{"reviews": [{"review": "IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE BUYING: If you are getting this game and expecting to hop online and get first place with no knowledge of kart racing. Then you would be wrong. First and formost this game is for kart racers or people interested in karting to experience the most immersive racing. And on the simulation side of the game you won't find anything like it. It is 100% best kart game I have played and most realistic. (coming from a kart racer myself) But right now there is little to no people playing on servers. So if you do expect to do races on servers make sure you have friends to race with. Because you won't find any just sitting around. \nSo yes I do recomend this game for kart racers or people that are that big of fans of karting. If not DONT GET IT! \n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505744781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 605, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198139801136", "num_games_owned": 36}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509682", "timestamp_updated": 1505631806, "recommendationid": "35016260", "timestamp_created": 1505631806}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 15, "review_score": 6, "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 20, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive"}, "success": 1}
