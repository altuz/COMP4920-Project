{"reviews": [{"review": "Red Comrades Save the Galaxy: Reloaded is a remaster of a classic RU point and click adventure, the very first big(ger) budget one, which was so influential it essentially borne a new sub-genre of typified \"Russian quests\" (\"quest\" being how \"adventure\" genre was known due to Sierra series) - wacky pop culture heavy parody adventure games. And yet, despite always having a soft spot for adventure titles, this was my first ever time playing it, simple due to how incredibly pop-culture reference and cheap comedy reliance, which is not something I ever liked.\n\nAs a glimpse on what late 90s post-soviet parody/humor could be, it's a great history piece. And it's also a surprisingly well put together, quite well animated and relatively well paced game in its own right - it doesn't feel \"cheap\", rather - intentionally ugly, but with a lot of polish and thought underneath. That said, given that a lot of its humor is based on racial, gender and historical stereotypes and typical jokes of late-/post-soviet times, you might not get it or find it funny. Personally, I wouldn't find it particularly funny even in the late 90s, but I'm still glad I went with this experience and finally played the game.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1503942134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 283, "num_reviews": 112, "steamid": "76561197989807190", "num_games_owned": 1511}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506437", "timestamp_updated": 1504027644, "recommendationid": "34562457", "timestamp_created": 1503955201}, {"review": "Great story line, funny dialogs, great artwork.
