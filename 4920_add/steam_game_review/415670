{"reviews": [{"review": "I love word games and this one does not disappoint. Think Boggle/Scramble/Book Worm game play with obstacles. The mechanics are flawless and easy to understand, you match tiles, create new words and some later levels even throw number matching. I think part of the fun was weaving letters through the characters to connect other letters across the board and create larger words. Some levels have time limits, some don't. The time limit levels are about making words fast regardless the length, while the non-timed ones gain more points through longer words. After so many levels the gameplay changes a bit to keep it interesting. \n\nI loved all the characters. Each one brings a new ability which cost turns. The story mode actually has a story! The character interactions are amusing. The graphics are top notch for a word game. I\u2019ll cut this review about here, since all I can do is continue praising this game. \n\nBought Highrise Heroes while on sale, but I assure you, it's worth every penny of $4.99. Love this game. It is far superior word game among the others I have played on Steam.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506919409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 329, "playtime_forever": 892, "num_reviews": 26, "steamid": "76561198142428668", "num_games_owned": 1118}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1504336659, "recommendationid": "34678345", "timestamp_created": 1504336659}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 39, "review_score": 7, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 41, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
