{"reviews": [{"review": "The game initially appeared fun and enjoyable. And at first, it was. The physics were crazy and gave it a fun edge of unpredictability. That said, the appeal wore off quickly. The only thing left after that was a frustrating example of a physics engine gone wrong that made it impossible to really enjoy the game because it would always take five tries for every level. Trying to play it quickly became a chore.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1504558920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 219, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198327386528", "num_games_owned": 6}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": true, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499956", "timestamp_updated": 1504573312, "recommendationid": "34747192", "timestamp_created": 1504573312}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 89, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 110, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
