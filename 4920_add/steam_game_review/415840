{"reviews": [{"review": "Please disregard the reviews saying that this game is not free. This game is definitely free. \n\nThere is an energy system where your actions cost energy and your energy can be refilled using in-system items, but there is no need for using any real money.  Your energy refills over time, at 2 mins per energy point, and each new level you achieve both refills and adds more total energy points.  You can even earn extra energy points by finding your items quickly.\n\nI spent 3.5 hrs and went from level 1 to level 12 in one sitting- no money used at all. The energy bar system just forces you to evaluate your actions strategically- for instance, I have enough energy to play at the cabin, but not at the library- even though I need loot dropped from the library I will play the cabin, because that will give me enough energy to gain another level and my total energy will be refilled. \n\nThis is a casual type game, but it's just right mix of thinking and not thinking to be fairly addictive. I didn't mean to spend 3.5 hrs playing, yet I did.  There are various tricks the game implements to keep the game slightly different, but still pretty easy.  There's a nighttime mode, a silhouette mode, and around the time you get comfortable enough with a location to identify where certain objects will be, the game adds more items to your list. Also, there are achievements to gain.  I already have half the achievements with just a few hours gameplay. Finishing the game completely should give you all the achievements without need for any extra replays.\n\nPlease note, this is not a game that you will play through in one sitting unless you want to use a little real money to help. You will need to leave the game periodically to allow your energy bar enough time to refill. However, it is still a fun, slightly challenging,  fairly addicting hidden object game that will keep you occupied for a while.  \n\nIt's free and doesn't use much space on your computer, so I definitely recommend at least trying it out to see whether you personally will like the game or not.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506527821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "playtime_forever": 1835, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198035698064", "num_games_owned": 3814}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_updated": 1486236895, "recommendationid": "29701266", "timestamp_created": 1486236895}, {"review": "I tried to avoid the ingame purchases but this game will not allow that its pay up or no play so I am going to uninstall soon\n\nStill liked all the game - it worked as it should had nice color and interesting characters but I need more am i just spoiled.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1485158810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 91, "num_reviews": 27, "steamid": "76561198032582216", "num_games_owned": 74}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1485158967, "recommendationid": "29438653", "timestamp_created": 1485158967}, {"review": "nice free to play hidden objects game.
