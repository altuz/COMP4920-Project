{"reviews": [{"review": "Possibly this is a satire of something I never played, or a lot of horror movies I never watched. \n\nOverall, the narrative was less than compelling, the game has a complete lack of characterization.  While I've noticed Japanese literature tends to characterize in terms of a persons relationships, but there is still actual information about the characters.   Not so in this game.  \"Best friend of 10 years\"  \"my parents will be....\" etc...\n\nAdditionally, the entire first 20 min or so are completely pointless.  Presumably the author was attempting to give the reader a sense of the every-day lives of our characters and grow our attachment to them, which would have been nice if there was some actual characterization and some tension to keep the pace up, but instead we get 20 min of \"we like to play games, a lot\"   A simple \"My friend and I were excited to finally be out of class so we could finally download this new game he heard about....\" or some other such conceit would have served the purpose far more meaningfully without a lot of superfolus minutia to click though.\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1501030121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 41, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198023781727", "num_games_owned": 88}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506651", "timestamp_updated": 1501030971, "recommendationid": "33798280", "timestamp_created": 1501030971}, {"review": "Due to the amount of reveiws on this game, i am going to provide my own opinion on this game, providing the upsides and downsides.\nUpsides:\n-It's $2\n-It was great and had me forming my own theories about the end as I was going\n-Good visuals. It's not professional, so I wouldn't expect them to be 100% pleasing to everyone, as it is $2\n-The story is a bit cliched and short, as it only took me three hours to get every ending, and there is the whole thing of \"oh no, people are dying from a game that appeared out of nowhere but no one believes it\"\n-The story is amazing if you like trying to figure out the ending before it happens, but if you don't do that, you are boring and you wont like this game.\n(I didn't listen to the music as I like listening to my own as i read)\nDownsides:\n-The story is rather cliche and is short\n-The visuals aren't amazing, but they are good\n-The translations aren't spot-on\n-It's only fun if you enjoy experimenting\n-It's a visual novel(but if you didn't notice that, use your eyes and look for a change)\n\nHoped that reveiw helped, as I've never written one before. arguing that this game is bad because of it's story is like arguing that naruto is hentai. It's not, but if you look too much at on thing(google images ing the example of naruto) it is. The story is a very small part of it, so focus on all the aspects of it, not just one.
