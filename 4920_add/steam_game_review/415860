{"reviews": [{"review": "So the game seems like it is tons of fun. I love the idea of it the fact we get stronger as we go is amazing. But I feel it still has a bit to go before it really is put out as a finished game. 1st you can not really get coins to get more people in less you kill stuff but most every thing is not only a lot stronger then you but shows up in big groups. That would not be as bad if you  could make better gear sooner because even with a blade and leather armor at 5 levels over them I still got wiped out. Your power shrine (towns main building) is a massive pain to get. I spent a long time dieing alot looking threw 5 desert to only find 3 tress in total worth 40 points and only got 2 resin. I found someone nice enough to give me some only to find out after putting it down it will kill it's self after not being fed something I have no idea how to get. I do love how you have the stuff set up so that 1 tree is not 1 item but when you see other a ton of 2 or 3 ones it is less about gather and wait (that is how the game feels tell to gather and wait.) and more watch then move. But from what I have seen (I could be wrong.) there is also no way to move anything after you put it down and you have no way to see how it will face. I see this game having a lot of potential but as of right now the game has a feel of about mid alpha maybe early beta. I would suggest scaleing the number on trees and stuff up a lot ways toget GC from just doing stuff you do anyway (Getting grass and stuff.) Making enamy groups smaller but puting out a lot more groups and mak it so our town hall (power shrine)  will not kill it's self if not fed and let us in away pack up our town. So lets say you have a few chests and stuff walls and so on and you want to move. You hit \"pack up\" on it and everything in your border gets picked up and put into a \"town box\" Now to balince this it can cost I would think about 1000GC but it would also wight about 1,500 pounds. Then really it would just be the placing stuff and picking/moving items you placed. For now I say play it if you have a few hours to kill and not much else but keep an eye on the game to be better.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1500792217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 543, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198085837541", "num_games_owned": 32}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498693", "timestamp_updated": 1485029615, "recommendationid": "29406301", "timestamp_created": 1485029615}, {"review": "Wonderful game, defintely not for the faint of heart gamer.
