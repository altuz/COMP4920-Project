{"reviews": [{"review": "I have hundreds of hours into this game. It plays extremely well -- it's some of the most fun competitive gaming I've ever had. But the game was launched incredibly rushed with very little content, and it's suffered big time because of it. The devs have promised frequent updates with free content, and now they have introduced microtransactions. They have just four characters in the game -- adding a fifth but asking for money for him despite their earlier promises.\n\nThe game has a very low player count and is extremely light on content. I played far more than I should have because of the promise that the game would be filled out in the future. The devs are now going back on that promise, and it's incredibly disappointing. I'd be more than happy to buy cosmetic items to support these devs, but the character being 25k J's (that's a lot) and the fact that anybody could have spent their J's at any time (I did, two days before the update) and the fact that long queue times means it will likely take a week or more to earn enough J's to get the new character (all other characters were free, go figure) means this game is no longer worth my time.\n\nAnd it's not worth yours, either. These devs have let me down with their bad communication, bad decision-making and complete and utter lack of content.
