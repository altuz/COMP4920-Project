The musical score is really well done. The game features wonderful dreamy tunes that would have been right at home coming from a SNES rpg circa 1994. Graphics are cutesy and fairly good for a 16-bit style game. Each character you discover features their own unique ability to help you out in different situations. The characters and plot are fairly basic. Help restore the Kingdom by gathering the magical stones back from an evil Ant kingdom.\n\nThe main things I dislike are the combat areas. They tend to be a bit of a sprawling mess. The lack of control you have over your NPC companions can be annoying at times. While in battle they tend to just run straight foward to attack, and take alot of damage in this way. Luckily you tend to come across plenty of chests that contain health vials and you're able to stock up on items wherever you come across the helpful Flea brother merchants.\n\nAll in all I'd recommend this game if you're looking for a touch of old SNES era action rpg fun.

[i]That's what makes it good.[/i]\n\nCrystal Picnic is a very short (yeah, short-short) game, styled to be like 16-bit games. I'm tired of looking at games that claim to be \"8-bit\" or \"16-bit\" and turn out not to be. That's why I was hesitant to buy this game. However, Crystal Picnic is different.\n\nThe graphics (while the color pallete might be off a [b]bit[/b]) do, for the most part, represent 16-bit perfectly. The controls really feel like I'm playing it on a Sega or something, and the music is probably the best. It just [i]feels[/i] like I'm on a Sega.\n\nThe game is cute, so are all of the characters, and their world is just built so perfectly, everything is so humble. The soundtrack is good too. It's a very lighthearted game with fairly nice combat. The combat is my favorite part. You adventure around like classice RPGs in a tile-based (I assume) world, but upon entering combat, you're suddenly tossed into a platformer-like game, which I loved.\n\nMy only problem was the lack of direction at the beginning of the game. I had the hardest time figuring out where to go, and that you could actually walk over that dark grass that previous RPGs taught you that you can't. Another thing this game needs is a MAP. It has a world map, but nothing for the specific area you're in. You can't pull up a map while you're lost and go \"Alright, I'm here.\" That was my only main problem because the last two areas in the game REALLY need a map.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nI only have one heart-breaking problem... On the world map, there are areas that are very detailed and look as if you could go to them somehow. You can't. It breaks my heart because as a child I would always dream about being able to go to places you're not supposed to in games. I would dare myself to go beyond, to believe, to dream that one day I'd find some secret in the game that would actually take me to these hidden places. But you just can't. It's not physically programmed into the game. I'm not asking the developer to add these areas, but I was just wondering why they decided to detail the map so greatly in certain areas you can't go to, but then make it so plain in others...", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1450228232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 325, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561198043969235", "num_games_owned": 178}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503410", "timestamp_updated": 1454215687, "recommendationid": "20864249", "timestamp_created": 1454215687}, {"review": "a pretty good rpg 100% worth 3$ \nbut at the same time this bring up the old shxxxy time when i play old rpg game\nand forget to save (cry)\n\nbuy it and try it out if you are still think \ncharacter are cute <3", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1446626609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 27, "num_reviews": 68, "steamid": "76561198173892127", "num_games_owned": 754}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495294", "timestamp_updated": 1446625831, "recommendationid": "18870750", "timestamp_created": 1446625831}, {"review": "Well I'm not sure what to say about this game.\n\nLet's start with the bad:\n\nFirst of all, the combat was not great, I wound up playing most of the game as the Bisou the bunny cause she's ranged and OP as fuck.\n\nSecondly, you can pretty much avoid almost every fight if you can (there are some encounters that still happen when the character trips on a banana peel, i give points for this) since there is no EXP to gain and you only get money from enemies, no items or anything\n\nThirdly, was there armour in the game and i just missed it all?
