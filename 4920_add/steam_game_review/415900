{"reviews": [{"review": "Bugspeed Collider is an amazing game where you play as a really powerful beetle and beat the tar out of other, equally powerful beetles. It's great for either single player or local multiplayer, as the single player campaign is challenging and will improve your skills, while the multiplayer pits you against your friends. The single player campaign is also a co-op campaign, and you can challenge the levels and bosses with your friends. Plus, you can play the game upside-down if you want. All in all, a great deal for only $5.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1491609196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 383, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198039923756", "num_games_owned": 119}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505766", "timestamp_updated": 1476029523, "recommendationid": "25950513", "timestamp_created": 1476029523}, {"review": "This game is great for those who are a fan of the smash brothers franchise, and it's best to use a controller with it if you can.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1503708049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 260, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198047765736", "num_games_owned": 122}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491830", "timestamp_updated": 1479930614, "recommendationid": "26834319", "timestamp_created": 1479930614}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
