A new twist to the classic chess game but overall I would not recommend buying this game unless you get it on sale.\n\nThe game itself is pretty fun and challenging at the same time but the way the pieces are made is a huge problem for me in this game. Althogh the pieces are shown what moves are available, the issue for me lies between the controls (xbox controller) and the design of the pieces. It would be a more enjoyable experience for me if I had the ability to tell my pieces apart as well as a toggle to keep the enemies next move on the screen. If these two issues are fixed in future updates I will change my review to a recommend after I play a few games.\n\n\nedit: after noticing the updates that took place only after a few hours after my initial review, i would highly recommend this game. Still a few things that could be updated as far as the interface goes and the controls could be a bit better but overall I know the developer is solo working hard to improve this game and make it more enjoyable than it already is. Please leave feedback on any issues you encounter and if your luck is as good as mine the dev will make your experience a much better one than before! I will be looking for more projects by this team.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1504588289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 184, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198291461436", "num_games_owned": 84}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "3", "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500279", "timestamp_updated": 1504588191, "recommendationid": "34729915", "timestamp_created": 1504512489}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 28, "review_score": 7, "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 31, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
