{"reviews": [{"review": "It's hard to find a game that scratches the same itch that Final Fantasy Tactics gave me so long ago, but this comes pretty close. The game is definitely remiscent of it, with spending skill points to learn active and passive skills, having a primary & secondary class to mix and match your skills, desperately trying to manuever just right so your healer doesn't get mauled down by that jerk void-monster-thing over there and the boss fights are all pretty fun. The music is surprisingly solid throughout and few tunes even stick in your head afterwards.\n\nThe only real bug I encountered I made a post about and had a response within a day or two from the dev (even though it was a pretty minor bug in the sceme of things). The game has an interesting inclusion of using shovels, picks, and other tools to interact with things on the map, sometimes obviously and sometimes secretly. The only real negative I have is that inventory management is kind of annoying, but I say that as someone who hates inventory management in literally every game that has it (Diablo, Fallout, etc.) so grain of salt there.\n\nIf you are out for a tactical RPG, this is a great one to give a shot. It might not look flashy but there's a lot of depth to uncover here.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1490462977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1390, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561197961230622", "num_games_owned": 745}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503205", "timestamp_updated": 1505029257, "recommendationid": "34855603", "timestamp_created": 1505029257}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 69, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 71, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
