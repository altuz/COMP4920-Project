{"reviews": [{"review": "This game reminded me of what was probably my first handheld video game\u2026 Merlin in 1978, and brings back a lot of happy memories. Yeah, video games have come a long way, but only recently have we begun to see a variety of fresh new expansions beyond the traditional shooter and racing genres. Sometimes You is already becoming well known for bringing out games with a novel approach to gaming, such as Retention and Energy Balance. Where those focused on photography and Math, Energy Cycle focuses on the Math of patterns and arrays\u2026 color synchronization.\n\nEnergy Cycle consists of patterns of lights that when pressed, toggle on or off adjacent lights. It\u2019s a definite mind-bender, and the ambient electronic themes add to the \u201cmind music\u201d effect. When I first saw the trailer it reminded me of my old Merlin. But, where Merlin only had a limited field of about 9 lights to work with, Energy Cycle expands on the idea by presenting a variety of arrays and multiple colors. Each puzzle becomes increasingly complex, forcing you to use a part of your brain that doesn\u2019t really get a lot of gaming time. Forgive me for lapsing into the old \u201cright-brain/left-brain\u201d ideas, but yeah it\u2019s difficult to analyze a visual pattern that uses no words (like with the 1st game Retention.) If you love puzzle and thinking games, then you will definitely want to give this a try.\n\nThe Deluxe Collector\u2019s Edition includes wallpapers, a \"process\" art book and a photo album of art that features nostalgic moments... especially of cats. It also includes the soundtrack with a mix of high energy, at times melancholic techno-funk sound effects. These were interesting to me because I enjoy getting some background on what goes into a game. It adds something a little extra to see how the creative process took off. And, that\u2019s what makes Steam a great platform for gamers, because no matter how many gaming magazines you read, you can\u2019t get all that in a magazine. \n\nThere is a level editor as well, where you can make your own patterns, and you are given a level code. But, I haven\u2019t gotten far enough yet to figure out whether or how you share that code with friends to play each other\u2019s designs. I will explore that more when I solve level 10, which I got stuck on. \n\nI grabbed a couple of extra copies, which I will be giving away over on Steam Gifts just as soon as they add the game to their giveaways list. The giveaways will show up on this link, probably in the next day or so... http://www.steamgifts.com/user/EdenStarGazer", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1501362006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1866, "num_reviews": 65, "steamid": "76561198154425859", "num_games_owned": 1020}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 7, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544133", "timestamp_updated": 1452725751, "recommendationid": "20513338", "timestamp_created": 1452725521}, {"review": "Uninspired and boring.
