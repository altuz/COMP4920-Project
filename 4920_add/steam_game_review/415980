{"reviews": [{"review": "EDIT: Alright so I have beaten the game in just over 4 hours and have played after the update that fixed many of the problems I have had with the game. Those problems include leaving the level after collecting 1 wisp and the spaced out checkpoints later on in the game. The only problems that remain are the music and the camera. Now the music is not bad, it\u2019s actually very good, but there is only one track the plays in the levels as I have noticed. It gets annoying after a while. Also the fixed camera can get in the way in a few levels, but isn\u2019t as bad as it first seemed. Despite the problems I still feel this is a solid game. Most of what I said in the first impression still applies. Overall I have to say the game is worth a purchase especially with many of the initial problems being cleaned up rather nicely. It shows the developer is keeping a close eye on the game, which is important.    \n\nFIRST IMPRESSION:\n\nFrom what I have played thus far, I have to say this is a charming puzzle platformer with neat puzzles and visuals on top of some great music. The game is a simple 3D platforming game with a unique twist which is that you can shift between multiple worlds to help progress in any given level. The concept is simple but it sets up for some really cool puzzles. The controls at first were a bit strange and the fact that you couldn\u2019t control the camera was annoying, but in all honesty it wasn\u2019t that bad once I got used to it. And even if you mess up for whatever reason, the game is very forgiving in that it usually spawns you pretty close to where you died last. Also there are no lives, so you can die as much as you want.\n\nThe other aspect to the game is the aesthetics. While it\u2019s not the absolute prettiest game I have ever seen, it is still visually appealing. The game does a great job with the colors, making them vibrant but not painful to look at. The music is great. So far it has all been piano pieces that fit the games atmosphere perfectly, being calm and serene. \n\nMy only problem with the game thus far is the fact that when you collect a wisp which is essential for moving on in the game, you exit the level immediately. The problem with this is that there is usually more than 1 wisp per level, meaning you have to go through a portion of the level again to get the other wisp. It\u2019s pretty annoying, but the levels are not too long, so it is not a deal breaker. Also most extra wisps are not at the end of the level so you don\u2019t necessarily have to go through an entire level twice to get them. \n\nOverall this is a great little game that is definitely worth the price tag. From what I can tell by the progress I made in an hour, the game should last around 5 hours. I could be wrong with this, but that is my estimate based on the progress thus far. Its aesthetically pleasing and most importantly a fun puzzle platformer", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1448669326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 258, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198032588587", "num_games_owned": 1007}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517789", "timestamp_updated": 1448086178, "recommendationid": "19105823", "timestamp_created": 1447634361}, {"review": "Great concept.

It's casual platforming/puzzle-solving with callming piano music in the background. My only complaint is that some of the jumps seem legitimately impossible. Fortunatley these jumps are for extras that aren't required for beating the level, but being a bit of a completionist this is pretty annoying. Maybe there is a power-up later in the game that allows me to traverse the gap, but I only end up a few inches short of the required distance I need to jump.
