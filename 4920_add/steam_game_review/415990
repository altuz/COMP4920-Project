{"reviews": [{"review": "Short version:\n4/5. If you're a puzzle collector, get this. The simple interface and simple concept but challenging puzzles make for a nice, approachable game.\n\nLong version:\nLightbender is a good way to spend 10 minutes or 2 hours, solving incredibly mind-bending puzzles. Such a simple concept, just mirror, reverse, break or combine light; and yet it is very challenging. Sometimes you'll solve the puzzles by accident when you're trying out something new, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It'll teach you to think. There are also user-created maps, as well as a whole plethora of maps on the developers' part, so you won't be speedrunning this game. \n\nThe critical things that I would have to say would be that the music could be a bit better-ish. It's not bad but it can start to irritate you after repeating over a same puzzle for a long time. Fortunately, as always, you can turn it off in the options if you don't like it. Other than that, I can't really think of many bad things to say. If the game continues to be what it has been so far, it should be a nice, small little puzzle-game. To be honest, it might not be one of the most memorable ones because it doesn't seem to have a plot of any kind, but it's overall very tidy and nice game.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1473317985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 138, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198012696724", "num_games_owned": 145}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505544", "timestamp_updated": 1455735857, "recommendationid": "21280283", "timestamp_created": 1455735857}, {"review": "Solid puzzle game mechanics. \n\nA large amount of puzzles to solve, 240 not couting the tutorial or user submitted puzzles. \n\nThe ability to create and share your own puzzles. \n\nThe Devs for the game are extremely responsive to issues and game play suggestions. \n\nIf you are looking to be an active part of a games developement, you aren't going to beat it for $3 bucks.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1450862029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 285, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198027561993", "num_games_owned": 411}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501188", "timestamp_updated": 1450778213, "recommendationid": "19839878", "timestamp_created": 1450777465}, {"review": "Ive spent to much time on this.

Not sure if it's only me, but there's no mouse control. Moving your mouse does around the menus does absolutely nothing, but for some reason left mouse buttons works as a confirm button. Really infuriating, especially because of point 1.\n3. No audio controls at all. Have to go into the windows audio mixer to mute or lower the volume of the game.\n\nThis is my first impression after 5 minutes of playing. As someone who regularly work with unreal engine, I know that mouse controls are not difficult to implement. Get on it.\nI am a sucker for mirrors and lazer though, and the game itself seems to have a decent amount of levels in it, even user levels.
