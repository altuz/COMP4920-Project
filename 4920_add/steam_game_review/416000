I have confidence it will bring a lot to the genre. Has a unique sprite style, nice colors, and easy-going music. It has a long way to go in development, but is already enjoyable and has a lot of promise. Developer is incredibly active and responsive to feedback.

First and foremost, this is an absolute gem of a game that already has many, many hours of content to be enjoyed. Secondly, the developer is doing a phenomenal job bringing this game to fruition. He is extremely responsive (I suspect he doesn't sleep), and he is working tirelessly to finish the game. I bought this game looking for a Stardew Valley follow-up, but I keep playing because Orange Season is charming, engaging and simply fun to play. Buy this now, support the dev, and contribute to the path the game takes.
