There is nothing wrong with weapons nor with the controls, they are diferent, take time to ajust, but they are fine for what it is, a mech game.\n\nHowver, even with recomende specs the game was a nightmare to make it run, and ir ran \"fine\" until it lag spikes horribly.\nLag is also another problem, the game doesnt take high lantacy well and i was getting about 300ms on oficial dedicated, wheres in other games with dedicated server i usulay get around 80.

On top of that the developer is focusing their resources on the HEADS UP DISPLAY INSTEAD OF FIXING THE GAMES FUNCTIONALITY! :poop: like this is why the mech genre is dead. On top of that despite having hardware that can run this game THE GAME STILL LAGS! Its unoptimized as all hell and in my case only the light flamethrower worked!
