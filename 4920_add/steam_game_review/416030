But after an hour of playing I realized that the problem wasn't the controls, it was the pace of the game. Since the whole point of the game is to build a village untill your ready to conquer a dungeon, you spend most your time building and gathering resources. But it takes forever to do that, and it shouldn't. I thought after I got workers to collect wood and stone for me, it would be less time consuming to collect enough resources needed to build houses for my village. Wich is true, but it still takes about a minute to put down a damn fence or remove a field, Wich is a problem because when your building or removing something, you can't move. Basically what I'm saying is most the time your staring at your screen as your removing something or building something, and being someone who is used to fast paced gameplay, I find this extremely boring.

It delivers what it promises... a casual, 2D Strategy/RPG.\n\nYou gather resources, fight, build, craft... the movement IS slow, but its pretty much in line with similar 2D games. The crafting and harvesting time is slow, but only at first. As you progress and are able to build better and better tools, things change.\n\nI think that may be the root of the negative reviews... people who are used to instant gratification or a pay2win store where they can just purchase the top level gear and bypass having to work your way up in a game\n\nThis game is fun. But make no mistake, it is a casual game (perfect for watching videos or having a drink or BOTH). \n\nWhat really struck me about this game, is the genuine feeling of accomplishment I got when I was finally able to build a new building, or craft a new item. But what really stuck with me was the feeling I got when I finally had a little village going which was basically self sufficient. They were gathering enough resources on their own to support themselves without me needing to add in additional food. It felt good.\n\nOn the developer side: wow!\n\nQuick replies and fixes when bugs are reported. I reported a bug and within an hour I had a reply from the developer, and a fix was applied shortly after.\n\n\nIf youre looking for a fun distraction or a really enjoyable time waste (you wont feel like the time was wasted), this game is well worth the $4.99.

Overall this is a very fun game and a very nice developer to support.\n\nSeveral months later and now I am very angry with the developer. He doesn't listen to the community anymore; he has ceased pretty much all development on the game and the game has tons of bugs. The game runs on XNA which is no longer even existant because it sucked so bad so really my computer meets the requirements but the game launches with a pink screen on my newer computer and I can't get passed it and I am having to use a 10 year old computer that can run the game and my game that I saved is just gone because everytime I try to load it, it just crashes the game so I lost about 36 hours invested into this stupid game. If the developer adds anything more, it probably is just going to be bugs and he doesn't even have people test the game anymore before he releases big updates that may screw up your saved games like it did in my case and make the game unplayable on HUNDREDS of computers.
