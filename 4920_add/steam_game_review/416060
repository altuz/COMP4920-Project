You need to click (repeatedly) on an enemy to shoot them but the mouse pointer is so small and basically the same color as the world so I kept losing it when things got hot. Even at 1920x1080 I was having trouble spotting the items in the world you could pick up (which you need to do to survive and complete quests).\n\nI felt the stamina system was a waste and just meant I had to waste time waiting for a bar to refill while I'm trying to explore a map. I guess it's meant to stop you from kiting or something. I dunno.\n\nThe stealth mechanic works excellent, so I spent most of my time walking to take full advantage of it, only running when I needed to escape or cover uncontested ground.\n\nI've only tried pistols and assault rifles so far and enjoyed them both. I think the rocket barrage skill or whatever that the cyborg starts with is messed up. The rockets travel at like walking speed. So, by the time you realize you're jammed up, launched them, and they've travel whatever distance you put between you and the enemies (which should be healthy to avoid rocket damage) I've lost more health than if I had just popped any other skill and mowed them down.\n\nI haven't played enough to tell if putting points into skill cooldown reduction makes a good dent because the skill cooldowns are loooong.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I got it and I might come back.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1502758121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 72, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561197982316641", "num_games_owned": 195}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513373", "timestamp_updated": 1502758889, "recommendationid": "34246655", "timestamp_created": 1502758889}, {"review": "I don't typically review my titles, but I noticed in the comments section this game is getting a lot of criticism that I feel is misleading. In the negative reviews, it keeps coming back to two features:\n\n1) The movement system is bad\n2) The game (or some aspect of it) is too hard\n\nSo here's the thing, the movement system isn't BAD, it's just different... very different to a point where it feels weird when you first start playing. That is not inherently a flaw though... I'd say I found League of Legends use of right clicking more unintuitive, and certainly harder to adjust to. Really, it's pretty simple, you just need to het the hang of it... Mouse scroll up to run and down to walk, click to move-to, holded shift to stop or alt to crouch to switch your mouse clicks to aim and fire rather than move-to. That's really all there is to it, for all reviewers keep ranting about how awful it is. I think I basically adjusted after 20 minutes. No, there is no cover mechanic, the idea is you walk to approach in stealth if that's your plan, or just run around a corner and get firing if not. You can abandon a fight and run back around a corner (or down a hall!) if you want to stick and move (it is useful for healing, admittedly, but usually the idea is whether because you dash in suddenly guns blazing or tiptoe in unheard, your statedy is close distance and mow the bad guys down.\n\nAs for difficulty, the game actually isn't hard per say, rather it just doesn't hold your hand. The tutorial is brusqe (because who likes long tutorials?) and from there, the game expects you to really use the info it gave you, pay attention to your UI, and figure out the details of what information you have and what you're able to do via observation and expeirmentation. The closest I'll come to saying it's \"hard\" is that these are skills an experienced gamer is much more likely to have... but it's like knowing enough to look at the deeper menus of a game like Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea with the comprehension that if the devs put it there, there's information worth knowing. If you use all the info and tools the game gives you, it's really not hard at all.\n\nA good example is \"There's so many enemies, not enough ammo\". Initially I had this same problem, but realized it's because I was missing most of the item drops because they're very hard to see in the game... that said, you don't NEED to see them, your map displays all of their localation of every item in the zone you haven't gotten yet... just follow it around to collect them all, and you should have plenty of ammo... but you can sneak past foes or do melee takedowns on lone targes it will help too.\nAll in all, the game is differnet, interesting, and pretty fun, you just need to learn to play.

It reminds me a bit of the old Syndicate game set in a CyberPunk type, corporations rule the world way.  The English is a little rough.  That is to say, it's about 99% understandable, but also fairly obvious that it was translated by a non-speaker.  The game is pretty unforgiving when it comes to combat, even on Easy difficulty.  As far as I can find, there's no pause or anything when fighting.  And if you get tag teamed by 2 or 3 guys, you're probably going to die, at least at the start (this is not a negative in my opinion -- that's they way it should be).\n\nA few things I don't like so far:\n1.  You can quick save, but you can't get to a main menu screen unless you quit out of the game.  That's pretty bad.\n2.  There's no tutorial at all.  There are a few helpful boxes that pop up, but they're not all that great.  Spend some time looking at the controls before you start playing.\n3.
