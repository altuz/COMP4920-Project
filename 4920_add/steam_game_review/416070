{"reviews": [{"review": "Nice premise, just needs a bit of work to worthwhile. Random deaths or fatal accidents is one thing, but my ship crashed three times in a row on take off, that is just North Korean level incompetence. I can imagine this being a lot of fun. Add some things for the player to do, like the tasks should be more involved rather than a damn progress bar and 50/50 chance of them failing or not. Shooting asteroids is just amazingly boring, no editable controls. And the mini-games REDIFINE repetitive, inane, mind-numbing boring. With that being said, I really think this could be an awesome retro game, BTW I do love the green color, that part at least was pretty cool. Please do some work on this and upgrade. If you have plans to do this, please disregard my remarks and I eagerly await its completion....", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1504902723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 72, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561197970516721", "num_games_owned": 408}, "language": "english", "developer_response": "Hello -=Jester=-,\n\nLaunch failures are an optional simulation which can be turned off from the Options menu. \n\nThey are turned on by default, which can earn you two achievements.
