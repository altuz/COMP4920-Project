{"reviews": [{"review": "This is a great original idea that's very well executed.  I originally played this in a blind race and bought the game immediately.  The advanced mechanics are introduced at a near perfect pace throughout the game to make the experience enjoyable throughout.\n\nThe movement mechanics are what makes the game stand out.  You don't actually move your character, you just push a direction and your character moves all the way across the screen until hitting a wall.  This makes for unique level design with the innovative movement in the game.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1489858053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 153, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561197984883519", "num_games_owned": 369}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "timestamp_updated": 1504734665, "recommendationid": "34783820", "timestamp_created": 1504734665}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 34, "review_score": 7, "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 37, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
