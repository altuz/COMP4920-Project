{"reviews": [{"review": "This game is dope. As someone who's relatively new to playing computer/video games, the clarity and straightforwardness of InterSection's setup is great since it doesn't pose as particularly overwhelming to a novice player. With simple controls, clear instructions and a minimalistic aesthetic appeal, InterSection proves to be both an enjoyable and exciting game. However, its simplicity does not interfere with its ability to provide a refreshing challenge and encourage the player to really think (I definitely had to)! The visuals are wonderful and the color scheme is lovely. Basically, InterSection rules and everyone should buy it.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1468370090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 53, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198318004379", "num_games_owned": 1}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510172", "timestamp_updated": 1468522738, "recommendationid": "24320061", "timestamp_created": 1468522738}, {"review": "I watched this game's devlog since relatively early development on TIGSource.

The core mechanic is inspired and interesting, but as is so common in the indie puzzle scene, it seems to need a bit more. \n\nThe opening puzzles are fun and quickly introduce what I have dubbed the double platforming mechanic. The slow introduction of other elements kept the game fresh and engaging in my short play through.\n\nHowever, around level 25 the execution difficulty spikes. The camera becomes difficult to use and the controls (changing based on your perspective) become frustratingly easy to mess up. I overcame the level but once again hit the same problems only two levels later. Imporovements to camera control ( I have no idea how) or setting the controls so that they do not shift with perspective might fix this. \n\nIt's a shame as the game is interesting, but not enough for me to warrant putting up with this frustration. A more patient player (or one with better platforming skills) will likely get more enjoyment out of what is a quirky little game, but that is not my story. \n\nStill, I will not be looking for a refund and I look forward to seeing what this developer comes out with next. So I'm recommending this, but leaving my thoughts. Buy this game if you want to see something interesting, but stay away if you're looking for a casual platformer.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1477759707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198102886645", "num_games_owned": 250}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494152", "timestamp_updated": 1477760136, "recommendationid": "26295769", "timestamp_created": 1477760136}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
