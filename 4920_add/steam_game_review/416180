Choosing your primary and secondary weapons works well with fast weapon menus once you get the hang of it.\n\nThings to improve:\nMolotov feels too overpowered. When you are fighting in tight spaces all the guns can do nothing against one molotov. The end screen should be something more than just the points, something to tell more clearly who was the winner and why. Also chat should be visible in the end screen.

Anything that brings that loungeroom fun back, and does it with online multiplayer gets my vote instantly. Ultimately, my best comparison from my childhood would have to be Liero, that real-time worms game that ran on DOS. Easily played at school because it would fit on a single floppy disk. I can't believe I just typed that, I haven't mentioned floppies in so, so long.\n\nGun Bombers is actually faster paced than I realised; my first game, I ran into the other player with a pistol and clicked my mouse to fire; shoot..... shoot... .. shoot, shoot shoot. The realisation that it plays more like Soldat or Crimsonland than .. Something much slower, was surprising to me, I don't know why. I guess I looked at it and expected bomberman, a game of timing and strategy, when in fact it's an action game. I only mention this in case some of you haven't realised this, as I hadn't.\n\nIn a nutshell, you have multiple rounds where you have to divide your time between trying to kill the other players and mining for minerals to gain currency to be spent buying weapons before the next round. Surprisingly similar to Counter-Strike if it also had random piles of cash around the map which you could go for prior to planting the bomb.\n\nHonestly, there's not too much I can say about the game. It plays great and feels very solid. I guess there are a few things about it that I'd like to see improved:\n\n\u2022 The UI is based on its spiritual precursor, a SNES(?) game, so there's of room for improvement there. Weapon selection included.\n\n\u2022 The digging mechanic; having to aim in the direction you want to dig was annoying at first, but became second nature after a few matches. I still find myself accidently digging while running toward or away from someone, would be nice to have to confirm an intent to dig, a key or something.\n\n\u2022 Mines and claymores are not visible to enemies and can be placed without any real warning to other players. They slow the pace of the game due to their lethality. My friends and I always have these disabled.\n\n\u2022 Zoom. I love the zoom feature, but feel I am disadvantaged when using it, so it is rather redundant. If larger maps were ever going to be a thing, I'd like to see everyone forced to the same zoom level, not necessarily being able to view the entire map at once.\n\nTo be completed.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1504319170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 411, "num_reviews": 66, "steamid": "76561198004125261", "num_games_owned": 754}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504376", "timestamp_updated": 1462629368, "recommendationid": "22545446", "timestamp_created": 1461221522}, {"review": "Remember Mine bombers? remember how much fun it was? Ever wonder why nobody has ever made a game like it in over a decade against all odds? Well now that long wait is finally over.\n\nGun bombers is a unique combination of bomber man, minecraft and some kind of top down shootery thing. You mine out rocks and sand, find gems, explore them map, conspire to kill your enemies with bombs, mines, guns etc and between rounds you use all the money you aquired to buy all manner of weird weapons including room filling polyethalene barrels to cricket bombs (that home towards enemies in line of sight and explode with every jump).\n\nNo two matches are the same and its very satisfying to get a guy right in the path of your rocket turret. Despite being complete, it is still having things added to it (as of this review)(, hello people of the distant future, did we win world war three or are we all speaking martian now?)). There are also all kinds of fun bonuses across the map like maps, incremental upgrades to your pick and weird stuff like scuba gear.\n\nIf you or any of your friends enjoyed Mine Bombers in the past, and would love to see a modern revitilisation, this game will probably fit the bill.\n\nCharge the elevator!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1489887854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1767, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561197979993116", "num_games_owned": 352}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507163", "timestamp_updated": 1453262120, "recommendationid": "20635994", "timestamp_created": 1453262120}, {"review": "Great game that takes me back to the old days of Bomberman.\n\nAlthough I never played Mine Bombers, this is a game I can really get into quickly.

I can think of a few things that contribute to this feeling:\n- Many pitiful weapons.  Some of the weapons and buffs do add some player agency, but it takes a while to get them.  Some are so buggy that I feel robbed when I finally do invest in them (EX: claymore).\n- The player character is very slow moving, so it takes forever to traverse a relatively small map.\n- His pickaxe is painfully slow, so it just feels like a dumb slog during the initial phase, especially considering the player's movement speed.\n\nFew Players\n------------\n\nEvery game mode felt insanely empty or just plain impossible with only a two or three players.
