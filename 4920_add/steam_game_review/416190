{"reviews": [{"review": "Vehicle Simulator is a great game that allows you to fly and drive a wide range of vehicles, including submarines, sailboats, aircraft, helicopters, cars, and RC quadcopters. The amount of DLC available for free on the internet for this game is vast, allowing for a wide range of scenarios on land, sea, or air.  \n  \nWhat I like:  \n-Realistic sailboat controls, which I haven't seen in any other game. \n-Highly unique vehicles available like flying boats and spacecraft all in a single game. \n-Everything is customizable, and you can even design your own vehicles if you have the skill.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n-Although very difficult to get started with flying, once you get the hang of it, it's very fun.\n-The graphics leave much to be desired.\n-Many add-ons are from 3rd party sites, making me think twice about downloading a vehicle (although I haven't seen any malware yet.)\n\nThis game is for vehicle enthusiasts who enjoy taking leisurely adventures, or designers who want to drive their creations with total control of the stats. I was tired of seeing high priced simulators with expensive DLC, so having a game with unlimited options and a one-time price was very appealing.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505338653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 642, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198027567695", "num_games_owned": 47}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1504636154, "recommendationid": "34762053", "timestamp_created": 1504636154}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 20, "review_score": 6, "total_negative": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 28, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive"}, "success": 1}
