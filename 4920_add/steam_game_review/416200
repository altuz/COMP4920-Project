Whereas the art deco environments of Bioshock were tinged with the madness and blood of Splicers, Door to Door opts for a slower, more subtle pace, which befits its walking simulator esque gameplay. If you have never played a walking simulator I would caution that this game's pace is much more about ambiance and unsettling quiet than high-paced action, with very limited player interaction beyond simply run / walk / and interact. I am a big fan of Noir / Neon / Detective type settings and I think thie game presents an unsettling, empty, surreal art deco environment well. It reminds me of a minimalist sidestory of a detective somewhere between the Metropolis, Brazil, Bioshock and Blade Runner universes.\n\nI'm uncertain what's going on in the story thus far as I've played very little and only some of the case \"Reverse Vasectomy\" but with its cool environmental design and creepy, sudden, unsettling effects [spoiler]the moment that convinced me I am going to enjoy the game is after passing through the Tulip lounge area, as I was idly browsing an eerily-quiet display shop of robots displayed behind glass, after pushing the \"interact\" button on one of them, it suddenly retracted its display case and the entire back wall of the display came cascading down, revealing a large, hidden room behind with a larger door on the other side of the room, approaching the larger door I noticed a bunch of security panels / televisions with static on them near the entryway to the door, with a very surreal effect following once you reach the static door...[/spoiler] the way the game makes you feel as though you're \"not where you should be\" and that you're encroaching into areas you're not supposed to is pretty immersive and a good depiction of a detective/spy slinking around. I hope moments like this are not limited to this particular case, but with there seeming to be several to pick from I think I will enjoy the game if it creates tension as well in other areas as in this particular scene.  \n\nAlthough there is some voiceacting in sections of the game it seems overdone and that the translation to English may have been poor for what NPCs (robots) were attempting to convey. It's a bit hard to hear audio tapes you pickup, and most of the dialog seems a bit rambly. The main character's voice actor is thankfully sparingly used after his first intro dialog, with his \"gruff detective voice actor\" I found to be incredibly overdone/ham-fisted. That blemish on the sound design aside otherwise it is very well done, with ambient effects of steam, whirring fans, transports being used, etc it does a good job of immediately immersing you into the surrounding areas, with a fitting synthy soundscape, and a plethora of strange effects. I'm glad the voice-acting seems sparsely used as it doesn't match the quality of the sound design otherwise. \n\nIt's a nice looking game and holds its own when compared to other titles, most notably Bioshock, although Bioshock had a much higher budget so its textures and overall level complexity is a bit higher, but to compare the two games too much is to discredit this game's standout, unique depiction of a detective story just happening to take place in an art deco / sci fi type setting. What resources the game has to utilize graphically is well designed with level areas flowing into one another in a similar fashion to Deus Ex city segments or the Bioshock games and well-made poster and neon sign designs throughout the environments.  \n\nOne major gripe I have with this game and walking simulators at large is that there is no traditional save option here, at all. You're expected to complete the each case in one sitting, which I don't find myself doing too often. This can kind of kill your incentive to pick up a case if you had to leave and had no option of saving. I'm not even sure if the game has an auto save at all, so it may just be expected that the player is to sift through areas they already had if they happen to turn the game off before completing the case. This has lead to me not recommending other walking simulators in the past, but the fact that I find the overall setting of this one so enjoyable I will be attempting to go through it regardless of this limiting feature. \n\nIf you're not a fan of noir/detective stuff and had your fill of Art Deco via Bioshock, or if you have never played and are weary of giving a VERY limited gameplay style (walking simulator) a try, I would caution against picking this up, however if you are a fan of detective / noir / scifi and particularly the art deco vibe of smokey, loungey, futurustic type areas and are looking for an interesting, low-key, immersive first person experience Door To Door provides just that.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1499571177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 63, "num_reviews": 148, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "num_games_owned": 800}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1499213954, "recommendationid": "33254045", "timestamp_created": 1499213590}, {"review": "Horrid clusterfuck of bad design styles topped by the worst use of typography ever seen.\nUser interface is a myth.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1493981304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7, "num_reviews": 78, "steamid": "76561198044218149", "num_games_owned": 162}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499607", "timestamp_updated": 1496070591, "recommendationid": "32043379", "timestamp_created": 1496070591}, {"review": "the ui is not fun to use at all", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1484004501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198006714488", "num_games_owned": 342}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498411", "timestamp_updated": 1496892121, "recommendationid": "32260374", "timestamp_created": 1496892121}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 9, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
