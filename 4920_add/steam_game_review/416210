I don't think it's worth it unless the game is on sale. That being said, here's my review of the game:\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nBlock'hood is a beautiful city building game that combines the art style of Monument Valley with the upward building idea of Tiny Towers. Its main mechanics are micromangement and resource awareness, as each block requires different inputs and produces different outputs. A balance must be struck so that certain resources aren't eaten up too quickly and others don't pile up and cause negative effects (note, I wouldn't necessarily call them [i]good[/i] and [i]bad[/i] resources, as even resources with negative downsides can be used positively). It is very open in build choices, meaning you can create a full industrial complex, a single cabin in a massive forest, or a harmony of man and nature. The story mode focuses on this balance\n\n[h1]Story Mode[/h1]\nThe story mode is a few chapters long and tells the story of the main character finding the right equilibrium between machines and animals. The story itself is quite nice, but more importantly it teaches some basic mechanics of the game, ramping up to showing the inner workings of more advanced blocks near the end. I highly suggest playing the story mode after the tutorial. I would definitely like to see more stories available, hopefully this is something the devs are working on\n\n[h1]Challenges[/h1]\nThese are, as the name implies, short levels where you try to reach a certain goal, such as producing a certain amount of resource without producing too much of a negative one. Difficulties go from extremely easy to nearly impossible, challenges are a nice follow-up to the story mode but I'm not a huge fan of them. They make it feel like a cheap mobile game and I would much rather see more story options\n\n[h1]Sandbox[/h1]\nThis is where the game shines the most, in my opinion. Here you're free to create whatever giant world you feel like. You can follow the rules of resource management and try to grow your hood naturally, or you can completely ignore them and build purely for the aesthetics, which make for some gorgeous creations when coupled with the style of the art\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nBlock'hood has a simplistic but charming art style that works quite well with the \"artificial vs natural\" theme that the story highlights. There are so many different blocks to use and learn the best route for managing various resources. The nature of the game lends itself to sandbox mode. However, I would love to see more emphasis on the devs on new stories. The game is 100% playable and enjoyable, but I do think there are a few unfinished outlets, such as certain resources that cannot be used and just build up forever", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506397318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 314, "playtime_forever": 653, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198090585511", "num_games_owned": 488}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "timestamp_updated": 1506231083, "recommendationid": "35171539", "timestamp_created": 1506230977}, {"review": "Did you ever play the isometric city-planning game SIMtown?
