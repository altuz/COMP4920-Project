{"reviews": [{"review": "A very promising game, even in the early alpha. You can desing your own ship, make it any shape and size you want, and outfit it with whatever components you want. You could even make a full sized, fully functional Death Star. Really. There are also enemy factions and ships to fight, which is the only way to get higher leveled components at the moment. The universe size is massive. You could fly for hours, at light speed, and still not see everything. Theres lots to explore and discover. As the game develops, I'm sure we'll see many improvements and features added in. Keep an eye on this one, Its going to be big.\n\nTo the developer: There are some things I would like to see implemented (you are probably already working on some of  them)\n\n- Working, joinable factions. Because it kind of sucks that everyone is hostile toward me no matter where I go.\n- A more in depth ship building interface, including engery output and consumption.\n- Singularities, cosmic storms, comets, and other hazards and \"weather\"\n- The ability to craft stronger components beyond the 2nd tier.\n- A trading and currency system\n- A job or contract system, allowing you to take jobs from ships and stations, such as \"go deliver this\" or \"hunt down this ship\" or \"Im stranded and need repairs\" or even \"mine asteroids\"\n- A shield system. Something like, a shield would cover a certain area aound it, and higher tier shields would cover a larger area. The shield would consume energy and when depleted would need time to recharge.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505876592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4753, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198023436355", "num_games_owned": 51}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "3", "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "timestamp_updated": 1492560563, "recommendationid": "31165964", "timestamp_created": 1492294508}, {"review": "Minecraft meets Eve online.

I've been playing it since the first Alpha, so I've gotten to enjoy seeing the progress that has happened with it and gotten to know a bit about what the developers have in mind for the full game. It's about time I wrote a review because I really like this game and I have been sharing a lot of content of it lately. I even started a YouTube channel.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZmkcMNcJ3Y&t=37s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrukZw2voSQ&t=2s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRvTUlX1VPM\n\nJust as a disclaimer, my videos there are not of standard gameplay but of artificially-induced difficulty using cheats to spawn lots of enemies.\n\nI want to say that a lot of the reasons I decided to buy this game had to do with the nostalgic itch factor. The vintage space sims that I was reckoning include (this might be giving away my age here) Mine Storm (1982), Escape Velocity (1996), Armada (1999), and EV Nova (2002). Space Impossible shares enough of the same qualities with these games that my itch was not left unscratched, and since it is a new game with its own style and depth it offers even more than that! For the first time I can actually build the spaceship however I want it and fly around the universe taking on whatever is out there in retro pixel fashion. We didn't have crafting in those games either, but it is quite popular in modern games and it plays into this game's structure very well. The aspect that drove a lot of earlier games in this genre was difficulty, and with a game called Space Impossible, you would expect there to be some sort of difficulty progression that was especially challenging. The truth is, that's not really the case with this current version, which is why I took to adding lots of extra bad guys for video capture. But that's just this version, which is scaled back considerably from earlier Alphas that included level progression, among other things that are missing for the time being. The reason for that was because the developers got a lot of encouragement early on (myself included) to allow player-built creations with an in-game editor. Naturally a lot of things had to be re-written, so we're left with a pared-down version that was created to meet that demand, with plans to bring back previous functionalities like trading and torpedoes, as well as adding more future yet-to-be-determined content. This sums up why I think you should buy the game now if you think you might like it: our developers here, rexspaceman and Stuffie, have been really eager to please their gamerbase so far, and have every indication of following through on that all the way to the game's release. They are ready to take input and plan out the rest of the development based on whatever suggestions you might have. If you like Early Access games for the fun of seeing a good game evolve into a great one, don't miss this game.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1504145709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 13668, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198151129091", "num_games_owned": 35}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1494820197, "recommendationid": "31761891", "timestamp_created": 1494820197}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 41, "review_score": 7, "total_negative": 6, "num_reviews": 5, "total_reviews": 47, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
