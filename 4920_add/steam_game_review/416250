{"reviews": [{"review": "A beautiful game, cartoony style, based on tales and classic epic stories, where you have to solve the malevolence of a kind of demon that want to erradicate all memories of them, by making characters in those stories forget their important role in human history and bring an end to all that it's wonderful and magic in our world.\n\nA classic point-click adventure game, where you're not there to kill and be killed, but to solve situations by using things you pick up, talking to characters, traveling to places where you have to find solutions to the problems that are presented to you. It also includes some simple puzzles.\n\nIt is meant for those with patience, that take their time to go around exploring, searching, listening and clicking their way through the story until it unravels itself.\n\nIf you liked games like Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Discwolrd, Blackwell, Kathy Rain, a.s.o. this one is for you. Maybe not as witty and more could have been done with it, taking into account the theme (stories, tales and legends), but it was a pleasure and I know that I will play it again, as I did with others.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1504902791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1768, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198112272735", "num_games_owned": 51}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510175", "timestamp_updated": 1500141203, "recommendationid": "33564776", "timestamp_created": 1500140399}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
