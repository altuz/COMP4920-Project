{"reviews": [{"review": "Alright so I barely played this so perhaps this won't be the best review but then again I barely played it for a reason. So for starters this game will make you question your PC when you click \"Play Game\" and it freezes. After multiple times starting the game and it crashing I decided to just leave it on \"not responding\" to see what happens. About roughly 5 minutes later the game finally loaded. \n\n\"HOW AWESOME WAS IT?\" you ask? Not awesome.\n\nIt starts with a super laggy and not well done camera pan from the skies down to your player whos laying on the ground, but isn't touching the ground. You then get up having full control over the player but not enough control to fight the terrible frame rate this game runs on. Within about 0.0007 seconds you're going to notice that the game looks absolutely nothing like it does on the steam store page and you're going to feel violated that you spent 3 $5 footlongs worth of money on this instead of enjoying your favourite meatball sub watching reruns of Breaking Bad on Netflix.\n\nI did however manage to traverse down the mountain to a crate in which I found some fruit. I wish I could say this was one of the good things about this game but I can't because the inventory UI was awful.\n\nI hope these developers improve on this game signifigantly and makes this review look silly but once you play for yourself you'll see that quite frankly this review was actually very nice.\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1448041163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198060810707", "num_games_owned": 150}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "11", "votes_down": 25, "votes_funny": 30, "votes_up": 91, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584551", "timestamp_updated": 1448043124, "recommendationid": "19177510", "timestamp_created": 1448043124}, {"review": "Early Access Launch Day...  My YouTube Hour long Early Access Launch Day Review Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO4s0OqrkYg\n\nI bought the game less then an hour after it launched in early access on Steam..\n\nFour fatal errors of which one hard locked up my PC requiring a hard reboot.\n\nThen the game, even set at minimum graphics quality settings for everything was stuttering and running awful.  ..The good thing is the devs who are two 18 year old kids quickly put out a texture patch to make the game process the textures better on lower then high end gaming rigs and the game was actually playable!  YAY!\n\nSo then I deleted my first video on my youtube channel and was able to replace it with a full hour long first impressions and early access review video!  \n\nThe bad news is that while the game was very playable now, I walked around for that full hour.. and I walked some more.. and I walked some more.  And still yet.. I walked some more!  There are NO creatures, friendly or hostile in this game at early access launch.  Resource gathering requires you explore the world enough to find the tools required to gather different types of resources.  So you will spend a LOT of time walking around the map.  Alone.  With weird glitches and oddities plentiful.  I found two pickaxes in a barrel sitting in the most bizarre spot off the trail.  Trying to simply equip the pickaxe, I magically turned it into 6 pickaxes!  Trails that you should be able to follow sometimes present invisible walls that can't be passed unless you jiggle and finess your character at exactly the right angle and spot in order to move on.  Shadows from trees seem to have epileptic seizures all around you making you get excited and think you saw some other creature off in the tall grass, but then realize that its just another weird graphical phenominon of this game.\n\nWhile the world they have created shows promise and like a place I would someday like to have epic battles for my life in, this world now is just as blah and heartless as a skeletal corpse void of any life at all.  There is nothing here that makes you want to play.. or stay.  Atleast today on early access launch day anyhow.\n\nSadly, this is just another game that was released in early access way way way too early by a couple of teenages way way way too eager to see their baby out on Steam.  I'm sure they both had and still have high dreams for this game, and I hope that they don't lose their passion and vision of what they plan for it.  My mission however is to score this game the same way I do every game I review on Steam and protect potential disappointed customers.\n\nAt the time of this review on its launch day of its early access, I don't see the game being even close to what it \"should\" be for a very long time... at least a year away, and that's if the developers continue to work very hard on it and keep their faith.  I hope that I am wrong, but I forsee this game being yet another abandoned early access survival game that once had developers with incredible visions and even more promises to any customers who would support them.\n\nAt the time of this review:\nThis game scores an F \n\"While it shows some hope, it just feels like it was released at least a year too early.\"\n\nWatch my video link above for a much more in depth review and all the reasons for why I scored it that way that I did.  Not recommended until this game is closer to 70% complete rather then the 15% complete it feels like it's at right now... and that's problably a long ways off, if it ever gets there and doesn't get abandoned first.\n\n* Please Note:  Suspected Shady Developers Behavior Early After Early Access Launch....  This game is getting \"mysterious\" positive reviews to counter the negative reviews.  No actual written postives yet, but just postives to help counter the negatives it's getting on Steam so far.  Are the developers giving copies to friends, family, and/or alt Steam accounts to hop in and add these mysterious positive scores?  - I wouldn't be surprised.  I could be wrong, but be wary!  Too many of these type of early access games that score this low from me seem to have developers trying to pull all kinds of this kind of shady behavior to desperately try and help them keep some sales coming. :-(", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1448093431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 169, "num_reviews": 292, "steamid": "76561198053422627", "num_games_owned": 960}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "21", "votes_down": 29, "votes_funny": 9, "votes_up": 95, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567995", "timestamp_updated": 1448275459, "recommendationid": "19177874", "timestamp_created": 1448044642}, {"review": "The screenshots make this game look somewhat interesting and playable.

Game is very very slow at loading once in the game it is hard to get anywhere as the game freezes crashes.
