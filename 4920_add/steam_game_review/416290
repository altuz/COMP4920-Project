It's been...fuck me, it's been JUST ONE GODDAMNED NIGHT since I last played a recently-released \"horror\" game which I should have known full well would turn out to be a steaming pile of dog turd.  And yet, Father...I JUST CAN'T HELP MYSELF.  I know it's BAD, Father, I...I think I might have an ADDICTION, Father.  I think I might be addicted to purchasing and, moreover, compulsively REVIEWING cheap-arsed, scammy horror games which alleged \"developers\" knocked up in a little over a fortnight using free or inexpensive software in order to indulge their delusional fantasies of becoming rich and adored video game designers, and/or just to swindle a few indiscriminate fuckers like myself into buying what looks like it will be a highly satisfying gaming experience, when it should be painfully clear from the Steam Store page that it will be anything but.\n \n   They are SHIT, Father.  Oh yes.  And I feel like I also must be shit to keep giving them my money.  But this is precisely what I shall continue to do...oh yes, Father, I shall.  (Though I might have to force myself in future not to pay six dollars - on SALE, at that! - to indulge this idiotic hobby of mine.  I already owe way too much on my fucking credit card.)\n \n   Okay, fair enough, let's drop the gimmicky facade for long enough to step out of the confession booth, and examine this one in a little more depth.  The depth it surely deserves, considering the many TENS of hours (not hundreds; definitely not thousands) which Curse Box Studios - aka the weird, socially-retarded twentysomething year-old dude who still lives up the road with his mum - put into it.  \n\nOkay, first of all, it looks like puppy vomit.  Secondly, the monsters squeal like puppies who've just had their bellies tickled whenever you \"kill\" them WITH YOUR OWN BLOOD (never really explained, but it's \"different\", I guess...though it must be awfully troublesome being a human-murdering monster if a tiny bit of the red stuff kills you instantly).  Thirdly, every floor is basically THE SAME MAP OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  Fourthly...it crashes quite a lot (despite the aforementioned thing about the game looking no better than puppy vomit).  Fifthly...oh, why would I even bother?!  \n\n   Just don't make the same mistake that I did, and remember, kids: Just say NO to reviewing cheap 'n' nasty \"horror\" games on Steam.  Look at what it's done to me.  BEST SIX BUCKS I EVER FLUSHED DOWN THE TOILET. \n \nVerdict: 3.5/10 (hey, at least it gets points for being original, even if the \"twist\" it presents makes ABSOLUTELY NO FUCKING SENSE WHATSOEVER.

But\u2026 it\u2019s fucking broken.\n\nYou\u2019ll be playing as Zoey, a run-of-the-mill survivalist living in a post-apocalyptic world ravished by rubbery, fleshy monsters called the Pale Ones. After a scavenging trip goes awry, Zoey\u2019s fellow survivors are slaughtered by Pale Ones. She just barely manages to escape before losing her arm to a monster. Although, in the brutal process, she learns that her blood is somehow capable of poisoning the beasts. (I\u2019d tell you why that is\u2026 but I failed to beat this poor excuse for a game.)\n\nAnyway, your goal is to reach the roof of the dilapidated office building and ride the cabal car back to safety. \n\nNow, I\u2019d first like to commend the concept this game has created. Using a rusty screw driver, the player must stab Zoey\u2019s gaping wound and spray incoming monsters with blood to kill them. Really cool idea, but this game\u2019s disgusting design, disgusting optimization, and disgusting character models ruin what might\u2019ve been a decent horror experience.\n\nThere really isn\u2019t anything else to this title. You\u2019ll walk up floor by floor, slaying the odd monster, reading notes and picking up keys. Oh, and by the way, these notes are everywhere, and I mean EVERYWHERE. But trust me\u2026 it won\u2019t be long before any sane person ignores them all together; trying to read while stomaching this game\u2019s frame rate is as plausible as Donald Trump winning the 2016 election.\n\nOh yeah, did I mention the frame rate? It\u2019s like something straight out of hell. My rig is nothing to brag about, in fact, it\u2019s kinda shit, but Jesus\u2026 COD: Ghosts had better optimization than this.\n\nThis game crashed on me three times, and one of those crashes managed to freeze up my entire computer.

Your only weapon against the tentacled beasts that hunt you is your own vital fluids which you spray from your sketchily bandaged stump by jamming a screwdriver in the wound hole. \nThen again, it's pretty novel for a reason. Why would a species so dramatically allergic to human blood EAT PEOPLE? How are there any of these imbeciles left in the first place? \nI'd be willing to lay that to one side if the game itself were any good but, for a title that sees you trying to flee to a rooftop cable car before you wring yourself dry out of your mangled arm, it's a tediously placid experience. There's no urgency in your situation. You'll find more medipacks than you'll ever need. There are notes, NOTES for god's sake, like I'm going to stop to check them out mere minutes after my hand's been chewed off, and the monsters just kind of slowly amble towards you, giving you plenty of time to douse them in artery juice. Once you get over the amusing gruesomeness of this sole attack, it's a wildly annoying six second animation that will unavoidably cause you to take damage before you can kill your opponent. \nAt around 25 minutes long, the only positive you can take from this mess is that it's a surefire refund candidate.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6f_6Lb7bIU", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1447118181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 28, "num_reviews": 115, "steamid": "76561198169311898", "num_games_owned": 1797}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 12, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496818", "timestamp_updated": 1447217300, "recommendationid": "19005089", "timestamp_created": 1447217300}, {"review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yatFlp9zp60\n\nI really wish this one was better.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1484309443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 34, "num_reviews": 44, "steamid": "76561198021057760", "num_games_owned": 540}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498652", "timestamp_updated": 1494389272, "recommendationid": "31658962", "timestamp_created": 1494389272}, {"review": "It's actually scary!\nI'd add a more intense and frightening music for the moments when an enemy appears.\nAlso the in-game help should show the keyboard and mouse controls when I'm playing with them, and not the gamepad.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1447808175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 25, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198041162500", "num_games_owned": 11}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489594", "timestamp_updated": 1447808382, "recommendationid": "19137894", "timestamp_created": 1447808382}, {"review": "I like this game.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1455665970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 32, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198130162623", "num_games_owned": 997}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489484", "timestamp_updated": 1447256496, "recommendationid": "19014215", "timestamp_created": 1447256496}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 7, "total_reviews": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
