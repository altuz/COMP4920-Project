{"reviews": [{"review": "i like alawar games and i like time management games. thing is, i like to play levels in my own pace, i dont care about achievements or gold stars but eg sometimes i like to max out all buildings, sometimes im lazy to wait around for that.\nthese type of games i find relaxing and entertaining.\ni dont care about the not-so-attractive graphics or the one bug but i really hate that the game rushes me. i know, its TIME management, still, if i wanted an adrenalin rush, id play an another genre. dont rush me, if im slow deny me those ah-so-coveted gold stars. with this genre i expect relaxation not frustration.\nso, unfortunately i wont finish this game, and because of the above i cant recommend it.\non the other hand, if you dont mind trying a level again (andagainandagain) because the game kills your rescuees, it might be just for you.\n\nupdate1\nMia, a fellow steam user brought to my attention that this game has a 'relaxed mode', where you dont have to play against the timer. im not sure the game had this feature before, quite possibly it did and i skipped it the clever guy i am. so thanks, and though it wont be my favourite time management game, my rating is changed to recommended.\n\nupdate2\nand im getting senile and i forgot why i actually disliked this game, i started again (no steam cloud) and at about the 12th map i remembered: fire kills my rescuees. so sorry Mia, changed back to not recommended.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1474052991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 503, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561197962576592", "num_games_owned": 1025}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506551", "timestamp_updated": 1474053272, "recommendationid": "22297600", "timestamp_created": 1460108084}, {"review": "Pretty good time wasting game.
