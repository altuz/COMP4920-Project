{"reviews": [{"review": "I'm really wanted to recommend this game. I really like some aspects of it.\n++ The music is really good, to the point that I actually left the game open to listen to it while doing other things.\n+ About the first third of the game was good. The characters interacted well, the story was good, the jokes were alright (not personally my cup of tea, but fine), and the little investigation puzzles you did were a rather nifty.\n\nThere were also things I personally liked, but I think some people would be mixed on. \n+/- While I personally was not bothered with it, I can see some people really not liking the art in this game. The backgrounds are perfectly fine, but those characters. It's a generic animu style, complete with nonsensical proportions and bad shading.\n+/- The game also has some animations, which I find is another mixed point. The also has that animu style, except now instead of being poorly shaded, it has wonky physics and for some reason has Japanese voice acting. The Japanese is handwaved in game, but that doesn't make less odd. While it is rather cool that the developer included these scenes, I would have been perfectly fine with them being left out.\n+/- Another mixed point in this game is the player's input within the story. Your actions in the game don't change anything about the ending, they only change which character/s you end up with. However, to make up for this, the game has several puzzles, each increasing in difficulty. While I found the puzzles a nice tradeoff, I can see people really not liking the lack of player induced change. Also, while almost all of the puzzles were good, I found the very last puzzle more tedious then challenging.\n\nThere was even something that, while I personally didn't like it, I could see someone else liking it.\n-/+ The CGs in the game I did not like at all. They, for me, crossed that line from being animu but fine to looking like DeviantArt trash. Proportions were completely off, to the point that Max's spine looked broken in most of them. Sometimes the characters in the CG looks little to nothing like the characters that are meant to be in them. However, if you can look past those two things, then they are rather nicely detailed, colored, and shaded.\n\nHowever, there was one thing that made this game unbearable. [spoiler]Around the point that Max's apartment flooded/burned[/spoiler] or about 1/3 of the way through the game, the entire thing became completely unenjoyable. I enjoyed this part the game so little that everything wrong with the game at that point was a major issue.\n- What happened to the humor? It turned from a mix of deadpan, referential jokes with a mild hit of random/stupid humor to being [b]entirely[/b] random and stupid with the occasional deadpan joke thrown in. This got to the point where there is an entire sequence where the only thing going on and the only joke occurring is that Max thinks that a cardboard cutout is really a person. Why did you do this? I at least found the first part's humor harmless. Now I just want to hit all of the characters (well, mainly Max).\n- [spoiler]Also [b]why is everyone sexing[/b]? Max, Brad, and Ethen will no matter who you\u2019re going for, as do Holly and Ember, and Victoria and obvious villain number 1. I have no qualms with multiple relationships at once, no that's not the issue. First off, if you go for Brad/Ethen, you have to have a scene with the both of them, and if you go for Holly/Ember/Victoria, you have to have the scene with Ethen and Brad. So, I hope you wanted Max to get with Ethen and/or Brad. Second, while Max/Brad/Ethen was hinted at, and Victoria's was hinted at, Holly/Ember is not, leading me to believe that their scene was added as fan service. Thirdly, all of these events happen/ are repeatedly brought up at in the same sequence, which makes them all really off putting no matter what.[/spoiler]\n- Because of the two points above, all of the characters are ruined, as they do basically nothing else.\n- The entire story is also frequently derailed due to this.\n- The ending contains a not really twist that I predicted.\n- The very ending contains a stupid joke they decided to make an animation for because...reasons.\n\nDue to the latter portion of the story, I cannot recommend this game. The good parts are mostly ruined by the bad. If you can get the game for ten dollars or less, then it might be worth it, but even that's a stretch.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1493934517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1088, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198304489224", "num_games_owned": 79}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523170", "timestamp_updated": 1504249831, "recommendationid": "33825331", "timestamp_created": 1501136526}, {"review": "so far im really enjoying the game and i look forward to more games by this studio", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1501336864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 762, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198018188854", "num_games_owned": 68}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495896", "timestamp_updated": 1501197181, "recommendationid": "33843460", "timestamp_created": 1501197181}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 48, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 50, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
