{"reviews": [{"review": "Classic HOS game, but for one thing : silhouette HOS .. they look like HOS but you actually end up manipulating objects forward and backward, moving them from left to right.. untill they fit the perfect shape to a certain angle. I found these quickly boring. Some achievements will require you to accomplish them under a minute. \nAs most games of the genre, the story isn't ambitious but it gets the job done, driving you from many nice and somewhat easy puzzles to few classic HO scenes and some silhouette HO thingy. \nI still recommend it, especially if on sales.\n\n\nOne big pro : The more or less chip music of the retro arcade video game \"Flap for Life\" (a game in the game) with many chip sounds of 8-bit music. That was a good and enjoying surprise!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505848583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 801, "num_reviews": 23, "steamid": "76561198015324296", "num_games_owned": 465}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1505852099, "recommendationid": "35071671", "timestamp_created": 1505852099}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "review_score": 5, "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 11, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
