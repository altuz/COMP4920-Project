{"reviews": [{"review": "The game is a bullet hell shooter, make no mistake.\n\nIt's more concerned with sending a barrage of bullets your way than actually making a fun experience.\nThe control you have on your ship also isn't refined enough for the tiny gaps they want you to fit through, you move the stick just a tiny bit, and you jump 10-15 pixels in that direction.\n\nI'm also not sure what's up with the hit detection. I realize the player's hitbox is typically pretty small in these type of games, and I assumed it was the tiny light on your ship. However, there were times where bullets passed directly over that light and I didn't take any damage. The game feels inconsistent in this regard, makign it feel poorly programmed.\nThe ability to use infinite continues makes the whole thing kind of boring as well. I didn't even see any way to limit the number of continues in the settings menu, which is pretty lame.\n\nThe sprite work is pretty middling, but it's also not even able to be appreciated with all of the bullets on screen. The whole game just feels like it doesn't have a soul. Even though it only took me 1.3 hours to beat, it felt like an eternity because I kept just wanting it to be over already. It's a draining, unpleasant, tiring experience, and one that I wouldn't reccomend to anybody.\n\nP.S. Whoever did the English translation for those achievement titles needs to go back to school, because holy crap, they are bad!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1504636816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 287, "num_reviews": 37, "steamid": "76561197996627259", "num_games_owned": 1116}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482708", "timestamp_updated": 1504626638, "recommendationid": "34749898", "timestamp_created": 1504587476}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 19, "review_score": 5, "total_negative": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 28, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
