{"reviews": [{"review": "In the Dead of Night is a fairly generic and somewhat uninspired TD.  The RTS elements are extremely minimal as you manage a group of villagers to gather various resources, build towers and construct them.  The towers are very limited and suffer from a lack of creativity as the first three traps are simply different spike traps built from the three resources in the game.  The game play can feel slow and repetative even after only the first day of a level.\n\nFrom a technical stand point this game suffers from a few glaring issues.  The most basic of them is that the graphics will wow no one who has played a game made after 2000 yet despite what should be a very very low demand engine the optimization appears non-existant as the game will stutter and lag during fairly small enemy waves; long story short if my rig can handle Cry engine there is no way this game should lag.\n\nThe possibly most offending part of this game is the pure lack of polish to the menu/playing interface.  Many click boxes do not line up to their respective buttons or appear to be missing completely, with basically 3 interface interaction between start to finish on placing a tower that means you have to deal with 3 menus/interfaces each of which is full of missing or misplaced click boxes, it's tedious and frustrating.\n\nThe story idea is interesting but I've played better built free flash games than this mess.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1450558802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 54, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561198087864882", "num_games_owned": 248}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531573", "timestamp_updated": 1450654548, "recommendationid": "19790359", "timestamp_created": 1450559525}, {"review": "Great ideas to mix in RTS elements, shame the game's unfinished.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1456343830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 40, "num_reviews": 25, "steamid": "76561197987323362", "num_games_owned": 697}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500164", "timestamp_updated": 1456343914, "recommendationid": "21431252", "timestamp_created": 1456343914}, {"review": "Can't say i hate this game, but as i decided to skip the tutorial to go back to the main menue to test something i ended up permantly disable the tutorial with no ways of turning it back on.I some how still figured out how to play after losing some villagers, seemed okay but nothing special, just wave after wave of enemies and wolves?\n\nFor some reason a woman is burned as a witch out of fear as she for some reason want to bring back a child from the dead, this results in the husban of the witch to some how bring the dead wife back alive by the sacrifice of another woman?Then for some reason the dead witch decide to raise her dead child back to life, oh and destroy the people who live in the towns as revenge because why not?\n\nTho weak she easily get revenge on the guy in charge and the reason she was burned as a witch but she won't stop there as she seek to destory everyone and it is your job to prevent that from happening by gathering the limited resources on each level and make traps to stop the waves of undead!Oh and animals?\n\nAs i missed the tutorial because i was trying to understand a crash error i got when i first booted up the game, i ended up in the dark as to what does what, as there really is zero information about how to do anything.The lack of an interface does not help as you are left to guess what buttons to press to build the right traps, some of the more expensive traps seem to do nothing unless you tap them with the mouse witch is nothing but a hassel to me.The basic traps seem to be allot better to spend resources on then the more expensive supposedly better traps you can research.I quickly lost interest during my first level and ended up waiting for the first level to end.\n\nThe lack of options is not really a big deal to me but it might for allot of other people,but it still would have been nice with proper options in the settings as this game defintly could have used it.So tho not a horrible game, it is a very slow and boring game that i do not recommend people to buy.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1450563643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 56, "num_reviews": 58, "steamid": "76561197979402731", "num_games_owned": 821}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494941", "timestamp_updated": 1450565517, "recommendationid": "19792057", "timestamp_created": 1450565517}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
