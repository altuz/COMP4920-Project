{"reviews": [{"review": "In short I recommend this game but only because the price is so reasonable. It is a quirky Tony Hawk Pro Skater wanna be game. But that\u2019s why I find it so enjoyable. It manages to imitate it in a charming and delightful way that I just enjoy the hell out of.\n\tFirst off do not play this game with mouse and keyboard. You will not enjoy yourself I promise you. While it does have its flaws the game shines when you are playing split screen with your friends. Definitely a party game at its heart and you won\u2019t be playing it for an extended amount of time but you will enjoy it for the time you are playing it. \n\tLike I said in the beginning this game does emulate THPS a lot and it does an excellent job in doing so. Basically it\u2019s the apocalypse but people still need their taco\u2019s so you need to deliver them. Not supposed to make sense so stop worrying about it.  So the 2 modes are to deliver tacos or play a strange form of tag that will make you stab your best friend. It\u2019s all good fun.\n\tThe game does have a problem of keeping prolonged interest as I have the attention span of a squirrel on cocaine. So you might play it for thirty minutes at a time every now and again. Also it has a problem with its version of tag where the person who grabs the shiny taco first proceeds to cheese the game and avoid you for the entire match if you decided to play it in the burbs. But all in all it\u2019s a great little game that deserves more attention. And for the asking price of almost nothing compared to bigger game\u2019s I would say it is worth the buy.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mZGKiILA9s&feature=youtu.be", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1496855085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 42, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198026574363", "num_games_owned": 218}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500178", "timestamp_updated": 1497218812, "recommendationid": "32243094", "timestamp_created": 1496857322}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 16, "review_score": 7, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 16, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
