I have a soft spot in my gamer heart for cartoony platformers. This looked like such a great Keen-esque platformer that I bought it on blind faith. Bad mistake. It's a horribly simplistic, buggy exposition of what it looks like when a video game is made from the ground up to hit a marketing goal. Someone said \"old school is in right now, Halloween is cool, push this game out\" and this horrible thing was patched together as quickly as possible. I'm pretty disappointed in both Interplay and Steam for signing off on the distribution."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1441957415, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518403", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "17979499", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198067119595", "num_reviews": 51, "last_played": 1442308050, "num_games_owned": 1019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1344}, "timestamp_updated": 1445191154, "received_for_free": false, "review": "ETA ---- I have found that the game is broken at the end. You hit all the switches in the final level, then the screen tears, and you fall into nothingness. So a proper ending can not be seen. Further, on reading in the discussions, I see that the game has been reported to be this way over TWO YEARS ago. And the devs have done nothing about it. And Steam continues to sell a broken game ---- unacceptable, so I am changing my recommendation.

The graphics are really crisp and sharp. It can be beaten without tricks. The enemies are varied, as are the weapons. Stages are varied, although more so in the second half of the game. It'd be a game you could let your kid play. The longer you play, the more you'll get used to the controls and enjoy playing.\n\nThe bad: \nIt's got some bugs. It suffers from a severe lack of polish. Some levels you'll have to restart simply because you used keys on doors that are pointless (trial and error). The controls take a bit to get used to due to a weird jump that has you glide down.\n\nOverall, it's not one I'd recommend, but it's not as bad as some of the reviews indicate. I mean, if you got it for a dollar or two...it's worth it."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1402084293, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504739", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "10371929", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197993813869", "num_reviews": 40, "last_played": 1402716361, "num_games_owned": 922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 364}, "timestamp_updated": 1402084293, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A lot of people don't seem to like this game.
