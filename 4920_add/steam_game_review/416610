{"reviews": [{"review": "Complete Shit\n\nI got this game 85% off, so I was like 'hey it's 60\u00a2 why not get it?' Worst sixty cents I ever spent.  The controls are fairly straight forward, but the walls extend like 5 pixels out so thesensing sucks.  You can't even get close to the wall without losing.  the soundtrack resets whenever you die, so you just here the same beat starting over consecutively.  There aren't any instructions, so by the time you get to the third or fourth level you have no idea what all these symbols and markings mean.  The only way to find out is to ram into them and then most likely die.  Bottom line, don't buy it.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1475426316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198203220793", "num_games_owned": 12}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500234", "timestamp_updated": 1475426317, "recommendationid": "25824183", "timestamp_created": 1475426317}, {"review": "A [strike]mildly[/strike] infurating game of mouse dexterity and percision.
