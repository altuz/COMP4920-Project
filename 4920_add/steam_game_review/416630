Nothing truly interesting happens throughout the 1-2 hours it takes to finish it. Lucas is an ok character, but other than that there's nothing there. The love interests are boring as hell, the cruise consists only of partying, swimming and eating (I know it's like that in real life, but please make something happens!), and the weird match-3 minigame brings nothing to the game and is just in the way. \n\nI couldn't believe it, but the endings truly are abrupt.
