{"reviews": [{"review": "I loved lemmings back in the day and overall like games that make you think with some strategy mixed in.\n\nThis is lemmings with a much more fun, comical twist in that you're the zombies and the humans are the bad guys.\n\nPros:\n- The pixel art \n- The soundtrack. Seriously it's really good. I could listen to that if I was just working on a project at home.\n- The comedy. You will chuckle quite a bit at some of the various dialog. It's stupid and it's funny.\n\nCons: (not many)\n- You will inevitably say sooner or later \"F that level\" as you either can't figure it out or you can and executing it is simply hard. But that makes it all the more worth while when you come back the next day only to beat it.\n\nCan't recommend it enough.

The graphics are good, well done pixel art. Fun concept.\n\nSlow paced strategy game. If a level is moving too fast you can pause to think.
