It's like the Tony Hawk of bullfighting. I just wish there was blood. Now we need a sequel, Running From The Bulls. With the option to be the bull :D\n\nEDIT: I in no way endorse the harming and subsequent murder of bulls in real life. I do understand it is a large part of history and culture and vehemently defeneded by certain demographics in parts of Spain. I, personally, am against the unnecessary real life animal violence, but, that's my opinion and I don't have the cultural and ethnic background of the people who enjoy this thing, so I can't comdemn them for something they were raised on.

I suspect an equal number of words will be wasted pointing out the ostensible hypocrisy of people who think nothing of shooting digital humans, but feel the need to howl over the killing of a digital bull. I won't bother injecting my point of view because many of you, like me, just want to know if it's worth 4.99. \n\nThe simple answer is no. \n\nBull fights are essentially made up of two mini games. The first has you taunt the bull in order to get it to charge your cape. The basic idea is to perform strings of combos in order to increase your score as well as crowd favor. The second is a series of timed button presses. Both are repeated over a four round match. \n\nOverall it's a fairly shallow game. The controls are extremely stiff and somewhat non-responsive . Matches lack any depth while managing to feel too long. What's more the actual killing of the bull isn't shown. The Tercio de Muerte is nothing more than a couple of button presses ending with the bull charging off camera followed by a score card. I imagine some people will view this as a good thing. \n\nWhy am I giving this a thumbs up? The game isn't totally devoid of entertainment value, but mostly because I welcome the chance to experience something different regardless of what side of the line my moral compass points towards. I can appreciate someone trying something different, but if I were you I would wait till it's on sale. \n\nWord of warning this game works with the Xbox 360 controller, but not the Xbox One controller.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1453942247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 25, "num_reviews": 62, "steamid": "76561197972930825", "num_games_owned": 1630}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "13", "votes_down": 143, "votes_funny": 14, "votes_up": 116, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511127", "timestamp_updated": 1453866469, "recommendationid": "20779085", "timestamp_created": 1453866337}, {"review": "Game concept is good the sport is awsome.

First off, grow some balls you pansies \u263a. This game is just a virtual depiction of a sport very sacred in my culture. So maybe before criticizing the treatment of bulls, think about whether you may or may not be being a racist.\n\nNow to the game, because that's the important part of this review:\n\nSome of you kids seem to think that a virtual bull being stabbed in its rump is more vile than actually eating your stupid hamburgers you stupid American fatsos. Now fuck you. I'm a little mad because we should be talking about the game when you little tiny idiots are so small you can't even comprehend the importance of this sport you miniature idiots. Maybe you Dwarven smurf petite dinky microscopic nerds can read up on wikipedia because I don't have time to educate you paltry gnomes. Lil baby boys. Puny.\n\nSo about the game:\n\nThis is a 8.7/10 but pip-squeak idiots like the ones in this review section wouldn't be able to comprehend that because their brains are tiny as heck.\n\nThe sound is fantastic. The graphics remind me of the good ol' days of gaming (retro). Twerps. \n\nMaybe in the audience next time you could add some scantily-clad women (because when I used to bullfight there would be ladies in the crowd displaying breasts). It was Spain so we called them \"se\u00f1oritas\". \n\nMaybe you Americans would benefit from immersion in another culture, instead of bathing in your mountain dew and baby sweat and tears because Mom turned off the Nintendo.\n\nP.S. Your fucking tiny, dweebs. Lilliputian homunculi.\n\nSo peace out, you rat-chasing, dust farming, pint-sized tinyfucks.
