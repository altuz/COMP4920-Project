{"reviews": [{"review": "This is a great little puzzle game that combines Minesweeper and Picross, with a solid learning curve that starts easy to teach the basics, but steadily (and fairly) climbs to puzzles where figuring out each single square as a yes/no feels like an accomplishment.\n\nDespite what all the negative reviews seem to say, these puzzles are all 100% logic solvable with no guessing needed - I was able to work my way through all of them, and when I did make a mistake, I was able, on taking a second look, to figure out what I missed that would have saved me from that wrong move. But each time I made a mistake, I learned from it, reset the puzzle, and started over - and eventually solved them, no guessing or using guides.\n\nOnly downsides are:\n1. It would be nice to have a \"maybe\" flag, similar to Minesweeper, for use in testing \"what if it's this square\" theories, without having to keep track of it all in your head.\n2. There's not a lot of replay value. All the puzzles are pre-made, so once you've beaten them, you know them. But I got 9 hours of distraction out of an $0.89 investment so I'm still feeling I got my money's worth!\n\nFully recommend.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1501386796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 592, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198110595954", "num_games_owned": 116}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506829", "timestamp_updated": 1501386937, "recommendationid": "33894981", "timestamp_created": 1501381485}, {"review": "[b]Recommended only, if you're really into that genre of games![/b]\n\nA mashup of minesweeper and picture cross, which could've been great, but actually isn't. Mainly that is because one has to guess at certain points in later levels to solve the puzzles without make a wrong move. That should be a no-go in a logic game! But would be less of a problem, if the game wouldn't tell you immediately after each click, if that selection was right or not. Flagging cells as \"unsure\" (like in minesweeper) would've also helped a ton here. Especially if you're after the full 3-star-rating in each level that quickly becomes a real pain and most later levels are solved more often than not by brute-forcing your way through them, taking a photo and then doing them once more without even thinking it through. Which mentions another major downside: the 36 levels presented are not random.
