{"reviews": [{"review": "Can I just start by saying I really wanted to DISLIKE this game.  I am a pretentious DDR player who played for 4 years and beat almost all content DDR, ITG, and Stepmania had to offer.  So this game strolls along and is all like \"look at me, I'm a dancy game\" and I thought it was just stupid, I mean look at that guy with the afro, is he a wizard, is he a disco dancer? wtf is this game?!\n\nThen I played The Metronomicon at pax and ho-ly-crap I was instantly addicted.  Everything just made sense, the step charts were smooth, the rpg element was smart, the team building was in depth, it just felt right.  So the devs spotted me a copy and I streamed it for awhile hoping to find some aspect of the game I hated, but it just kept getting better.  This game isn't 90% dance, 10% rpg, it's 50/50.  Building your party is JUST as important as hitting the notes right.  I've kept in communication with the devs for awhile now (I stalk them on twitter) and they are seriously the most legit game devs out there, I mean their next tournament is called W.E.I.N.E.R and let's face it, any game devs that put weiner in their game deserves you to buy their game.\n\n9/10 point deduction because F&*% you guys, your game can't be perfect.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506747212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 226, "playtime_forever": 3528, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561198044935812", "num_games_owned": 430}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": true, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 7, "votes_up": 42, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571572", "timestamp_updated": 1505335705, "recommendationid": "34926975", "timestamp_created": 1505335673}, {"review": "Very unique game, really fun so far.

I would rather have one hard line and play that.\n-The music in the game, most of it just isn't my style.\n-The game breaking con? If you use a X360 controller and obviously that includes if you use something else that makes yours emulate one and show as one in your control panel then you WONT be using the triggers as controls. For me that is a must, to use rb, lb and the triggers. I come from the DDR game that was on PS3 in the past that you can no longer play and the controls were like that, the outsides were the triggers and L1, R1 were the center and hopefully someday someone that knows what I am talking about reads this and they will save themselves from buying it. If I am paying for it I am gonna play it my way or Im not buying it. There's no reason the devs cannot fix this issue, pretty ridiculous in my opinion as it's rare a game falls subject to that axis cancelling out problem instead of being able to see both buttons\\triggers pressed at the same time. In fact this may be the first time I've had this problem with a game on steam ever, mostly if I've seen this it was related to OLD OLD games designed for win2000 and earlier lol\n\nBUT I still gave the game a thumbsup as I feel if your looking into it and you aren't used to a certain way of playing this type of game the controls issue may not be a deal breaker for you in which case definitly give it a shot.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506639984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "playtime_forever": 24, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198169404671", "num_games_owned": 194}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502678", "timestamp_updated": 1506642569, "recommendationid": "35276742", "timestamp_created": 1506642569}, {"review": "A well made rhythm game with a unique twist (the RPG party system).\n\nThe music tracks are good and varied.\n\nI just wish I didnt suck at it.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506934458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 136, "playtime_forever": 136, "num_reviews": 25, "steamid": "76561198006817082", "num_games_owned": 294}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1506936572, "recommendationid": "35409896", "timestamp_created": 1506936572}, {"review": "This game is fun and cutely designed, I'm just really bad at rhythm games.  /really bad./  You should get it while it's on sale if you like that kind of thing.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506618789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "playtime_forever": 34, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561197983239974", "num_games_owned": 2327}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1506621009, "recommendationid": "35267330", "timestamp_created": 1506621009}, {"review": "My fantasy threesome involves Jona Bechtolt and Jimmy Urine, but since that's unlikely to happen IRL I'm making do with this game.
