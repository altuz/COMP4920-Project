Poor ol' death has lost all its powers and doesnt feel very good in this world, the only friend it could find was a fly....mustve been the smell or sumthin'.\nWhen you play as death the game is a platformer, you cant attack but you can toggle the big switches and use keys.\nWhen you play as the fly you can fight enemies, toggle the small switches and fly anywhere to explore the levels.\nYou can switch between the two at any time and thats required in many situations.\nA nice addition are the items that you can find in the levels or buy in the shops that you can even summon during levels if you have the required item in inventory. . They give specific abilities to the characters, like telekinesis to Death and pass through walls to the Fly.\nThe level design is nice and the difficulty increases steadily as you advance through the levels.\n\nIts important to play the game fullscreen, very hard to see anything otherwise.\nThe negatives would be the confusing interface, easy to figure things out in fullscreen but in window mode it can be tricky.\nAlso the game doesnt seem to remember your settings so it happens randomly that music is off when i start a game or it starts in windowed and i have to restart the game.\n\nI found this to be a very entertaining game that i dont regret purchasing. Its actually considerably better than similar games made for the old 16 bit consoles."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1414244325, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496735", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "12625235", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198045650941", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1376482545, "num_games_owned": 517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 21}, "timestamp_updated": 1414244325, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I personaly found this game to amazing.
