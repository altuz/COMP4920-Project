I would like to see it expanded upon, add more maps that differ from the current \"Don't hit the white space.\" Online multiplayer would be nice, no matchmaking or anything like that, just the ability to invite your friends. The lack of options and no custom keybindings is basically the only major problem with the game, the key layout isn't good.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1454525545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198011760214", "num_games_owned": 482}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513693", "timestamp_updated": 1454525588, "recommendationid": "20936863", "timestamp_created": 1454525588}, {"review": "Why does this not have alot of reviews?

It's simple enough that anyone can easily pick it up, and it has enough stuff that it can keep you playing for hours. Games are short and sweet, with a hectic fast pace that makes it addicting.
