This right here is why stalker is one of my favorite games, I feel like I'm doing something.\nLet me tell you something else, the gunplay in this game is something else (you know a game is good when you feel like your weapons are actually weapons and not pea-shooters), the sounds, the flashes, the modifications, they all come together to make for a somewhat realistic and definitely awesome FPS experience.\nAnd you know what? Even after you finish the game (which you probably will do) there is still more content in the form of mods. If you don't know what mods are, mods are community made content which are specifically made to make a game that bit more awesome. One of my favorite mods for Stalker: COP has to be \"Misery+TheArmedZone\" which adds so much to the game I can't even name all it's additions (no really!).\n\nSo to summerise.\nThis game, this experience, has to go down as one of the best FPS games, no, one of the BEST games I've ever played.\nThis one's a keeper."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505009673, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34851256", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027898656", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1482965221, "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2479}, "timestamp_updated": 1505009673, "received_for_free": false, "review": "(I did have Misery) The one aspect, if nothing else, in this game that I like is that you are REWARDED for playing carefully and planning ahead.
