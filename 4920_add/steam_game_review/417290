{"reviews": [{"review": "Ghost of a tale is a fun to play and a really gorgeous looking game. Stealth mechanics work great, but if you just want to quickly backtrack from point A to point B the game won't punish you too hard for alerting one or multiple guards to your presence, as you can easily find a hiding place to wait them out. Yes, there is some backtracking, but is made far less irritating than in most titles through game's single, continuous environment and multiple paths you can take from one location to another. Speaking of that environment, it feels truly filled, lush, alive and immersive. Being underground feels like you really are underground and in contrast forest really looks and feels like a forest, which is something I find a lot of game struggle with and tend to feel unfinished. Ghost of a Tale actually IS unfinished, but it already feels incredibly rich.\n\nGameplay is very straight-forward for a stealth game. You can sneak, hide, knock your opponents out or distract them. All of these work well, are fun to do and I've not run into any issues with them during my playthrough. Minor bugs aside, I've not ran into anything game-breaking or quest-breaking, or really any kind of bug or glitch that interferred with my gameplay. If these were present in earlier versions, they have been fixed.\n\nThe main character, Tilo, is quite compelling with his adorable appearance, poignant backstory and clear motivations. You are also given some, admittedly very limited, choice with his personality when picking dialogue options during NPC conversations.\n\nAlthough the story has been described by the developer as linear, there are a few choices to make during the game, most of which unfortunately we do not yet get to see the result of (like what you decided to do with the spyglass). Some quests also give you multiple options on how to complete them and some quests are not all that easily discovered, thus giving you a reason to thoroughly explore this wonderfully crafted world. Expositional text is simple and yet effective in conveying the world of the game to the player. It is sometimes serious and sad, and other times funny, even occasionally dipping into black comedy. Besides telling you about the world, it might also reveal things about Tilo and other NPCs.\n\nOn the more biased note; this game will most definitely appeal to the fans of Redwall, Mouse Guard, Beyond the Western Deep and similar works. I thoroughly recommend Ghost of a Tale to those whose stylistic predilections are already aligned with the game, those who enjoy stelath games and those who just enjoy a colorful and well defined fantasy worlds. It\u2019s already worth your time and money in its early access state.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506720189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "playtime_forever": 492, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198169063798", "num_games_owned": 12}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504305", "timestamp_updated": 1505051587, "recommendationid": "34862491", "timestamp_created": 1505051587}, {"review": "I love stealth games and recently there has been a huge resurgance in them.
