Every section of the music, the game assigns selected Japanese letters to your direction buttons (WASD, Arrow keys, or as clickable buttons). You will listen to the japanese sounds and time the button to the beat (or just by timing it on when your character should jump on-screen).\n\nThe game randomizes which buttons is assigned the letters so you won't memorize the combinations. Unfortunately, this changes the game from a memory test to a speed-reading test. When playing, I found these two strategies of playing:\n- remember the letters spoken, then look up at the prompts and read the letters.\n- or look at the prompts, listen to the letters and remember the button order.\n\nOne complain I have is that the game has slow progression. It took me an hour to finish the K- Hiraganas. For someone who is familiar with Hiragana and was looking for a game to test my memory, it feels too slow. I hope the later part of the game will mix up the letters instead of batching them up.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nOn one hand, the gameplay made the memory test harder than it should.

The difficulty curve on this game swings wildly because of seemingly random combinations of variables on how the levels play. It's even worse when on the one level I played it just flashed the hirigana characters before the blocks, and expected you to identify them (as the romaji letters were shown on the keys), AND remember them (because there was nothing printed on the boxes to jump over), made worse because some of them were only shown for a fraction of a second before it flashed the next.\nI get that it's good to force you to try to identify them faster, but memory isn't my strongest point and remembering whole words is different to remembering multiple single characters.\nMaybe it does serve a roll, but I can't see how and I just find them frustrating.\n\nI've not come accoss a section that I haven't been able to get past though so it's not a big deal, and I still like the rest of the game for what it does.
