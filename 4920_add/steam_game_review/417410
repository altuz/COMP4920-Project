{"reviews": [{"review": "Northern Tale is an amazing game of time management. You play as a viking who has to beat some levels to defeat a witch and save your daughters. Some levels are very difficult and despite the fact the the game doesn't have Steam Achievements, it has 50 achievements inside the game. The music is great and I can spend hours and hours playing this.

It's a time management type game like \"My Kingdom for the Princess\" and very well done. It runs very well on my older PC and has cute music and nice looking graphics. \n\nAnd my favorite part...It has a relax mode so I can play without having a timer stress me out. There are two types of timed game play (normal and hard) if that's your thing, but I personally don't like timed games. \n\nThere is one bad point...If you have your window's display setting set to 125% or higher, the game is not smart enough to display properly. This is easily fixed by temporarily changing your window's display setting back to 100%. But if you don't, the game will not fit your screen. In windowed mode, the game will extend past the bottom of your screen and full screen will chop off both the right and bottom parts of the game. \n\nOverall, this is a fun little game and well worth 3 dollars.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1499532692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 203, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198030831426", "num_games_owned": 117}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "timestamp_updated": 1490398603, "recommendationid": "30714943", "timestamp_created": 1490398603}, {"review": "Fun sweet game.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1472692466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 679, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198093276843", "num_games_owned": 212}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 10, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487066", "timestamp_updated": 1455508679, "recommendationid": "21222730", "timestamp_created": 1455508679}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
