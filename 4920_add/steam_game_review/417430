{"reviews": [{"review": "Moto Racer 4, a release which seems to have completely slipped under my radar, recieving little to no fanfare even at the time of its release. I have played another game in this series, Moto Racer 2, and as such I'll be comparing my experience with this title to my previous experience in Moto Racer 2. \n\nTo begin, its very much an arcade style racer, die-hard racing simulator fans need not apply. However, i'd say that its very much in the spirit of the rest of the series, as MR2 had a distincly arcade style of gameplay. This arcade style of play is quite enjoyable actually and gives the game a very oldshool style of play. There are a few new additions to the gameplay in Moto Racer 4, the TURBO system, whereby a carefully timed press of the A button will give you a boost of speed at the starting line and also a boost of speed when executing a wheelie. As far as variety in the gameplay goes, you have standard races, time trials and other modes such as 'slalom' where you have to weave in and out of traffic, but still arrive at the finish line before time runs out, and an elemination mode where the racer in last place is eliminated every 30 seconds. You also have a variety of road and dirt tracks, utilising superbikes and dirtbikes respectively. This variety has been enough to keep me entertained so far, with both dirt and road tracks providing their own set of unique challenges and quirks. There are also various tricks to pull off when riding a dirtbike, the tricks must be executed by pushing a certain sequence of buttons, this is a welcome addition to the game as in MR2, tricks would occur at random and didn't really have any impact on the gameplay whatsoever.\n\nThe graphics are superb in my opinion, I'm not sure what another reviewer was talking about when he said that the graphics look dated. The game is bright with colour, but still easy on the eye. Coupled with the variety of environments this gives the game an increadibly varied colour palette, making for an absolutely stunning game to look at. In terms of graphics options you have the standard options as well as the ability to toggle bloom effects and post processing options.  However, graphics tweeking enthusiats may be sad to find no indepth Anti-Aliasing options, with there being only a simple toggle to switch AA on or off. \n\nThere's also a decent level of customisation in the game, firstly you're offered the choice of several unique racers, each with their own distinct motorcyle, emblem and colour schemes. You can however tweak both the colour schemes and emblems of the riders to your own liking. You can choose the colour scheme for the bike, the rider's outfit and even their helmet. Rather dissapointing is the lack of variety for the dirtbikes. By completing races in the main career mode, you will unlock upgrade points, allowing for you to upgrade the stats of your chosen rider's bike. You can alter stats such as handling, acceleration and the power of your Turbo boost. As mentioned, each rider gets their own unique bike, but only for the road stages. On the dirt stages, all racers will use the same model of dirtbike (custom colour schemes are still applied however). This is the only thing that bothers me about the bikes and cheapens the game somewhat. I do hope that in future we get a variety of dirtbikes to choose from. However, similar to MR2, each rider's bike has a unique set of starting stats and a unique upgrade limit. E.g certain riders will have a bike with really high speed, but low turbo boost potential.  Its interesting to see the devs incorporate this feature alongside the newer customisation feature to help each rider retain a sense of uniqueness. \n\nIn terms of multiplayer, there's both online and suprisingly enough local splitscreen multiplayer. I sadly haven't played too much of the online mode, so I'm unable to comment too much on whether or not the game's mulitplayer is still populated 8 months after its initial release. Splitscreen however works very much as you'd expect, hook up another controller to your PC and you and a friend can have some wacky fun times fooling around in single races. \n\nThe music is sadly somewhat forgettable but is fitting for the game, if that makes any sense? The dirtbike sections are accompanied typically with punk-rock style instrumentals and the superbike sections are accompanied with instrumental electronic tracks. None of them really seem to stick in my mind even though most of the tracks sound decent enough. Sadly, you can't switch music tracks in game from the pause menu (in the same style as MR2) as it seems certain music tracks are locked to particular race courses. For the best experience, put on the MR2 soundtrack or some Eurobeat and you're good to go. \n\nYou can play the game from a 1st person viewpoint, which to me is absolutely brilliant, as you could also do this in MR2. The bike detail on the 1st person view is also very good, with each bike featuring a working set of clocks, unlike in MR2 where the clocks were just a set of flat textures. \n\nA custom track creator would have been absolutely great here as an ingame track editor came on both the PC and Playstation versions of MR2. The creator could have made use of the steam workshop function too, possibly allowing for a larger sense of community surrounding the game. However, from what I believe was intended to be a budget title, that might be asking too much. \n\nFinally, the season pass is still not entirely worth it, with the entirity of the game's DLC coming to far below the \u00a319 currently being asked. Whilst the first DLC pack has been released, it simply consists of 2 race courses, 1 road, 1 dirt. In my opinion they're not worth the \u00a32.79 pricetag. If you intend on getting the season pass/Deluxe Editon, then please buy it on sale. Its not worth the \u00a340 you'll be paying otherwise. \n\nIn conclusion, this is a fun arcade racer from a long forgotten series that actually feels like a worthy entry to the series and not just a random bike racing game with 'Moto Racer' slapped on it. I'd highly recommend getting this if its on sale.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1502055427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1041, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198067637977", "num_games_owned": 135}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1498779857, "recommendationid": "33015232", "timestamp_created": 1498779857}, {"review": "Sure, the system requiring you to \"bet\" on yourself before the race starts sucks, sucks hard.
