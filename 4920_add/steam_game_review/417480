{"reviews": [{"review": "This game is not good. Boring stages, boring achievments, boring music, boring everything. The hit detection is really messed up..I can jump on an enemies head sometimes and be successful while other times I die. I've encountered so many glitches too I can't even count them. If you jump in an area that wasn't meant to be jumped in, then you get stuck and have to restart. I've gotten stuck in the goal as well because you move faster when you sword jump. I did a sword jump right before the goal a couple of times and got stuck in the wall. It's pretty much a mess. It feels more like a flash game or a game meant for phones. Kids may find this fun, but If you're an adult and enjoy platformers, stay away at all costs.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1453769698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 563, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561197986911919", "num_games_owned": 345}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505207", "timestamp_updated": 1453676338, "recommendationid": "20736602", "timestamp_created": 1453676338}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
