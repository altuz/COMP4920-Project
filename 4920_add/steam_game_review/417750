I realized early on in Left Alone, though, that there weren't any actual \"enemies\", so I was able to enjoy the spooky ambience without having a nervous breakdown. Just be aware before buying that this isn't survival horror; it's more \"Layers of Fear\" than \"SOMA\" or \"Amnesia\".\n\nI will say that there are a lot of things about Left Alone that could use some serious polishing:\n- The battery resource management is pretty pointless.\n- The outdoor portion of the map felt like it was just slapped together. Lots of generic tree textures and fog.\n- The puzzles would be more enjoyable with less backtracking.\n- I was surprised to discover the developers were from the UK, because the writing for the in-game text read like a bad localization at several points.\n- The audio effects were a little \"unsubtle\", if that makes sense. Kind of generic haunted house-y in parts.\n- The narrative in the discovered notes was pretty disjointed.\n\nThat being said, I found the end result charming despite its flaws! The developers seem earnest and I feel like they put a lot of work into the game. I'm looking forward to seeing what they put out next, now that they have some experience under their belt.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505711785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 151, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198025376705", "num_games_owned": 377}, "language": "english", "developer_response": "I appreciate you taking the time to write an honest review about your experience and I appreciate all of the points you have touched upon.
