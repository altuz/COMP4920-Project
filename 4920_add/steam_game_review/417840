You have to solve all of the puzzles in one room in order to access the next.  In each room is a variety of furniture and decorations, though the contents of each room doesn't change much.\n\nLike all point and click adventures, you have to manipulate your mouse precisely and accurately so that you click on the correct object.  Unlike most point and click adventures, this game does not tell you when you move the mouse over something significant.  This was the first sign to me that this was going to be a bad game -- you literally have to click all over the room to grab something that makes no sense to grab -- like in the first room, the stick leaning against the shelves.  Why?\n\nUltimately, the lack of the pointer highlighting an object (or however else the game would let you know you're looking at something significant) leads to a prolonged experience.  And that's important with this game because it is EXTREMELY short.\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, your \"movement\" between areas in each room is EXTREMELY slow.  This was another bad sign when I started playing -- slow movement making up for a lack of content.\n\nOther criticisms -- there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason why you would perform some actions or why you would want to explore one part of the room but be completely unable to explore another.  The objects that you pick up are a little obscure in their identity as well -- in one room I picked up am object that looked to me to be like a piece of undeveloped or developed film.  This made no sense because the game obviously takes place in kind of medieval times.  Unlike most point and click adventures, this game doesn't tell you what the object is when you pick it up, doesn't tell you what it is when you rest the pointer over it, and you can't right click on an item to have a closer look.  It was only with a combination of random clicks that I realized the piece of film wasn't that -- it was a box of nails.  That's a pretty big problem when you can't figure out what something is unless you have a purely random experience.\n\nMany areas of each room make no sense that you would want to explore -- in the tutorial room, the second piece of what you are looking for is behind one of the lanterns on the wall.  Of course it is!  What rational person wouldn't look behind a lantern mounted on a wall?!\n\nIn the end, this game was reduced to random, frustrating clicks.  There isn't a storyline that I can find, other than somehow you've gotten yourself trapped in a castle whose builder apparently had no sense of proportion, direction, function, or decor.  Fung Shui has no meaning in this game.  It's like a digitized version of the famous Winchester House, where the owner built stairways that didn't go anywhere and doors that opened to brick walls.  I realized this finally when I had to set the dials on a lock that opened a window -- and then the window opened to another room.  Made sense.\n\nTruly, I'm writing this review so that, when you look back on your life when you are in your elder years -- you don't dread wasting two hours of it on one of the sh*ttiest games on Steam.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1459021270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 107, "num_reviews": 40, "steamid": "76561197984269843", "num_games_owned": 670}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515706", "timestamp_updated": 1459016880, "recommendationid": "22068999", "timestamp_created": 1459016880}, {"review": "the only way i can destribe the game IS A VERY VERY BAD phone app i can just delete and its nothing like the trailer\nplease buy a better game its not worth the money and space on your laptop!!!!!!!!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1459329360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 35, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561198164706315", "num_games_owned": 181}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492540", "timestamp_updated": 1459366789, "recommendationid": "22148165", "timestamp_created": 1459366789}, {"review": "Wish I'd read the reviews before buying.
