Call it a semi-spoiler. With that said, those with intentions of playing the game without being spoiled, please look elsewhere.[/b]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI used to have a lot of friends back in high school. And there was this one person with whom I never spoke too much. After graduation, she left for the US. We were able to get in contact with each other through social media, though. I think I struck a conversation with her first, and that's when our friendship started to blossom.\n\nA few days in, we start to talk about almost everything, being all nice to each other and stuff. We speak about what school was like. Just sharing memories.\n\nA few weeks in, mid-2012, and we talk to each other non-stop. We tend to stay up late for each other. Sometimes, we'd ask each other stupid questions just to keep the conversation going, because it was fun.\n\nA few months in, end of 2012 to early 2013, and we have practically found solace in each other, and talk to get away from things. We share info on our problems. We complain to each other. We debate on things. And there are many times when she felt like she wanted to come back here to meet everyone again. This was the closest I've been with a person online.\n\nIt's about mid-2014, and we've run out of things to talk about. She talks about how she doesn't feel too alone anymore. and how she's making new friends now and then. And I say that I'm really happy for her. She sells cupcakes, and goes out with her friends once a while.\n\nIt's 2015 ... I send her a sort of petition to sign, but it was just a desperate attempt to try to resuscitate our excessively engaging conversations again. It didn't work, ended up talking about college again. It felt like talking to her the first time all over again.\n\n2017... and counting ... I haven't spoken to her since then ... and it doesn't feel like we're friends anymore.\n\nAlthough I am a stranger to the nostalgic visualization that the game represents to those who are familiar with [i]AOL Instant Messaging[/i] (as I have clearly never used it), [i]Emily is Away[/i] nails this emotional aspect of my life so hard, it made me think of the times when I actually had a lot of fun talking to my friend. The fact that I can't have that back again makes it all the more hurtful. And all the more reason to give it a try, so you could appreciate what you had while it lasted. \n\nThis game, in short, is a reminder that all good things will always come to an end. And I feel fucking horrible about it.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1487744212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 48, "num_reviews": 45, "steamid": "76561198018243990", "num_games_owned": 451}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532931", "timestamp_updated": 1487720956, "recommendationid": "30088864", "timestamp_created": 1487718265}, {"review": "I feel empty inside :(\n\nGoodbye.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1485044608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 40, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198080370666", "num_games_owned": 503}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514002", "timestamp_updated": 1485196808, "recommendationid": "29447734", "timestamp_created": 1485196808}, {"review": "The game is about you having a crush on a girl from your high school and chatting with her.\n\nThe game puts you in 3 years of the character's life where he chats with his crush Emily.\n\nIt's kind of fun. You say something, then she replies, then you have to reply and it goes on.\nEach time you have to reply, you will have three choices of what to say. So you have a few options and it won't be like watching a premade tv show.\n\nPicking what to say is not all you have to do. You have to type it too. Well, not quite by yourself. There is a premade sentence for each choice. When you start hitting your keyboard buttons and try to type something, the letters began to be placed one by one. So you can either try to guess what your reply choice will say and try to type that, or simply just spam one button until the sentence is complete. Whichever type you are.\n\nIt's kinda fun but also saddening and stuff. Just like a real crush. If you don't want to go through the pain of having a crush on someone, don't play this. If you do want to, then play it. It only took me 0.9 hours to finish it (I started button spamming in the second half of the game). 0.9 hours isn't very much so you won't lose anything. Specially since it's free to play.\n\nIf you're a guy, you can play this. If you're a girl, I don't see the point. If you're a lesbian girl, yeah play and have fun.\nIf you're a shemale, well then I'll be confused to advise whether to play or not so it's up to you. Heheh, just kidding.\n\n\nI'd give the game 7/10 I think. Made me relive some bad memories of when I had a crush on a girl and f**k did that hurt!\n\n\nWARNING: SPOILER ahead. If you want to play the game, STOP READING NOW!!! If no, you're not interested, then scroll down and read the spoiler.

Nope, as Emily does one thing very well: Making you want to experience every dialogue option to see the answers and different small talks you'll get in response.\n\n[b]It does fail as a story as it has a start and (an EXCELLENT) build up.... but SEVERELY lacks as an end. It just... ends. Yes, it's impressive how you get to CARE about characters that don't exist and most: do not even talk (game's just a chat window, literally).[/b]\n\nBut none of it goes fucking anywhere!\n\nApparently there are 2 endings: Mine was [spoiler] Emily ends up going back to the boyfriend she broke up with 2 chapters or so ago. A boyfriend that had one hell of a temper and didn't hit her because her guardian angel was amazing! Both you and Emily end up talking occasionally after high school as the story happens during college and [/spoiler]the tension between you and Emily is not only ridiculously clich\u00e9 but the fact that by the end it's CRIMINALLY linear completely kills the atmosphere of a tense story I was so excited for. Until the last chapter I was loving the game, and then... shit starts getting talked about and I pick an option, as my character DELETES MY DIALOGUE and WRITES A NEW, LAME AND 1-WORDED DIALOGUE like \"Goodbye\", \"I dunno\".\n\n[b]The chance of a real \"relationship\" with this virtual character/setting the mood for a great emotional story is completely skull fucked by this as every choice I make is quickly deleted and replaced with something that is answered for the sake of the ending being \"always bad\". All stories can end well.[/b]\n\nNot this one! \n\nAny questions of the story, just ask me, but overall I thought the ending (while realistic (then again, other realistic endings could've happened)) was rushed and literally went nowhere. Just a story of a [spoiler] missed chance at love that generated a weird relation between 2 friends of the opposite sex that ended their friendship by the end of college[/spoiler]\n\nAnd as I do not see my choices mattering at all to the course of the story, I cannot even care for the second ending as I also don't see it being any conclusive.\n\n[h1] Other Stuff and Overall [/h1]~\n\nA good game? Yes. Totally worth a playthrough and an achievement run as I got it 100% in like 40 minutes. The game itself can be completed in 25-30 minutes. It's charming, interesting and quite well done.\n\n[b]It just lacks more branching paths that would allow for a good ending that cannot happen because sometimes your choices are replaced by others totally different (Didn't people complain about that in Fallout 4? This did even worse and get's nearly praised its ass off!), ending in a forced note that left a very sour taste in my mouth[/b] that I had to wash with proper dialogue options in an RPG.\n\nIt's a free-to-play 60 Mb game. Definately worth a run. I sincerely hope for a sequel or a similar game but that allows for your choices to matter instead of this.\n\n[h1]A rock solid 7/10.
