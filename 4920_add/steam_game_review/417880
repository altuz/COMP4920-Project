{"reviews": [{"review": "It is nice, pretty high quality game, with interesting story that I have yet to fully experience.\n\nSO why do I even write the review? \n\n*EDIT*\n\nThere is one thing you need to know! The game is bit confusig on how and when it saves. It should save after every interaction with the orb, but it seems like that is not working every time \n\nInitially I got put off after loosing 45 minutes of progress. Then I contacted Chinise room and they provided me with this info\n\n\"Because some players had an issue with this we implemented a manual save on PC \u2013 interact with the You are Here maps around the world to do this.\"\n\nTHIS IS IMPORANT info! So go around the world and find the maps to save the game. \n\nSince this seems to solve my only issue, there is nothing standing in my way to recommend this cause I like it a lot =D", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505603113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 158, "num_reviews": 77, "steamid": "76561197979540745", "num_games_owned": 204}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514916", "timestamp_updated": 1505473676, "recommendationid": "34891627", "timestamp_created": 1505170535}, {"review": "Everybody's Gone to the Rapture is something special.
