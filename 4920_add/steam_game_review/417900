{"reviews": [{"review": "One of the most boring games I have played in recent time.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\n+ graphics are okay\n+ music is alright\n+ controls work fine, fluent\n\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\n- the game is flat out boring, there isnt anything exciting about climbing this tower\n- you gain no abilities or anything, this is just jumping up\n\n- the game tries to add variation and throws a couple of new obsticles here and there at you, but dodging a snail with jumping isnt any different from jumping over another insect.....\n\n- its basically only a race against time and you add time by collecting fruit....time is the only challenge here, Id much rather have a more difficult tower to climb\n\n- there is no depth....no unlockables, there is nothing but mindlessly jumping up\n\n- the price is outrageous compared to other games, you definitely can get much better and complex games than this one\n\n\nI wouldnt recommend this to anybody. This game comes off as being a 1\u20ac mobile game. Way too simple and super overpriced.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1498678825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 94, "num_reviews": 188, "steamid": "76561198001794713", "num_games_owned": 2045}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503083", "timestamp_updated": 1498311208, "recommendationid": "32726912", "timestamp_created": 1498311208}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
