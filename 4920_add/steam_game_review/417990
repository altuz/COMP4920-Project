{"reviews": [{"review": "First off, I wanted to say that I got this game for free on my Android phone and tablet. I'd heard about it  before it was launched and was interested but, in my busy life, forgot about it until a few days ago when it was recommended to me when opening the GooglePlay store. I didn't bother to read the reviews or anything, I just picked it up and started reading and playing.\n\nI finished the story on my tablet and I thoroughly enjoyed it. So much so that I would purchase it on Steam to benefit its creator and encourage him to continue creating more games like this. \n\nI opened my Steam Store and saw a bunch of bad reviews even though Major\\minor is reviewed as \u201cVery Positive\u201d. Frankly, I find a lot of the bad reviews just plain puzzling and allow me to explain why. I originally played this on the tablet and phone version. It doesn't have the sound, the ability to edit your name, you can't even make calls. I had to laugh a little when I read people complaining about the music. I didn't have sound at all and I still found this story to be great and immersive. The characters were believable in the sense that you may not like them or agree with them entirely but still favor them in some way. There is a sense of depth there. Now, I'm not saying this was the best story I've read, but it certainly wasn't bad! You don't have to be a furry to enjoy this story but one thing that I'll say as a furry to other furries.....have you read some of the -really- bad furry novels out there?! LOL! But I guess it's just a difference in tastes, as art always is. \n\nI wouldn't put this up on Kyell Gold's level of literature but it reminded me of the grittier moments in Kyell's Volle (or Prisoner's Release) series. Still, this was a fantastic read and  look forward to playing through again to see some of the many outcomes and, of course, have fun experiencing the full version of the game for the first time too.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505428217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 740, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198056517699", "num_games_owned": 42}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504038", "timestamp_updated": 1505268891, "recommendationid": "34911858", "timestamp_created": 1505268891}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 206, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 253, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
