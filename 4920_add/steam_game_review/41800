Maybe 3 days per ship for an artist and with modding I've added my own custom weapons super easily.  Others have even designed their own ships with custom destructions and all that proving how easy it is to make new content for this game, and yet the DLC costs as if it was difficult.  1/3rd or more the price of the actual game.  The fact is however, this game is very, very boring.  You spend a lot more time building ship setups, than ou do actual playing.  Its just a spreadsheet type game basically.  The battle can be decided without ever stepping foot on the battle grid, just run the calculations and thats it.  This game just gives you a way to view it as if its a real battle."}, {"votes_down": 10, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502392013, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481505", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "34153013", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020320500", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1502391856, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 179100}, "timestamp_updated": 1502392013, "received_for_free": false, "review": "None of this stuff works.
