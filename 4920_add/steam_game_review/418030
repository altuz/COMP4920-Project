It has good graphics, but is still playable on affordable PCs (unline Rust and Rising World, at some point the patch made the requirements at least double than the original game) and it has a really nice crafting and building system. The modular building is not very aesthetically pleasing, but practical and gives a feeling of customizing your game. \n\nWhy, then, did I review it negatively? Subsitence was made to be hard. It is not hard. It is impossible. You always run out of ammo as you totally rely on the loot crates, so, on luck. Even the bow has no affordable mass ammo, because the feathers you need for the arrows are also a matter of luck. Either you get them hrough lootcrates (see above), or you have a chicken farm. To have a chicken farm, you need to catch a chicken. The chickens have nearly infinite stamina and run just as fast as you, so you will either be exhausted or run into a predator before even coming close to them. Even if you manage to catch a chicken, you can't build the farm, because you need sinews. Sinews can only be aquired through killing mountain lions, which are by far the most dangerous adversary in the game: they run faster than you, have a shite ton of health points and a base attack to one hit an unarmed player. \n\nSo, you can go hunting every 4-5 days because you will need that time to get enough ammo. Why do you need so much ammo? Because when you hit a wolf in the head twice, it does not die, it chases you till your fecking end, starts fidgeting so you can't hit it any more and will take anoter 2-3 bullets. Like this, I had a wolf covered in bleeding wounds patrolling around my base. Killing players make animals level, so this fecking wolf has become immortal! NINE, 9 GOD DAMN BULLETS to the head and it looked at me like \"what if I told you I am Chuck Norris?\". \nBut it's not just about the animals and the insanely luck-based system of loot crates \u2013 anyone else having enough nails to replace the wood of your house, but no damn cloth AT ALL? The hunters, NPC wild humans who shoot at sight and reproduce all over the map as if they were fecking rabbits, never encounter ammo problems, do cooperate and occupy all the ponds and lakes so that you can't even water your shitty plants. Talking about farming: Why on earth can't you extract cotton seed? Do you think it is already way too easy to get cloth, one of the most important resources ever?

You're not sure what to do or how to do stuff so you try to find some crates and you walk walk walk without doing much. Once you have enough material to start your base you realise it's nowhere near enough so you go out there again to find more crates.\n\n- the mid game: is where things gets interesting. You're starting to understand the mechanics. Ressources are not a problem anymore, you know how to get them and efficiently. Your base is settle and you're beggenning to upgrade it. The hunters have spawned and you get some interesting action going back and forth with them.\n\n-Late game: is when you've constructed everything and you've pretty much done everything. At this point you're pretty much free to do anything and are waiting for new content.\n\nOverall my experiene with this game is pretty good. If you're willing to give 2 to 4 hours in the early games to understand the game the mid game will feels incredible.\nThis game have a lots of potential.

The visuals, mechanics, and overall is a very stable game. I would highly recommend this game for people who want to play rust or dayz but without players. Now I have had some pros and some cons about this game. But in no way reflect the way I feel about this game.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing visuals\n\n- Building aspect is great\n\n- The crafting system is overall stable\n\n- The map is different, meaning you have hills, a mountain, lakes, and valleys so not always the same when walking to a different place on the map.\n\n- The looting systems is pretty good, meaning it doesn't give you to much stuff or to little stuff.\n\n\n\nCons:\n- Gunplay is eh, its ok but could be better\n\n- 1 hunter is ok to deal with, 2-3 hunters are really hard to deal with. Which makes sense but just something to consider looking at.\n\n- Also the minute the hunters enter your world, they have guns. I mean pistols, then little bit later shotgun, the a little bit later, they have rifles. Plus, most of the time they are dead accurate which makes sense but it seems like a disadvantage to you because you don't have as much ammo or the fact they run and hide behind every rock or tree which is amazing for AI but can get annoying for the player at times. Also ammo, they have F*ck tons of ammo, like where the F*ck are they getting all this ammo.\n\n- Also the loot you get from hunters is pretty bad, like when looking at it overall. It would be more effective for me to put my bullets into a animal and get meat out of it then put the bullets in a hunter and get some terrible stuff, the only good thing is the weapon parts which are required for the .44 magnum.\n\n- Also I don't exactly get the idea of everytime the animals kill you they level up. I feel that the system would be better that everytime you level up then the animals gain more health to match your level or something like that. ( Just a suggestion )\n\n- Also its survival so makes sense to be grindy but being able to reap more rewards would be nice, like for example trees can give you on average 3-4 logs. These then give you one plank, or you can craft it to one stick. The profit from using like 10 seconds to get logs from a tree should be worth the time to grind to get the wood.\n\n- Also most of the time is spent walking from one place to another or if you die then sometimes you will spawn like half way across the map and you have 5 minutes to get to the place you died. In relation to this con, the map is overall not the biggest which makes sense since its a new game and the creator would rather make the gameplay better than the map, but the map is overall small and the only reason it seems big is because you walk everywhere.\n\nSo those are overall just my little ticks about the game but overall the game is amazing and its even more amazing that the creator is one guy and works a full time job! Also the only reason why the con list is bigger is because I wasnted to add my input on how to impove the game, and no way reflects the game being bad in anyway, because simply the game isn't bad, all it needs is some tweaks here and there and it would be even better than it already is. So I would love to say that job well done on this game and I can't wait to see where it goes! (P.S. Any negative reviews are from people who just don't understand the mechanics of the game or don't like the grindyness of it. So its better to just take those with a grain of salt.)\n\nAlso here is some things I would love to see!\n\n- Overall some of the gameplay mechanics changed or reconsidered like the ones I listed above.\n\n- Map size increased and maybe a abandoned town/city. With that maybe adding a bike, or motercycle.\n\n- More things to craft, overall many things to craft already just would like to see more things, like different guns or different things to use the power in my house.\n\n- Anything else you can think of!

Single player only (I think) it is a challenge, beautiful to look at and best of all, NO SQUEAKERS!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506228269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 469, "playtime_forever": 1907, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561197970723934", "num_games_owned": 82}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1505946710, "recommendationid": "35093168", "timestamp_created": 1505946710}, {"review": "I just got this game and i am already hooked completely.\nMost of the complaints i see people make of this game is \"Its impossable, and you have to reply on loot crates to much\"\n1. The game is not impossable because on my first world i created and the only one i have made, I have been able to make a nice base get pretty geared up so for someone who is completely new to the game i have survived quite well. I am also playing on normal with hunters and all that enabled.\n2. However, i do think you have to reply on loot crates to much... so i was hopeing the sole developer will see this idea, I was think maybe you could add 2-4 more animals in the game like deer and elk ect... Also i wish their where fruit trees and bushes with berry that would be a great update in my opinion, but if u make these changes decrease the amount of food that spawns in loot crates.\n\nI think this game is amazing in its current state, I would even compair it to rust in many ways, and lastly this game is only in aplha meaning this game will hopefully recieve alot of attention and get alot more updates to keep ppl who have the game happy.
