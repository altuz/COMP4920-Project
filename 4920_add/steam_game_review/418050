{"reviews": [{"review": "This game looked cool from the screenshots. Broken camera, terrible physics. Absolutely horrible music. The 3D models are generic and the gameplay has no point. It also claims in the steam icon to be 'the world's most cpu dependent game'. Completely untrue and irrelevant. This is shovelware. It's just kind of upsetting that there are actually enough 'positive' ratings to say that it isn't terrible.\n\nWhen you first start up the game you have two options. >Start game, and > . The second option pops up a dialog that says 'missing executable.' The first brings up the window \"Fall Setting Dialog\" that has very broken english. \"Self Collapse(May become the cause that very slow)\" and \"keep the fps forcibly(May become the cause that looks poor)\". The music in the main title sequence sounds like it came straight out of a 90's romantic sitcom. When you start playing one of the three game modes, you jump and fall down an endless tunnel, occasionally hitting things. The controls only give you some small command over your character, but not enough to be meaningful.\n\nTerrible game.

It has a sort of charm in it's lack of graphical polish which only highlights the focus on gameplay. Overall i believe this game to be very fun to play but even if you don't like the game itself it is a great display of physics and destructible terrain. It also tests the limits of your PC after a while of progressing through.The only flaw i can see is the sound design. It is a bit rudimentary but not a huge con. Something that isn't explained too well are the controls. I would suggest just a small tutorial or at least a mode in which controls are displayed or even just a screen with controls.

I'm not sure how else to classify it. It's got very poor quality graphics, and yet it somehow has charm. You control your ragdoll by using WASD and the right mouse button for the jetpack and jet boots. Currently, there are three game modes. None of these are explained in game, so I'll explain them now from what I have gathered. Time is a game mode where you try move from one level to the next as quickly as possible. Score is the same as time, except you get score for killing enemies, and the last Depth, is similar to an endless runner game like temple run. You have to go as far as possible as fast as possible. Now that I have summarized the basics, I'll now move into pros and cons.\n\nPro:\n-Odd graphical style that has charm\n-Satisfying physics. It's always fun to plow through a building and turn around and see the hole I left.\n-Good animation on the giants.\n\nCons:\n-Poor graphics that are most likely assets of some sort.*\n-The game literally can't handle its own physics. If you turn the graphics up to super fine and set off a shockwave, it will crash. Nukes crash the game regardless of the graphics.\n-Alt-Tabbing will crash the game\n-Your character resets his animation every time you shoot while flying or falling. \n-Oh God, the music. Please have mercy on my ears.\n-The monster noises and design are appalling.\n-No explanation of ANYTHING\n\n*I know I just praised the graphics, but it charm doesn't excuse garbage because it isn't a stylistic choice, it's just barebones. This is likely due to the developer's shortcomings.\n\nTL/DR: Even though the pros I listed are outnumbered by the cons, it's still FUN. Fun, in my opinion, is the most important part of any video game. Although it has its flaws, I would definitely recommend this game.\n\n\n\n\nAnd no, this is not memes.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1485376020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198045913387", "num_games_owned": 240}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494052", "timestamp_updated": 1450492979, "recommendationid": "19773682", "timestamp_created": 1450492979}, {"review": "Great indy Gem.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1452914499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 59, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561197979579510", "num_games_owned": 576}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472637", "timestamp_updated": 1452913732, "recommendationid": "20552370", "timestamp_created": 1452913732}, {"review": "i wasn't supposed to be on drugs until the weekend", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1450415310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7, "num_reviews": 44, "steamid": "76561197968877572", "num_games_owned": 649}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 43, "votes_funny": 13, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439339", "timestamp_updated": 1450415326, "recommendationid": "19758102", "timestamp_created": 1450415326}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 8, "total_reviews": 8, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
