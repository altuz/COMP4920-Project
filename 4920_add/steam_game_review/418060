The issue is with the way you redefined the controls in the input options. You can easily solve it by redefining the controls in a way that avoids duplicate controls. Using only the keyboard would also solve the issue. To get the controls to their default state use the Reset Game option from the Options menu within the game. More details can also be found in the Discussions forum from the game's community.
