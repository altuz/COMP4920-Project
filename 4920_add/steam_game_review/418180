{"reviews": [{"review": "10/10\n\nGame doesn't feel fun until you get your hands on Frigate I. Until then, the game is pretty hard to adapt. Tutorial doesn't explain everything and sea monsters are pain to deal with. Enemy ships/Allied ships attacking me while I'm boarding on enemy ship is also extremely unfair. It's cool that what's happening outside your boarding fight is actually real time, but when that interferes with you capturing enemy ship, it SUCKS. \n\nHowever, once you get your Frigate I (trophy or not), you are open to pretty much anything you want to do. You are tanky enough to take some damage, you have enough firepower to deal with stronger ships than you, and you have maneuverability to avoid enemy fires/spells. \n\nWarning though. I got my first Frigate I (captured ship) when I spent 8 hours into this game. Some quests are hard to proceed with your low level ships and the game doesn't even explain if you are on low level ship or doing low level quest. Once you get your Frigate I, time does fly really fast. I'm now on Battleship I (captured) and the game is just so fun. \n\nIf this game can become open world MMORPG with one server (and no fast traveling), this will be THE best pirate game to play in the world.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505937271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1910, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561197977795368", "num_games_owned": 305}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516938", "timestamp_updated": 1505338174, "recommendationid": "34927535", "timestamp_created": 1505338174}, {"review": "Pretty good game, fun, enjoyable and one hell of a blast.
