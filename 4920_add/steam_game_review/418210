{"reviews": [{"review": "This is amazing.  Truly a metals game! \\m/  Getting Kerry King or Dime's guitar really sold me on it and having female characters to show that chicks can shred too. Really cool dude.  It's a lot like Isaac but it has enough unique features and qualities to make it interesting.  The theme is really unique in video games there are only a handful of truly metal themed games.  It's not perfect by a longshot but it is well worth even full price.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1492882004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 93, "num_reviews": 23, "steamid": "76561198056281627", "num_games_owned": 809}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508004", "timestamp_updated": 1492836876, "recommendationid": "31289040", "timestamp_created": 1492836586}, {"review": "Made me feel so metal that I started to p!ss mercury.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1493001476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 859, "num_reviews": 37, "steamid": "76561198000919706", "num_games_owned": 748}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506250", "timestamp_updated": 1492704020, "recommendationid": "31258342", "timestamp_created": 1492704020}, {"review": "like Binding of Isaac, but good and with metal.\n\nPs.
