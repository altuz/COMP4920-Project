This game worth it. I agree with masteratt, he argues quiet well. But I disagree in some regards.\n\nI played Commandos and Desperados, all of Commandos games, but not all of Desperados.\n\nI can say that this game is a mix, and is getting closer to first Desperados. Some features are from Commandos (2), like all units can move dead bodies, others are from Desperados, like the Shadow Mode. \nThe graphics are better in Commandos, but this game choose the Desperados graphics, which have more light and colours. This is a thing of taste. But Commandos 2 burka missions are masterpieces. Though the game design levels and detail are also impresive, as said, is a thing of taste.\n\nThere are multiple solutions for a level situation and this is great. I opted for stealth kills instead of using all the features (I am old fashioned Commandos fan, what you expect >). While you can ~cheat~ in C and D by overusing the pistols if you want to finish fast, this game has reduced the ammount of ammunition to 3. BEST IDEEA EVER, but was better with 5.\nI don'''t use guns neither in Desperados neither in Commandos they ruin the fun.\nThe best sniper is still Doc MCCoy. Commandos Sniper, a great character but not so efective in game, and Takuma (which is recomended by the game hints to be used, is useless and don t have suficient gas bombs to throw a party 1-2 for level) his abillities don t help to much in game, his pet can be easily replaced, but you can use it also, to fell his presence. He is the best at game dialogue, he is a strong formed character with his broken leg, presentation and spech,  Doc MC Coy has a blind instead. Finally, Takuma fits in the game but is low used ingame.\n\nOur green beret and marine are still great because are split in 3, Hayato, Yuki and Mugen (don t forget to throw his ~cigarettes~), in Desperados splitted between Copper, Sanchez and Yung. They are great characters and have multiple usess.\n\nAiko is a great spy and has great abilities. She is a great addition to the game and 100% usable and not cheesy like some say. She could improve her abillities, like changing her first ability, which is pretty useless.\n\nI would loved a pet in the game to move items from another.\n\nOverall Mugen and his allies will break your heart with their determination, even if the graphics are Desperados related and even if there are 3 enemies classes and no intermediate enemies, like in others games (some panicking faster, some over watchers, some easy to take cakes).\n\nWhile I wait for an add-on, I still hope this just remains a masterpiece like the first Commandos and Desperados!!!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505558850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1880, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198040581733", "num_games_owned": 102}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1506368233, "recommendationid": "35209299", "timestamp_created": 1506368233}, {"review": "Amazing game...

Don't get me wrong, RNG has it's place, but this game is better for avoiding it.  There will be times when you're stuck on a part in the game, but because it's all set in stone, it never feels overwhelming.  Whenever you fail at something, you won't be mad at the game for screwing you over by chance.  You'll instead think of ways to improve your current tactic, or perhaps try a different tactic.  The game acts almost as a puzzle that must be solved.\n\nCon: The controls for the camera are pretty awful.  Not a whole lot to elaborate on here, but even after nearly 20 hours of play (not done with the game quite yet), the camera controls still don't feel completely natural to me like they would in most other games.  I've gotten used to them, but I still fumble with it at times.\n\nPeople that enjoy a slow, methodical game that requires lots of planning and those that have a tolerance for having to retry things multiple times will enjoy this game.  People looking for a more fast paced type of gameplay with a lot of quick action and quick progress should look for a different game.  This game absolutely does require that you be patient with it.  Speed runs are possible, but those come only after having having beaten the levels before and using that experience to build upon and refine the tactics you've established to near perfection.\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506705584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 937, "playtime_forever": 1354, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561197989612098", "num_games_owned": 253}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "timestamp_updated": 1506480888, "recommendationid": "35234334", "timestamp_created": 1506480888}, {"review": "\u5f88\u4e45\u4ee5\u524d\u6709\u4e00\u6b3e\u53eb\u505a\u300a\u4fa0\u76d7\u7f57\u5bbe\u6c49\uff1a\u820d\u4f0d\u5fb7\u4f20\u5947\u300b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u578b\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u5927\u5bb6\u73a9\u8fc7\u6ca1\u6709\uff0c\u5076\u8bf4\u7684\u5f88\u4e45\u4ee5\u524d\uff0c\u662f\u5927\u698210\u591a\u5e74\u524d\u4e86\uff01\uff01\u8fd9\u753b\u9762\uff0c\u8fd9\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9UI\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u673a\u5236\u3002\u3002\u3002\u4e0d\u8981\u8ddf\u6211\u8bf4\u300a\u76df\u519b\u6562\u6b7b\u961f\u300b\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u7b80\u76f4\u5c31\u662f\u5f53\u5e74\u300a\u4fa0\u76d7\u7f57\u5bbe\u6c49\u300b\u7684\u91cd\u7f6e\u7248\u672c\uff01\uff01\n\n\u300aRobin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood\u300b i only want say this name again, it is about 10years ago......", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1491837856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1929, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198243360980", "num_games_owned": 17}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1504687553, "recommendationid": "34771775", "timestamp_created": 1504687553}, {"review": "Overwhelmingly positive is an understatement", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1497314627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 123, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198170658678", "num_games_owned": 53}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499588", "timestamp_updated": 1505504940, "recommendationid": "34979936", "timestamp_created": 1505504940}, {"review": "I don't usually write reviews but I just finished this game last night and was thoroughly impressed by this stealth game.

In this sense, it's more akin to a puzzle game than anything and even playing on the easiest settings will provide a challenging experience. \n\nDying and reloading your save is part of the experience and a timer even warns you when you spend too much time playing without saving. But the game also maintains a very high level of polish across all 13 levels and forces you to find new character combinations to solve challenges.\n\nThe only gameplay flaw I can find is that the \"Shadow mode\" that allows you to stack character actions simultaneously is poorly explained and feels clunky when playing with a controller.
