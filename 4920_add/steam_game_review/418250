{"reviews": [{"review": "This is an excellent little title!  It's light on the Colony Management piece for a Space 4X, but the combat is extraordinary and meshes well with both the research and ship design pieces of the combat to come up with a unique feel for combat.  This game also really gets down the EPIC feeling of empires spending entire human generations at war with one another--the time scale is done just right and nothing happens too quickly.\n\nWhat is most different about this game is the research system.  The emphasis on Fundamental and Applied science as a path to unlocking technologies will be fun surprise to anybody who's not already familiar with Space Empires 4 (I think), which pioneered this approach.  That research system gets a little cumbersome in the later game, but is still a welcome change from the \"Research Mega Blasters / Then research Ultra Blasters\" pattern most of us know from the days of Civ I.\n\nWhat really sets the research system apart is how the introduction of new technologies and components can radically change the way battles should be fought.  A fleet full of carriers with lots of fighters can go rampaging through star system after star system, until the enemy obtains and deploys MIRV technology to shred those fighters in a hurry.  The game also allows you to build highly customized ships (e.g., an anti-fighter killer MIRV missile boat) for almost any occasion.\n\nIt's those two things, rather than the research system itself, that truly sets the game apart.  It doesn't have nearly the complexity, nor quite the immersion factor of Distant Worlds: Universe but this is a great little game.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1498244520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4987, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198064749920", "num_games_owned": 77}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512222", "timestamp_updated": 1504908014, "recommendationid": "34823981", "timestamp_created": 1504908014}, {"review": "At first I wasnt sure, I saw mixed reviews and waited for a sale.\n\nWhen I finally fired it up first impressions looked too rough to be a good game. There were bugs with the settings to set up the screen resolution and the in game text looked bad, but I switched to beta and got 1080p working and found it not only worked OK once you got it going. it also has a real depth of rewarding gameplay.\n\nFirst impressions are deceivng as are the graphics and resolution issues with the game. There is a lot of fun tucked away in this game and if you like Space Empires or Stars! then you will like Polaris. Most of the negative reviews come from players who dont understand the joys of emergent gameplay which come from cargo micro or value 3D graphics above gameplay. A few were exasperated by bugs, perhaps from an earlier stage of development. I am just saying there is something to like in the game, its not the kool aid talking.\n\nThere are still quite a few bugs around but its being worked on and devs are active in Steam discussions BB. So I recommend it as worth the money, at sale time, if you like old school galactic 4x with cargo and fuel and resources and stuff.

Tactical combat combat is fun & interesting.  Planet management forces tough choices on the player - science, industry, or agriculture?  But these good points do not make up for the negatives.\n1.  Ship design is a game of fitting rectangles into irregular holes.  Btw you are not allowed to rotate any of the rectangles even though it would make sense.  Your scientist are too dumb to figure out how to make a 6x4 shape into a 4x6 shape.  I found this part of the game frustrating and tedious, even so that eventually grew to hate redesigning my ships for new technology.\n2.  Technology - Your scientists will spend decades researching a hi-tech item that all too often turns out to be inferior to the lo-tech item you researched a century ago.  Descriptions of techs often don't have any useful information about what the tech actually DOES.\n3.  No rally points?  How could the designers overlook this?  If there are rally points, it wasn't mentioned in the manual or the tutorial.\n4.  Immersion,  The tactical combat could use some better sound and graphic effects.

While there are some nice points to the game ,like I love watching the ships on the main screen moving in space and the unique approach to research, yet there are some very bad presentations for my taste.  Ship building should NOT be a tetris puzzle, I find that part very silly and speaking of ships there is no real viable approach to winning other than building up a ton of fleets and just conquering.
