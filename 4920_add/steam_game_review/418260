{"reviews": [{"review": "I took a quick look at Ghost Machine`s latest game Gumball Drift, and i did enjoy this very much. Table top games makes for a fun experience in VR. I still feel the game needs more objectives. maybe this will come in a future update.\nHere is my video : \n\nhttps://youtu.be/3cpHInZw_Zg", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1459874229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 39, "num_reviews": 25, "steamid": "76561197971570389", "num_games_owned": 295}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 8, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509170", "timestamp_updated": 1459879865, "recommendationid": "22256609", "timestamp_created": 1459879865}, {"review": "This looked so good on the store page. But it was disapointing on many fronts. The concept is great, somewhere between micro machines and having one of those electric toy race tracks. The VR perspective looking down on toy like race cars you control works really well. There is of course no reason it needs to be VR exclusive, the camera could easily be bound to the right analog stick allowing non-VR onwers to join in. It's all down hill from there too.  \n\nI loaded it up and went straight into options, where sound was defaulted to off and virtually impossible to adjust because attmepting to adjust the volume sliders moves you to next option in the menu. I later found out the volume sliders only affect the main menu and even with sound off the the music at the start of the race will blow out your ear drums. \n\nI bought it primarily because it's one of the few Vive enabled games listed to have multiplayer. So talking to a friend in teamspeak we loaded up the game, and clicked online. Immediately we were taken into a race track. First thing we noticed was dispite the game not using the vive controllers, they still floated visably above the race track blocking the view until we physicaly moved them out of the way. Next we noticed we were both alone. We were just thrown into two empty games displite connecting at the same time.\n\nTurns out connecting at the same time was the problem. If one of us went into the online mode and waited by themself for the race to start then the other one of us joined, then the second player got to join in on the race in progress. Just to clarify, there is no lobby of any sort. You click online and you just get thrown in a game if one is there. So the only way to play multiplayer with my friend was to join them in a race that already started, so they could be halfway around the track before I got in if they wanted (we were of course gentlefolk about it).\n\nThat where it got really stupid. The multiplayer games last 4 laps... You'd think that means first to do 4 laps wins... Nope, it means cars can cross the starting line 4 times. All cars collectively. So if we were neck and neck the whole way around, the game would last 2 laps (about 30 seconds). No winners no losers. The 4th time a car goes over the starting line the game just ends and both players get kicked out to... The map select menu for the single player campaign mode. Which you then have to back out of to go back to multiplayer again. Which btw will be on the same map every single time.\n\nPretty much everything about the menu interface is broken. Multiplayer while technically existant, is completely broken. The single player campaign mode is where the most work seems to be put and it's passable at times, but just passable. I know it's early access but a lot of work needs to be done to polish this up to something worth selling and once it is it still needs more content to justify the listed pricetag.\n\nI suggested to my friend we refund the game and go get Toybox turbos for a quarter the price. It was a much better investment.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1466861487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 21, "num_reviews": 31, "steamid": "76561197994197145", "num_games_owned": 1823}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510414", "timestamp_updated": 1467294828, "recommendationid": "23798063", "timestamp_created": 1466874709}, {"review": "Waste of $20. I downloaded the game for my son and as soon as I started it up, it was offcenter and can't be full screened or adjusted so you can't see whats going on. All you can see is a tractor literally in front of the main menu. And then if you can figure out how to accidentally start the game you play the whole game from a fixxed position behind a crash wall barrier.

Please read before you buy and please note I am using the HTC Vive.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple and exactly what you see in the description. Playing the game however is nothing like the previous arcade racers this is baced upon but more akin to racing radio controlled cars...and it works well to a degree.  \nThe usual power ups and earn cash to unlock better cars is there. The tracks whilst basic in some respects are enough to kepp you on your toes. Visually it's basic cartoon style graphics, very much akin to games from 10 years ago but it is rendered  brightly and clearly within your VR enviroment  and seated or standard gameplay (or both) poses no issues. I could as much sit down to race my cars as I could stand up and walk around my play area. In fact it some cases it was preffrable to stand up and move. My only issue here was that there is no reset view, which whilst not problematic was annoying when you wanted to play seated but had to stand up (and turn my back to my PC) and move just to get a better view. Please add a reset button devs...or at least make it clear where the reset view option is if it's implemented (I could not find it).\n\nA huge bonus for this game is also the fact that the dreaded VR sickness is a complete non issue in this game. \n\n\nHowever, there are 2 big elephants in this VR room. First and formost is the lack of support for the Vives motion controllers (and I suspect future Rift Touch controllers). This could just as easily be capable of controlling the cars but the support simply isnt there. If you do not own a game pad, you cant play.  The second is the price of this title. I bought it in the Steam sale and paid \u00a38.99 (down from \u00a314.99).  This is not a \u00a315 game in my opinion, even taking the VR part into account (so pick it up on sale).  Not a bad game at all (lot of fun infact) but for the stanard price I'd recommened plenty of other games over this (at least in the case of Vive owners). \n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1466798146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 12, "num_reviews": 85, "steamid": "76561197970866188", "num_games_owned": 299}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1466819097, "recommendationid": "23775893", "timestamp_created": 1466819097}, {"review": "Fun game but it is buggy.
