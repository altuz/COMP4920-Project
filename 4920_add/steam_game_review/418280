I'm glad that is all the game cost. \n\nIt wasn't a terrible game but that being said it certainly wasn't what i would call good. This may be because it is the developers first attempt or whatever and hence the low price point.\n\nHere are my major issues with the game:\n- Time: the playthrough took me 30mins. idk, I may have missed something but it seems to be a really, really short game\n- Controls: these drove me crazy!!! walking was very, very slow so i just sprinted everywhere; Even though there appeared to be no height difference between the sidewalk and the road, I had to jump up onto the pavement. Going up stairs was basically spamming the jump button. \n- No pause menu: hitting esc just sent you back to the title screen\n- Story: ok, I must have missed some stuff but i think I got the general gist of the story and, to be honest, it was pretty uninspiring.\n\nHonestly, I can't recommend the game, even at the low price simply because it has nothing going for it.

First of all, through possibly no fault of his own, the game didn't seem to work for anyone when first put up on Steam.  Apparently there's STILL issues going on there, as the dev has now suggested to anyone who purchased his game to do a temporary \"fix\", which basically means you're playing a \"beta\" version of the game.  Having now played said \"beta\", all I can say is:  I sincerely hope the \"fixed\" version, once it's up and running, has far less technical and design problems, 'cause the version I played has an awful lot of 'em...\n \n   Firstly, almost straight off I noticed a bug in which the sound of my footsteps continued, even when I stopped walking or running.  Secondly, there are bits where your character has to JUMP to step up onto a sidewalk, despite said sidewalk only being a couple of inches off the ground, and you similarly can't traverse an ordinary set of stairs without LEAPING up them!  Thirdly, it's hard to tell which objects and doors you can and can't interact with, and even when you can, said interaction can be pedantic and hit-and-miss at best.  Fourthly, the map of a town that you pick up isn't that much help considering it doesn't show where you are as you move about, and fifthly said map disappears from your \"inventory\" and has to be picked up again if you start a chapter/section again.  Which sixthly, I ended up doing purely by accident, when I pressed the ESC button to pause for a second, and when I \"continued\", found myself at the beginning of an area which I'd already half-completed.  Oh, and seventhly, you do have a lighter, brought up by pressing \"F\", though I don't recall the game ever telling me this, and it kind of lights up fuck-all when you've got it out anyway.\n \n   All of this pales in comparison, however, next to the game's hands-down number one fault, which is the time-honoured \"what the fuck am I supposed to do next?\" syndrome inherent in an awful lot of \"independent\" game-making.  For all their frequent lack of genuinely inspired ideas and slave-like adherence to established formulas and what-not, it's very rare to find a big-budget, mega-mainstream game in which you are left genuinely perplexed as to what your current objective is.  Now, I'm sure some would come to the dev's defense and say that it's all a bit \"open\" and you're supposed to uncover the town's secrets for yourself, etc etc, but that doesn't explain why I went into a building, searched around a tonne, found the numbers to a keypad by a door, entered the room in question and read a note and listened to an answering machine and THAT'S IT.  Not even some indication that I SHOULD go back outside and start looking elsewhere, just a complete confusion on my behalf as to whether I had missed something in the room or..?\n\n  In any case, the next building I explored was a high school, and a pair of what I take to be game-breaking bugs basically signalled the end for me.  Firstly, there was a room (with a very visible note on a desk) which I simply COULD NOT ENTER, despite the doorway being wide open.  Secondly, after collecting a bunch of jigsaw puzzle pieces I was instructed to go to a girls' bathroom, and sure enough found some \"drugs\" on the floor therein.  But again, there was no signal whatsoever that any \"change\" had occurred in the game, and this time 'round I couldn't even leave the building the way I came in.  Oh, and I should add...I had already managed to find and pick up the drugs earlier, BEFORE solving the jigsaw puzzle, but they still decided to respawn a second time.  Game over for me one way or another, I'm afraid.\n\n   Now, as to whether any of these issues are actually dealt with in the game proper I can't say, but given that the dev himself is suggesting that people play this beta, I can only assume that there won't be a dramatic improvement.  I can see what he's trying to achieve here, story-wise and so forth, and I won't deny that there's potential, for the game and/or himself as a designer.  But in its present state the game is eminently unplayable, and generally suggests a failed-but-interesting demo which should have been chalked up to valuable game-making experience, rather than released to Steam (even for a measly dollar).\n\n   By all means, should we get the word from the dev that:  a. the official game is now playable, and b. said official release is quite a bit more refined than the beta which I just attempted to play, I would be more than happy to give this another go.  For now, though, I cannot in all good conscience give it a recommendation.  You know there's something seriously wrong when you see the words \"horror game\" and \"very short\" all over a Steam page, and even YOURS TRULY doesn't bother to see it through to the end!  Here's hoping we get to turn that thumb the right way around some time...\n\nVerdict: 4/10.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1451320479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 62, "num_reviews": 429, "steamid": "76561198048974498", "num_games_owned": 1513}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529359", "timestamp_updated": 1451323949, "recommendationid": "20038915", "timestamp_created": 1451321850}, {"review": "I've got to say, its got a lot of glitches, and the flashing lights are annoying.

Luckily the developer got the game to run despite its quirkiness and off I went! Firstly, this game is only 99 cents, and it is way worth that much money. So much of the time big games will have beautiful graphics and  but absolutely no storyline, just shoot and be shot at. This game, however, has a very interesting story behind it which has kept my interest so far. A quick synopsis~You wake up in a van with no knowledge of what happened nor who the person is who has abducted you. This stranger (or is it a stranger?)  subsequently dumps you in the middle of what at first appears to be the woods. After some walking around you discover that in fact you are in an abandoned town . It has a bit of an open world feel but it is small. Despite this, it is very nicely done and delivers a good creepy atmosphere.  I wont write more about the story but this scenario grabbed me. Yes, the graphics are a little clunky but there are moments of very pretty scenes like the night sky with a full moon that make up for this, and there was a few little oddities like one has to jump up to get on the sidewalk to walk as if there is a small wall around the sidewalk but otherwise the game ran well and is definitely worth it if you like a creepy tale, exploring, puzzles and a mystery to solve.
