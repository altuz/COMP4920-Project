{"reviews": [{"review": "Short: The game has problems but the core gameplay is solid. It's definitely worth the current price of \u20ac0.49. \nDon't expect great writing but the music is really good.\n\nCopied from my forum post which kind of turned into a review.\n======================================================\nAllright, After playing it for a bit I want to add that I am enjoying it although it has many problems.\n\nFirst allow me to vent my frustration: I just got a 122 combo and wanted to take a screenshot, so I pressed F12 and the game rebooted.\nPlease remove this reboot button :)\n\nAllright, that's out of the way (I'll get it again later)\n\nThe story doesn't make any sense: characters are not introduced and it jumps from one thing to the other. Somehow everyone has this urge to die. The writing feels cheap, more like a fanfiction than a game. (Well, the game is cheap)\nI guess it's just a recap of some memorable moments of your other games and is not supposed to form a cohesive story in itself?\n\nI don't know how you guys came up with the controls but they were unplayable for me. I created an auto hotkey script that swaps the X and D keys. It's still confusing sometimes but works way better now. I'm using a Belgian AZERTY keyboard. This game needs a custom controls setting. But I understand if you don't want to spend development time on that. There are many alternatives available that let the player rebind keys.\n\nThat said I do enjoy the game. The gameplay is solid. It is also a fresh take on rythm games.\nInstead of the usual press this button on the correct timing, you opted for \"you have limited time to input these buttons\". I also like the variable speed the button prompts fall and the breathing room once in a while.\n\nI think it's great how you guys made this possible with RPG Maker! Good luck on your future projects.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1455318097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 106, "num_reviews": 22, "steamid": "76561198015623134", "num_games_owned": 320}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536751", "timestamp_updated": 1455315848, "recommendationid": "21162972", "timestamp_created": 1455315848}, {"review": "i like the game but it's impossible for me to finish because of an error.\n\n[code]\nScript \"Video Player\" line 390: ArgumentError occurred.\n\ninvalid byte sequence in UTF-8\n[/code]", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1489011782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 115, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198082900181", "num_games_owned": 77}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505471", "timestamp_updated": 1480247473, "recommendationid": "27815289", "timestamp_created": 1480247473}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
