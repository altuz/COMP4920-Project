Overall i would rate this 6/10 but at the same time i would and wouldnt recommend this cause paying 20$ INCLUDING the DLC isnt worth it for only a short story.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1504586063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 579, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198121308594", "num_games_owned": 53}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518784", "timestamp_updated": 1504586631, "recommendationid": "34749699", "timestamp_created": 1504586240}, {"review": "Its pretty bad...

It's best if you get it on sale, but it's an okay game for the price. The 4 main characters play similarly, but have different ranges, and spread. The combos don't change much and you can't change the appearance except for dlc costumes. I find this game to be quite enjoyable and a good game to pass the time, and it's really fun when you play on higher difficulties as they increase how many monsters there are then. The game is somewhat grindy and gets a bit boring after a few hours on a single character if you stick to the campaign in my opinion, but you can play more than just the campaign. They have a decent multiplayer that allows you to play with up to 3 others and in the same game modes single player has. So, although there do seem to be a lot of negative reviews, those guys are probably still going to play the game because of how fun and enjoyable it is.
