{"reviews": [{"review": "I love this game. \n\nI first played this at PAX East in 2016. My two friends and I played it on Friday, then kept coming back to play. By Sunday we had spent the majority of our time competing each other on this game, stacking up wins against each other. \n\nStrategic, fun, competitive, and just random enough to keep it interesting, Gurgamoth is crazy addictive. I totally recommend it if you've looking for a local competitive game. \n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1501975109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 378, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198015309760", "num_games_owned": 159}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "timestamp_updated": 1496600285, "recommendationid": "32182083", "timestamp_created": 1496600285}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 16, "review_score": 7, "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 17, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
