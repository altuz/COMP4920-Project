{"reviews": [{"review": "Resident Evil 7 is a masterclass on how to reinvent yourself in todays modern survival horror genre. The story manages to drag you in and drop you into this visceral experience seen through the eyes of a newcomer to the series. Following a distress call from his missing wife of three years, Mia, you take on the role of Ethan as you step onto the Baker Property and beyond. Mainstays from the series return in excellent fashion as the game also returns to that familiar feeling of dread last seen nearly 20 years ago in the Spencer Mansion (which interestingly was built by the same contractors that are to credit for the Baker Residence.)  Do yourself a favor and pick this game up, especially if it's on sale - I myself grabbed it during a Capcom sale. \n\nPersonal ratings: \nGraphics - 9/10 Some prerendered backgrounds are very noticeable when a majority of the game is rendered beautfiully. \nControls - 8/10 Some aim assist issues and general clunkiness (which apparently is lessened in vr) are present \nStory - 10/10 I absolutely enjoyed the main story of this game and appreciated its pacing. While there is some slow-down towards the final portion of the game I found that the story didn't skip a beat.  \nSound - 8/10 There are several sections in this game where the sound design places the sound behind or around you than rather where it is coming from. Notably in the Old House section. \nReplayability - 10/10  While I haven't completed this game on the Harder difficulties, I have completed a second run for several achievements. There's enough beckoning you into returning to this title and dredging through the harder difficulty modes that give this a perfect replayability score. \nDLC - As of posting this review I haven't purchased the dlc for this game. \n\nRating - 9/10", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505429837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1161, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197999129940", "num_games_owned": 211}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500061", "timestamp_updated": 1505519198, "recommendationid": "34983690", "timestamp_created": 1505519039}, {"review": "After playing the previous 2 RE titles, this was a very pleasant surprise.
