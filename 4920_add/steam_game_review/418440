{"reviews": [{"review": "[i]Tick Tock Isle[/i] is a third-person pixel art adventure game that contains a little arcade-style platforming, too. I had a lot of fun with [i]Tick Tock Isle[/i] and while it only takes two hours to finish the game, its price is very fair so I certainly recommend it to anyone who thinks they may enjoy a game of this genre.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nYour name is Strike and you're summoned to an island to fix a clock in a mansion. When you get there, you find the mansion seemingly abandoned but you do find the clock. After tinkering around with the clock a bit, it teleports you through time to the year 2009.\n\nIn 2009, the mansion is full of life. You'll meet the ten inhabitants of the mansion and try to fix the clock - sorry, try to fix the time machine in order to find your way home. Soon you notice you can easily travel back and forth between the year 2009 and 2010. And you'll find that things you do in 2009 have an impact on the mansion and its inhabitants in 2010, of course. Could this be the key to fixing the clock and returning to your own time?\n\n[i]Tick Tock Isle[/i] is not a visual novel and the narrative is a rather basic time travel story, but its writing is entertaining and cute in its innocence. Strangely, although the game is set in 2009 and 2010, there are a lot of references to 1980s and 1990s pop culture.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\n[i]Tick Tock Isle[/i] plays like a point & click adventure game but without the pointing and the clicking. Yeah, I know how that sounds, but bear with me here. You wander around the mansion, talk to its inhabitants, collect items and use those on the correct target NPC or object to advance the story. The only real difference is that instead of using the mouse to point and click your way through the game, you use the keyboard to control your avatar.\n\nWhen Strike is near a spot where he can perform an action (pick up an item, interact with an object or NPC, use an item, \u2026) you'll get an on-screen prompt and just have to press a button to have him perform the required action. So there's no pixel hunting and no 'using everything from your inventory on everything' in [i]Tick Tock Isle[/i].\n\nWhen you press the Enter key, you see a status screen containing your inventory and a short description of each item you've collected, a brief checklist of things you're required to do, the current year and a crude map of the mansion. The map doesn't help much, really, but the mansion isn't that huge, so you'll soon find your way around without needing a map anyway. \n\nOn about five occasions, you're required to go through a minigame to get an item you need. The minigames are short, basic platformer levels you need to go through. This involves jumping (none of those insanely difficult jumps you need to time perfectly, though), killing or avoiding monsters, dodging bullets and even one 'boss fight' at the end of the last platformer minigame. Platformer games aren't my cup of tea but I didn't find these platformer minigames frustrating. It did take me a few tries to get the last two right but that's to be expected and part of the fun, as otherwise it would mean the minigames are way too easy.\n\n[h1]Graphics and sound[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are pixel graphics. Generally speaking, I'm not a big fan of pixel graphics but [i]Tick Tock Isle[/i]'s graphics are relatively easy on the eye. \n\nThe music is typical retro-style music that goes perfectly with the pixel graphics, and actually sounds pretty good. It reminded me of the high-end 16-bit console games of the 1990s.\n\nThe sound effects are also basic and retro-style. When a character starts talking, you hear a sound effect that sounds like the character speaks one random syllable. So there's no voice acting but this minute detail does offer a taste of the tone of the characters' voices, which adds a lot of atmosphere.\n\n[h1]On Steam's extra features[/h1]\n\n[i]Tick Tock Isle[/i] has no Steam Achievements. It does have 10 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 5 while running the game.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1502279259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 161, "num_reviews": 92, "steamid": "76561198042646749", "num_games_owned": 700}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527163", "timestamp_updated": 1502279867, "recommendationid": "34123609", "timestamp_created": 1502279867}, {"review": "This is a cute little game with adorable art and chock-full of pop culture references.

Gameplay is pretty basic: explore an island with a big house on it and look for items to collect and people to use those items on to solve their problems. The time travel aspect gives the game a neat premise that is delivered on in the <2 hours it takes to complete. My biggest complaint is that there is quite a bit of repeated and sometime tedious exploration needed to find the right item or event to trigger the story to move on. On the other hand, there are a few action segments that break this tedium up quite nicely. I will note that when you first explore the house it can seem confusing, but if you pause and look at the map it will help you imagine the layout much better. Otherwise it feels like you're moving through a 3D space in 2D quite strangely.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1501968427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 92, "num_reviews": 16, "steamid": "76561197995291334", "num_games_owned": 508}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1502307643, "recommendationid": "34131663", "timestamp_created": 1502307643}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 63, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 66, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
