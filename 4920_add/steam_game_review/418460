Nothing is locked from the start, you can pick any class if it is available.  No weapon unlocks just skin unlocks which make zero difference other than the kevlar for the US forces.  The basic one is a bit bright and easy to see.  \n\nThe game is good but it also has its issues.  For instance, latency on US servers is rediculous.  I'm in Texas and I join servers relatively close to me and still get 60-120 ping.  This isn't an internet issue on my end as I have zero problems with everything else I play and my connection is fiber with low latency and high bandwidth.  Other issues that plague the game are getting stuck on things in levels and hit registering.  While I don't have nearly the amount of problems with hits registering in RS2 compared ot DoI, its still a small problem.  I don't notice it unless its obvious, like when I am point blank and dump a whole mag into someone and they turn around and kill me.\n\nOutside of those issues, the game plays well and all the weapons feel balanced.  People will always moan and groan over things like flamethrowers but their range is so limited that if you got burnt up by it then its your own fault.  Adjusting the sights of your weapons and taking into account bullet trajectory is a big deal for longer range weapons and using the RPG and grenade launchers.  Getting hit in RS2 can mean death or wounded.  Sometimes you can bandage sometimes you are hosed.  In the end, I find most of my deaths are from stupidity of the moment although I don't die that often at all.  \n\nThe first thing you are going to notice are those that run into battle and moan and groan that they died.  This is not a Call of Duty game and you will get rocked doing that.  Slow and steady, check your area move as a squad.  The commander is a pivotal role in the game, if for any reason there is none, assume command.  If you don't and no one else does you are losing out on artillery, napalm, respawns, recon, etc.  I would rather have a bad commander than no commander.  Squad leaders are responsible for marking targets, digging tunnels, and being a spawn point for your squad.  When playing RS2, play...your....role!\n\nAs far as the graphics go, they are mediocre.  It isn't a AAA game and was never trying to be.  I find the sounds to be fairly decent and the controls, for the most part, to function correctly.  I have had a few times where I watched my guy reload the weapon and I pull the trigger and \"click\".....fuhk....  It happens but doesn't happen often enough to matter.\n\nI think one of the biggest detractors from the actual gameplay that aren't bugs are the lack of levels.  There are hardly and levels to play while more is being promised later this year.  While this doesn't matter that much to me, it does to others and causes a mediocre playerbase.  Around 1000-2000 players during peak time and a bit lower during non-peak.  This isn't to say I have never had a problem getting into a server but it can be irritating to get into a queue because only 8 or 9 servers are running and all full.  Getting into another server that is empty rarely results in it filling up.  Better marketing, less bugs, and more levels would breathe better life into this game.  I really enjoy playing it, it fills that hole in FPS gaming for me as I am a bit older these days and the slower nature of the game suits me.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1504921019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1441, "num_reviews": 39, "steamid": "76561197986365521", "num_games_owned": 194}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499554", "timestamp_updated": 1505687274, "recommendationid": "35034494", "timestamp_created": 1505687274}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3693, "review_score": 6, "total_negative": 994, "num_reviews": 20, "total_reviews": 4687, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive"}, "success": 1}
