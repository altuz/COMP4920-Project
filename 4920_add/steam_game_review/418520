{"reviews": [{"review": "If you like voxel based creative software and enjoy VR then this is a must have. I have used a few other voxel based games/software over the years just for being creative in and this is by far my favorite so far. Makes quick work for alot of stuff being able to scale up and down which is where it excells over others. In others you can spend ages trying to make some big if you are stuck at same size but in this you just scale up create it in next to no time roughly and scale down to add details. This is a fantastic feature as you can scale down extremely small to add those hard to get to details. For alot of art and creative stuff, its the details that count so how this gives you the option to add as much detail as you want ....i can see some awesome creative screenshots and installations getting posted on the community page once people really start using it to its potential.  I've only had this for 2 days and already put nearly 17 hours in. So far i have'nt even tried importing any objects which i see others have. So huge options available.\nPros: Almost too many to list.  \n        VR \n       Being able to scale up and down\n       Editable Avatars is fun\n\nCons:  Ummm be prepared to live in VR and lose days of your life.... altho its quite worth it.\n          \nIdeas:   Maybe a palette of textures like wood, stone, grass, gravel, etc to add to give an even more real look to objects you create. \n       Top marks to the developers of this. Its great fun and loads of potential. Worth every cent. Stop reading this and go get it if you dont have it and are a creative person. :)", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505094118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3521, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198101377714", "num_games_owned": 96}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_updated": 1499546710, "recommendationid": "33385265", "timestamp_created": 1499546710}, {"review": "I've looked at this off and on for a while now, but only recently pulled the trigger after buying the daydream version on sale. After playing around with that I discovered that it supports cross-platform multiplayer, which meant that my daughter and I could play at the same time in the same world (one of us wearing daydream and the other the Vive). We've had a ton of fun throwing rockets at one another, playing ball, destroying everything in sight around one another, and changing scale so that one of us becomes a giant and another a mouse.\n\nWhen I play by myself I've found this to be a more powerful and easy to use creation tool than I expected. Right now I'm working on a house for my daughter. I love how I can change scale on the fly to make tiny details (like a bee on the rose bush under the window, or a birds nest inside the trunk of a tree). I really love creating things in VR, there's something incredibly satisfying about it and this game scratches that itch perfectly.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1504827565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 339, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197972159575", "num_games_owned": 198}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1504312600, "recommendationid": "34672764", "timestamp_created": 1504312600}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 32, "review_score": 7, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 32, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
