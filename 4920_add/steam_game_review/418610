It has these locations where the height of your jump is slightly too much but you don't expect that, so first you mess up, go back to a checkpoint, and next time you have to remember to jump in a weird way so you go right when you start falling. And that has to be well timed, too. Almost everything is based on perfect positioning but the way the \"character\" controls really sucks. Oh and sometimes you get stuck in the ground.\n\nThis all happened to me on the first level. I gave up.\n\n\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1466875061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 10, "num_reviews": 53, "steamid": "76561198010360684", "num_games_owned": 936}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543686", "timestamp_updated": 1478339467, "recommendationid": "23798566", "timestamp_created": 1466875612}, {"review": "So I'm going to break this down into categories for easy readin' n reviewin'\n\n------------------------------------------------\nGame was updated 27/01/2016. I'm using this space to update my review based on those changes. Original review is down below.\n\nThey have implemented WASD controls and have now made wall jumping a tad easier. This makes playing the game more comfortable and with the improvements to wall jumping less frustrating.\n\nFixed the music abruptly stopping after death. You can now finally hear the chill music track and I dig it. \n\nThey've implemented a level counter. A small change but it's nice to know you've completed a level.\n\nSmall introductions to new mechanics. Base game had no tips, more info about new mechanics is always welcome.\n\nUpdated score 7/10.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal review:\n\nPros:\n\nPrice is on point - For such a simple game I feel they nailed the price point perfectly. If you enjoy challenging platformers, I feel you can get your \u00a30.79 worth.\n\nIt's challenging - Not a surprise there! If you're like me and like a quick challenge there's something in here for you.\n\nSimplicity - You're a square avoiding death, it doesn't over complicate things, it knows what it is and sticks to it.\n\n25 levels - 25 doesn't seem like a lot but having spent an hour on just 6 levels I feel there's easily enough content.\n\nDevs listen - They're very open to feedback and have proven to change the game based on said feedback. Fantastic to see!\n\nCons:\n\n(Fixed as of 27/01/2016) - 1 Music track - Swiftly fails hard on the music front. I would like to say I've heard the whole track however when you die (And you will die a lot) the music instantly stops and starts from the beginning. Within just 9 minutes I hate to mute the game entirely and put on my own music! Extremely frustrating to listen to.\n\n(Improved as of 27/01/2016) - Controls - For the most part the controls are fine, so why is this in the cons section? Wall jumping. Yup. Wall jumping. Wall jumping is the most infuriating part of this game, it's not challenging, it's not fun, it's a wrestle with the controls and it sucks!\n\n\nImprovements:\n\n(Fixed as of 27/01/2016) - Don't restart music upon death, let that little sucker continue playing! The addition of 2 or 3 more music tracks would be extremely welcome.\n\n(Improved as of 27/01/2016) - Re-work wall jumping! I can't even put down in words how frustrating it is to mash up & left then quickly let go to mash up and right in the hopes it's timed correctly to achieve a wall jump. Make is so your square can stick to the walls for easier jumping or rework the whole wall jumping together!\n\nAchievements don't pop at the end of levels - They only pop once you go back to the menu.\n\n(Implemented as of 27/01/2016) - Add a level notification, I had no idea I had completed 5 levels till I exited to the menu. Once the player has moved to a new level and quick flash of level [number] would be welcomed.\n\nSimple leaderboads - Just to add a tiny bit of competitiveness to the game. Add a simple leaderboard of the top 10 fastest finishes. It's simple and could spur somebody on to beat that No.1 - adding a small amount of replay-ability.\n\n\nConlusion:\n\nIf you like quick, fun, challening levels I see no reason why you shouldn't pick this up. The game needs improvements there's no doubt about that. However, what we have now is still an enjoyable game despite some flaws. Overall I give Swiftly 6/10.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1485547808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 191, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198000801413", "num_games_owned": 1035}, "language": "english", "developer_response": "The square now \"sticks\" to the wall for half a second now, so wall jumping should be easy now.\nAlso, the soundtrack doesn't restart upon death.\n\nThanks for your review!", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1453868528, "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523001", "timestamp_updated": 1454824855, "recommendationid": "20772357", "timestamp_created": 1453836686}, {"review": "Ooh yay, yet another 'hurr-durr dis gem iz hard' game.  \n\nOk, I get that some people get some entertainment out of these, and most of them are cleverly thought out and put together, so that no time is spent figuring out the mechanics.  But this game just doesn't play well at all.  I couldn't figure out what the hitboxes of the wheels were, making the game not just hard, but also annoying.  It wouldn't have been bad if I could have set my own controls.  Using the arrow keys to move is meh, I prefer AWSD, but using the up arrow to jump just makes this game unplayable.  Also the physics are st00pid.\n\nUnfortunately I can't recommend the game, despite the low price.  Save your pennies, folks!\n\n\nUPDATE:  So I was contacted to change my review in light of recent changes that have been made by the developer.  \nOne thing I can give credit for is that the developer seems to care about constructive criticism and wants to improve upon what he has made and has as such implemented AWSD controls after my review.  Jumping however, is still a pain as I'd rather have a dedicated button that isn't part of my control pad.  Music doesn't restart upon death anymore, fortunately removing another layer of obnoxiousness.  Hitboxes are still eh.\n\nA small thing I forgot to mention in my first review was how the first checkpoint was stupid, because you need a run-up to do the next gauntlet, meaning you have to track back a little every time you die.  This doesn't make the game hard, just annoying.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that maybe I was too harsh at first and the game is just unfinished and needs some polish.

Another mean element not to be underestimated is the deadly ceiling. But after get used to it you can even skip many gears by jump over them with full throttle or use the checkpoints that are spreaded in the levels. Some quality issues forced the dev to remove the achievement for the last level (level25) and also the lately added timer seems pretty broken.

I got [i]Super Meat Boy[/i] for 0.69\u20ac and it has since become a proof to me that \"cheap\" doesn't have to mean \"bad\". Even if [i]SMB[/i]'s case remains an exception more than a rule, I refuse to treat uncostly games any differently from all the other ones. I expect, at worst, a fun distraction that lasts way too short, or something of this sort.\n\n[i]Swiftly[/i], in any case, is a non-descript, generic game in the hardcore-platformer-with-minimalist-aesthetics genre. It has no story, worldbuilding or joke to it. What you see on the screenshots \u2014 black square, spiky wheels etc. \u2014 is all you get. It's super basic, and nothing changes during the game either; no new mechanic appears, even the background and the music remain the same throughout. (In fact, the single music track is looped, and there are no other sounds.)\n\nIf there's one distinctive element to [i]Swiftly[/i] \u2014 and maybe the one thing that could have saved it somehow \u2014 it's the focus on physics. I should, however, put \"focus\" in quotes here because it really only is lip service. While the game makes the notions of having some very physics-y stuff in it (e.g. you \"add force\" by pressing move buttons, according to the help text), there isn't any actually to be found. What's more, you shouldn't even expect the most basic physics to behave correctly. Some of the things that happened to me when playing Swiftly:\n\nI strafed in the air.\n\nI jumped in the air. But I think it only works when you're falling.\n\nI jumped in the air when hitting a bouncy platform and got rocketed into the sky.\n\nI also got sent into the sky because I moved between two different-colored segments on a platform.\n\nI got stuck to the ground.\n\nI got locked in between two blocks with no way to restart from a checkpoint. (In fact, there is no pause menu; you just exit to the main one.)\n\nAnd many, many more surprising situations. Or, as one might call them, bugs.\n\nTo make things better, the game explicitly includes wall jumping which I guess was added just 'cause it's cool \u2014 so much for the \"scientific approach\".\n\nFor what it's worth, [i]Swiftly[/i] is relatively challenging, so at least one of its claims is true. (Although maybe I should say, relatively unchallenging, since while it was somewhat hard at certain points, the game doesn't come close to the difficulty of [i]VVVVVV[/i] or [i]SMB[/i], or many other titles.) At least it is short, so you won't suffer too much if you do buy it (took me 2.8 hours to beat).
