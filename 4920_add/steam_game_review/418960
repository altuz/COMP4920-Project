The other thing was trying to use the aim and power IN MIDAIR was very fiddly and difficult to get right.\n\nAll in all, I think this game needs a bit more polish and could be a great game. It's still a decent enough game but it won't hold your attention for too long. The only reason why I tried this game out was because A.) it had a cat as its main character (albeit no real story or explanation for it) B.) it was $2.50 (if I had paid more, then I'd be quite upset) and C.) It's an indie title and you should at least TRY and give the smaller guys (or girls) a try and a helping hand.\n\nI hope there will be further updates such as the way to control and move around the screen, which would definitely improve at least the playability of this game.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1451307365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 37, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198047563715", "num_games_owned": 159}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496057", "timestamp_updated": 1451114732, "recommendationid": "19953554", "timestamp_created": 1451114732}, {"review": "NO.
