{"reviews": [{"review": "Tags: Casual - Sokoban\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Huge performance issues and technical problems as well as design flaws ruin this as a contender for one of the top 5 Sokoban-Style games I am prepared to make a spot for in my library and dooms this title to library removal\n\nOutstanding Issues:\n+Crates obstruct the ground due to isometric view complicates the player's ability to predict the solution path\n+Dropped frames everywhere on overkill hardware for this title\n+Game refused to fullscreen/Grayed out option to fullscreen in the options\n+System fans started ramping up way too hard while playing this title - Hints at a memory leak or huge optimization issue\n+Laggy unresponsive menus\n\nPros:\n+Nice audiovisually\n+Has its own twist for sokoban - introduces crates with different properties but more interestingly rather than marking objectives on the floor for you to solve, it simply places on objective for all crates on one tile and gives you another tile as a trigger. When you activate the trigger, the portal will start vacuuming in the closest crate, that crate will vacuum in the next crate in a direct line path to it and so on and so forth. Allowing you to chain-link your crates to the end goal which is at least something to freshen the experience\n+Has controller support\n\nConclusion: \nIf it were not for the camera, the performance issues and the botched resolution support I would had definitely booted out a more vanilla sokoban that is keyboard only out of my collection to make room for this one. But as things stand I will have to unfortunately discard this one instead.
