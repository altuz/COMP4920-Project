It's a lot of fun. Well worth $2.49 for sure.\n\nGranted, it's not designed to be a heavy bridge building simulator, it's just a simple arcade style game you might want to file under \"Comedy\", because I've had lots of laughs with it so far.\n\nYou don't actually build bridges with it, but you are doing stunts where a bridge is under construction. You have to build the perfect RAMP, or ingenuis pathway, to get to the other side and capture the checkered flag.\n\nI also like the instant replay, the ability to save a replay, the ability to convert the replay into a video, and the ability to convert the video into a GIF. Totally setup to share the laughter with your friends for sure.\n\nNot everything is entirely simple in this game. It does have a few challenges where you must use a little strategy without going over your construction budget. There are times when you must run a stage TWICE, once to grab a star along one possible route, and again to grab a bolt along another possible route. A few routes may seem impossible, but nothing is impossible in this game. There's always more than one way to get to where you want to go.\n\nAs far as stunts go, you're basically doing forward and reverse flips, BUT it's the way you DO THOSE FLIPS is what really counts in some situations. You might have to use other particular objects found at each site to give you some boost (hint, hint).\n\nTheres really no right or wrong way to play this game. You can be serious with it, or goof off with it, or experiment with odd ramp designs in odd places that other people might not think about considering. With that being said, here's another clue... Just because it doesn't look like you should put a ramp there, it doesn't mean you can't. Just try it and see what happens.
