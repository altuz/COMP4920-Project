{"reviews": [{"review": "I bought this game after seeing the documentary Thank You for Playing, which tells of story of Ryan Green and his family as they come to terms with the terminal cancer of their son Joel. This game is his labour of love and lasting testament to his son.\n\nThe game is made up of dozens of scenes, some set in the real world of hospital wards and waiting rooms, and others set in imaginary allegorical places.  It does a great job of conveying things from different perspectives; sometimes you play Ryan, sometimes his wife, or sometimes a silent observer watching events as they unfold. This is one of the game's strong points, and lets you see things from a very personal perspective.\n\nWhat wasn't so strong was focus and consistency. There were mini-games, linear set-pieces on rails, and in other scenes it wasn't clear at all what to do and where to go to progress. It felt sometimes like you were wandering through an art gallery but couldn't find the exit - some clearer hints might have been appreciated.\n\nA lot of the symbolism and allegory was very Christian. As a non-Christian I found it difficult sometimes to understand the message, and I reckon a lot of it went over my head. Anything as deeply personal as this was going to be hit and miss against a mass market. Nonetheless, the environments created were simple, beautiful and imaginative.\n\nFor me I really, really wanted to like this game... but in the end I couldn't connect with it as I had hoped, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't give it a chance.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1481219722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 152, "num_reviews": 16, "steamid": "76561197965277046", "num_games_owned": 70}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514964", "timestamp_updated": 1505521170, "recommendationid": "34984157", "timestamp_created": 1505521170}, {"review": "Rich story that really pulls you in.

Depression Quest, take copious notes.\n\nIts an interactive game/novel that follows the life of a family struggling to deal with the harsh reality of cancer overtaking their young son. Don't expect breathtaking visuals. Everything is kept very simple and I'm glad this choice was made because the narrative is the stand out star. The visuals and music are there to assist not overshadow. The presentation of this piece is what makes this a success, in my opinion, because it manages to leave an impactful mark without being too self-serving and pretentious. Focusing your narraitive on a subject so real and so tragic is very, very risky but I feel that the risk was worth it. \n\nThe only issue I came across is muddled, garbled audio from inner monolougues. I'm not sure if its intentional to add impact to the emotionally infused written letters or if my computer is temporarily on strike but I'm noting it anyway, just in case.\n\nThis is the second game that has driven me to tears and I'm okay with that. I will play this game again, most definately, after some time has passed. The journey may have been mostly sad but I will happily take it again until That Dragon, Cancer, is finally slain.\n\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506113397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 139, "playtime_forever": 139, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561198366326831", "num_games_owned": 33}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1506117480, "recommendationid": "35138588", "timestamp_created": 1506117480}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 589, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 65, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 654, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
