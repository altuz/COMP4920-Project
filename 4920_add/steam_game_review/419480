It very easy to cheat with a simple edit of a save file, note unlocking the best ship just means they will attack with theres. so its kinda pointless to cheat, its way better just to play as is. Its a long strat game with some RPG to it but thats realy half the fun. Took a bit to get used to controlls, but makes a good space shooter game with some deth, The only problem i have is the jobs get repetitive, but some new one seam to open the more you do them. the random events make up for this, you can come across anything on the way to your mission. I have not noticed any bugs other then what i pointed out.  just a drag its single player, i can see some good multi side to this game. if they made a universe with players chooseing there factions to pvp and grow there area, be cool.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506295548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_forever": 1010, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561197988121349", "num_games_owned": 79}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500091", "timestamp_updated": 1505776707, "recommendationid": "35054573", "timestamp_created": 1505776707}, {"review": "I definitely recommend this game, but there is a catch that must be mentioned upfront: the game is listed as having full controller support, but it does not. It has ok support for standard Xbox controllers, however it does not support flight sticks. There is also no in-game tool to remap controller buttons, and their default layout is a bit awkward. I'm also finding that the controller can't be used to get some info--for example, if you place an enhancement on any of your weapons, you can only see which one you used by using the mouse. Controller support is definitely partial, not full.\n\nAside from that, I'm loving this game! The comment I keep seeing in reviews that convinced me to buy this game was, \"It's not as good as X3.\" I'm happy to say: yes, thankfully, this game is NOT like X3. It's actually playable; it's accessible. I love that it manages to combine space simulator with RPG and economic management in a very smooth way, without a ridiculous learning curve. \n\nThere's a fun balance between combat, trade, and tactical management. You can build fleets and have them defend your forward posts. Or you can join the fight yourself. You can assign other ships to your own fleet for some backup in a fight. You can play the main missions, go looking for your own fights, or take \"freelance\" quests. You can declare war on your neighbors, or send trade fleets. \n\nThe game looks and sounds good--and if you have a decent subwoofer, the rumble of ship movement is incredible! And I love that the main missions give you a speed booster to get to the play area faster.
