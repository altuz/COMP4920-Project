{"reviews": [{"review": "The game has a simple premise:  The character you control is a clockwork postal bird, kind of like a parrot.  The objective is to get from one cage to another to deliver the mail, avoiding anything spiky along the way that will kill you, and don't fly off the screen either.  Your flight direction is predetermined, but you have the ability to click and drag your clockwork bird to teleport in order to avoid hazards.  Pulling this off successfuly is another matter.  It becomes more difficult as each level progresses.  Just when you think you've avoided a set of spikes, a steam jet can change your direction and now you're flying in a direction you don't really want to go.  To add to that you have gates that slam together, pinwheels that spin around, and the screen is constantly moving you ever onward, and not always just left to right.  Sometimes the scrolling direction changes.  There's no health meter or hit points.  Touch something sharp and you're dead.  Fall behind and you're dead.  It will test your reflexes and mouse skills, and patience as levels become increasingly difficult.\n\nThe levels themselves are fairly short so it's an easy game to play for a while, put down, and come back to.  As you play you can collect gears on each level and gain a \"flawless\" status for completing a level without dying and collecting all 3 gears on the same pass.  You can die as much as you like (there's achievements based around the number and types of deaths) or you can restart a level and try to get a flawless status.  There's really no difference between dying and chosing restart from the menu except that restarting will reset your death counter so you can attempt a flawless pass.  The teleportation mechanic itself is very straightforward.  It's just click, drag, and release.  It's extremely easy to learn.  There's 60 levels.  It's already challenging by level 10.  Expect it to be hard to master.\n\nVisually the theme is black and red, and I mean that - just black, and just red.  Well, a little variation on the red, but mostly just red.  The environments are steampunk inspired, with spikes, lots of metal framework, spikes, gears, spikes, steam pipes, and did I mention spikes?  Yeah, you'll want to avoid those.  It's very minimalist and simplistic, which actually helps with the gameplay.  There's no cluttered textures or anything that will visually distract you from what's important.  The high contrast keeps you focused on the hazards and your bird.\n\nThe soundtrack seems to be Hungarian, or at least the title song is.  It's fairly light and completely non-distracting, giving an upbeat air to what would otherwise seem like a completely hellish environment.  Again, going with the theme of sharp contrasts, it fits right in.\n\nPerformance concerns should be a non-issue due to the visual simplicity, and there's no real benefit of playing this on a super-high resolution.  You can play it at 1024x768 just fine.  It'll play just fine on your custom gaming rig or the \"old family computer\".\n\nAn often overlooked concern with video games... this game is a very good choice for colorblind players.  The high contrast between the open spaces and solid objects means that those who cannot see the full spectrum won't have any trouble distinguishing between the two.\n\nFinal word:  If you want a simple game that's easy to learn but provides a fairly steep challenge you can't go wrong here.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1501036165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 92, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561197964253420", "num_games_owned": 83}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491883", "timestamp_updated": 1497761662, "recommendationid": "32526754", "timestamp_created": 1497761493}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
