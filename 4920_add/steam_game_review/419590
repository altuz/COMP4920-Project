{"reviews": [{"review": "I was skeptical this game would be \"quality\" or any fun to play after seeing its somewhat simplistic design, but I'm glad I took a chance and bought it (during a sale..) after having been interested for awhile and can say it has been some of the most fun I've had with a game in quite some time.\n\nIf you're looking for a retro sci-fi, surreal adventure and are a fan of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea / When Mars Attacks! and other somewhat kitschy sci fi worlds you will probably find some enjoyment from this title. After your submarine and crew are warped to outer space during a faulty equipment test, it's up to you to select your crew from Scouts, Engineers, and Gunners, and equip them with a variety of gear, grenades, and weapons, ranging from pistols to shotguns and rocket launchers. The gameplay's more RTS-like controls threw me off pretty bad at first, but you quickly become accustomed to the game's mechanics via a comprehensive, easy to follow tutorial.  \n\nThe effects of the game are very simplistic, with explosions not packing much of a punch, and enemy designs appearing somewhat rudimentary. The lighting and animation of your crew members is pretty well done, however, although the resolution / textures are quite basic, the low-lit environments and somewhat smokey ambiance add to your immersion. \n\nThe one thing that bugs me the most about this game is that the UI / display of the commands you can give your team take up a LARGE portion of the bottom of the screen and obstruct your view of your divers / spacemen as they float along through the surreal, ambiguous environments. It's not a game-breaking obstruction, but it just hides a lot of your view up close of your team as they navigate the terrain, which is fun to watch as they bound along in low gravity, but harder to see due to this situation. \n\nThe game lacks controller support of any kind and is strictly mouse+keyboard for better or for worse. The game features full voice-acting during mission intros and a variety of tasks to complete during missions. I could see the repetition of the environments possibly wearing thin a bit into the game, but so far I have enjoyed myself.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1499590825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 459, "num_reviews": 148, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "num_games_owned": 800}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_updated": 1499130348, "recommendationid": "32714858", "timestamp_created": 1498288432}, {"review": "Can only give Tales from the Void a big thumbs up.\n\nThis is a original game with a really good narrative, which creates a unique immersive experience. \nCant help getting sucked into the old time british atmosphere, which is spot on. \n\nThe combination of a 1st worldwar submarine, its crew and strange aliens is very original and all the missions I have been on sofar reflects this in an interesting peculiar way.\n\nAfter getting familiar with the alternative controls, it gets really funny to play and the combination of resource management and action is really well balanced giving a good game experience.\n\nIt is definately worth your money giving you hours of great entertainment!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1497625151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 547, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197964946154", "num_games_owned": 53}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1498645642, "recommendationid": "32925840", "timestamp_created": 1498645642}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 8, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
