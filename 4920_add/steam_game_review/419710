When I say \"old-school\", I'm thinking of of Mario 64 or Super Mario Galaxy, Crash Bandicoot and Ratchet and Clank. Rogue Singularity has managed to emulate those games while still bringing in some uniqueness into the mix. This uniqueness comes not just from the speedrunning element, but also from the procedurally-generated levels; modern, colourful, sci-fi graphics; and a great soundtrack.\nMy one complaint is that while you can probably complete the main game in between 30-50 minutes, I am yet to finish due to how difficult it is at the very end. So I guess the complaint is with myself as the game's difficulty does increase at a steady rate. \nI would recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a nice-looking, replayable challenge.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1482744069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 233, "num_reviews": 69, "steamid": "76561198007988289", "num_games_owned": 516}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1482736767, "recommendationid": "28661873", "timestamp_created": 1482736767}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "total_reviews": 5, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
