{"reviews": [{"review": "As far as Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks go, this one is brutally hard, as the map of the house is extremely confusing, with many areas that result in certain death.  It isn't combat-intensive difficult (as is Caverns of the Snow Witch), but managing your Fear points can be tough.  There are several solutions to it to be found online, including maps, which you will need when you invariably become frustrated with it.  I bought this book originally in 1985 as a child, and never finished it successfully, unlike the 20-some odd other books I read in that era.  Tracking down all 30 achievements isn't a lot of fun either.  There were far more enjoyable books in this series from back in the day.  I hope Tin Man will put some more of those here on steam.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1505103140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 284, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198007102534", "num_games_owned": 236}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504192", "timestamp_updated": 1502614754, "recommendationid": "34209403", "timestamp_created": 1502614754}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "review_score": 7, "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 15, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
