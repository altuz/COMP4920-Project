The complete lack of ANY communication for TEN YEARS is completly disgusting, It is disrepectful to the fans who supported valve for years. Its sad that valve doesnt even have the courtesy to tell their fans that half life is dead. It is clear that we will never get a satisfying ending to an amazing story. I personally am not interested in anything valve has released since Episode 2, and if the single player story driven masterpieces of recent years are anything to go by, its that valve only cares about its games as service titles, and not their narative driven campaigns. I am deeply upset that we will never get to explore the atmospheric and exciting universe of half life again.

The Half Life series is one of the best in gaming history, if not the best. Perfect writing and story, fun gameplay, and simple yet intuitive puzzles. However, Valve has let greed take over their almost-perfect company. I totally  recommend this game, because it really is good and continues the great story; However, I am starting to dislike Valve's morales, so I'm going to give this game a thumbs down, more on that later. \n\n Valve is my favorite game company in the industry. It's brought many classics such as Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress, Counter Strike, etc., and of course.. Half Life. Half Life is one of my favorite games of all time, no doubt. However, as most people know by now, Marc Laidlaw has had enough of waiting around, and decided to not only leave Valve as a whole, but release the story of Half Life: Episode 3. I respect his decisions, as it has been long overdue. I also understand Valve's point-of-view as well, as i know it must be tiring working on the same game for many years. You look at Rockstar Games, known for their famous series, Grand Theft Auto. They work on other games besides GTA, because they want to expand. So, I understand that Valve wants to do the same as well. However, Half Life Episode 2 was released a DECADE ago.. Its time to bring it back or at the very least FINISH THE GAME. Now, from what Laidlaw has said, he was finished with Half Life once Episode 3 was going to be released, He was going to answer the last remaining questions and finish his story, and leave the game to future generations to expand the franchise, if need be. So, my only question is, why is it taking Valve so long?! The story is what makes Half Life, and Laidlaw not only had it written out, but was planning on finishing it for the time being. All Valve had to do was create one last Episode, and be done with the series, then go back to their behemoth multiplayer games. But, they let greed take over, and just put all time and effort into TF2, CS:GO, and DOTA. I think Valve should be ashamed, because Half Life is what brought them to this point, it created a huge community to help support Valve, by creating mods with the tools Valve gave them from the original Half Life. I guess Valve just thought that people would forget Half Life, because \"Hey kids, we have skins for your weapons and knives!\". Overall, Half Life is one of the best games that you could play, and Valve just seems to brush that compliment away. \nAt least Marc Laidlaw provided us with a written story, to end Half Life (for now). \n\nThank you, Marc Laidlaw."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504925865, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500629", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34827742", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198088566043", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1504828974, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 726}, "timestamp_updated": 1504926044, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is my first review of a game, only to tell you how high I think of Half Life. If Valve launched today, a HL3 or HL2ep3, on this same engine, I would buy at full price. The game is awesome, Half Life made Valve, Half Life CHANGED FOREVER THE PC GAMING. So you'd think they would treat this legacy, one of the biggest fan bases, with some respect, but now, over a decade we were mocked, every now and then a light about the next game would come and the HL fan base would go nuts over the possibility. But after seeing the whole thing with Black Mesa from the Crowbar Collective(must buy btw), and after the next game plot being posted online,  I fear that Half Life series are dead and buried. We did need the mod community to make a remake about the game that I repeat once again, changed forever the PC gaming, and it seems we will need them see more of Gordon Freeman, but that is not simple as doing a remake. Anyway, the game is awesome, one of the best that I ever played, worth every penny in full price,  but Valve/Steam don't deserve your money on this game. This review is my soapbox, and I want to talk about how shameful is this whole Half Life thing with Valve. Seriously, if they released today a sequence, I assure you, game of the year, record sales, name it and the game would get. But they seem to be more interested on robbing people blind with CS:GO(that would not exist without Half Life in the first place) and what not.\nHalf Life , Half Life: Source, Half Life: Blue Shift, Half Life: Oposing Force, Half Life: 2, Half Life 2: Episode One and Half Life 2: Episode Two: 11/10.
