I honestly enjoyed playing.\n\nHowever, despite the ability to unlock each new level as a starting location, the linear level progression left me feeling cold.  In later levels, earlier enemies are replaced with vastly different opposition.  Meanwhile, unlocked player abilities can't be used in earlier chapters.  While having each level bring its own challenge may yield variety, I never felt like I mastered the skills.\n\nDon't let the ascetics fool you into thinking Trino is a quick arcade fix of endless flow.  Instead, it is a long, defined set of varied, discrete, timed events.  While often satisfying, it may at times feel like a frustrating tutorial for a game that never begins."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1342182333, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498977", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "1309788", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197991161976", "num_reviews": 101, "last_played": 1342249200, "num_games_owned": 4682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 15}, "timestamp_updated": 1342182333, "received_for_free": false, "review": "\ud2b9\uc774\ud558\uace0 \uace0\uc720\ud55c '\uc0bc\uac01\ud615' \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5c8\uace0, \ud3f4\ub9ac\uc2f1\ub3c4 \ub098\ub984\ub300\ub85c \ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\ub2e4, \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774 '\uc778\ub514 \uac8c\uc784'\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uc778\uc2dd\ud560\ub9cc\ud55c \ub531 \uadf8\ub7f0 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uae30\ub3c4 \ud55c\ub370, \uc548\ud314\ub9b4\ub9cc \ud558\ub2e4."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1324104370, "weighted_vote_score": "4.996669", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "288905", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197967714806", "num_reviews": 261, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 22}, "timestamp_updated": 1324104370, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Box your enemies in to destroy them and get upgrades.\n\nIt can be entertaining, but is fairly shallow.

You make a triangled web (which can be upgraded) that has to capture enemies. The enemies occasionally leave behind green orbs (among upgrade and life orbs). The green orbs are used on certain points of the level border. Most of the time you have to unlock 6 or more of the points to end the level. Does it still make any sense ? Anyway, it starts off kinda fun, but the enemies in the later levels are too hard to capture, making it a frustrating experience. It's one of those games you play for several minutes, then probably never touch again. If you can get it cheap, give it a shot. Otherwise you aren't missing out on anything in my opinion.\n\n[Rating: 73/100]"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1368171473, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495846", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "74394", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197961167439", "num_reviews": 609, "last_played": 1368255600, "num_games_owned": 1339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 21}, "timestamp_updated": 1385413869, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Trino pits you as a flying sperm where you create triangles to capture enemies, eat their goo, and ultimately connect the dots around the border to complete each level.
