{"reviews": [{"review": "While this is amusing for the purpose of playing around, it's plagued with bugs, poor coding decisions, and is a right mess. Command keys such as Delete will just stop working randomly, wall placement and movement will randomly decide whether it wants to move the wall, move the wall and everything attached to it, move the wall but angle everything attached to it, et cetera, and object scaling will randomly decide whether to scale only the side you move, or to scale both sides at once. There doesn't appear to be a way to manually enter the scale of objects, and speaking of scale, EVERYTHING in the menus for objects is dead wrong, in terms of scale. Cabinets do not fit standard scale for pretty much anything, every fridge is exactly the size fridges aren't, the doors are all wrong, the stairs are a waking nightmare, and I've yet to see a couch that isn't a bad joke. Wall height can only be adjusted in certain places, and there's no way to cap reduced-height walls, there's no shelf-fill, there's no ceiling option, and \"rooms\" properly \"Fill\" the floor and ceiling themselves only about 50% of the time, ultimately filling a floor that cannot be split, so if your \"room\" initializes improperly across multiple spaces, or a wall is put in after the fact, the wall you attach it to will split, but the floor will not.\n\nUltimately I think this utility could be interesting. Maybe with a LOT more work, and perhaps a team to go over this sort of thing to ensure proper scaling, and proper fitting of pretty much everything involved(Including fixing the default wall thickness, as only masonry walls typically hit the 8 inch mark). But as it stands right now? It's a cesspit in dire need of a floor-to-ceiling rework.\n\nAssuming the ceiling even fills in properly.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1507101671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 759, "playtime_forever": 759, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561197975073452", "num_games_owned": 716}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "6", "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "timestamp_updated": 1507102072, "recommendationid": "35465316", "timestamp_created": 1507102072}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 64, "review_score": 5, "total_negative": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 102, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
