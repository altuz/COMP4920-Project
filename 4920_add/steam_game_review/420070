Although sort, the conept behind the game is pretty hilarious.  The game is a nice mix between a platformer and a puzzle game, reuqiring you to utilize the enemies at your dispsal to kill the plumber.  The game only suffers from a few levels where collecting all of the optional stars requires some unintuitive use of the terain or enemies available.  For a casual player, you will likely not experience this.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers and puzzle games, while not looking for anything that requires intense levels of skills or a significant time investment.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198046611459", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1467954123, "num_games_owned": 195, "playtime_forever": 214}}], "success": 1}
