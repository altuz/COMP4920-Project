The turnoff on this game for me is that there is only one dictionary, and so it's hard to actually guess what word the game is asking you to spell. However, if you're very wordy, you won't find any difficulty jumping right into this game (you don't actually have to follow the game's reccomendations, you just can't accidentally gather a letter that isn't going to spell a word).
