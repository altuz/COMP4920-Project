I personally prefer those moments where you have a crew with a good sense of humor than to just win the round. With such a crew, it doesn't even matter if your ship is sinking and everything is going down the drain, You'll laugh loudly in the process and have the time of your life. These moments have been fairly common to me while playing, but it all comes down to using the mic yourself and at least let out a \"yaaar\" once in a while. \n\nYou don't have to be social in Blackwake, and it's possible to play the game without the use of a microphone. but the game is made with communication in mind so it's a must if you want to get the full experience. Other players are mostly happy as long as you're able to tell your crew that you need supplies downstairs, follow captains orders and basic stuff like that.\n\nTo be somewhat effective in this game, you really need a captain that knows what they're doing and a crew that are willing to do the orders they bark out. Playing as a crew member you'll be spending your time scouting for eneny ships, firing and reloading cannons and repairing the ship, sails and killing erupting fire with buckets of water..The tasks are simple but when those cannonballs start flying through your ship and you run around working those holes, you'll be thankful for the simplicity, because it can get pretty intense, at least with a headset. There's also the possibility of locking down enemy ships with grappling hooks to finish it off and the other way around. Ths is where your weapons get useful\n\nPlaying as the captain of a ship is different and in some sense more challenging than crew member. You'll need some ability to manage multiple people and tell them what to do and when to do it. And you MUST have a microphone and the will to use it if/when playing as captain on populated servers. Nobody likes a silent captain. Good captains keep the crew informed about their actions in time for the crew to be prepared and ready..\n\nYou'll spend most of your time in one position steering the ship in position to fire the broadside cannons on the enemy as well as evading incoming threats by staying out of their range and the angle of their devastating broadside cannons. This is the easy part. The real challenge isn't that or the enemy ships, it's your crew and how you manage it. The difference between firing off a full broadside at the right moment and individual cannons firing off cannonballs at their own convenience is the difference between winning a round or losing it.  Take control and demand respect. Your crew should only fire the cannons when you say so. \n\nIt's a type of game I jump in and out of for an hour or two rather than a game I play for full evenings and nights, but I fully recommend this game for its simple yet amazing gameplay and hilarious approach.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561197980916444", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 86, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1507068349, "num_games_owned": 69, "playtime_forever": 1297}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505488574, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510972", "timestamp_updated": 1505488574, "recommendationid": "34974414", "votes_up": 7, "review": "Really great game, lots of fun with friends.
