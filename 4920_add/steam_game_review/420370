It starts out super easy and gets more challenging with each level as it adds more game mechanics and puzzles. Often the Lumies are very tricky to get, so it requires quite a bit of thinking and puzzle-solving if you want to get them all. \nThe game has a nice sense of player knowledge progression to it. The more you play it the better you get at mastering the game's mechanics. The controls are as intuitive as it gets - easy to learn, hard to master. The only problem I had was in the menu options where I couldn't exit the options menu, but it wasn't a problem after all since I could start the game regardless and the option menu closed automatically. Music and sound are really cute and blend well with the game's aesthetics. Loading times in this game are pretty much non-existent which makes it a nice filler game, ideal for a quick break inbetween tasks.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561197989569103", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1474889421, "num_games_owned": 114, "playtime_forever": 101}}, {"timestamp_created": 1474533380, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503208", "timestamp_updated": 1474533380, "recommendationid": "25631864", "votes_up": 4, "review": "[h1]Really cute plattformer game![/h1]\nThe charming graphics lead through a whole bunch of cool worlds and levels in diverse styles, which keep you quite bussy while solving them all.\nThanks to the direct, intuitive controlls it plays pretty neat and feels captivating over the whole game, so you can focus on letting the gravity shifts play with your mind.
