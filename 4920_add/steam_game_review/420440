It's fun to play.\n\nThe Meh: The graphics aren't great; serviceable, but not outstanding.\n\nThe Bad: The damage models aren't accurate, at all. The armor models are even less accurate. The ships all fire at the same rate. A battleship's 16-inch guns fire at the same rate as a destroyer's 4.5-inch guns.\n\nThe Ugly: The UI is terrible.\n\nBottom Line: If you're looking for a sim, keep looking. If you're looking to have fun, you've found it.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198008265397", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1502485869, "num_games_owned": 195, "playtime_forever": 850}}, {"timestamp_created": 1504031840, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "timestamp_updated": 1504031840, "recommendationid": "34584786", "votes_up": 4, "review": "Submarines are a little too OP against destroyers, AI makes some poor choices (like bringing a Nelson BB to the battle with only 1 DD escort) Game lacks a sandbox battle mode or 2p hotseat mode, scenarios are very small battles, kinda wish they included some big fleet actions or fictional battles.
