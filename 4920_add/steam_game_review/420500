Mechanics are not explained well despite their being a minor tutorial level. Sound effects and voice work is very rough. While I enjoy the creator of this its not quite a game id recommend maybe put it in alpha and flesh out things doesn't feel like a finished product. The genre of a throwback to games I grew up with though has a nice tough though, however I feel that genre is a pretty niche to dead market. This game if a few things are fixed may work well on a mobile device though like a ipad or phone.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561197976945057", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 82, "last_played": 1500142595, "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 8}}], "success": 1}
