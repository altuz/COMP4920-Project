It's so addicting and so much fun that this game would make a great center piece attraction for any party or get together!\n\nMuch like Pacman Championship Edition DX brilliantly took Pacman into the 21st century with it's high adrenaline and furious gameplay, Cubixx HD does the exact same thing for another 80s arcade classic called \"Qix\".  This is a brilliant and expertly designed and programmed remake of the popular 80's arcade classic \"Qix\" with more facets, more enemies, and more high octane fuse-burning action than Qix ever dreamed of!\n\nAwesome!  Even if this game was $25 USD, it would still be a bargain!  Highly recommended, scoring a 95% score from me in my video review, and getting one of my rare \"MUST BUY!\" suggestions!  My first personal candidate for \"Game of the Year\" on the PC in 2016!  ^5 to Laughing Jackal for brilliantly bringing one of my favorite old arcade games from the Commodore 64 to today's PC in style and modern, epic cool gaming flavor!", "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 2, "votes_down": 5, "author": {"steamid": "76561198053422627", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 292, "last_played": 1454629314, "num_games_owned": 955, "playtime_forever": 328}}, {"timestamp_created": 1484032244, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195", "timestamp_updated": 1484032244, "recommendationid": "29157043", "votes_up": 5, "review": "I used to play this game on PS3 years ago.
