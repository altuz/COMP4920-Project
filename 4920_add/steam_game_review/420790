It has a very interesting concept: there is no penalty for having more players. Trying to solo any single area will almost always result in death so you must always group together. The graphics quality might discourage you at first, but don't judge this game by the art style. Where the game is strongest is in concepts for weapons, enemies, areas, and(even though there are only four)very diverse classes. They aren't cookie-cutter classes because each class has some elements of the steriotypical classes(tank, glass cannon, etc.)which makes each class fun and new to play.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nStarBreak is a very fun sidescroller MMO that has very new and original ideas, and is definitely worth a try('specially 'cause it's free)", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198151486749", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 149, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1506892676, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_forever": 1812}}, {"timestamp_created": 1487746345, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503470", "timestamp_updated": 1487749422, "recommendationid": "30094136", "votes_up": 5, "review": "Once again, negative reviews have playtimes with 1.1 hours/2.0 hours. Completely bias and unfair to the game.\nThis is a weird game. Never have I played a roguelike MMO, and never have I been so satisfied platforming with multiple people. You don't know anyone, but you get into runs with people and there is an unspoken team effort that will carry you from the midboss, all the way to death at the boss.\nSometimes It can be challenging with a million things exploding on the screen/damage numbers flying all over the place. I recommend turning off ally damage numbers in the options menu. I would also like to see an addition to the game where you can limit the opacity of teammates. If you take your eyes of your character, you will die.\nStarbreak is challenging, but not unfair. You can leave an area at any time. Every level has multiple sections, so if you continue with 26/90 health and you die that's your fault and no one elses. Dying results in your character's permanent death, as well as any gear he/she had equipped. There is a stash that exists for item storage between characters.\nBosses are insane.\nThe characters consist of a shooter, a tank, melee puss puss, and a platform creating robot. I'm still pretty early in the game, so I have yet to unlock the last character. However, the characters all have personality and their skills are appropriately designed for their respective roles. It's nice to see diversity in such a small MMO.\nLoot is great, only one pickup can mean the difference between decent damage and holy-crap-did-you-see-that?", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561197995377749", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1488517194, "num_games_owned": 325, "playtime_forever": 1364}}, {"timestamp_created": 1486572982, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501188", "timestamp_updated": 1491350779, "recommendationid": "29785208", "votes_up": 3, "review": "Fun and addicting.
