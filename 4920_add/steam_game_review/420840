The others are splendid cosmic particle experiences, but this one is a pretty fun and addicting game. It's kind of like inverted Qix, in VR, and plays perfectly to the medium. Also a game that you can play as a meditative experience with the right music, and not try to go for the high score -- it's very relaxing.
