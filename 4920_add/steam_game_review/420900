Easy to play, fun. \n\nPros\n-If you have people for LAN\n-Like Controller Games\n-Like Top-down Games/Arenas\n-Does have online function, though you might be waiting for new players new release.\nCons\n-Brand new, no sale yet, so be a while before other players.\n-Bots get boring even in hardest setting. Although they are a great way to practice.\n-Possibly no newer content, abilities using buttons with be nice.\n-Can get boring from repetitive in general. But I can see myself logging in a few times a day to play.\n\nOverall, great game. Just needs new features and if you are hesistant to pay, wait for a sale.", "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 2, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561198059585890", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1458046449, "num_games_owned": 83, "playtime_forever": 81}}, {"timestamp_created": 1458073007, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500615", "timestamp_updated": 1458073007, "recommendationid": "21858336", "votes_up": 3, "review": "A fun, addictive little game.
