I rarely even look at mixed review games but glad I did! The sale price of $2 put me off because I'm cheap and not typically into these rouge-likes but the presentation actually caught my eye. Reminded me of classic old games like the Exile series and the DOS game days.\n\nI then learned you can download the standard edition for free at their website so I played a game and I really like it. ToME is one of the few others that feel like this game in some core ways. Its very true to NEShack and Rogue. I find the art style nice and the interface welcoming. I like its not a very involved game and seriously has a casual feel to it. Character creation is outstanding! This is Daggerfall level CC cool easily, folks. Build pretty much any character you wish.\n\nTraps, bolders, poisonous monsters, fishing, merchants, skill books, alchemy, crafting (with perk), magic wands, scrolls, potions, crap tons of spells, secret doors... there's a lot packed into this game and its clearly well thought out. I've only played 2 games but man I really like this.\n\nVery old game though. If you're not old or into classic looking game you will instantly dislike this. There's also some issues with the mouse like dragging and dropping skills to the quickbar. Its unfortunate and super frustering to the point I will complain on the forums.\n\nBottom line you can totally tell this was a late 90s project that started with a few friends that made it in their spare time, improved it over the years and eventually said 'hey lets put this on steam to make a few extra dollars!' And I am completely happy they did. Charming game. Difficult. Not super polished. Overall I would recomend it to people who enjoy these types of games and old school dungeon crawlers. I give this cool find a 4 outta 5!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198025153924", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "last_played": 1500303867, "num_games_owned": 108, "playtime_forever": 87}}], "success": 1}
