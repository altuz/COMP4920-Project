The story is pretty interesting with some funny twists. It has an ecchi undertone that is constantly in the background of the story, however nothing really gets serious. It has no nudity but plenty of big titt shots and barely clothed titty monsters. \n\nStory 7/10\nThe story is about a kid who loses his parents in a fire then goes to live with his grandfather that is a scientist that has created a time machine. He hires scores of young titty monsters to work for him so they can help stabilize history? It\u2019s kind of eh, but this makes for the interesting dynamic of going to many different settings.  The game really does not have an ending so you need to get Time Tenshi 2 to complete it.\n\nArt 5/10\nIt is not atrocious like some western VNs I\u2019ve played, but its downfall is the lack of varying character poses and outfits. They reuse the same 10s of character art throughout the game which gets a little too repetitive for my liking. I could look past this if there was some voice acting to further convey emotions of the characters but sadly there is none.\n\nMusic 7/10\nVery enjoyable music that has a vapor wave/jazzy sound to it with the tense moments having a dystopian sound, again just wish there was more variation.\n\nMizuki best girl.\nMichelle a discount Poison and a thot.\nRose a titted paladin knight.\nKyo a big-titted gamer/crybaby.\n\nTakeaway from game: Never trust a thot.\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198041912031", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "last_played": 1496379600, "num_games_owned": 425, "playtime_forever": 1050}}], "success": 1}
