If you're instead looking for a decent single player compaign, you're playing with a controller, or Dirt Rally is a little too punishing, I think Dirt 4 is a great choice.\n\nRegarding driving physics: I'd say Dirt 4 is a bit more difficult than Forza / Gran Turismo, and is significantly more difficult than Dirt 1-3. It's not a simulation (Dirt Rally is a better sim), but the feel of 4 wheels on the ground is great, and the differences between FWD, RWD, and AWD cars are pronounced.\n\nWhere Dirt 4 impressed me is in its single player experience. I'm always craving a good racing campaign, and other games have been letting me down recently. Dirt 4's campaign isn't \"incredible\", but I think it's pretty fresh. Since rally stages are randomized, it's not a game about memorizing tracks, which distinguishes the game right away. I like that my AI opponents' times have variety, and sometimes the leading AI will screw up and give opportunities for a comeback. Money is doled out at a good pace, but I don't get flooded with cash. There is also enough choice in what cars to purchase that I can focus on a certain drivetrain or class, or branch out for variety. None of this is groundbreaking, but Codemasters made smart choices and did a good job balancing the game.\n\nI also appreciate the little touches, like needing to slow down my car after the finish line, weather screwing with my co-driver's radio, etc, that helps break the monotony that other racing games suffer from.\n\nThe game does have noticeable shortcomings. I like randomized tracks, but you see tiles repeat a lot and the game could use more track content. The graphics range from decent to last-gen, and the foliage is uglier than Dirt Rally's (weird!). The multiplayer experience is unfortunately pretty bare-bones; the community time-trials are nice, but beyond that I don't bother with it.\n\nAll-in-all, Dirt 4 scratches my rally itch better than Dirt 1-3 did.

If you've played DiRT Rally throughly, you're going to be frustrated by this game. To be fair DR was frustrating at the start as well (IMO), but it grew on me and I came to enjoy DR. At the moment D4 doesn't give me the same excitment as DR did once I learned the handling. I've only played this game on simulation so I can't say how the gamer mode feels and maybe just swtiching to that would make this game fun for me. That is not the mode I want to play in though. I've only played Rally and RX so below pertains to those only.\n\nWhat I like about this game:\n[list]\n[*] The randomly generated tracks \n[*] Career mode has much more detail than DR does\n[*] RX seems improved from DR\n[*] FFB feels good, the issue from DR where by alt-tabbing/using the keyboard in the game would reset the soft lock on your wheel is gone.\n[*] Handling on snow is improved, your car is not skating around like it does in DR\n[*] Tuning menu has been refined from DR\n[*] Part durability and repairing the vechicle is more engaging than DR\n[*] Replay options\n[*] Lights that don't break easily\n[*] Land Rush handling feels great on dry tracks\n[/list]\n\nWhat needs to be improved:\n[list]\n[*] The AI times are WR on specific cars/track/difficulty combinations and at other times you can win comfortably\n[*] No sense of speed. Even at WOT the game just isn't exciting like DR is.\n[*] Lack of locations. This is made worse by the repetitive track generation.\n[*] The lack of different tiles the tracks are generated from. Get ready to see the same corner combinations over and over.\n[*] The default tuning is bad, expect to spend lots of time tuning. This is especially bad when you're completing a Daily where you cannot edit the setups.\n[*] Multiplayer is dead to pubs. There are people, but you're going to have to find them via the steam discussions, CM forums, or reddit. Don't expect to queue up a race whenever you want.\n[*] The co-driver callouts. There's a lot to be said on this topic. The callouts can be wrong, they can be given way too late depending on the course, and get ready to hear 'bump' every 2 secs. The excessive bump calls make it hard to not just begin ignoring the callouts.\n[*] The handling on AU. This could just be me, but I feel as if every car has no traction.\n[*] Get ready to deal with children as part of your team. Only applies to career mode. Dumb things that drag down your ability to tune the vehicles.\n[*] Limited save slots for tuning. You get 4 per car. FOUR.\n[*] CM support just disappeared after release. Zero input from the community taken on issues that were not immediate/obvious bugs.\n\nAt this point in time, I can't recommend this game at full price. Wait for a 50% off sale. If you have not played DR, get that instead. This is a sad entry for a Dirt title. Dirt 2 is by far a more exciting game to play than this and you get much more content and tracks. There's a 'Clubs' update that is supposed to be added to this game, I can only hope that CM adds and makes some changes to the game then. I'll recommend this game only if you have every other Dirt title and you just need to have a complete collection, but dont pay full price for it. I give this game a 7 out of 10 assuming you haven't played DR before this.\n\n\n", "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561197961174854", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1506285973, "num_games_owned": 278, "playtime_forever": 2745}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505280515, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507922", "timestamp_updated": 1505280515, "recommendationid": "34913694", "votes_up": 10, "review": "I've thought a lot about this since I bought the game. \n\nPros: \n\n- Team management is the best in the Dirt series so far. \n- The cars and overall graphics are beautiful.\n- Physics is improved overall.\n\nCon:\n\n- Tracks are very repetitive due to the process being automated.

Last stretch of the final Spanish Rallye stage. I am in 2nd place, I need to catch up with the leader by 5 seconds. That spin at the start really messed me over, I think, as I slam and lock the brakes, and gently slide into a right 2. The flat-4 of my 2001 Impreza howls angrily as I try to be even more aggressive. At this point, it's all about taking every corner with full speed. I doubt I can keep this up for the remaining 2km or so, for I have not yet gotten a good grip on the new handling model.\n\"Rechts 3, durch Senke, in sofort Kehre links.\" (Right 3, through dip, into immediate hairpin left) My German co-driver exclaims. The suspension just about keeps the car stable and I manage to navigate through this section. Not much left now. I hit full throttle, about to jump over a crest. Then, suddenly, a massive flock of pigeons, startled by the engine, takes flight from the left-hand bank, blocking my vision for a second. Barely, I avoid smashing the car to pieces as I slide into a right 1 turn. But not unscathed. My windshield cannot absorb the force, and it slowly and gradually cracks before my eyes. Just fucking great, I note to myself.\n\"\u00dcber Kuppe, rechts 3, in sofort Kehre links.\" (Over crest, right 3, into immediate hairpin left) I follow my co-driver's commands again, until he suddenly adds...\n\"Achtung, Gefahr voraus.\" (Watch out, danger ahead.) \nMy eyes shoot up. Above me, standing on a tall bank ahead, a man frantically waves at me. Only now I notice the little breakdown triangle at the exit of the hairpin. I see smoke. Instantly, I swing my wheel around to the right, narrowly shooting past a broken-down car. Out of the corner of my eye, I manage to pick up the flag and nameplate. Belgium, L. Goossens. Somewhat smirking, I let off the gas a little bit, finishing the stage without any further incidents. That was the guy in front of me. Not anymore. Engine failure. I drive up to the marshall and get my time confirmed. I am in 1st place, taking the win after all. Smiling, I lean back. \"That was pretty cool.\" I note, before proceeding to watch the replay and then take a break.[/i]\n__\n\nSo, how's that for a little story, eh? When DiRT 4 shines, boy does it do it brightly! Compared to how sterile the stages in DiRT Rally felt, as if you were racing against ghosts with robots cheering you on, this is a revelation. It feels vibrant and immersive. Much, much better than DiRT Rally.\n\nAlright, alright, I may have sugar-coated some things here. The flock of birds (just like all the \"animal encounters\" on the stages) were very noticeably poorly animated, muddy sprites. And apparently, L. Goossens drives without a co-driver. There was only his name and country flag on the car, no one else's. \nBut I can ignore that. For window-dressing in a racing game, all of this is brilliant stuff. Codemasters obviously knew what they wanted to do with the Rally aspect, and even though the whole sponsors aspect feels very tacked on, I get a little bit of a GRID vibe. Those were the days...\nBut we have advanced from those days, and in 2017 with DiRT 4, Codies tried something extremely, utterly, one might say foolishly ambitious: Letting you choose freely between arcade AND simulation physics, so that DiRT Rally veterans and newcomers without \"enthusiast gear\" alike could enjoy some Rally, RallyX and Landrush.\n\n\"You can't please everyone.\" And, sadly, I do believe this is very fittingly DiRT 4's tagline.\n\nNow, let's get one thing out of the way first:\nIf you are a casual gamer using keyboard or gamepad, someone who enjoyed DiRT 3 a lot and is looking for a more refined experience with some really cool additions, you absolutely have my recommendation to buy this game. Put it on \"Gamer\" handling and blast off! Though I would advise waiting for a sale, like I did, because after all, we are talking about 50% of the game's experience here. And this is the only reason I am giving it a positive review, because it does do enough things well to warrant this. Certainly on \"Gamer\" handling.\n\nHowever, as soon as you own wheel & pedals and plan to use them (obviously you want to use \"Simulation\" handling, too), I really do not think this game will be something you are going to write home about. Not at all.\nLook, I do not even want to argue about this. If you're coming here to tell me that \"It's not DiRT Rally 2, you idiot\", then you can sod right off. I'm sorry, but Codemasters Chief Designer, Paul Coleman, literally said, and I quote:\n\n\"We are taking everything we learned with DiRT Rally and using that as our foundation. That means we are taking our simulation engine, improving it and building everything else on top of that. We are then taking everything we loved about all the other games in the franchise and bringing it all together into a much more coherent package.\"\n\nI honestly do not know how this happened, but they messed up big time. So much so that I almost want to consider Coleman a liar, at this point. Despite this being the same engine and apparently the same foundation, every single RWD, a lot of AWD and some FWD cars feel just awful.\nCars have weight now, yes, that is awesome. You can't just lock the brakes and come to a halt on gravel anymore. Now your rear will just spin and you are most likely going to wrap the car around a tree.\nBut the rest just feels off. \n\nAnd now it's time to say this: I am not a Rally driver. I have never driven a Rally nor a racing car before. When it comes to those beasts, I am an armchair racer. But what I have done was drive FWD, RWD and AWD road cars under every condition there is. Just a few days ago, and we're talking real life here, I hit the gas a bit early in a modern BMW whilst turning into a \"left 1\" on dry tarmac. Guess what happened? The rear got really nervous and skidded a bit, despite all assists obiously turned on. That car has 180bhp, btw.\nAnd in DiRT 4, I can take a 70s Opel Kadett with 200bhp (naturally not a single assist enabled) and it will UNDERSTEER under power on gravel. Yeah, you read that right. I did do a comparison with DiRT Rally later, and the car indeed behaved completely different there. Still not 100% accurate, of course, but it had a nervous rear axis and continously spun when given full throttle out of a corner. Apparently, it is possible to recreate a similar handling to DiRT Rally by messing with the (very detailed) tuning options. This would be a very big plus, would the default setups not suck doodoo. Realistically speaking, you'd have to take every single of your 10 Shakedowns to eke out a \"drivable\" setup. \n\nAnd, in my mind, this is not how it should be.\n\nThere are other problems with this game, definitely. The stage generator for example, and the mostly uninspired crap it spits out. The disgraceful FFB that is just barely usable without adjustments (On the contrary to DiRT Rally, which had decent default settings). Or the horrendous menu design (Why the fuck do I need to back out of the Events and return 3 menus to access my team, only to go back into 3 more menus to access the Event screen again?!).\n\nBut at this point, the review is getting too long, and you can easily read into other reviewers' thoughts on this. I do sincerely hope that Codemasters have not abandoned this game, now that F1 2017 is released and no more game are planned to come out this year from them, I believe. I really do. Perhaps we might get some adjustments that will make this game just as challenging and fun on the sim mode as DiRT Rally was by default. But until then, I would advise against a purchase if you are a simmer. Normally I'd advise to go for a trial & refund but the game needs far over 2hrs to show you its flaws, in my opinion.\n\nAs for me, I will play it some more. Perhaps dig more into Landrush and RX, though these never overly captivated me. But, one thing is certain for me: As it stands now, DiRT 4 will not earn a place in my heart like DR or DiRT3.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198143192580", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506024769, "num_games_owned": 141, "playtime_forever": 2138}}, {"timestamp_created": 1507131662, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1507131662, "recommendationid": "35474371", "votes_up": 1, "review": "it is a very good game", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198168370598", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505749747, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_forever": 3587}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505657540, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499661", "timestamp_updated": 1505657540, "recommendationid": "35024481", "votes_up": 2, "review": "Better then Dirt 3, Not as good as Dirt Rally.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198032777621", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505766197, "num_games_owned": 243, "playtime_forever": 2321}}, {"timestamp_created": 1504666539, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1504666539, "recommendationid": "34768554", "votes_up": 2, "review": "Fun game when you are bored", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198351745396", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505591447, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 1560}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505153868, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502605", "timestamp_updated": 1505153868, "recommendationid": "34887772", "votes_up": 3, "review": "I've played the original Dirt, Dirt Rally, and now Dirt 4.

I'm not sure who would think that a randomly generated track could be as fun as a track made by an intelligent and creative game designer.  Also, the graphics aren't even as good as Dirt Rally.

Simulation mode didn't really feel all that different from gamer mode. I use the handbrake, but for some reason these cars still automatically correct themselves. The stages are also extremely repetitive, with slight variations in some sections, but ultimately the same thing.\n\nIf you like this game, more power to you.
