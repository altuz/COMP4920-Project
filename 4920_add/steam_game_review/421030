My brain hurts when I see rope appearing out of the air. Is it just me? Come on!\n-Lack of tricks. There are 6 magic tricks. All of them are awesome! But... Just 6?! Come on!\n-Lack of guards. Nothing to explain here.\n-Losing connection. When I get all the coins and unlocking the last safe, I suddenly het the network connection error and I have to do everything again. This annoys me too much.\n-You can't skip the results after the \"performance\". This is very annoying.\n\nEverything else is great. Buy it!
