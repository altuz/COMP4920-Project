You can just watch your little blue guys collect food as your dogs scare away unwanted animals from stealing your stuff. I do feel like it's a little overpriced for the amount of content there. It's nice to think that your little buddies will keep up with the farm while you are away. I would suggest this on sale to anyone who wants to play a nice little clicker game.\n\n[b] This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: [/b]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\n\nOnce we have a 100 followers on our group there will be a game giveaway, but only the followers have a chance to win. \n\nIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

Don't believe me? Here is a picture.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/jAtyP5j\n\nBut if there were no malware, would it still be a good game?No. The game has no depth. You will unlock all plants and animals by level 20 which is very easy to do in an hour or 2. After that you just get stars for said plants and animals  for leveling up to get extra money from them. You have to BUY offline progression which only give you up to a level and 100m. The space for your farm is limited and there is no form of soft reset for this to go faster other than paying for multiplyers. Finally, all items cost are capped at 99m.\n\nThere is no sense of progression. You just get subtle changes like an extra dollar on a product or an extra 1X multiplier on all items which feels meaningless. I'm at level 241 and I feel progress has somewhat increase, but it's not enough.\n\nIf you really wanted to play a quick idle game just go on Kongregate. If you want to play a good idle game, play Clicker Heros, AdVenture Capitalist or Cookie Clicker. And if you really want to play this game, don't even buy this game on steam, just get the app for FREE or even on Newgrounds which is also FREE. \n\n\nDon't play this game.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561198054579237", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505693659, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 12312}}], "success": 1}
