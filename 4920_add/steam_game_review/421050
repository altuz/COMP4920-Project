It's a bit tedious with the gameplay, but I can't bring myself to dislike the story... Or even the ending.\n\nIn America, we're used to happy endings. Almost all movies and books end with a happy ending, and Goodbye Deponia didn't have one. It caused outrage from the fans. We grew to love these characters, and yet the ending wasn't what we wanted. So Daedlic Entertainment created this game... In a way, from the very beginning, it was a giant middle finger to the naysayers. \nIt's still very funny, and in my opinion worth playing (though, admittedly, with a walkthrough, cause things are just not that obvious this time around), however there will be a lot of people who dislike it. It does not have an all-around happy ending for the original pair. However, previously, it was disappointing. This time, it was somehow... poetic. From an artists point of view, it's majestic. From the fans' point of view, it probably won't be. That's why there's so many mixed reviews... That, and, probably people are tired of the timeloops.\n\n\n****SPOILER BELOW**** \n\n\n\nThe difference here, is, Goal gets to say goodbye to Rufus...

There were some less fluid bits and sometimes too easy puzzles, but storywise, it was stronger than previous parts (as any final chapter of any story should be). It strung very well on nostalgic feeling toward old characters and locations, while not overusing them all - just to keep things familiar and beliavable, and there was a lot of new things so it feels like a new game. It is also commendable how well executed was whole time travel theme, both in terms of gameplay and keeping logic of story, and of course of jokes. Overall its short game, like 15 hours tops, but with a lot of love put into it. So I strongly recommend it, after playing previous parts.\nIn the end, hardest part was to let go. And I did.

(I even bought them up to four times due to an unfortunate real-life adventure. :D )\n\nDeponia 1-3 was great and I am one of those unthankful idiots that was disappointed in the ending. I guess life has the most unhappy endings, so I wish for happy ones in made-up stories, okay? ;)\nI waited long until I finally purchased Deponia Doomsday and I thought it was nice that they gave Rufus another chance. Yes, he's a pain in the a**, but still quite a fun character I grew fond of.\nSo yeay, another Rufus maneuver, another chance to make things right....right?\n\nFar from that. I agree with other players here that it doesn't really fit into the whole Deponia story, that it feels a little bit like a desperate attempt to fix something and then in the end only wanting to directly punch everyone in the face. I could hear the devs laughing, while I watched the credits puzzled and thought: \"That's it? Seriously?\"\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are nice riddles, the familiar scenery of Deponia, you finally get to Elysium (*cough, cough* only to destroy it *cough* Darn it, Ronny!), there's Goal and close to the end the story takes a turn that makes your head ache. No, there's nothing missing that makes it a nice point-and-click adventure. But I felt like the title \"Doomsday\" couldn't have fit any better. At some point I think the devs just stopped caring. For example Rufus walks over a dead pigeon several times...maybe funny, but rather lines up with all the jokes that really went to far in this one. It just keeps going, Rufus is sometimes so awfully rude and annoying that I wished I had an option to change his attitude after all. Plus you don't really want Goal and Rufus to be together, because you want to spare her from this unbelievable douchebag.\nAnd then basically all other characters you knew don't exist in this one. No Bozo, only a little bit of Lotti at the beginning and (thank god) only a small part for Cletus as well. \n\nAnd after going through this really effed up portal madness you get to the ending, only to find out that this must be the most disappointing revival of a protagonist in a game ever. I hated it. And of course now they made sure that there is no chance for Rufus to return ever again. (You read that right. Finito!)\n\nSorry Daedalic, I love you but this was no big fun to go through. \nI still recommend it, if you're into point-and-clicks and twisted stories. Also I guess this would work without playing the trilogy first...maybe that would even be more fun.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198328861212", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1504901630, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 939}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505870610, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499435", "timestamp_updated": 1505870610, "recommendationid": "35075286", "votes_up": 2, "review": "I wish there was an in between option for this game as I did enjoy it but it was not without some flaws.
