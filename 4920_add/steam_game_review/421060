Do it badly/slowly and they start beating up your base, do it well and you start to dominate all three lanes and kill everything as soon as it appears on screen. The lanes mostly fight against others in the same lane, but some units are designed to use dominance of one lane to give you a boost in another - like the bomber which is useless if you don't have aerial supremacy, but can be powerful at clearing zeppelins and ground forces if you do.\n\nThe base gameplay then works fine, and make an interesting lite-RTS style experience where you build units, upgrade your base to build more unit types, or research upgrades to existing units, all while fending off the enemy attacks. Unfortunately similar to RTS games each new level you start again from scratch, which has never been something I am keen on as it can makes levels fairly repetitive, especially later on when you have the same 15 techs to get as last time before getting a new 16th tech and finally get to do something a bit new.\n\nAnother issue in the game is some unit types aiming ability - most units fire straight ahead, but then bullets curve downwards, and no one ever learns to adjust for this and fires up slightly, meaning some units that seeming have long range actually can only hit things immediately in front of them, and some units are much more vulnerable and weak purely because they have some part of their design that drops \"below the waterline\" of where units shot in each lane.\n\nThere is a main campaign where you unlock new units as you go along, and there is a story to give it all background which was passable but no more, and missions have some variety of objectives - make a certain amount of resources, build a certain tech/upgrade/unit, kill a number of enemies, survive a certain time, etc.\n\nThere is also a survival mode where you can sit there and slowly the amount of enemy units sent against you increases and eventually overwhelms you, I can't say I played this mode much as it didn't really feel much different to playing any of the later levels of the game for the initial stages, then you wait around a while once you have all the techs/units/excess resources you can get for the enemy forces to ramp up, then eventually there is another interesting bit where they start to break through but you can hold on by making the right choices, but that tends to only last a few minutes before the enemy adds even more forces and then nothing you can do holds them back.\n\nOverall it is fairly decent, a bit innovative in it's approach, nice to look at, but has a few flaws/frustrations that stop it really being something special.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971341065", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 94, "last_played": 1483225998, "num_games_owned": 2716, "playtime_forever": 828}}], "success": 1}
