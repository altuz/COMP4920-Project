Visual storytelling at its best of course. I will say that the human sfx was a bit distracting when viewing such an alien world. I would have preferred more surreal sound design rather than the whimsical whoosh and whistle.\n\nIf you know anything about Floex, you'll agree that he's outdone himself this time! Machinarium used to be my bar for indie game scores but this one is simply much more fanstastic!\n\nIf you've enjoyed any of Amanita's previous games, this one's a no-brainer!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197990835108", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 372, "num_reviews": 40, "last_played": 1506225839, "num_games_owned": 397, "playtime_forever": 424}}], "success": 1}
