Also harder than it looks, even on easy difficulty. Suffers a little from unforgiving RNG which can sometimes feel unfair.\n\nThe game mechanics are pretty straightforward and turn based, there are two separate parts to the game, the strategic part where you collect resources which you spend on upgrades to your kingdom or recruiting and upgrading new units. Random events pop up which allow you to go questing or seach for resources or treasure items that you can equip to your soldiers, or you can focus on healing your units or researching new technology. Or you can choose to fight tactical battles against the enemies, which you have to fight before your kingdom gets overrun.\n\nThe tactical battles are played on a relatively small grid filled with terrain obstructions. Placement of units seems fairly random and there doesn't seem to be any way to set a formation for your units to stay in. You can get badly screwed by initial placement pretty easily especially if you're going with a team of glass cannons like rogues and mages. I've only played about an hour but so far I found these battles pretty tough. The enemies are equivalent if not superior to all the units available to you at the start, so you'll need to team up and at least plan to use 2 units of your own for every 1 enemy, and even then it can be a close thing if the RNG goes their way.\n\nAnyway, it's a challenging but fun game with a surprising amount of depth, and it's cheap.
