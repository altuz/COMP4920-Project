Its a dark puzzle game which has seen me gassed, spiked, sliced open with a swinging axe thing, burnt to dead and fallen into the dark abyss below.  I'l be honest i was surprised by how much I liked this game.\n\nFirst thing that caught my eye was it was so cheap.  The controls felt basic at the start but it didnt take me long to get used to them.  Also For anyone who thinks the game is too hard the game creators in their mercy have put in a hint key. Anytime your stuck hit the H key and you get a hint at the area your stuck at.  Tempting to use all the time but it still doesn't ruin the puzzle when you do use it.  \n\nAlso a great bonus is the respawning so close to where you die.  The checkpoints must be every 5 or 10 steps as I never seem to respawn too far away from where i died.  In a puzzle game like this where you die alot this comes in handy. \n\nThe grusome ragdoll deaths keep in with the tone of the game if that makes sence and even the way the characters ponytail bobs when running are wee signs the creators were thinking when putting this together.\n\nI'm gonna keep playing this as it has my attention.\n\nHeres a first level play through if you are still making up your mind. \n\nP.S Any laggyness is the fault of my computer running recording software at the same time.  The game itself is usually smooth when the recording software is off.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7RNzLhLg9Y", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 6, "author": {"steamid": "76561198010649381", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1450810278, "num_games_owned": 133, "playtime_forever": 96}}, {"timestamp_created": 1451012541, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488504", "timestamp_updated": 1451012541, "recommendationid": "19925406", "votes_up": 3, "review": "Fun limbo like game with good controls fast respawn and good tutorials.
