A simple ruleset with only one board but variable gamepiece placement makes this a very fun - albeit challenging - exercise in logic and planning.  Far less variety among moves and fewer pieces than chess leads to briskly paced games that reward focus on necessity and encourage a flexible tactical approach to achieving the goal: eliminating all the enemy captains.  I am so far (3 hours played) quite enjoying the smooth difficulty scaling, but can already see both the enemy quantity and type making my further progress hard-fought and well earned.  I have zero reservations recommending this at full price, much less on sale!  Militia is a carefully executed and interesting take on small-scale tactics that is well worth both the cost to purchase and the time to play.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198156373372", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1498598402, "num_games_owned": 501, "playtime_forever": 425}}, {"timestamp_created": 1498069792, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501940", "timestamp_updated": 1498069792, "recommendationid": "32624267", "votes_up": 3, "review": "Addicting random puzzle strategy.

I've put dozens of hours into Axes and Acres and their latest, Minos Strategos.\n\nMilitia is a fun game and I can somewhat recommend it. It has many of the features that I like in BrainGoodGames - simple rules but lots of complex strategies. \n\nThe AI is very simple but the game is definitely a challenge. Unfortunately that is the one flaw in Militia and it is why it is my least favourite of the BrainGoodGames I've played. I reached level 6 after a couple of hours of gameplay and I really struggled to accomplish anything after that. In fact, if anything I got worse at the game, mostly as a result of frustration. The challenge ramps up too quickly for me.\n\nNor sure what was happening with my game but I got quite a few erros. Reinstalling fixed an error that would sometimes occur when I pressed ESC. A few games later I got a crash after winning a game.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561198007513026", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 199, "last_played": 1499658318, "num_games_owned": 510, "playtime_forever": 480}}, {"timestamp_created": 1497572041, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498060", "timestamp_updated": 1497572041, "recommendationid": "32458019", "votes_up": 1, "review": "Very fun strategy game with lots of depth.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198119834041", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1499647298, "num_games_owned": 106, "playtime_forever": 192}}], "success": 1}
