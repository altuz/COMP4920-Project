From a pure \"gameplay\" (such as it is) perspective, the interactive segments do nothing for the overall story. Notably, there is a moment where you must input the number of planets in the solar system and the numbers of the continents and oceans on Earth. These are questions which don't have solid answers, and make it hard to progress.\n\nFrom a story perspective, I found it poorly written and completely uninteresting to read. The \"point\" it was trying to make felt heavy-handed and didn't seem to fit with the form it was presented in. I cared very little for the character, and there were certain inconsistancies that I found distracting from the overall story. The audio version is a nice touch, but I can't say much about it as I didn't listen to it for very long.\n\nAs mentioned, I found this to be an interesting concept that just isn't well written enough to whole-heartedly reccomend.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198017956515", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1450392314, "num_games_owned": 886, "playtime_forever": 30}}, {"timestamp_created": 1450586658, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502671", "timestamp_updated": 1450586658, "recommendationid": "19796610", "votes_up": 4, "review": "A short enjoyable experience.
