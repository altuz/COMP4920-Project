For your currency, you get a well-written tear-jerker with some unexpected twists - which is of decent length - plus voice acting (in Japanese), very nice sprites and a really good soundtrack.\n\nI recall only a few flaws in the English translation - very minor.\n\nI'll give this 1.75 thumbs up (that's one thumb plus the other bent at a 135-degree angle).", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198059320281", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1503245091, "num_games_owned": 176, "playtime_forever": 885}}, {"timestamp_created": 1504056995, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505286", "timestamp_updated": 1504056995, "recommendationid": "34594477", "votes_up": 2, "review": "I love this game.  I've been around in the Key community for a while now, so I knew what to expect, but I never thought it would become my favorite story of all time.  I marathoned this game to completion on release date, and then when I finished, I just had to stop, and sit for a while.  I literally walked to the park to the next day to just sit, and think of the impact on my life.  I won't guarantee this experience for anyone else, but that's exactly how I feel about it.  I don't really want to go into details because spoilers so I'll just move on to the other aspects.\n\nOf course, like all Key games, the music is amazing.  And the art is also really, really good.  I especially love that colored pencil kind of sketching effect on the character portraits, its pretty cool.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough, its really worth it at $10, and super worth it if its ever on sale.  Just check it out, it's quite short and maybe you too will feel how I did.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198189310651", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506394514, "num_games_owned": 39, "playtime_forever": 695}}, {"timestamp_created": 1504537321, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "timestamp_updated": 1504537321, "recommendationid": "34736660", "votes_up": 1, "review": "Another Key VN - I just can't bring myself to like their work. \n\nKey loves to make you cry and make these \"drama VNs\" - but tbh I couldn't even shed a single tear or even had a feeling of sadness while playing this one.

It is likely much easier to relate to the characters if you yourself have experience similar emotions.  Overall it was an enjoyable story.
