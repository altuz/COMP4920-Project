With Christmas arriving in a week's time and no family member, friend or sibling to spend the holiday with, Koji decides to go out of his apartment to make an offering at a local shrine and wish for someone to spend the Christmas with. Afterwards, he will meet a fox spirit Akina who lives around the shrine and has heard his wishes, his middle school friend Itsumi who was handing out fliers for a cafe she is currently working at and Santa Claus's daughter who also goes by the same name of Santa Claus where Koji will help to find and recover her lost candy cane magic wand. Over the course of this visual novel, Koji can choose to visit the same or a different person each day before eventually spending Christmas Day with one or all of them.\n\nThe story and plot is written like a romantic comedy with a share of humour and fanservice and has 4 nice happy endings, the background music by REN from the circle 'Bastat tail', artwork by Inma and Badriel and overall presentation are great. Reading through the storyline and dialogue and unlocking all CGs at gallery will take less than 10 hours. Highly recommended when at discount or bundle offer for fans of Winged Cloud who might be interested in collecting the titles in the Sakura series and the great artwork in the trading cards, badges, emoticons and profile artwork in this game and for those who are interested in showcasing a Christmas-themed background on Steam profile.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198006413390", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 91, "last_played": 1505032800, "num_games_owned": 2216, "playtime_forever": 111}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505566832, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490319", "timestamp_updated": 1505566832, "recommendationid": "34996363", "votes_up": 1, "review": "Only bought it for points on Appnana\n\nSakura Santa - Generic bullshit + retarded characters + chunky gameplay + garbage\n\n....and just as I thought winged cloud couldn't fall deeper into the pile of shit it already is\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 6, "author": {"steamid": "76561198271346633", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1483096516, "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_forever": 251}}], "success": 1}
