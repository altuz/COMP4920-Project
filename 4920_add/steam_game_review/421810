I've never played another game like it.\n\nThe basic mechanics are simple. Turn based JRPG. But in this version, the epic heroes have already fought the evil doom of the universe...and lost. The narrative flows between several scenes of those watching the heroes flee from the villian, leaving people behind to fend for themselves in a world that is shaking itself apart.\n\nEven though you don't use any character long enough to get really attached to them, the hook is definitely set as we watched the routed heroes at each turn. There's no shops, limited items, very little chance to grind. This game has more challenge then the average JRPG because resources are so limited and you must find the strategy that can work.\n\nAll and all, a fun game.

It's definitely higher quality than some other ones out there and has some more work put into it. I like that you don't actually play as the heroes, but as a goblin betraying his overlord FOR the heroes. Still, I did question this game a bit.\nFor starters, at some points of the game, the screen would freeze for a split second and jump forward a tile. Kinda messed with my eyes a bit.\nThe battles are kind of a problem for me. They immediately throw you into strong battles with just yourself and have to rely on summon skills to fight back which requires you to wait a few turns while the enemies get to beat you to shreds. There was a point in the game where I was left alone and the game didn't give me enough potions so I ended up dying because your character doesn't have an attacking skill that can hurt more than one enemy. \nAgain this game seems higher quality than the rest, but the actual gameplay is lacking.\nThank god I didn't actually waste money on this game, got a coupon when I made a badge so.
