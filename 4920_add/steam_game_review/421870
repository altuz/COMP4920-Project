It basically renders the top 4-6 lines of the board useless in the later stages as the piece will drop in & you have basically zero time to adjust.\n\n- The pacing in the early levels is very slow due to essentially playing 4 games of Tetris at once, for the first 5 minutes of my first game it felt like the most boring game I'd played in a while; that goes away by level 6 or so of your first game when the speed of gameplay heats up & you know what to expect for future games, but I feel it needs addressing.\n\n- White background with a slightly shinier white grid is an odd choice. The grid is hard to see when you need to make some fast channel decisions & bright white is annoying for long periods. It doesn't need to be dazzlingly colourful experience in the background like I guess Neon Drive or even Lumines, but...something to not blind me when games run 15+ minutes.\n\n- 'Fixate' the game mode where you can't rotate the pieces feels like something you could do in other games of this type, but wouldn't.\n\n- I do hope we get a 'Piece Hold' function, seems like it'd provide some good strategy.\n\n\n", "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561198086542708", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 77, "last_played": 1469873473, "num_games_owned": 3586, "playtime_forever": 28}}, {"timestamp_created": 1497705050, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1497705194, "recommendationid": "32504182", "votes_up": 0, "review": "don't be deceived by the trailer (or maybe only I got it wrong)\n\nit's not TETRIS in 3D\n\nyou neither build castle walls, nor play on different dimensions\n\nit's just a variant in which the whole thing gets spun, so the level interlocks  \nwith what you just planted there before it turned\n\n(which can also help you not mess up your game too fast)\ntherefore you can plan ahead if you remember the pattern of the side view, meaning it has\n\n\nso much potential, but:\n\ndoesn't have things like T-Spin\n\nmaybe it's me, but I just had a session of 27 minutes\n\nand it became interesting from lvl 16 on,\n\nbefore that it was just really taking way too long .. felt rather dull, if not boring even\n\nbeen playing Tetris since the release of Nintendo Game Boy\n\nthis has so far been one of the rather dissapointing variants, shifting from the original Tetris\n\nmaybe I'll try multiplayer the next time, or see if I can now skip ahead and play from lvl 10 or 15 on \n\nso let's (lemme?) give this a yes -for- now\n\nalthough I'd not give almost 4\u20ac for this I guess...
