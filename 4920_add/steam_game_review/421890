Extremely grindy, every battle you get a small amount of coin that every ~25+ battles will let you buy a piece of equipment that is what you have +1, etc.  There is no actual strategy or decision making in the battles either, its just fight till you're almost dead, then pull behind troops and wait 30s to regen, rinse, repeat.  No plot, no combos, no strategy, no choices, no decisions, nothing.\n\nThat said, it's an entertaining premise, and would make a great addition to the App Store at a $1-2 price point.

I don't think this will reach a wide audience but it's still got some very good points.\n\nI'd like to start that this is a rather old game and quite text light compared to this company's usual affair. Probably why it was the second of their games to get translated to english.\n\nNow, here's what this game is, as I think a lot of players are looking at it the wrong way. The battles, at least for the first chunk of the game are rather simple, and can mostly be won without your help. That doesn't make them boring and simple though. The main goal of this game is to rake in some mad money, experience and points in each battle. And you only get those for your own contributions. So either your character or your direct bodyguards need to get the kills.\n\nA few things that aren't explained too well is that you only gain experience for every attach you do. So you need to run your character to the frong line and manage positioning so you don't die while keeping your troops alive. If you don't level up much the later battles will floor you. So while your allies are killing you need to rush in and try and score as many points as you can by targeting the right enemies, while managing to attack as often as you can taking as little damage as you can. This makes even the \"easier\" levels really challenging. If you don't do much you can beat level one gaining a single experience point, or you can beat it gaining 100 if you position yourself in each battle correctly. The more you do in a battle also nets you more gold allowing you to do even more in future battles.\n\n--TLDR--\n\nIt's a game of managing your position and troops to attempt score as many points in a level as you can, not just to kill the enemy commander. The strategy and challenge is in managing your fame in each of the battles.\n\nIf that sounds fun to you, pick it up.\nIf not, then this won't win you over.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 4, "votes_down": 17, "author": {"steamid": "76561198002642797", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1450165337, "num_games_owned": 1179, "playtime_forever": 122}}, {"timestamp_created": 1450225320, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519684", "timestamp_updated": 1450225320, "recommendationid": "19721568", "votes_up": 17, "review": "It gets old fast.

This game is so simple, and yet somehow fits into the category of also having so much potential. It is one of those games that does so much, with so little, that fits into a genre that is casual, and yet not at the same time. And after playing it for about  15 hours (Yah steam doesn't seem to log hours with all games properly, if you start them from inside the file folder, as opposed to the steam browser) I can say definitely, that unless I misread the tone and character of the dev, you DO NOT want to buy this game.\n\nThere are 4 troops types for which the player can use. They are so strange to be apart of the same Army, that when you see them, you instantly think \"Oh these are just the starting units for a much larger fighting force.\" Really there are 3 unit types, with the 4th being the \"Base\" unit you receive from winning battles. You cannot recruit more of these, you can only turn them into Mages, Ninja or Mummies.\n\n  The game FEELS lke it belongs on phones and tablets from a year or two ago. it is so simple like that, but can still be engaging, actually LETTING you control your troops as you run around the battle field trying to defeat the enemy general. Most games like this, play themselves, giving you very little actual control. This game gives you control, but gives little else. \n\nA few pieces of equipment for the Empress to equip to get stronger, that with levels make her a force. You get gold to spend on that equipment, or to change your knights into mages, ninjas or mummies as stated above, but so much is left wanting, it is shocking. The amount of options this game DOESNT HAVE makes me think the dev was literally trying to do the least amount of work possible, and release a product, to see if he could get away with it. \n\nWith a little more work, making 3 dozen more units, equipment types, Empress Ability types, battle functionality, and/or the Dev being smart and actively making the game modder friendly, this game would easily sell 50 times whatever it happened to sell so far. There is no doubt in my mind this game could have been amazing, and still could, if the dev and publisher actually wanted to make a brilliant indie game. I am not convinced that was there goal at all, which is why I cannot recommend this game, and will never do so, until they change the direction of this game.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 8, "author": {"steamid": "76561198006524453", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "last_played": 1450170681, "num_games_owned": 668, "playtime_forever": 61}}, {"timestamp_created": 1451188409, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502673", "timestamp_updated": 1451188409, "recommendationid": "19983492", "votes_up": 2, "review": "It has promise and is marketed well with some celver screenshots.

It is nice to watch huge battles but as the game goes on things can get annoying with night maps that have the fog of war which force you to look everywhere for the enemy Comamnder.. I'll also note that I refunded the game.\n\nGameplay wise, you're an Empress fighting against armies of evil dudes with the help of the King. Your own troops that you buy are the Empress Guardians who follow you around and protect you and can also be ordered around. The hundreds to tens of thousands you get are from the King, a friendly NPC. If either you or the King dies (he can almost always handle himself though) you lose the battle, to win you have to kill the enemy Commander. As Empress you can both fight in melee or use magic as a ranged attack (which is pretty much just Magic Missile).\nBetween battles you can buy upgrades (armor is armor, sword is melee, ring is magic) plus buy extra Guardians.\n\nThe game's main appeal of course is the absolutely massive battles. Not all of the levels have these, such as the fog of war levels I mentioned which are annoying. Battles get harder as the game goes on though the position of troops for th battles are randomized. It could definitely use more unit variety (Warrior is generic melee, Ninja moves fast and is weak, Mage is the ranged unit, Mummy is slow but tough) and well more variety overall.\nAs another review pointed out, it is very much grindy and mindless at times (bunch of battles can be won by doing nothing, depending upon the randomization they can end within seconds but that's not too common) plus it's price is a tiny bit steep. \nIt would definitely make a fun mobile game, but on Steam I'd really only recommend getting it while it's on sale or if you got some dosh to spare from selling ugly CS:GO knife skins.
