The graphics look great.  The controls are surprisingly right.  I'm not a big fan of those games where WSAD moves my character around and I use the mouse to click on enemies to shoot, but this game is paced well enough where that was not an issue at all.  I picked up my controller and the left analog was able to move my character around!!  If he makes it so the right analog allows me to aim like a twin stick shooter, this is going to be a fantastic game!  PLEASE DO THIS!  Also, this game has a really great ragdoll physics engine.  After you shoot down a zombie, you can sort of kick him around for a bit before he disappears. \n\nThe bad?  It's got issues.  Not the kind of issues you want in a game.  In my case, I can't click on the inventory button in full screen mode.  Just not possible.  In windowed mode if you maximize the window, it works fine.  So that's something I expect will get fixed very soon, the developer already stated in a thread that it will be looked at asap and will make a hotkey to open the inventory as well.  \n\nLet's start the patch train, I'm quite impressed so far.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZnE24oZYnk", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 4, "votes_down": 11, "author": {"steamid": "76561197993698981", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 135, "last_played": 1452218654, "num_games_owned": 9297, "playtime_forever": 64}}, {"timestamp_created": 1452552066, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512464", "timestamp_updated": 1452568688, "recommendationid": "20477359", "votes_up": 13, "review": "I think a critic should state their likes and dislikes before  they do a hatchet job on some style of game they didn't like to begin with or know much about..So I normally play  pipe puffer empire  building games, the more  boring the better and I'm into my 68th summer so zombie shooters are not my staple by any means.\" Dark Days\" seems certainly OK,fine, and  any short comings could be my fault  rather than the games.\nIt looks ok not great but certainly functional,I used my Sidewinder 2 joystick and my Logitech Precision controller and both ,surprisingly, worked well.I found keyboard control fine ,pretty easy really .Not a lot of assistance getting up and running but enough for me so its  heaps really.No crashes, bugs,bad boogie woogie, it ran well  and was fun.I'm running it in Win7  64 bit and it runs this game superbly.\nThings I didn't like much are ( 1) inaccurate gunfire.

Maybe in a browser, maybe you bought it for a pittance in a Steam sale because what are you really risking for like \u00a30.07 and ooh, trading cards. It isn't awful and it is still obviously a very early build but I honestly can't see it developing into anything worth picking up except begrudgingly as part of a bundle.\n\nI'll spare you the well-worn intricacies of [b]Dark Days[/b] (make molotovs, buy guns, kill fast/slow/brute zombie, next level) and instead offer the developers a little feedback just to bring the title up to speed with even the most mediocre of titles that share its genre.\n\n[b]1.)[/b] There's no intensity. None. Why would I panic about any of my fences breaking when I can easily outrun even the fastest zombie? I often found myself jumping over the barricades anyway, searching for stuff to kill that was actually taking forever to spawn.\n\n[b]2.)[/b] Guns and ammo are far too cheap and some are gamebreaking. As soon as I got hold of the shotgun, it was essentially game over. Everything dies in one shot except the giants who die in three and move so painfully slowly that they're more of a threat to the other zombies by blocking their way than they are to me.\n\n[b]3.)[/b] By contrast, the ranged weapons are practically pointless. Molotovs do nothing. Zombies just wander through the fire like its scotch mist. The tactical use of the mines and the one-shot kill of the knives are just as effective as a shotgun blast, except I don't have to craft shells for that in multiples of three. The grenades have a fuse delay so they're utterly useless against the runner zombies who are the only mild threat in the game. Which I shotgun. Because the shotgun is insane.\n\n[b]4.)[/b] The first survivor's gun appears to do nothing. I've stood there watching him pour nearly a hundred M16 rounds into a standard undead just for it to carry on shambling towards me.\n\n[b]5.)[/b] It's called DUCT tape. Not 'duck tape'. Although there is a brand of tape in the US called 'Duck' but I sincerely doubt that's what you meant.\n\nI think that'll do for starters.
