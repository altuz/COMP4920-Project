Just let me get in play the game.....\nsome nice ideas but a lot of bad noobish gameplay choices.\nI mean I have a joypad in my hand but I have to constantly keep pressing space to skip text why cant I hit A ffs\nalso movement of the ship is not precice or responsive enough to allow bullet dodging\nthe movement is laggy and travels a set distance minimum which is really annoying.\ncheck the japanese bullet hell shooters to see how to do it properly. i.e either use the analoge input so we can control speed or use a fast slow system like used in most japanese bullet hell games. any way as I said nice idea but you need to get the basic mechanics right before you start building a massive game around them. ill look out for 2.0\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198154976508", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1494071327, "num_games_owned": 19, "playtime_forever": 53}}, {"timestamp_created": 1495559812, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501314", "timestamp_updated": 1496255884, "recommendationid": "31921118", "votes_up": 2, "review": "UPDATE 5/31/17:\n\nThe first update has addressed a lot of the issues i was having and added more things I wasn't expecting! Keep the updates coming Varia!!\n\n\nORGINAL POST:\n\nOver all a good game!\n\nThere are some issues with the User Interface (which makes me cringe) and some other bugs that still need squashing, but it is-for all intents and purposes- a finished and full game!\n\nAt its core and when it is all working together- the bullet hell is pretty dang fun!\n\nWhen it doesn't work and your weapon you chose doesn't fire where your joystick is firing... it can be frustrating! When that happens I just try a new weapon! There are alot of combos that work well together and it is fun experimenting! I just wish that it did a better job of explaining things...Also! Is there a story mode? I would think there would be a story mode and not just custom maps. Either way! Its still SOLID!!\n\nI think it is a fun game and I recommend it!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561197985116361", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1496255794, "num_games_owned": 713, "playtime_forever": 614}}], "success": 1}
