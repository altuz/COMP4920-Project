Yesterday, the game decided one of my lighthouse stations was a controller. This meant I only had access to one controller, and it wasn't the one that would allow me to teleport, so I was stuck in one place.\n\nTried it again today, still only had one controller, but at least I could teleport this time. What I found while moving around was quite a disappointment. Items in the world (like buildings and trees) wouldn't appear until I got close to them, within about 10-15 meters.\n\nFurthermore, I could teleport inside of anything; huge rocks, a bridge, that giant Buddha statue, nothing was solid aside from the ground. I teleported inside of things several times since I couldn't even see them from a distance. Also I'm leaving a trail of rocks everywhere I go, because for some reason the controls to teleport are the same as creating a rock where your controller is located. This eventually started to lag the game as well.\n\nAll in all, this game is poorly made, and it's certainly not even worth it with 20% off of $0.99.
