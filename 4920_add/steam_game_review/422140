I love the idea of playing a game as a struggling Indy wrestler trying to make it in a cutthroat and difficult business. Indy wrestling is driving 250 miles to get paid $20 to wrestle some has been who thinks he's too good for you and intentionally makes you look bad. Its about passion and love for the carefully constructed performance art that is professional wrestling.\n\nThis however offers nothing to simulate that experience. Instead, you have a completely luck based system that in my few hours of play seems heavily and consistently biased toward the CPU (the last match I played I did five strikes early in the match, calculation gave each around an 80% chance to hit, four missed). You face no name indy wrestlers that inexplicably have unbeleivable statistics and are seemingly impossible to beat because of the luck based gameplay determined by the statistics. There is no incorporation of match psyychology, or anything to make this a pro wrestling simulator in the least bit. \n\nWorst of all, the performance art aspect of pro wrestling is completely lost in this game. Your success is measured exclusively by your win/loss record. Putting on a great match is absolutely meaningless unless you win, and the matches are simulated completely as competition rather than performance art. \n\nI don't understand how GreyDog can simulate pro-wrestling so well in TEW and so poorly in this game. If you are looking for a great pro wrestling simulator go for TEW 2013. And if you want to experience the life of an aspiring wrestler, either play WWE 2K16 or train to wrestle yourself.

Those that will enjoy it, will enjoy it a lot.\n\nHere's what it is; if you've played any of the 'Total Extreme Wrestling' games, or its older free version called \"Extreme Warfare Revenge', it is similar. In fact it uses the same in game world, promotions, and wrestlers. But rather then taking the role of a booker and handling all the behind the scenes stuff, you actually step into the role of a wrestler as you guide the wrestler through their career. \n\nYou have multiple modes for this, either a career mode where you can take control of any wrestler in the game, or the more difficult \"Rookie To Legend\" mode, where you create a wrestler from scratch and set out to make your name in the independent scene and get signed with larger and larger companies, as you carve out your legacy.\n\nThe career mode works like this; choose an available storyline, wrestle in four matches spanning the four weeks of a month, hope you succeed in said story, then repeat. As you win matches you get experience points you can spend on upgrading your stats, or save them up to buy special attributes to give yourself other bonuses. Winning the storylines gets you popularity which you can use to get signed into new companies.\n\nKEEP IN MIND, that at the start, especially in the \"Rookie\" mode you will be severely outmatched by a lot of your opposition, similar to an old school wrestling game like \"Here Comes The Pain\". You'll have to persevere, cherishing the few victories you get and improving your stats correctly to succeed. At the time of this writing, I am seven months in with a record of 10 wins, 20 losses, with two storylines that didn't succeed or fail, several that I failed outright, and ZERO I managed to succeed in. This isn't an easy play for sure.\n\nThe character creation is awesome, as you can choose your size, and your style and depending on what you end up going with, you can only choose certain moves. No 280 pound guys doing shooting star presses here, at least not from what I've seen. You have a crazy amount of moves you can choose from, and you can work in almost any pro wrestling region, from Canada to the UK to Japan. It's not something you'll be dissapointed in. \n\nBUT the big part of all this, is the actual gameplay. It is essentially a turn based wrestling game. Without getting too deep into percentages and dice rolls and all the calculations, you choose a move to attack your opponent with, hope it succeeds and then continue the attack. If they block it or counter it, they go on the offensive so then you need to counter or avoid their attack. However it takes into account things like being outside of the ring, being in the corner, your opponent being on the ground, etc. It's very, VERY, in depth and requires a lot of thinking on your part. \n\nI will point out this is all text based, with no music or sound to go with it so make sure you have a great soundtrack to listen to as you play. You also have a couple of other modes based around the matches without any career stuff, such as an exhibition mode, a league mode for singles and tag teams, and a streak mode where you try to go undefeated for as long as possible. Cool but it's not where the meat of the package is. Lastly, one of the big *in game* achievements calls for you to go through career mode for 25 years, win 1000 matches, and a lot of other crazy shit so whether you get it on sale for $5 like I did, or pay the regular cost, you're gonna get a great 'dollars versus hours' ratio on this.\n\nHonestly the best bet for you, reading this, is that if you aren't sure, do the following: buy the game, get yourself into a match or two and play around with it. If you like it, great. If not, get your refund within the two hours. It's not for everyone but if you can get into it, you'll find a slightly frustrating but very enjoyable wrestling experience.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198009316076", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 63, "last_played": 1492382129, "num_games_owned": 549, "playtime_forever": 569}}], "success": 1}
