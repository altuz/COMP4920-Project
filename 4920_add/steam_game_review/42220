Within this game you assume the role of amaranthine sleuth Nancy Drew and investigate rumors of a mythical monster that has terrorized German grounds, specifically Castle Finster, for as long as many residents can remember. Recently the monster has emerged from the castle woods with a penchant for destruction; causing fires and destroying private property. Markus the castle\u2019s owner has pleaded with Nancy to step in and find out the truth behind the creature before the castle is closed for good.\n\nNancy Drew adventure games are not your typical triple \u201cA\u201d open world RPG or FPS. As the genre mentions it is a \u201cpoint and click adventure game\u201d where one searches for clues, solves puzzles, questions suspects, and unravels a larger mystery through deductive reasoning. The game is not designed to be an engrossing universe or narrative, but rather for me, is designed as a light-hearted story for anyone of all ages. It serves as a nice break from larger games and is easy to simply kick back to, relax, and enjoy. The plot-line of these games typically takes about 7-12 hours to unravel, depending on your sleuthing skills. \n\nThis game in particular had a great Germanic atmosphere, weaving tales from Grimm\u2019s fairytales and mythical folklore into an intriguing plot. However, its dialogue, scripting, and voice acting falls a little bit flat for me. If this is your first time looking at the Nancy Drew game series, I tend to recommend some of the more classic titles, which are in my opinion, of higher quality and contain better narratives (keep in mind though that their graphics and game engines may be a bit more dated, being from the earlier 2000s). To understand if you might like these games I recommend checking out the more iconic titles: The Curse of Blackmoor Manor, Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake, or Treasure in the Royal Tower. During the summer or holiday sales these games are easily $2-$5 on Steam so just wait until then and you can check out these games as a nice cheap break from the usual.
