Gameplay isn't that bad but the game could have been more successful with just a bit more work. (more ships, levels and at least a few unique elements) \n\nShipLord would never be a huge game with tons of followers but for what it's worth they should have added more effort into it.  The game is too repetitive and there isn't much depth which makes it a poor game. There are a few other cheap games like this on steam that are much better.\n\nPass on this one and play something else.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198045468592", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "last_played": 1487002579, "num_games_owned": 564, "playtime_forever": 277}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505863306, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491816", "timestamp_updated": 1505863306, "recommendationid": "35074018", "votes_up": 2, "review": "k", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 5, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027180717", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4050, "num_reviews": 200, "last_played": 1506510765, "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_forever": 21566}}], "success": 1}
