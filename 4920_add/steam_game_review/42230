The plotline of the game is stale and short. Most tasks are not part of solving the mystery, but rather errands and chores given by other characters. The game is also disappointingly short. I finished the game in two short sittings (Steam records that I played 11 hours but this is incorrect; I have been experiencing some home IT issues that increased my calculated gameplay). Other ND mysteries have at least held my attention through a few difficult puzzle series. The \"size\" of the environment was also far too small. The whole game is spent in three small areas: a house, a barn, and a shop (3 rooms in the house, 2 rooms in the shop, and 1 barn area). The only exceptions are the outside area (where 2 activities are held)  and driving on the roads (which was more of an annoyance than a fun game element). Trail of the Twister is unfortunately my least favorite Nancy Drew game yet. I hope Her Interactive can step up their game and bring back the excitement seen in games like Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake and The Curse of Blackmoor Manor."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1388797578, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507695", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8543106", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116355919", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1388800131, "num_games_owned": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 710}, "timestamp_updated": 1388797578, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I just bought this game and it constantly pops up with a message; \"application load error\" would really like if someone could help me fix this."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1446863196, "weighted_vote_score": "4.997779", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "18921238", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198141720460", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1506734540, "num_games_owned": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "playtime_forever": 387}, "timestamp_updated": 1446863196, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This was less of a mystery and more of a chore list.

I know there are negative reviews that might warn you away because they say the game has a glitch and won't open. That happened to me too, but I entered the code ThwEDgb5rfFw into the BETA section like another review on the game page told me to, and that fixed it:) So I was finally able to play the game! Have no fear, the code works and the game will work!\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's one of my more loved Nancy Drew games. I've played every single game and I will continue to. There are some games that are boring (for me) and I will never touch again, there are some I moderately love, or that I loved when I played but don't really feel the need to play again, and there are the ones I will never get enough of. This is one of the ones I really loved while playing, because it plays on my love of twisters. \n\nIt's actually a little harder game play for me, I think. (But nothing like Captive Curse, which I still haven't finished. At least I finally found my way out of this one). Before my PC crashed I was stuck for months not knowing what to do to get past the trigger object or whatever. But when I downloaded it on here I did something right:) So it's one of those games you can get stuck on, which to me means it's not as easy, a little complicated. (as opposed to Message in a Haunted Mansion you can finish in just hours, in my experience).\n\nIf you love tornados, this is a fun game. I really enjoyed the weather of this game, because I enjoy that weather in life. Finding the weather pics is a little annoying, and if you can't manage to trigger the next part (whereever that was for me, I don't remember now) that's a little annoying. And if you decide to play the two mini-games that will get you Pa's Pennies, make sure you don't forget to spend them before you trigger the end so that your time and hard work doesn't go to waste :/\n\nThis is one of my most liked Nancy Drew games:) \nMy other recommendations are: \n-Secrets Can Kill\n-Stay Tuned for Danger\n-The Final Scene\n-Danger on Deception Island\n-Secret of Shadow Ranch\n-Danger by Design\n-Creature of Kapu Cave (+HARDY BOYS!!!)\n-Tomb of the Lost Queen\n-Ghost of Thornton Hall\n-Sea of Darkness"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1469225882, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "24468143", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198086656522", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1503114441, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 466}, "timestamp_updated": 1469225882, "received_for_free": false, "review": "As someone who enjoys simpler games that don't require a lot of backtracking and give good directions on where to go next, this game was perfect.
