Still obviously rough around the edges, especially as the difficulty ramps WAY up in the campaign very fast - I might say frustratingly fast.  A bit more \"Clicky\" than I normally prefer but a very interesting alternative the the usual RTS fare and a lovely visual presentation.  A lot of potential, assuming it keeps getting developed.\n\nA few things I hope will play out as development goes along:\n\n1) A gentler ramping up of difficulty.  The first two planets are challenging for a newcomer, but easily beaten.  The third one is suddenly far more difficult.  I find this just a bit too punishing - a smoother curve is needed.\n2) Something to automate repairs.  Having to manually send out one drone at a time while you're being harried to death is a bit much in my opinion.  Interesting idea but I'm not sure it scans, because there aren't really any \"lulls\" in combat to support a manual repair mechanic.\n3) Menu transitions in the game are too long.  Just getting out of the game when you're done takes thirty seconds or so, which doesn't seem like a lot until you wait through it.\n\nAnd one suggestion:\nMultiple star systems.  This would make a very interesting basis for an extended, or even a procedural campaign mechanic, and would help keep the game fresh.  And after all there are a lot of elements in the Periodic Table.\n\nIn spite of my quibbles it's a game that shows a great deal of interest and promise and I am looking forward to seeing it take shape.  Definitely worth its buy-in cost, even taking all the above into account.", "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198006744827", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1504841485, "num_games_owned": 49, "playtime_forever": 268}}, {"timestamp_created": 1450208174, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510482", "timestamp_updated": 1450208174, "recommendationid": "19717428", "votes_up": 11, "review": "Great game!

However, I have noticed one problem: the diffculty curve.  As someone who rarely plays stragety games (My only one being Halo Wars), I am pretty bad at them.  I find the first to planets to be pretty easy after a try or two, but the third planet ramps the diffculty up WAY to high.  I am still stuck on it after a week because after i get my resource buildings up (One minute), the computer sends about 5+ attack buildings next to me.  I have to frantcally build defense and attack buildings, while being destroyed in the first 3 minutes of a round.

I've had to click up to 12 times to place 2 different structures, as I navigated from terrain type, to unit type, to unit strength, and then click back all those options again to return to the initial menu... not ideal for a quick response.\n\nThe structures are too similar for me, and the game provides [b]very little feedback[/b] of what's going on (particularly on the side of the planet you can not see).\n\nIn short, the UI is often one of the game's greatest [b]source of frustration[/b]. And speaking of frustration:\n[*][h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nThis game really [b]needs balancing[/b]. The first two planets are almost boringly easy, and suddenly by the fourth one it's impossible to get a foothold, as you are quickly surrounded by an ever-growing mass of enemy structures and satellites.\n[*][h1]Game Mechanics[/h1]\nThe game consist of placing [b]structures for attacking, defending, and resource gathering[/b].
