After selecting my locomotion option (teleportation, I known the limits of my stomache) I was faced with a small group of slightly blurry characters talking around a fire. After an abortive attempt to find a menu I could use to make them a little less blurry, I listened to their short argument and was invited to head back to town with one of them.\nOn horseback.\nHorses in Emerhalt are controlled by manipulating the reins, but turning ones head to look around also seems to alter thier directing in a disconcerting, and nausea inducing way. By the time we reached the first corner I was starting to feel quite nauseus and hoping the journey would be over soon, unfortunately the town wasn't even on the horizon yet. By the time we eventually reached the town (which seemed like an eternity, even discounting the short break I took to ensure I wouldn't be physically sick) and I finally recieved the instructions on how to dismount from the acursed beast, I had well and truely decided that that would be the last virtual horse of Emerhalt I ever mounted.\nAfter a short walk through the town I was reunited with my former compatriots from around the fire, who had aparently been having a drinking contest. Between them they drunkenly came to the conclusion that we should all participate in a horse race.\nAnd so my experiences in Emerhalt came to a close.\nMy susceptibility to motion sickness isn't the least extreme, but nor is it the most, and I wouldn't ask developers to leave features others might enjoy out of a game just because they make me feel sick. But I would ask that they strongly consider not making those features a mandatory, unskippable, part of the game.

That being said I have a couple of critiques. First of all the melee attack definitely needs haptic feedback, the weightlessness of the shield makes it seem as though you are flailing your arm around for no reason. Second of all the telekinesis doesn't have any proper way to throw back at an enemy other than moving your arm side to side, this is an issue that might not be able to be fixed since that's just the way telekinesis works (but it becomes frustrating trying to toss back at an enemy). Finally my biggest problem with the game is the blocky style of the graphics. Now don't get me wrong I actually prefer stylized graphics (overwatch) over realistic graphics (battlefield) but the character models are incredibly blocky and the non moving sky and the water textures are very immersion breaking. I wouldn't expect you guys to add lip syncing or anything but the faces definitely need a bit of an overhaul specifically the eyes. All that being said I would give the work so far a 7/10.

I, like many of us I'm sure are dying for a good story driven adventure free roaming RPG to save us from the endless wave shooters.  This game seems to have a start in filling that void.  I like the option of trackpad and teleport.  I've really grown to like trackpad locomotion and have over come my motion sickness from it for the most part, but with this type of locomotion, where you move in the direction your head is pointing instead of where your hand is pointing,. I just would rather be able to point where I'm going and tilt the controler to slow down if I need to and look around while I'm walking.  The graphics are terribly blurry.  That really needs to be fixed.  The horse back riding is a nice mechanic even though I found that it was pretty touchy especially when you were walking and not galloping and had a tendency to make me feel a bit sick.  There were several bugs,.. walking into the town I must have dismounted my horse before I was supposed to and the controls for dismounting floated in front of me the whole time I was in the village.  there were serveral loud voices that seem to yell at me from every direction and that was a bit odd since there was only one person I could see in the village besides the group I met up with before the horse race.  The voice acting was a bit cheesy.  Also,. this is just my own personal preference here and I know many disagree and that's cool,. but when I'm playing as a character in a VR game it really kills it for me when the game starts talking for me.  That was my one complaint about Arizona Sunshine.  I'm the character, it's my adventure, let me be the character and don't tell me what I think.  The battle play was actually pretty cool.  could definatily use some force feedback or something and I would probably make it so the giant boulders don't just roll away like a basket ball when you barely run into them.  there was another strange bug when I walked into the fishery where a string of bright purple text that said hello over and over in a colum on the left side of my screen showed up and never went away the rest of the demo.   obviously I wouldn't reccomend this game in it's current state but that doesn't mean with a lot of work it couldn't turn out to be something pretty great.  but now it's just not", "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561198166306431", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1487099189, "num_games_owned": 56, "playtime_forever": 22}}, {"timestamp_created": 1488160328, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "timestamp_updated": 1488160328, "recommendationid": "30210790", "votes_up": 1, "review": "i like the artwork, horseback was pretty cool!
