Terrible controls. Somewhat buggy gameplay. Boring and ill-fitting graphics design. Most of the sounds are annoying. Thin, reverby music.\n\nYes yes, I've played the game for less than 10 minutes, but seriously, that was enough.\n\nThe way the karts control is horrible. Hitting the brake in a corner, accelerates you in the opposite direction of what you're turning. And no, it's not just that the camera moves to the side when drifting (which is annoying btw). I tested it several times. I can steer sharply to the RIGHT, while driving straight, by simply pressing LEFT and brake, and vice versa. I can hardly get through a hairpin and not hit the walls, unless I brake hard (without turning), and take the corner with 10 km/h. The original game is all about timing your handbrake turns, for just about every 90+ degree turn, and your shots (making no sense) following your turning, so they're always straight ahead of you (makes for great trick-shots). In this version, none of the weapons really feel awesome to use.\n\nThen there's the movement and obstacles. The AI's seem to lag through the air when jumping, and for some reason it's like you're sped up to 5x speed when jumping, which makes it feel like you come to a grinding halt when you land, so the jumps don't even feel awesome to do. More like a weird feeling, than anything else. And you can get stuck between a tree and the wall, without touching either, when there is clearly a lot of room for you to pass between them. Also, the sound for when the karts smash together, is not good. Sounds like two cardboard boxes being smashed together, with some added distortion.\n\nI'm not too fond of the graphics, either. In the old game, a fireball looked like a fireball. Here, they're just soft-white spheres with small spikes. And nothing quite fits together. Neon-green boost-patches and jumps? Large green question marks? It all just feels half-done.\n\nAlso, the music is pitchy and reverby, and doesn't really \"fit\", which reverby and pitchy music seldom does.\n\nWhich \"Wacky Wheels\" did you guys play? All the things that were unique and special about the original, are gone. This is just another cartoon kart racer, with the most terrible controls I've ever seen in a kart game, in my 27 years as a gamer.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. I LOVE the original. Bought it when I was 12 with my own savings, and loved it to bits. I had seen the videos and screenshots, and knew I wasn't getting the exact same thing, but the only thing this has in common with the original, is the description on the tin: \"Animals racing karts, shooting hedgehogs at each other. Also there are bombs, fireballs and spilled oil.\"", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 12, "author": {"steamid": "76561198008781092", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1478268602, "num_games_owned": 120, "playtime_forever": 8}}, {"timestamp_created": 1486606563, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502589", "timestamp_updated": 1486606563, "recommendationid": "29793296", "votes_up": 4, "review": "Runs poorly and slowly.", "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 4, "author": {"steamid": "76561198359404927", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1486606190, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 21}}, {"timestamp_created": 1464668503, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491120", "timestamp_updated": 1464668503, "recommendationid": "23302675", "votes_up": 7, "review": "It's so rare to see a PC game featuring a 4 players split screen mode and even if it still need some optimizations, the game feels pretty promising!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 9, "author": {"steamid": "76561198095201032", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1502317197, "num_games_owned": 842, "playtime_forever": 30}}, {"timestamp_created": 1473397607, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493132", "timestamp_updated": 1473397607, "recommendationid": "25421163", "votes_up": 3, "review": "This is Early Access, with all that means, but so far at least it is Early Access done right.
