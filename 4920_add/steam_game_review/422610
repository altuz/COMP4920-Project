This game is SLOW. The battles take 20 times what they should. And all other aspects are clutsy, at best. A couple of bugs in the game - I noticed the Injuns cannot command option out after a battle a couple of times.\n\nOverall - I am not sure I want to recommend this game. It is an OKAY implementation of the boardgame - but seriously slow. And, the funnest part of the boardgame is the human player interaction - which obviously this will not have.\n\n", "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198147807823", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1499147920, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_forever": 3860}}, {"timestamp_created": 1499051697, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502940", "timestamp_updated": 1499051697, "recommendationid": "33165096", "votes_up": 3, "review": "Unfortunately there's no way you can speed up the slow sea transporation or skip the dice rolls.
