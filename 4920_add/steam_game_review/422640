They don't add anything to it except for horrible steering (which is done with the touchpad). They basically just use the motion controls as a controller and not for motion. They only have them in it so they can say they use motion controllers. You do not steer with the controllers, you use the track bad. For power ups and boost you also just press the touchpads. While the tracks are nice to look at, they are short and are basically just flat ground with nothing else. If you are looking for motion controlled mario kart then you are looking in the wrong place. Maybe with future updates they will make them better but I doubt it since this is not even a early release or alpha or beta.", "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 2, "votes_down": 6, "author": {"steamid": "76561197990616207", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1465003317, "num_games_owned": 143, "playtime_forever": 41}}, {"timestamp_created": 1468018461, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524168", "timestamp_updated": 1468018461, "recommendationid": "24193577", "votes_up": 15, "review": "I just picked up this game, and I feel bad for both the developer as well as the community, as the game is a really fun little racing game with a lot of (unjust) bad reviews. Now... don't get me wrong... I feel like they should add some real motion control steering, but I have been playing using my xbox 360 controller, and it's a blast. The graphics are cartoony and fun. The driving on the controller is smooth and very responsive. The view itself is great, with nearly zero interference from the cart itself. You can get a great view of everything happening around you. There are a wide variety of different weapons to use in the game... from tire spike strips to homing missiles. The game also runs really well. I have a GTX980 (not a ti), and it runs perfectly smoothly through the whole race. The graphics are also easy on the eyes, being that games with a lot going on often times end up looking rough and pixelated in VR. There's plenty to look at in the levels, but it's all pretty crisp (as crisp as VR can be). I certainly feel like they could improve some of the control features. Having boost and drift the same thing is kida silly, and I think it's way too easy to spin out when you're bumped. Still... for 15 bucks, you get a fun, great looking Mario Kart feel with great VR driving action. Adding true motion controls should clearly be at the top of their list, but for those who enjoy using a controller... you should be plenty happy with your purchase.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561197990270671", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1469963302, "num_games_owned": 272, "playtime_forever": 157}}, {"timestamp_created": 1463847703, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508460", "timestamp_updated": 1463847703, "recommendationid": "23119714", "votes_up": 11, "review": "This was my first experience with the Vive that did not use tracked controllers and I was dissapointed ( I was trying to avoid this for now but it seemed it supported it under the controller compatability).\n\nAlso, the controls don't even work properly.

I tried racing and my driver kept steering off in different directions even when not touching the Vive touchpad.  Conversely, it would sometimes stop steering even when using the touchpad.  There also doesn't appear to be any support for driving wheels, whereas the Rift version advertises that support.\n\nThere is also no in-game representation of the Vive controllers even in the menu.  This makes it difficult to know exactly where on the track pad you are pressing, since you have no visual feedback, but they still divide the trackpad into multiple buttons.\n\nIt's disappointing how something as basic as getting the controls wrong can break an otherwise promising looking game.\n\nUpdated: I tried it with an Xbox 360 controller and that worked fine.

It works great with a xbox 360 controller and handles really well. It is the first game that i have asked for a refund of though. There are a few issuses with it. first off its just not fun.

Its bad enough to crash into the wall because of getting hit with this weapon but it takes control of your kart for 10-15 seconds and after that everyone has passed you and i just couldnt be bothered trying after that.\n\nThe scale also feels off the kart is huge and the world is huge. if everthing was %50 smaller I think it would be better. in a kart you don't sit on a chair you sit almost on the ground its a small and very compact feeling.
