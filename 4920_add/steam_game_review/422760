Far better than I expected. Lovely and smooth on a GTX1080. Throw rubber rings for the Dolphins etc to swim through using your trackpads or use side buttons to propel yourself around (use both controllers for faster speed). The voice commentary for each animal is very nice giving you some info on habits etc. Area's to swim around are really quite spacious. If you go real deep your right controller becomes a torch. Very good atmosphere and highly recommended if you liked 'theBlu'. Spider crabs, Snakes, Sharks, Dolphins, Whales and many more are here. The Great White startled me bigtime while I was in the cage.

Anyway, I've only tried the game for a very short while and my fist impressions are not good. I do own theBlu and you can't compare the two, except for the fact that theBlue is only like 60 seconds long (not really, a little longer than that). The underwater sound is annoying the rocks on the ocean floor looks is like rocks in Minecraft (again not really, but you get the point). \n\nIf the game designers could offer a high-texture and polygon pack, I believe this game/simulation could be awesome. But until then, I'll have to, unfortunately (for the lack of neutral) say no. \n\nLuckily the game is not that expensive and if you're prepared to live with low polygon rocks and annoying under water sounds, then buy this.
