Around 7 months ago I heard about this game's kickstarted and felt like playing the NES game, I heard goo things Scott Pilgrim vs The World video game and knew it was based upon the original RC, so I played the NES game and though it was great for the time, it was the perfect balance between beat 'em up and RPG, so, how does Underground fare in comparison with Scott's and the OG(Original game) games?\n[code][h1]Gameplay[/h1][/code]\nWhile I understand the WANTED mechanic of the game drove some people off the game it was never really that bothersome to me, while it got to me nerves a few times where I miss pressed some attack button most of the times felt it was me getting greedy looking for more money.\nThere are 10 characters with most of them needing to be unlocked to play as them, that said only 4 or 5 of them really feel fully fleshed out, some of the unlockables come with all their moveset unlocked and they never feel like enough, the other ones are amazing to play as, with lots of combos easy and hard to pull out.\nI didn't really see anyone mention this but the inventory system is really well made, they changed so you don't have to pause the game to use items like on the NES one, you have little squares under your health and once you buy items a mini pixellated version of the item appears on your inventory, you use one button to cycle through and another one to use the selected item, you can easily tell items apart since the icons for them are really well made.\nStats are a bit weird on this one, it isn't as straight forward as it might sound, such as: ATK, which represents attack doesn't really help you with hand-to-hand combat, only with special attacks performed by your character, and STR(Strength) increases damage dealt by both kicks and punches, I'm not the biggest fan of this change since for most of my first playthrough I was getting ATK up and seeing no difference on basic damage, that said once you understand what does what you can get the gist of it really quickly.\nMoney system is another thing I did not enjoy as much, every time you die you lose half of the money you had, if you're playing multiplayer only the player to get the coins gets money, so as long as you're playing with a friend you're constantly with low money unable to buy anything unless you grind for it, and grind it times the number of players you're playing with, a \"everyone gets the money\" option was really welcome here, there's still time to add, I don't think it would be that hard to add.\n[code][h1]Graphics[/h1][/code]\nIt's the prettiest pixellated game of 2017, and I belive it will continue to be until Katana:Zero comes out, the attention to detail and world building is really grand, I love how every part of the map has something going for it, a bicycle race going on, construction site with hazards, bridges with pooping pigeons, really this game is a pixel-art fan's dream, it does not disappoint from beginning to end!\n[code][h1]Music[/h1][/code]\nI head the musician for this game went on a rampage to getting every song they made of the games they were in, I'd say that's a total bummer, since the soundtrack is amazing, it didn't grab onto the old one with dumbed down remixes, it's totally new, the sweet crisp sounds are a blast and really compliment gameplay, now, the thing is, I belive they're composing a new soundtrack for the game, not sure if it's already out since I played the game before it was pulled from steam and I'm writing this review after it came back, I'll update in regards the new soundtrack if I play the game again.\n[code][h1]Final notes[/h1][/code]\nI really enjoyed my time with the game, the bosses are really fun and even tough it has it's problems none really overshadows all the other things the game does right, if you're looking to buy the game take a look at this guide:[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=874375560]All Shop Items and their Stat Boosts[/url] to undestand which stat helps you with what, and if you're not really into gaming but you're into pixel art there is a well written [url=Story Walkthrough SPOILERS]walkthrough with spoilers[/url]", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561198057846492", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "last_played": 1505681640, "num_games_owned": 313, "playtime_forever": 1547}}, {"timestamp_created": 1499975695, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511055", "timestamp_updated": 1499975695, "recommendationid": "33510750", "votes_up": 6, "review": "I am loving it.

1992, i strongly do not want to touch this game after hours of playing. i really want to use my bad words onto the developer team from Conatus Creative. \n\nlooks like the dev guys know less about Japanese Technos company, and the game gives me a bad feeling: it ruins many pieces of good virtue that Technos Corp. once built within Nekketsu series games.(i mean single-player part) . personally i don't treat this game as a Nekketsu formal successor of the traditional Nekketsu action games on NES. why i say so, go play this game, and get some feeling about \"what a Nekketsu action RPG goes like\": Technos Samurai Downtown Special (NES/Famicom, Technos, 1991, Japanese). and compare it to this game, you will understand what i am talking about. i also recommend guys to play this game for more feelings about original Nekketsu action games: <Nekketsu Kakutou Densetsu/Hot Blooded Fighting Legend> on NES, 1992, Japan, Technos Corp..\n\nthe new game abandons the advantages that a Nekketsu action game should have. i really don't know what are \"Arc System Works\" guys doing, they are damaging Nekketsu brand.(i once trusted Arc System Works, due to their \"Guilty Gear\" series, pretty good, but this time. too bad.)\n\ni once dreamed about the game would reproduce the greater work that Technos Corp. never reached. but now i find myself a fxxxxxx idiot to trust \"Arc System Works\" and Conatus Creative.\n\ni dislike the big change of the game style, due to dislike, so Not Recommend. i was a fan of the Technos Japan games. and after year 1993, i had been expecting a sort of formal continuity of the original Nekketsu action games or action RPGs, but after years of waiting, i finally found this game, i was quite unsatisfied, and felt very disappointed. that is all. when i firstly viewed the trailer video of the game, i actually once had pretty high expectation, but after i really playing it, oh ... no... that was not what i expected. and i felt a little bit \"cheated\" somewhat. maybe i shouldn't expect a licensed game so much. this is my fault.\n\nin the year 1993,1994, i was in my elementary school, grade 4 or so, Technos Japan's Nekketsu games once gave me a lot of nice pieces of memories. especially when i could have some fun time away from those years of book studying and heavy homework.(well, in China, for a '80s guy, elementary school was really bad experience.). and in those old era, due to scarcity and poverty, peeps seldom found nice fighting action games with smooth actions and low difficulty, especially on NES system, but Nekketsu brand game is one of them, easy to triggered alacrity skills, short learning curve, one beat them all, fancy and diverse skills, plus team skills triggered by 2 guys at the same time, fast and smooth combos, acceptable AI companion fighting along with you, most core gameplay fighting skills freely giving you or cost you quite less at the very beginning part of the game,(including that kunio-kun's specialty triple-sonic-kick hits ^_^) and 1st character/default character you can choose is the most powerful one and the \"most easy to use\" one, from the beginning to the finale, a lot of knocking down skills, so if enemy is very strong, just frequently knock him down. to be honest, i once played them a lot, recite all the hidden details and maps/levels. these nice features from the old Nekketsu games all leave a good memory.\n\nUnfortunately that, due to NES hardware function limitation, only at the same time, 4 guys on screen, can't be more(otherwise the system would be greatly slowed down, and rendering would be glitchy). so i thought this game would be much better, due to Technos Japan once built the series great, and nowadays both hardware and software have a big leap advancement compared to those in year 1991~1993.\n\nbut now, i really dislike this new \"Nekketsu\" game, the new flavor. in my old memories, Nekketsu brand games are NEVER hard to win games(single player part, story mode), but RCR:U the game, it is too hard for me, i have xbox360 controller, especially the begining part of the game. i like this series, so i don't want to cheat/use trainer programs on it(actually i can, my suggestion is: due to the game has skill limitation with SP bar, if player controlled characters, their base damage level TIMES 7~10x, enemy money drop TIMES 5x, i think that is reasonable, it is too hard, now. grinding/farming wastes lots of time, and no fun. or, maybe add a casual/relaxing difficulty for the story, that would be better). but maybe this is one good thing, this game completely ends my nostalgia dreams around Nekketsu legends.", "comment_count": "13", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false,
