I had fun, but not nearly as much as with Creeper World.  In fact, it wasn't until several missions in that I actually started enjoying it.  Since I can't make a \"meh\" recommendation, I'm giving it a recommendation, just not a very strong one.  Here's some details:\n\nPros:\n+ Clearly a lot of effort went into this.\n+ Can design your own ships.\n+ Good mix of different default ships with definite roles.\n+ Flexible tech upgrades - not locked into what you spend and can redistribute between general tech and specific ship boosts.  Can reallocate without loss, there's just a delay for full effectiveness.  This tech reallocation is actually one of my favorite features.\n+ Most missions do require some strategy.\n+ The particulate looks interesting.\n+ Sacrificing ships isn't a permanent loss and can be extremely useful.\n\nCons:\n- Rather short.\n- First couple missions feel way too easy, as if you just need to move your fleet a few places and your ships do everything you need.\n- Did not really deliver on the \"Adaptive and Emergent\" claim made in the trailer - yeah the particulate did react a little bit, but never in a really surprising or interesting way, mainly just acting like it was magnetically attracted to ships or spawning a lot more when you get close to emitters.  Did not seem intelligent at all.\n\nThe above are pro/con considering the game on its own merits.  But this game is part of the Creeper World universe, which begs a comparison with Creeper World 3 (the last and by far the best of the trilogy and an outstanding game in its own right).\n\nSo Compared to CW3, Particle Fleet has the following Cons:\n- Music is not as good.\n- Interface feels less refined.  For example for some reason you can't view ship health in the normal lower box, where you can toggle all the ship features, there's a separate box for that.\n- Not as satisfying.\n- Not nearly as challenging.\n- Feels shorter.\n- Story isn't as compelling or interesting.\n\nSo with all that, why am I giving this a \"Yes\"?  Because its fairer than \"No.\"  I did enjoy it, I don't feel ripped off or anything, and I want to encourage the developer to do better next time.  Creeper World 3 was awesome and I'm sure Knuckle Cracker will live up to it in future efforts.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198036489070", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1501379467, "num_games_owned": 165, "playtime_forever": 585}}], "success": 1}
