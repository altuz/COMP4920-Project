Unfortunately I will not be getting the backstory as the second last level is either broken or far beyond my capability to complete.  At 4 minutes and 13 seconds in an NPC bunker is destroyed every time; thereby ending my playthrough.  I'm unable to find any videos where someone has managed to save that bunker in 4 minutes 13 seconds or less, so I can only assume that the game is broken.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 4, "author": {"steamid": "76561198025488494", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1502423564, "num_games_owned": 182, "playtime_forever": 452}}], "success": 1}
