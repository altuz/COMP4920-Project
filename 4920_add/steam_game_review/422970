Death will always be waiting at the end of Your efforts. But that's what makes this game special. The time You survived is equal to the amount of skill and determination You have. (Not even luck can save You here, it'll maybe grant You one or two seconds but nothing more). Devil Daggers is brutal, unforgiving, it doesn't allow You to make mistakes.\n\nThat being said, it's not a game for everyone. Only people who are willing to offer a piece of their lives to refine movement, shooting techniques or monster spawning patters and to make it their second nature, only these people can really enjoy Devil Daggers. Seeing even a tiny bit of progress towards the achievement (and past it) is emotionally rewarding. It's not like You unlocked some new weapon that makes the game easier. No. It's You. It's always about You. Every bit of progress means that YOU are a better player. You rised above Your weaknesses and conquered them, and not many games can evoke this feeling.\n\n[i]Devil Daggers sucked me into its hellish dimension, it wants me there, it wants to torture me, make me suffer, it wants to see me dead, over and over and over again... but, I'm still standing, fighting against my inescapeable destiny. I'll be dead anyway, but I won't give up. Not until I'll give everything I got.[/i]", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198156702647", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 328, "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1506868935, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 1331}}, {"timestamp_created": 1504753193, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1504753193, "recommendationid": "34787142", "votes_up": 1, "review": "It is the end of all things.\nHubris most of all.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 2, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197960673227", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1505883516, "num_games_owned": 841, "playtime_forever": 300}}, {"timestamp_created": 1504733713, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "timestamp_updated": 1504733713, "recommendationid": "34783607", "votes_up": 1, "review": "Its a great game.
