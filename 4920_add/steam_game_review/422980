Is this game hard? Yes it is. Is it fun? Not at all. Is it worth playing? Not in my opinion. \n\nThe controls are really clunky. Unlike games such as Super Meat Boy or even the old good Super Mario Bros, your character has no momentum. When you stop pressing the left/right stick button you immediately stop mid-air. That's it. You just drop like a potato. That wouldn't be a big of a issue if the game didn't rely so much on accurate jumps. This mechanic cheapens the experience. Most of the time you will die because of this weird choice of controls. Surely you could get used to it if not for the fact that the game difficulty spikes too quickly before you can get used to the controls. It wouldn't be worth the effort anyway because the game itself is really uninspired. We've seen this done better in other games, including the obvious source material Super Meat Boy. This game does nothing new.\n\nThe hitboxes are another huge problem. In some stages they are completely broken. There was this stage where I kept dying after landing on a square with lava underneath. I died only because I wasn't exactly on the center of the square. I was still on the square but since I was not absolutely dead centered the game considered that I touched the lava and killed me. The same thing happened with sawmills. The sawmill didn't touch me but the game thought it did. You have to take extra effort of assuming that the hitbox will not work properly, otherwise you will die. If you trust what you see on screen, you will get frustrated. The game needed more polish before being released. \n\nI tried to like this game but I just can't. I am a fan of tough platformers. I've done 106% in Super Meat Boy, including some of the harder achievements such as no death runs. I beat 1001 Spikes including Antarctica. I really like challenging games. The problem is that this game is just not good. The level design is uninspired. Levels are bland and there is no variation really. You see one stage you see them all.\n\nOne thing I really despise in this game is when you die you get a message such as \"You died. That sucks\". Eventually if you die too much you get an \"achievement\" such as \"100th sawmill death\" or something like that. Maybe some people find it funny. I find it revealing of the game designer true intentions. SMB designers and Dark Souls designers don't want the player to fail. They want the player to succeed. They didn't make a hard game for difficulty's sake. People who made this game seem to want players to fail. This is  obviously inspired by I Wanna Be The Guy. The problem is that it was treated as joke in IWBTG. Death was funny. Not the case in here.\n\nThe hightlights for me are the soundtrack and the cutscenes. Those are really well made. I didn't expect production design this good in an indie game. The cutscenes are much better than those of Super Meat Boy and the writing is clever. I also like that you can restart the level at anytime by pressing Y. Having said that, there isn't much else that is positive.\n\nI have no idea how hard it must be to make your own game. I hope the creators don't get discouraged. The game has a lot of potential. It just needs more polish and a better approach to game design.", "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 7, "author": {"steamid": "76561198139870738", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1467338097, "num_games_owned": 63, "playtime_forever": 97}}, {"timestamp_created": 1487350416, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520356", "timestamp_updated": 1487350416, "recommendationid": "29988534", "votes_up": 11, "review": "Decent generic platformer with the full meaning of of it - it does nothing new or innovative that we haven't seen already.\nThis one got 0 momentum, so every pause midair or mid-dash is full stop.\n\nSaws, spikes, lasers, fires, missiles and so on... those are the kind of traps you can expect.\nI'd recommend this one to platformer fans, rather than people who seek brief casual experience, as it offers none of that.\nSimply hit it up to challenge yourself, beat it, and move on.\n\n6.5/10 for me.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561198040030741", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 106, "last_played": 1487345639, "num_games_owned": 828, "playtime_forever": 412}}, {"timestamp_created": 1459444440, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511930", "timestamp_updated": 1459444440, "recommendationid": "22163665", "votes_up": 13, "review": "This game is rage-inducing, challenging, and has made me angry at my controller countless times within the first 20 minutes of playing. Oh wait, not countless times. Exactly 97 times within 20 minutes. That's how many times I died within the first 14 levels on easy mode. \n\nSuper Robot Jump Jump is a fantastic platformer true to the genre. There aren't any deviations from what it claims to be. It is a challenging platformer through and through. The music sets the tempo of the game as you blast through parts of the level after dying to a god damn cloud over and over again. As soon as you make an error you tap Y (on the gamepad, my preferred method of platforming) and reset the level immediately. The pace is fast, the challenge is high, and the rewards are great! \n\nThere is no feeling like that of completing a level that increased my death counter from 47 to 82 (Level 12 Ugh). The art is cartoony and whimsical with a story and voice over work that matches that feeling beat for beat.

The first set consists of WASD for moving and space for jumping, while the other one has arrow keys for moving and numpad 0 (!?!?!?!?) for jumping. You can also use W or up arrow for jumping. I couldn't find any way to remap the keys.\n\nIf you're fine with these controls, then sure, but to me Z and arrow keys are the way to go for these type of platformers. Letting the player remap the keys would instantly fix these kind of issues.\n\nEDIT: After getting used to the silly controls and trying out the game more, I'm pretty disappointed in the level design as well. It feels bland and unsatisfying to play. There is usually a lot of stuff moving around at different speeds, which makes it feel like I have to trial-and-error the correct timings for different parts of the levels. I actually often found myself just sitting there, trying to figure out when and how to get through the next part.
