However I would recomend you don't make the mistake I made and purchace this instead of Race WTCC 07. That game basicly includes everything in this game plus another game, and  also has a wealth of mods on the internet, including the excelent 2012-2013 mod. For only $1 more it's an amazing value, and I ended up just purchacing that one and uninstalling this, because there was nothing more this could offer. As a game though I would recommend it. It's a bit of a hardcore sim, so if you're used to Burnout or Need for Speed you may have some trouble adjusting. However for the money it's a good deal.
