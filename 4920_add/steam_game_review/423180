There are three players ships that all nearly look identical, the weapons are uninspired, and the objectives are go here, survive, then go here.\n\nI returned to this game in an effort to give it one hour of gameplay. It is still very boring, repetitive, and pointless. The only good thing in this back is the background.  I also remember that I did not say that there is a bug when starting a level where you cannot move. You will need to exit the level and restart it to regain movement. I absolutely do not recommend this game.\n\nPros:\nGreat looking backgrounds.\n\nCons: \nRepetitive Music\nLackLuster Level Design\nLack Luster Ship Design\n\nDo you get one Hour of gameplay per $6 paid?: Yes. Game is cheap, you will at least get an hour out of it.\n\nEase of 100%: Very Easy, No achievements \n(100% Being all achievements, Unlocks, Upgrades, Ect.)", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197978232684", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 134, "last_played": 1495959267, "num_games_owned": 721, "playtime_forever": 75}}, {"timestamp_created": 1458322264, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488681", "timestamp_updated": 1458322264, "recommendationid": "21906901", "votes_up": 2, "review": "laggy and hard (poop)\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 4, "author": {"steamid": "76561198119010051", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1455585639, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 12}}], "success": 1}
