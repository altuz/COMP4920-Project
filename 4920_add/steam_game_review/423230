It's just different really. \n\nFuri is literally just Final Fantasy style boss fights, in that everyone has like 6 forms that you have to beat until they're truly defeated. Each form consists of one stage where you fight in the whole arena top down. There is usually a lot more shooting going on in this stage. Then when you damage the boss enough, you drop into close combat. Every boss is different and actually really challenging. It'll take you a few tries to beat any boss most likely. \n\nOne thing about Furi that I think is the key to it being great is that the timing for interations such as parrying and dodging are so precise, that even if you know what an enemies abilities are, you have to be focused on the game because you know you have 3 sweeping attacks to dodge and only a .1 sec window to do it on each of them. This makes you really get into the game, and also gives you one of the greatest feeling I've ever had in a game. It's challenging, but occasionally you do well, and you really do feel like a f***ing super saiyan when you're blinking across the battlefield, shooting, slashing, and parrying all perfectly.

This is one of those games that has not been made for a lot of people to like, rather for a few people to love. If you like action games, games with difficulty curves that require you to master it or bullet hell games, you're likely to love this game as much as I did. \n\nThe game's length varies dependent on how good you are, normally between 4-8 hours but I definately recommend playing through the game twice once you unlock the higher difficulty mode as it changes the movesets of the bosses rather than a simple damage value changed to add difficulty.\n\nThe main gripes I have with this game is the lackluster storyline which is a little dull and uninteresting in my opinion, and some moves seem a little unfair (e.g. on Furier difficulty some of the \"red pie chart\" attacks have safe zones that are incredibly hard and tight to get into with just one dodge). I also wish that there was some way to skip the walking sections because they're fine the first time you watch them, but are quite dull if you decide to replay (luckily there's an auto-walk button but you still need to watch the entire sections every time you replay).\n\nIf you decide to purchase this game MAKE SURE YOU BUY THE FURI + DLC BUNDLE! This is because it's not very expensive to buy the game with the DLC add-on and is definately worth the small extra asking price for what the DLC gives. Also, the soundtrack is insanely good, but you probably know that already.\n\nOverall: 8/10", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198055542075", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1505040929, "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_forever": 1787}}, {"timestamp_created": 1504633886, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "timestamp_updated": 1504633985, "recommendationid": "34761425", "votes_up": 1, "review": "This was my first bullet hell game experience, and I am incredibly glad I started with this game. This game absolutely nails the concept of personal progression, so that I always felt like I was getting better, even as the game continually beat me down over and over again. Each boss has a unique personality and reflective moveset; they all bring new elements into play that constantly refresh the game and pushed my reactionary capabilities further. The worldbuilding in this game has made many phenominal wallpapers, and the soundtrack is so solid that I believe it is capable of standing alone, even as it adds to the game it was made for.\n\n     But what I was most impressed with was how the entire thing is shown to the player. I was thrown into a violent world and told to fight. That is all I had. I was the guy breaking free, fighting in a world that makes no sense but at the same time amazed me. Throughout vast and foreign worlds, my character and my oddball companion were the only constants. Yet, despite having complete control of a character with no voice lines, I grew to realize how little this game was about me, the player. Although there is a predominant plot twist, it is paired with a gradual change as the player finds hints about the past of the character they inhabit, and the stories of those around him. By the end, the abstractions that make up the playable world feel relatable, and the \"people\" feel more human than anything else. \n\n     All this adds up to a game with unequalled replay value. The in-fight mechanics have an infinitely high skill ceiling, that always pushes me to improve. The various worlds in the game jump out and provide amazing explorability that I have hardly ever seen in any game, much less a game with set plot progression; the cinematics and choice camera angels of the game are incredible. The characters are thoroughly fleshed out, and able to tell their story and the protagonists with a handful of lines that never waste a word. The plot is steady, yet revealed for you to figure out through glimpses in words and phrases.

The animation does look a bit jank, given the low budget, but everything else is near-perfect. Astounding action game, fucking buy it.\n\n-Gameplay-\nFour simple moves (slash, gun, dodge, parry) make for a surprisingly in-depth combat system, built by character action aficionados for character action aficionados, meaning you can CANCEL ANYTHING INTO ANYTHING. The game itself can be completed with a basic grasp of those mechanics, but the skill ceiling and purpose-built speedrun strats are all there, and make the game look gorgeous when played in the right hands. \n\"Excellence is not an art, it's an habit.\"\n\n-Structure-\nSo, this game alternates hi-octane, masterfully designed boss fights and...well...remember those bits in Samurai Jack where Jack slowly walks through those sick ambient backdrops? Yeah, that. The boss fight are 9 (+1 DLC) in total, but last from roughly one hour (your first 5 attempts) to 20 minutes (the near-perfect run you pull off after that one hour of attempts), so in terms of the first playthough's longevity you've got nothing to worry about, with -at least- 8 hours of gameplay, pretty standard length for a character action game.\n\n-Visuals & Sound-\nOk, i'll be fair here: as stated above, the animations do look janky at times, that's french animation in general for ya.
