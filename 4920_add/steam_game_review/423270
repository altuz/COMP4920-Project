The gameplay is very satisfying and I'm sure you'll fall in love once you start playing.\n\nAs I mentioned, the gameplay is very satisfying.  Overall the combat is solid and very well done.  It is your typical light attack, heavy attack, but with some other goodies mixed in such as being able to actively dodge, blocking/parrying enemy attacks, and you can shoot enemies with your sidearm.  There are a variety of combos that you can pull off by stringing light attacks, heavy attacks, AND your ranged weapon, each combo has it's own unique style to them so you won't get bored watching the same thing over and over again.\n\nAlso you have an energy bar, using your ranged weapon will slowly deplete this gauge.  The bar will regenerate slowly over time, but can be refilled quicker by finding energy pick-ups.\n\nLastly there are two characters you can play, their fighting styles are different from eachother, one is more punching-oriented while the other kicking-oriented.  Nonetheless, both are very refreshing to play.\n\nThe level design is somewhat linear that are broken up into fight segments, where you have to defeat all enemies in an area before you can proceed.  Throughout the levels there are collectible items such as health pick-ups, energy pick-ups, and coins which contribute to your overall score.  you can find these in crates in which you can break open.\n\nA nit-pick I have with the game is how some fight segments are too short mainly due to enemies being too squishy.  Honestly it's not that big of a deal, but if I had to say something this would be it.  \n\nAs for the price-to-hours ratio, I'd say it is decent and you will definitely get more hours than it is worth, or definitely break-even.  The gameplay is good enough though so you'll for sure get your money's worth, especially if you're playing with friends/partner/wife/husband/kids.  From a singleplayer standpoint, the value is still there and you will for sure get your money's worth, it may not be as much as playing coop though.\n\nOverall very great game, you don't see very much [b]good[/b] beat-em-ups nowadays, but then you have Zheros which came in guns blazing showing that this genre is still alive.\n\nI hope this review helps you in deciding whether to purchase this game or not.\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561198040837514", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "last_played": 1487666449, "num_games_owned": 476, "playtime_forever": 490}}, {"timestamp_created": 1461501273, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498924", "timestamp_updated": 1461501339, "recommendationid": "22608953", "votes_up": 2, "review": "A cool beat 'em up with nifty graphics and, as has been said already, captures that saturday morning cartoon feel.

Unlike most games of this genre it isn't just going from left to right, there is a 3D element in play too as you can be heading up or down along a path as well, so it isn't quite linear, which opens the door for the a bit of exploring if it appears there are two paths you can take.The HUD is perfect in its simplicity, top par is your health, bottom bar is your energy (which is tied to the player's ability to block or fire a weaspon)\n\nThe controls are easy to learn, which is a huge plus, as some games tend to over-think the controlscheme a bit, though Zheros does have some control elements I don't like (the hold a button to charge an attack gimmick is something I truly hate, no matter the game). Playing normal difficulty, there is a nice even flow, where you have to learn and master all the basics, as knowing when to dodge and block can often be a determining factor being victory and defeat, by the end of the 3rd stage, a player should have all the basics down solid (at least in theory)\n\nThe music is where this game shines,  I was just bopping along to the sound track, it's that infectious! The sound effects are of a decent quality, the robots have little sounds they make when getting smack around which is a nice touch.\n\nVERDICT\nThough Zheros has very mixed reviews on Steam, I find it enjoyable for what it is, and since decent beat 'em games are not as easy to come by these days, I give this game my approval, and recommend you give it a shot!\n\nReview can also befound on my blog at www.fredcasdensbasement.com", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198104350086", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "last_played": 1487367264, "num_games_owned": 729, "playtime_forever": 52}}, {"timestamp_created": 1493311080, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1493311126, "recommendationid": "31396928", "votes_up": 0, "review": "Unintuitive gamepad controls which make pulling off moves more difficult than it has to be. \nAlso, the developers have been MIA, don't really seem to be listening to player feedback and yet they found the time and resources to release DLC.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198046951393", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1493414658, "num_games_owned": 328, "playtime_forever": 368}}], "success": 1}
