I wont give anything away but I will say that if you've ever played Jade Empire, and enjoyed it's style and storytelling, then Choice of Kung Fu will give you another chance to explore such a world again. Full of Kung Fu, Chi, Fox Spirits, Romance, and Rebellion; I was once again, pulled into the story of a single monk residing in a small monastery on the side of a mountain, seeking to learn from the fabled Dragon Sage. The breadth of play styles are impressive and refreshing as is usual in a Choice of Games/Hosted Games title. While the one ending I have gotten was fitting, it left me wanting more. Though, this is a testament to the quality of the story telling rather than the feeling of an incomplete narrative. \n\nA highly pleasurable title from our always entertaining friends at CoG/HG and the writers they help promote. I can solidly recommend Choice of Kung Fu to anyone who is a fan of, or has passing interest in, a Chinese themed setting that spans your life as a monk of the Order of the Peach Tree. Years will go by and it will be your choices that dictate the fate of the very nation you live in. Will you fight with honor and be as the Buddha would be? Perhaps you will dedicate your life to the pursuit of martial prowess and open a Dojo? Maybe you would just like to live happily with your thoughts as you create poetry with your lover? Maybe none of these things.

This game - it's in a quick summary simply amazing. The amount of work put into this makes it such a wonderful piece of art. The thought of a text based game may be quite effective as a deterrent at first glance but if you actually decide to play the game itself - you will see that it is simply a conclusion you came to rather than a fair representation of the game. The game is essentially a choose your own story type of game (which I am sure you already figured) but with a nice touch to it - since there is no audio or graphics (except for the text of course) there are really no limitations - instead of the game lacking in depth but making up for it in graphics or audio for example (*cough* Battlefront 3 *cough*) this game has been able to focus all of it's resources on the story itself making it a wonderful game with such a great story. I would absolutely recommend checking it out - it's definetly worth it and if you don't like it - refund it! As long as you keep the time under 2 hours during the first 2 weeks you're set (And I seriously doubt that you'll need 2 hours to decide.)
