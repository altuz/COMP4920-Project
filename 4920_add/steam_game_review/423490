That's how I played the game. As background I loved Apache 2, Comanche, etc. some 15 years ago and had a HOTAS and rudder pedal setup back then, but no more.\n\nTLDR this is a 7 out of 10 recommend (buy on sale) for Xbox controller gamers looking for a bit of approachable helicopter \"sim-lite\" nostalgia but be ready to walk away or be frustrated.\n\nI really had high hopes for this sim. Finally an approachable helicopter combat game that can be played with an Xbox controller! \n\nSadly the Xbox controls don't feel good to me. Anything beside Pilot mode doesn't feel remotely helicopter-ish. In Pilot mode I've tried multiple different setups, but nothing clicks. There's too much going on and it feels like you are fighting the controls the whole time rather than feeling like the game experience was optimized for the controller. I got stuck on the Jungle Air Support mission near the end of the campaign where you have to do lots and lots of manual shooting because the auto-gunner is too slow and aims at friendly troops. Ultimately I've had some fun with the game, but not finishing sucks.\n\nClose air support of friendly troops in particular is NOT fun. The Jungle Air Support mission is just torture. \n-- The auto-gunner targets FRIENDLY troops (WHY???) and there is nothing mapped on the controller to switch targets.\n-- Manual aiming is frustrating, particularly while zoomed -- the camera needs to pan to follow the manual aiming box when it hits the edge of the screen when TrackIR isn't in use. You do get this behavior in autohover & gunner camera view, but that's not always viable. The sensitivity needs to be turned way down to hit anything. Perhaps map the left stick Y-access to vertical camera pan when in autohover/manual aim?  Manually panning with the D-pad is a poor solution -- you need your hands on the sticks. Why can't tapping B switch weapons and holding B reload weapons? That frees up a shoulder button to act as a \"shift or toggle key\" that could remap the sticks and face buttons when held (or toggled), allowing \"pilot mode\" and \"gunner mode\" that adds more targeting functions that currently are keyboard-only and \"freelook\". Manual gunning outside of autohover is clearly what is intended but I have been unable to achieve the control necessary to beat Jungle Air Support mission despite many, many attempts even with all the damage settings turned off and on easier difficulty.\n\nMost of the reviews for the Xbox One version really trash it - and I can't argue with their objections. I bought it on PC pre-release and had lower expectations for polish; but I was looking a sim-lite that I could play and have fun with a controller and it comes close but ultimately frustrates. I imagine the PC HOTAS or keyboard/mouse crowd may have less to complain about.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197986675316", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1505152593, "num_games_owned": 120, "playtime_forever": 1427}}, {"timestamp_created": 1503354074, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498826", "timestamp_updated": 1503354074, "recommendationid": "34403919", "votes_up": 1, "review": "a nice easy going flight sim nothing to fancy great to take the load of your day as you blow stuff up.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027732286", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1506121619, "num_games_owned": 96, "playtime_forever": 78}}, {"timestamp_created": 1500230303, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492613", "timestamp_updated": 1500230303, "recommendationid": "33591340", "votes_up": 1, "review": "There is nothing more exciting than using my favorite helicopter to destroy everything I see.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561198261344265", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1500228532, "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_forever": 111}}, {"timestamp_created": 1503390910, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453191", "timestamp_updated": 1503390910, "recommendationid": "34411119", "votes_up": 1, "review": "This game sucks!
