This game is HARD, even on the easy difficulty. That is all fine, but the problem is that it is not really a fun experience. Boring enemies, boring towers. The points you spend can not be refunded and put elsewhere into the \"talent tree\", so if you make the wrong choices early game you will be utterly destroyed later in the game, as me and others have experienced on level 15, but with no way to fix it other than start over on another save from the beginning.\n\nThe only positive thing is that the achievements are super easy to 100%.\n\nSave yourself some money and buy another tower defense.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198058552427", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 1502288834, "num_games_owned": 494, "playtime_forever": 416}}, {"timestamp_created": 1501520533, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502063", "timestamp_updated": 1501520533, "recommendationid": "33931409", "votes_up": 2, "review": "There is absolutely nothing new here.
