This is SimTower for a new generation. Certain aspects of SimTower are removed: There is no traffic management of elevators, or rules about elevator sizes. I'm 50-50 on that. It was both crucial and important to SimTower, it is not so much here. To say it is less complex or simple, I would say is looking at rose colored glasses for SimTower.\n\nIf you are the type that is into min-maxing into the perfect tower, stay away. Once you reach a steady mid-game state it's 'downhill' from there. Large towers, and 'end game' apartments, businesses, and offices are fairly easy to keep happy and profitable. I can agree to reviews that say this is simple, but this is also because it lets you play at your own pace. Once you understand base mechanics you cannot easily fall into a trap that would create difficulty for you.\n\nFor me, this game scratches the same part of my brain as Cities: Skylines. While underlying mechanics are simplistic and once you cross initial hurdles you can expand upward (literally and figuratively) very readily. In this, and in Cities, I can turn a profit very readily and get a 'perfect' grid of a city, or in this case, a tower. That can happen quickly, and the challenge from that angle is very light. \n\nMy advice, you can and should design aesthetically pleasing and interesting towers. Make separate towers for your apartments and your offices. Make a skybridge to a mall area from the apartments. Challenge yourself to design aesthetically and think realistically: Maybe I want every floor to have a common area, or a coffee shop. Maybe I want to make a tower with some odd shape.\n\nThis game absolutely will not have universal acclaim, but I think that's OK. If you are a creative type that likes a game at your own pace, with a decent art style, and want to create cool towers that still function efficiently despite design challenges, this is a thumbs up for you.\n\nIf you are a min-max sort of person who wants the challenge of Rimworld or other similar games where efficiency is absolutely key and more difficult to achieve and don't care about decorating a lobby, skip it. \n\nOn sale for $5 I almost immediately bought all of the DLCs after playing for only 30 minutes because I knew I was into it. Admittedly $20+DLC is a little bit more than I might value it for how casual it is, but I will definitely put quite a few hours into it especially if small DLCs come out periodically. It also has workshop support which is a nice addition.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\n*If you like to min-max and don't care about making things look aesthetically good in a builder game (Rimworld, Dwarf Fortress, Cities:Skylines), avoid it.\n*If you like designing things aesthetically even if they are not perfectly efficient but still finding a way to make it work and look cool while doing it, pick it up.\n*The price point is relatively fair, but I would say a small sale (~$10-$15USD) is my personal value point. DLCs are far from 'necessary' but a nice addition for relatively cheap. *NOTE I have not played Vegas, yet.\n", "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561197976588426", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 472, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506894775, "num_games_owned": 299, "playtime_forever": 472}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505462492, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522232", "timestamp_updated": 1505462492, "recommendationid": "34966593", "votes_up": 17, "review": "Remind me of SimTower with more improvement", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 8, "author": {"steamid": "76561198036165758", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 244, "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1507198710, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_forever": 2085}}, {"timestamp_created": 1506647814, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517798", "timestamp_updated": 1506647814, "recommendationid": "35278455", "votes_up": 10, "review": "Missing a key element that made Simtower so great =(\n\nI wanted to love this game because it looked like a true sequel to simtower.. but after playing i feel it falls too short in this one area:\n- No micro management of civil engineering. In simtower a huge part of the game is micro managing elevators, escalators, stairs, and parking. Every NPC would have a routine and need adequate ways to get around without having to wait in line too long for an elevator. You'd have to focus a lot on optimization because your NPCs would have patience levels waiting for an elevator and would move out of your building if their patience ran out. I loved the feeling of saving enough to purchase a larger elevator shaft that could hold more people. \nAll of that has been dumbed down in project highrise from what i can tell. Seems like as long as you don't have too much space between your elevator shafts - your elevator overlay will always be in the green. \nJust feels like hugeee part of a good tower simulator is missing from this game making it feel dumbed down. I appreciate the work the developer made on other aspects that greatly imporved over simtower.. but missing the mark completely on civil engineering is like making a city building game that skips over the importance of traffic management. \n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971958202", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 839, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506723608, "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_forever": 839}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505970094, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513952", "timestamp_updated": 1505970094, "recommendationid": "35097702", "votes_up": 7, "review": "I was looking for a modern SimTower, and this fits pretty well.

It is essentialy a building simulator starting with the base game itself. You can set the challenge level according to what you would like to accomplish.  Feel like being wacky and off the wall with your highrise, setting up the game to easy level with the option of unlimited cash and resources can  allow you to do that. But let us say that you want to understand what it takes to build and operate a highrise in real world terms as close as you can possibily understand at that moment, the game settings can allow you to do that. Also, this game teaches the player a few points that are essential in the real world when you think about it..patience, pragmatic forethought and money management.  Because, if you set this game to the normal or harder levels, patience is needed to wait for when the moment is right to build more and expand, pragmatic forethought is preparing yourself for when you need to make smart decisions in a time of crisis or take advantage of a bad situation in your highrise in order to advance your ambitions to the next level...whatever they might be.\n\nSome of my likes about just the base game alone is that the challeges you take on from the beginning.  I have to admit that although I had to restart my game to the beginning because I did not understand certain concepts of play or, for example, why I had to replace essential lines after I tore down a section of wall.  Once I understood that, then I was better prepared.  \n\nMy dislikes to the game is that there is no multiplayer competition or cooperative play options. I would assume that in real world building  and operations management...there are those who compete to see who can create the best highrise and keep it operational and in the black the longest or have a team create and operate a highrise together.  \n\nIf I could make any suggestions that might be of interest to the developers...as for random events, could tthere be some random \"human\" events that could happen in the game like a bombing or riot for example or some other nautral events like a hurricane or a tornado?  Also, since the Miami Malls DLC has been created, could it be reminded that commuter trains are to be build on elvated and not underground since the earth around Miami is largely coral bedrock or create a game option that can determine how far you can build underground.  One last suggestion, since there are other builldings around the world that have added green technologies into there building designs...I was wondering if the same could be done for this game as well?\n\nSo, you like to building and running your own personal modern day monoliths for the fun of it, then Project Highrise is for you!!! ;)  \n\nSo, what will you build today????", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198257854117", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 926, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1507172870, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_forever": 2766}}, {"timestamp_created": 1506154631, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508732", "timestamp_updated": 1506154631, "recommendationid": "35147200", "votes_up": 13, "review": "This SimTower reboot takes all that was good about the 1994 game and throws it out the window.\n\nYou're left with micromanaging each and every office and home, laying pipe, waiting for construction to happen, and generally having a bad time.

I'll try to explain why.\n\nIn my opinion the 'Simulation' genre, is a genre that is almost more Sandbox than the Wide Open Sandbox games. The Simulation genre of games like Tropico, Project Highrise, or a huge amount of Kalypso's library are literal sandboxes, where you decide what kind of game you're going to play this time.\n\n\"I'm going to build a huge hotel with zero offices and the best Casinos and Concert Halls on the block.\"\n\"I'm going to build a mall with no offices or apartments, and literally nothing but stores and restaurants.\"\n\"I'm going to build a Dystopian Style Office complex with nothing but Plebs making me money.\"\n\nAnd so on. Think of them like terms and conditions for your playthrough of that Sandbox mode.\n\nAnd well....the more DLC that comes out for a game, the more tools you have in the sandbox. The more options for roleplaying with your imagination and building your tower come out. The DLC is pretty cheap, and the game goes down to around $5 for the base game during sales (It's 5.49 Canadian as of this review), and the bundle gives you a good 10% discount on all DLC if you get it as it comes out.\n\nUltimately although my reaction to this game isn't that it's the most stellar thing ever. I seriously have to look at something like say Tropico 4, or Fallout 4, or the Sims 3 and ask myself. \"How fun would those games be if you had JUST the base game and literaly no extra content?\" No cement factory or plantation in Tropico 4, no farm plots, robots, or vault stuff in Fallout 4, and literally none of the wacky stuff that makes Sims 3 into the equivalent of living in a Midsummer's night dream with Witches, Fairies, and Robots.\n\nSo yeah, this game might seem like a 7/10 right now, but I have no question that when the last DLC is out and we have every tool available to us, it'll be an amazing piece of tower fun. I mean it's not like the game will get worse with more options.\n\nSo I'll give it a recommendation, it's certainly worth the money if you get it on sale, and it's a simulation game, so you're likely going to spend enough hours in it just getting through the first few scenarios to make it worth it.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198023740727", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 590, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1507093487, "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 2549}}, {"timestamp_created": 1506968137, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1506968137, "recommendationid": "35425386", "votes_up": 1, "review": "\"I wish there were some elevators\"\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1155665521\nThis game is pretty neat. It is a lot like SimTower from back in the day, but with some extra neat features like gaining the ability to gain additional perks through hiring consultants and spending \"influence points\" or, by conducting marketing campaigns where you spend \"buzz\". There are also a number of contracts which allow you to gain a little extra cash by meeting city goals. For instance, you might get a contract for increased urban densification where you're rewarded for building a number of apartments. I went after this contract and over-leveraged myself, taking out a loan to complete the project only to fall short of the cash I needed to finish, leading to a rough few days where I thought I might go bankrupt. But when I finally managed to collect enough money to finish building and opening some of them, alongside a media campaign which dropped the price of building them and increased the rate at which they filled, I managed to scrape by and claimed my reward from the contract (plus the large increase in daily revenues I experienced after that). That was fun.\n\nNow for the bad. The pathfinding on the people living, working, and visiting your tower is horrendous. They will wander back and forth across floors, alternating constantly between stairs and elevators while complaining that your building has no elevators. I think the best way to handle this is probably to remove the stairs, but it makes no sense why this should occur. In the picture I linked above, that worker was literally standing in front of the elevator complaining that my building doesn't have elevators - and people will move out based on this complaint (except for your service workers - they're stuck there like indentured servants, mwuhaha). This quickly gets frustrating. Also, this seems to be a disregarded issue that the devs likely won't fix seeing as the game already has 3 expansions.\n\nThe services you add to your building are kind of neat, but also kind of jarring. In what world does a building manager build and pay for a copy center, a parcel delivery office (FedEx?), a water delivery service, etc etc. Especially with the ability to rent to different and unique tenants who move in, it seems like a better option would have been to attract businesses that perform these services, leading to awesome synergies within the same building (e.g. having a parcel delivery company that benefits from other offices in the building, plus increases their happiness in kind). The game already kind of has that synergy building element between businesses in other ways (e.g. creatives and lawyers often want cafes they can frequent) - that approach would have been much more interesting. On top of that, my janitorial services seem to do very little except satisfy the couple of office types which expect them, with offices rapidly getting dirty and requiring repairs from my maintenance office.\n\nAnother jarring thing is how the market can suddenly start booming in your city... for a day. So rents will go up and people will move in faster for that day only... because apparently that's how markets work. It's kind of a neat idea, but it really detracts from the world-building (tower-building?) aspect that is part of the core of this game.\n\nIt is also quickly starting to get dull for me. It is hard to explain why exactly. I love these kinds of games usually. I sunk tons of time into SimTower back in the day, and when I can find time I occasionally spend long hours on city builders like Cities Skylines.\n\nI really want to like this game. It just feels like it's too unpolished to upvote.

Would be better if you could skip to the next midnight instead, or if there was more to do while you're waiting for the next paycheck.
