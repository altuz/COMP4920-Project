The whole experience is very smooth and I haven't had any major problems with the puzzles which I liked.The story is nice and switching between 2 playable characters adds variety. The game has fully voice acting which can be a hit or miss sometimes but in here it fortunatelly works great. The 2D animations are gorgeous and definitely are the selling point in here. So if you like nice art, 2D traditional animations, good story, nice characters I definitelly encourage you to pick this one up. Very pleasent experience and good time with the game. As a point and click game I give it 9/10.Very well done.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198114873144", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "last_played": 1505071035, "num_games_owned": 492, "playtime_forever": 255}}], "success": 1}
