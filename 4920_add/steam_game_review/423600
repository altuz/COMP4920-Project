I already own it through Big Fish Games, but I wanted to have it on Steam, too.  I hope the other two parts are released on Steam as I will surely buy them.\n\nThe reason I like it is for exactly the points other reviwers made .. I like the graphics, I like that the first chapter shows you how to do things, I like the settings, and I like the bit of South American history that's slyly inserted, even if there are some fantasy elements in later chapters.  \n\nIn parts 2 and 3 of the Trilogy, it's much more free form and some of the irritating things, like having to click for Adelantado to pick things up from broken barrels become automatic, which is a great relief, and you can destroy unwanted buildings, too.\n\nAs The Gentle Hermit said, it's a gentle game, very family friendly.  I really hope people will give the game a chance as it really does get improved with each part of the Trilogy.

Extremely repetitive actions\n2. Placing buildings is a mess. They have trouble fitting and once you've placed them you can't even destroy them and to place them elsewhere.. (unless there's an option and I didn't see it)\n3. All you ever do is follow endless instructions about the tasks. Example: Restore building X so we can have X resources. Build a tower there. We need more food build some more gardens. Go there to help that guy. Click here, click there. Do this, do that. It ends up being really annoying and dull. The game gives almost 0 liberty to the player to do things their way.\n4. From what I saw you only have your main character and the labourers. You main character is the only one who can breaks pots and talk to the Indians and other people in the game. So again, that makes for endless clicking everywhere that does not give you any sense of accomplishment. \n5. Extremely repetitive actions (see what I did here)\n6. Nothing exciting about the game\n7. Your buildings lose some efficiency over time and I don't even know if you can reset them or do something to restart production (honestly at this point the game I didn't even bother looking).\n\nI still enjoyed the graphic style of the game (don't get me wrong it could've been a great game if only the tasks and missions were a little more interesting) but the structure of the gameplay is just very dull and unfulfilling, \nI'm sorry if my review seems rash but it's what I felt playing the game..\nDon't buy if you're over 12 yo I would suggest..", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 4, "author": {"steamid": "76561198054054829", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1450740538, "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_forever": 132}}], "success": 1}
