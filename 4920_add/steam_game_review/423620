If there are usually a lot of towers in other TD games, there you can find only 5. Only 5, really? Yeah, it's the main game idea. You need to use heroes to defeat enemies. Every hero is strong against special type of monsters; the guy with arbalet kills vampires in a couple of shots, the old mage with holy water wipes out a pack of skeletons.\n\nThere is a city, where you can power up your heroes. You can learn skill for each of them. Tree skill is small, but anyway it's interesting to choose which skill you will learn right now. \nAlso, there is rune system. You can put different runes into hero's weapon and when you charge him (upgrade) in the battle, he will receive this bonus. For example, there are damage runes, range runes and more interesting tunes, like \"75% change to attack with extra projectile\".\n\nSo, you pass a mission, go to the town, unlock new heroes/buildings, upgrade your heroes and start new mission. Easy to understand.\n\nWhat I like\n- Awesome 2d art\n- Fresh gameplay idea\n- Easy to undestand\n- Good voice acting\n- Tree skill for every hero\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=970812927\n\nWhat I didn't like\n- There are only 5 towers/units. It's a really small amount. Also, you summon them all in every battle, so every mission you play with the same towers.. It's quite boring.\n- The TD game is supposed to be strategy game. You need to think about tactic, find the best spots for towers and etc. The main part of gameplay of this game is relocating these 5 towers. When a wave starts you move them to a start point, some of them pass through, you move heroes to the end point. When new wave starts, enemies go on another road, you need to move heroes there. Repeat these actions X times (x - number of waves in the mission) to complete the level.\n- The gameplay is the same in all missions. Yeah, there are different roads, some bosses come, and there are shrines for heroes. But, you play the same mission exactly is previous. I would like to see more diversity in enemies, more special skills, something new, which could let me give a desire to continue the game.\n- Story is boring. Characters are usual. Dialogues bring nothing interesting to the game.\n- Game requires playing previous stages to unlock new ones. I got stuck 3 times because of it. I couldn't finish the game, because i was forced to replay 6 stages to unlock the final mission. But I didn't want to do that.\n- I would like to see active heroes\u2019 skills. It's really boring when you can only move them around the map and upgrading them. For example, KR series has 2 active spells, meteor shower and reinforcements. It's really enjoyable to use them. There are no such spells.\n- Rune system reminds me free-to-play mobile games. Grind gold, buy runes, combine runes to get stronger one. Repeat. I think, it wasn't a good idea to put this mechanic in PC game. Also, when you make an upgrade you don't feel what your hero become stronger. You start with \"+10% damage rune\". Really? The price of upgrading is equal to price of new hero. So, it's better to summon heroes instead of upgrading them.\n- There are no numbers. You can't see amount of health of monsters, you can't find how much extra damage hero does. It's a bad for mw. I would like to see more information. It's an important part of a strategy game, which helps players to find the best tactic.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=970812877\n\nSo, why have I given this game a positive review, if there are so many minuses? I have almost finished the game.  I suppose, if you play the game and could complete it, it can't be a bad game. The 15$ price tag is too high, I am sure. But i got this game with 70% discount, and this price is fair.\n\nP.S. I hope, devs will notice bad design decisions and make the next game more interesting.

The game has 5 towers/Heroes, so do not confuse this for a TD that has towers & heroes. I do enjoy the game but this is not a game for everyone. I personally feel the game is very grind heavy when at times it shouldn't be, stages don't really have a learning curve they have a \"grind curve\". Example in a two star level you may be able to beat it with 3 heroes with no problem, the third star... well now expect to spend another 1 hour grinding out \"hero/tower\" levels & money to upgrade your weapons in hopes you'll get the runes you need. I say \"Grind Curve\" because you don't have to change up your strategy you just have to \"grind\" till you can beat the level. Look at the achievements, look at \u201cmaster blacksmith\u201d & \u201cSavior\u201d hardly anyone has achieved these yet this is a main part of the game. The grinding just doesn't feel that rewarding very often in this game. The game play is super smooth and the game is fun, well worth the $ I spent on it while it was on sale. P.S. Yes I would purchase DLC if they had it especially if the DLC including several new \u201cHeroes/towers\u201d \n I personally thought 2 of the voice actors & their voice acting (especially jack) was horrible. \n\nPros:\nOk story\nGame Play\nArt/Graphics\nSome elements outside of just leveling your \"tower/hero\"\nUnique (towers/heroes)\nFun Levels\nlow end learning curve\nEach Stage is unique\nCharacter Designs are great\n\nCons:\nGrind Heavy\nRepetitive because of 5 heroes/towers\n\u201cJack\u201d (his voice is annoying and the voice actor is horrible).\nFalls short just simply due to the lack of content.\nFeels like there is more to come... but there isn't", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198054382565", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1499653809, "num_games_owned": 133, "playtime_forever": 1638}}, {"timestamp_created": 1499727287, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "timestamp_updated": 1499727287, "recommendationid": "33442789", "votes_up": 2, "review": "Sadly this game misses being an outstanding title by introducing grinding as a core concept.\nBeautiful design and a fresh approach to tower defense can not make up for forced repetition of the same levels over and over again.\nAdding to this is the fact that a spent resource is spent no matter what. For example if you use gems to build a shrine (a buff for your heros) and want to restart the level to try something different your ressources are not reset. So you have to go back to another level and do that again only, and I mean only, because there is nothing new in terms of skills or enemies, to farm resources. This might be fun for a few hours but it becomes a chore when you need ressources only to advance in the story, which is by the way not worth mentioning.\nThis game is a good idea not thought through properly. Some player might like doing repetetive stuff and grinding but I'd rather play defense grid for the 6th time than giving me this tedious and in the end rather boring failed attempt to reinvent the wheel.\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561197991867769", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1500592615, "num_games_owned": 158, "playtime_forever": 1375}}, {"timestamp_created": 1501348502, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "timestamp_updated": 1501348502, "recommendationid": "33885529", "votes_up": 2, "review": "Hello, reader. Different folks read different reviews based on which ones have the most thumbs up, thumbs down, or even only the positives, or only the negatives...and some folks try to read as many as they can, regardless of rating or positive/negative opinion of the game, hoping to figure out if it's right for them before purchasing. For Hero Defense, I would specifically encourage you to look at what almost everyone agrees on, whether positive or negative: [b]the grinding[/b].\n\nThis is a competent tower defense with a nice visual aesthetic, some alright gameplay, and a corny plot (those can be fun in games). However, upgrading your weapons and your heroes requires a very large amount of runes, gold, and experience, which requires playing the same levels many, many times. The positive reviews and negative reviews will both quite frequently point out that there is a grind, and I will say that it is a very prominent part of the game.\n\nThe grind in the game both looks and feels to me like a mobile free-to-play game at times, which I found very disconcerting, personally. There are no purchases in this game using real money as of right now, but it has a grind reminiscent of a \"freemium\" game, with little stars filling in next to each level as you complete different difficulties, and a second currency (runestones) which you can buy with the less-useful and more plentiful currency (gold). Character progress stagnates without these resources to increase XP gains, weapon damage bonuses, unlock more equippable bonuses, etc.\n\nIf even the slightest sensation of a game feeling like a freemium game turns you off on a game, then Hero Defense is not for you, as was the case for me. If you love the feeling of a freemium game without spending real money and dealing with the grind that entails, then Hero Defense might be something you would enjoy if you like the other aspects of the game.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561197972040704", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 455, "last_played": 1501346673, "num_games_owned": 831, "playtime_forever": 652}}, {"timestamp_created": 1501821193, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489970", "timestamp_updated": 1501821193, "recommendationid": "34007963", "votes_up": 1, "review": "i liked it", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561198029751280", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "last_played": 1478577309, "num_games_owned": 334, "playtime_forever": 422}}], "success": 1}
