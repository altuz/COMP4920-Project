In a typical game, there are only two kinds of enemies. Once you reach the stage where a 3rd type of enemy starts to appear, the game changes from extremely easy to insanely difficult. And it's not about me being a poor player, I made it to top-10 on global ranking, but apparently, there hasn't been much gameplay testing, because it's just not very fun this way.\n\nThis game is basically about dodging bullets, the enemies spawn at fixed intervals at the edges of the screen, and if you happen to be there at that time, game over. You have to have a hunch of when the new wave might appear, and be at the center. Your ship seems to have mass, because there's a delay in steering. Which could be undestandable in a simulator type game, but in a bullet-dodging game, it's not that great. Sometimes 5 (or more) shooting enemies spawn at the same time, and if you decided to stop moving after clearing a wave, well... you get the idea. Also, having about a second of delay in shooting doesn't help much in an arcade shooter. Call it consistency if you want.\n\nThat's about it regarding the classic mode. The chaos mode seemed to be truly chaotic, because you would get updates for your weapon or more speed at random times, overpowering a wave or two completely and then returning to the gameplay of the classic mode.\n\nAs icing on the cake, scoring is also flawed. As you shoot your enemies, the combo-bar builds up, and if you shoot frequent enough, your multiplier rises. But, if you happen to finish one wave off too quickly, the pause between the next one gets so long, that you lose the multiplier! So you have to be careful not to shoot too much...\n\nI bought this game for 1.50\u20ac, wouldn't recommend the game for that price.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197983809771", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1472578844, "num_games_owned": 79, "playtime_forever": 347}}, {"timestamp_created": 1462262593, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501816", "timestamp_updated": 1462262593, "recommendationid": "22774004", "votes_up": 3, "review": "I just lol when I saw Dev is #1 on the leaderboards and thought this will be a piece of cake.\n\nI had a quick play through and this twin-stick shooter is challenging.
