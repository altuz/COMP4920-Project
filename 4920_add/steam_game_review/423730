Likely a dead project no longer being worked on, and another example of why Early Access can bite those who buy into it on BOTH sides.\n\nOtherwise the gameplay screams \"Twin-stick shooter\" mechanics, but it's not. Think RC Pro Am or Rock'n'Roll Racing controls instead, but at much higher speeds. Horrible. Should've gone with modern \"twin-stick\" controls.\n\nFixing the controls and actually adding some content (online co-op) would make this a reasonable successor to Geometry Wars; perhaps superior. Since it appears abandoned however, I'll be hiding it from my library.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198034361185", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1495437147, "num_games_owned": 561, "playtime_forever": 7}}], "success": 1}
