I received the game with a discount using a coupon but after beating it would have definitely paid the full price. Plenty of boss fights, difficult but definitely decernable puzzles and certainly humorus moments.\n\nThe game is a bit short but satisfying...though I couldn't help but want more. Now I am off to try hardcore mode and figure out where all the stuff I missed is. Looking forward to see what else the developer pops out.\n\n(UPDATE)\nHardcore mode is a bit beyond me which (as someone who loves achievement hunting) is a bit sad. Made it to the last boss. but said boss on hardcore has a speed buff I can't see how to beat.

(Ver 1.42) [/h1]\n\nAfter getting a coupon for -90%, I figured why not, but having played through the game I couldn't help but see a bunch of problems that kinda need attention, as well as general criticisms that I don't think will change but I still did not really like.  \n \n* Really do not like the combat. Combat is real time which isn't necessarily bad, but because what you could do was typically very limited and only could be done at certain times, it felt really bad.  \nFor example, in a fight you could basic attack, cast a spell, guard or use an item such as a healing potion.  \nHowever, fights would typically devolve in to mindlessly doing two things - casting your strongest spell and occasionally topping off your health and mana. There was very little variety in how to play fights because you didn't have time to think and plan what to do, and you objectively had a strongest attack which you'd just spam in order.  \nAs such a lot of bosses and enemies just felt like stat checks, since there wasn't really any thought in to beating them it was just \"Spam this as much as possible and either kill the enemy or die\".  \nCombat definitely needs work in some way, whether it's dropping it down to be turn based to slow things down and let the player plan how to play, or overhaul the items and attacks the player could use in order to make things less binary.  \n\n* Controls were clunky and could probably do with breaking up some of the buttons which were \"press this to do everything\", and also there were times in the game which handled REALLY badly. One that springs to mind was the lava lake section, where sometimes the character wouldn't move as you wanted which was really frustrating.  \n\n* Some things felt fanservicey. I know some people like that, but personally I do not.  \n\n* Game felt very linear with not much side questing or exploration to get up to. There was a gold collection mechanic too, but never really anything to buy so it would just turn in to \"well I can buy hundreds of this thing and I've got nothing else to purchase, so ok\".  \n\nOverall I feel like the game does have potential, but currently isn't really fleshed out enough to justify buying.", "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198049190787", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1501605717, "num_games_owned": 127, "playtime_forever": 393}}], "success": 1}
