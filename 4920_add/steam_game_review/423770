I've only played 5 hours so far and about 35 days in and here's some things to say about it:\n\n1. The first problem is the map of the place, like seriously, how big does it need to be? It took me nearly an hour to learn how the map is laid out and where all the shops are placed, way too long.\n\n2. You barely get to farm. At the start there's like 6 places where you can grow plants and you have to upgrade your hoe to be able to farm in the other spots.\n\n3. You can't name your own animals or pick up your chickens. This is something that makes me sad, part of the reason why I loved Harvest Moon is that you could name all your animals and you could pick up your chickens, adds to the emotional attachment.\n\n4. You can't hatch your own chickens. I really liked being able to hatch my own chickens.\n\n5. When you buy chickens you have to wait until they start laying eggs. Like, really?\n\n6. You can't move the animals at all which makes things annoying when they're standing in literally the only exit of one part of the enclosure. I once had to sit there for like 5 minutes waiting for the damn chicken to move so I could get its egg.\n\n7. Energy usage is weird and you don't get enough of it. So you don't use energy for watering your plants, but you do when you pick up mushrooms? And by the time you've picked up all the mushrooms you've used half of your energy which will only last 3-4 stumps.\n\n8. Mushrooms are randomy placed. Just a nitpicky thing, I don't like it\n\n9. Nothing to do. By the time you run out of energy it's like 1pm and you can't do anything more so you end up going to sleep at like 3pm every day. I find that a waste, you should be able to restore your energy more than just the one burger you can get at the restaurant\n\n10. I don't like how the mines work. There's multiple mines in the map, all of the stones are placed in exactly the same place and once you've mined them you have to wait a couple days before they regenerate. I much prefer how Harvest Moon does mining\n\n11. Popups every time you do something. You get the same damn popup every time you pick up a mushroom, drives me nuts\n\n12. Only 2 cows. Even when you upgrade your barn you can only have 2 cows and 2 sheep, I want more :(\n\n13. Instantly upgrading the cow barn. Like seriously, I bought the upgrade and I walked home and it was upgraded. I'd prefer it if it took a few days at least, makes it more realistic and forces you to play some more.\n\n14. There are areas where you think you can walk but there's no actual walking space there.\n\n15. You can't die or faint from over working, but if you dare to harvest honeycomb without spraying the bees then you're as good as dead.\n\n16. No seasons. This is something that I really missed, having different seasons where you can grow different crops and you collect different items from the ground.\n\n17. The heart system is weird. First you have to get them to 5 stars, then you get blue hearts, then green hearts? or is it red hearts? I can't even remember\n\nI've barely even started this game, I'm only 35 days in, upgraded my barn and barely got a girl to like me and you can already see how many complaints I have. I only got this game for 50c though so I don't really care but I don't recommend buying it at full price when you can download Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town for free and it's 100x better.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198243668604", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1498118762, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_forever": 324}}, {"timestamp_created": 1498159910, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_updated": 1498159910, "recommendationid": "32649539", "votes_up": 2, "review": "consider the price. its a good game. but it sure takes time to gather all the pearl which is abit time wasting. the rest is all good", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198181433030", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1498334336, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_forever": 1076}}], "success": 1}
