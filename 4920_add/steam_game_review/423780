I ejoyed playing the games however it most definatly had flaws. firstly I don't think it is the most graphically beautiful game which is a shame because the enviroment it is set in lends itself to stunning visuals. Secondly I'm not to sure about how well the controller support works as we had a few issues to start with. Thirdly I do feel that the menu's were'nt brilliantly designed. None the less we actually enjoyed playing Zero G and feel that with a bit of work it could maybe even reach the hights of the Portal games.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561198126880559", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1474810147, "num_games_owned": 83, "playtime_forever": 44}}], "success": 1}
