It's one of those games where you start out high-fiving your buddies but by the end you're punching each other, or at least everyones punching Jeff because that guy can't ever freakin lose. Screw you Jeff. \n\nBefore purchasing I had only played it at various events so this was the first time for me playing single player, which is a great addition. The 'horde mode' style single-player brings me back to my days in the arcade chasing the top high score, and the use of the keyboard and mouse is great (I might even prefer it to a controller, surprisingly).\n\nI know the devs of this game (bought the game though, did not receive it free), and regardless this game is worth picking up whether you are in it for the classic arcade-ness of the single player, or just really good couch-muliplayer fun.

Here's a spoiler though. I think it is very good.\nFast, snappy dual joystick control and clean mechanics. Feels similar to TowerFall or Smash Bros., where it's not so much variety of moves or abilities, but how you can use the simple tools made available to you in Astervoid 2000 that make it a fun pick up and play game for a group of friends. \nThe Single player wave mode is very entertaining for a few minutes at a time, and it's the sort of thing I can see myself coming back to in fits and starts for a long while to come. \nEverything included, music, graphics, mechanics, is polished to a high shine, but there might not be enough there to keep anything less than a group of 3 or 4 engaged for a long time. The addition of some extra layers to the game, new modes, new weapons, abilities, etc. would probably cement Astervoid 2000s place as a couch classic.\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561197963895278", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1480878105, "num_games_owned": 520, "playtime_forever": 76}}, {"timestamp_created": 1480663880, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247", "timestamp_updated": 1480663880, "recommendationid": "28134072", "votes_up": 1, "review": "10/10 would sail off edge of map into the dark void of space again, shedding a single tear while dying alone and friendless.\n\n-- awesome retro pixel art/glorious explosions\n-- a tribute to asteroids. but much much prettier\n-- cracking chippy soundtrack\n-- tight controls once you get used to them\n-- purely skill-based, no buying your way to inglorious victory!\n-- doesn't baby you with unnecessary tutorials, you can drop right into a game without preamble\n-- blast your friends into oblivion\n-- die alone and friendless again\n-- find new friends\n-- repeat\n\nwhat's that? already bleachmurdered all your friends in dayZ? fear not, for there is a singleplayer mode and it is fearsomely addictive, particularly if like me you have run out of people to torment during your lunch hour at work. \n\nwishlist: online multiplayer so I can run out of friends in other countries.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561198057557525", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1480647126, "num_games_owned": 221, "playtime_forever": 171}}, {"timestamp_created": 1480642921, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1480645396, "recommendationid": "28130645", "votes_up": 0, "review": "If I could leave stars, I'd give this one 10 out of 10.
