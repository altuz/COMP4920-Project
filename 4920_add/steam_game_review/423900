It might seem a little repetative but the bosses are unique and so are the weapons and pets. It's one of those level one then go one to level two type games. You can also choose paths at times. And the secrets are cool too. The levels are sort of challenging because you have a hunger bar which is also you health. (You don't need food for the boss fights.) Sometimes your saying what the heck is that! And sometimes your like OH CRAP NOOOOOOO!!! This is all my opinion. You don't have to follow this if you don't want to. But I think it is worth $10.00. :)", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198197856366", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1501032641, "num_games_owned": 118, "playtime_forever": 538}}], "success": 1}
