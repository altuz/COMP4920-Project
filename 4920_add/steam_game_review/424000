To be honest as I was playing the game I had a feeling that this would fare better than most of the Unity-based FPS games here. I am referring to those that are nothing more than an asset flip. Plus, you have those that were made with the use of the GameGuru.\n\nIn any case, this game is about a project that went awry and you are tasked to find a hidden artifact in the location in question. It is a space station / ship with some robots and monsters. First of all, the main menu looks terribly simple and ugly. It is also very dark. You cannot rebind your keys and graphics options are limited. Even if you change the settings you barely notice anything.\n\nYou start off the game on the level called \"elevator\". It is, in fact, an elevator shaft without an elevator as you just keep falling for minutes without hitting ground. When you do so you realise you must be invincible since you did not get hurt, at all. But monsters can easily kill you later with one shot so you realise you are in danger, after all. You have one weapon only and finding ammo is possible at the beginning but later on I did not find any extra ammunition. In fact, if you get killed and restart from a checkpoint you have the same amount of rounds available i.e. if you die many times you simply reach zero.\n\nThe game is dark. VERY DARK! Your flashlight helps but not always. Your weapon has a laser sight but as soon as the enemies are at a distance you realise you cannot hit them. Often when you hit objects such as chairs, computer consoles or machinery parts with your gun these mentioned assets just fly away, sometimes literally out of the screen. The problem is that the textures are usually quite ugly and the game frequently changes your vision - while this is part of the story it is annoying to see things blurry around yourself for several minutes.\n\nThe story is barely explained. Sometimes texts are found but beside the English the creator thought the inclusion of the Russian language was a must (ever heard of a subtitles option?). Because of this the text takes up a major part of the screen and the English almost always has a couple of words outside of our view. Then there are sections (such as the asteroid level) where walking is almost impossible due to the FPS drop. This is area-specific so regardless of how many times you relaunch the game the resulting values will be the same. This is the reason why I quit as for 20 minutes I was walking just under 10 FPS.\n\nSound effects are generic and while there's an acceptable soundtrack you always hear when the track ends and restarts as not much work went into the editing, either. The most annoying part of the game is when you die. For instance, a turret hits you with its laser. You are down on the ground and your vision changes, let's say by 90 degrees. Funny thing is when dead you can still move (more like slide) and if you hit the laser once again it adds another 90 degrees so when the checkpoint system kicks in you see everything upside-down. Only for 5-10 seconds, though, as the game makes a correction.\n\nThere are sections where scripted events begin such as a platform starts moving. If you die along the way you are put back near the last save location but the game forgets to reset mentioned event. So, you cannot continue (the platform is already high up somewhere and you cannot recall it), therefore, your best bet is to quit and hit \"continue\". I could go on and list many other mistakes, glitches and bugs (not to mention the many typos in the English text) but there's no need, to be honest.\n\nProject Pulsation is a bad game. An interesting idea, but executed horribly. Unreal engine 4 or not, the game has ugly textures and effects and it is too dark for you to see and there's nothing, I repeat nothing, that make you want to continue once you're an hour or so in the \"story\". It's too bad that the developer (VGstudio) has other software with similar negative outcome. If you are desperate to do some trading card grinding then for half a euro this game can be of some value.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561197986360343", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 335, "last_played": 1494869135, "num_games_owned": 630, "playtime_forever": 247}}], "success": 1}
