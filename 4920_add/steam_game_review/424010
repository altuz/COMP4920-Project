I think I\u2019ve done around 10 playthroughs. It would probably have been more, but I cheated and looked up some answers on the forum.\n+ Choices matter. Say one wrong to word to anyone and you might have missed the opportunity to unravel what really happened.\n+ Non-linear. You can do whatever you feel like doing within the 1 hour you\u2019re alive.\n+ Minimap to never get lost.\n\n+/- Because it\u2019s non-linear, the plot can be a bit confusing depending on what route you\u2019re on. The twist at the \u201ccanon ending\u201d can also come out of nowhere because of this.\n+/- You have to play it with your mouse. If you don't use your mouse, you'll miss a lot of objects and some doors will not open anyway. (I'm used to only using my keyboard when playing rpg maker games.)\n\n- Character sprites style are mismatched. There\u2019s three (or even four to the well-trained eye) different style of characters running around. It\u2019s something that has annoyed me ever since I saw screenshots of the game. It was often quite jarring in my opinion, but that might be because I make sprites myself. Still would have been nice if the developer had picked only one style...\n- No save function. This game autosaves, which is really nice. Unfortunately it\u2019s the only way to save. Imagine you just died and you want to retry the scene to see what another choice would do, well you\u2019re in tough luck. 9 out of 10 times the save starts right from the moment you died cutting to credits immediately. Then there\u2019s also the issue that you have to replay from the start if you picked the \u201cwrong\u201d choice somewhere along the line. I personally would have liked to be able to have one save as well as the autosave function.\n\nI recommend this game to other adventure lovers who enjoy trying to find all the multiple endings.
