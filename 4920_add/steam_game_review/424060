I say semi-roguelike because the game shuffles tiles around, but the tiles themselves are the same, just moved around sometimes. The randomness can be unforgiving, especially due to the fact that one of the primary gameplay elements is stealthing around wandering enemies. Many times I would enter a room and be immediately spotted, often starting combat due to not wanting to lose my precious food. The enemies are also fairly repetative, with overworld sprites often indicating the type of encounter you will have, ie: if there's only one person and its one of the other possible playable characters, you can recruit them.\n\nAll in all, a pretty neat, short, punishing game. And I do love that this is not early access or anything like that.\n\nWhy do I not reccomend this? The game is extremely mechanics heavy, with no real narative or mystery to really move it along, but the mechanics are fairly boring, with not a lot of strategy in combat or while sneak-looting. The randomness doesn't really add a sense of freshness on every replay, but instead a rather large ammount of arbitraty success. I would die on a first combat encounter because the only loot I found was food and no better equipment. The next go-around I could find a revolver and ammo in the first container I looked in. There is no real curve of progression, since character traits are decided at the beggining of the game.\n\nI also encountered several game breaking movement bugs that made me restart because I had gotten randomly frozen in place and could no longer move my character, resulting in being seen and dying or needing a straight restart.\n\nThis is barely a not reccomend, and mostly because of the bugs. I totally get that there will be bugs, but the ones that break the game just ruin the experience for me.\n\nEdit//\nI love the support from the developer wanting to fix the bugs. Its great to see people fixing stuff after it realeases. I'm gonna play some more and see if the game draws me a bit more", "comment_count": "12", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 3, "votes_down": 5, "author": {"steamid": "76561198038467884", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1472685370, "num_games_owned": 260, "playtime_forever": 436}}, {"timestamp_created": 1450074915, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514247", "timestamp_updated": 1450074915, "recommendationid": "19689832", "votes_up": 17, "review": "I really like this game. It is, however, broken in a lot of ways. The dialogue and text sound, at times, as if they were written by someone who's first language wasn't english, ie. \"Oh thank god! I thought I was goner!\". \nThe textures sometimes fault, and if you try to skip the pre-conflict dialogue by clicking, sometimes it will freeze the game and render everything unclickable. Your character stands against no enemy models, just hovering hitpoints. \nThe game also occasionally just freezes. Sometimes you can still walk around but doors are unusable or things are unclickable. (NOTE: I believe the game is still being patched for bugs).\n\nAnother mechanic I don't understand is sometimes if you are caught trying to steal from humans, you enter battle with them...but they're zombies now. As opposed to being normal, talking people just before. \nThe game requires you to collect \"Essences\" to purchase extra trait points in game...however one of them seems entirely unaccessible. This could just be me being bad at the game, but I can't find a single way to get to it. \n\nThe game throws you into the muck with only a knife, and due to the random spawning you're sometimes immediately thrown up against a gang of up to 4 people, often with guns and armor. It is a cumbersome experience to set up your character, click through the opening dialogue, and have to loot your apartment, only to die instantly and have to do it all again. \n\nThere is also no map so it is extremely easy to get lost. Not sure if this is a flaw or just a function put in to emphasize the chaos and confusion. \n\nThat all being said, this is a charming and very engaging game. The pixel art is beautifully done, vibrant, bright, and spooky. The game mechanics are very well sketched out, despite the few minor flaws. The combat is quick to learn and either very rewarding, or very stressful (which is good, it's meant to be!). I sat down and played half of the game, then decided I enjoyed it so much I wanted it to last...however I went back to it not two hours later and completed it. It is UNBELIEVABLY satisfying to beat objectives. I still intend to play more of this game, because it's so exciting to discover all the little nooks and crannies and rooms and items. I fully recommend and really like this game.

Until I realized it literally can't be completed.\n\nThere are several bugs in this game, ranging from annoying to entirely game breaking. \n\nOne bug, or perhaps simply poorly coded event, I encountered was the way in which the NPCs react to you. Being that the game relies on stealth elements, it makes sense that an NPC having a direct line of sight on you is grounds for some sort of event or encounter. However, there doesn't seem to be much thought put into how an NPC spots you. It seems if they happen to look anywhere near your general direction they will spot you, regardless of how far away you are or even if you are on the same row/column as they are. \n\nAnother thing I encountered that upset me was rooms that are obviously capable of being entered (I can tell because when I move my cursor over the spot it turns into the boot icon that lets me know the door can be opened) yet the player cannot go inside. One such area is the room where the survivor Eric spawns during playthroughs that aren't his. Eric is pacing around on the far left, while there is a door on the far right that leads into a room where you can see an item. Despite the game telling me I can enter the room, there is no way for me to get into it and get to the items inside.\n\nThe dialogue of the game, while not painfully unreadable, could have easily been fixed to seem more natural.\n\nMy biggest complaint however, and one that based on the reviews was addressed some time ago and has still not been fixed, is the complete lack of ability to save the game and resume it at a later date. I'm not referring to the inability to save while on a mission so you won't have to restart when you fail, (although in all honesty that would be a lovely feature) I am referring to when you successfully complete a mission and the game gives you the chance to return to the menu or continue playing. If you continue playing, you simply go on until you inevitibly run out of supplies (they do not regenerate) or you are killed by a stupidly overpowered eyeball because you, ya know, RAN OUT OF SUPPLIES. So continuing on the map is pointless.\n\nChoosing to return to the menu of the game however, reveals that your progress was not saved and despite the fact you successfully completed the mission, it did not register and not only do you not have the unlocked character you were promised, but you do not have the collected Essence you may or may not have picked up while running from eyeballs and zombies. Because there is no way for the game to track your Essence or the fact you completed the missions, there is no way for you to then play the later missions which require the ones before them to be completed. It seems the only record of your completed missions are on your Steam profile, evidence of your triumph despite the games lack of any SAVE system.\n\nNow that I have so thoroughly destroyed this game, I do have a few positive things to say in hopes that perhaps the developers will listen and cultivate them (Unlikely) or another party will somehow find this and make their own creation based on this system.\n\nThe scavenging system was very nice compared with the mechanics of Hunger and Sanity. While they both seemed to decrease at an uncomfortably fast rate, with some grit and careful rationing I was able to keep a majority of my party with full bellies and barely sane enough to be kept out of the looney bin.\n\nThe fact that Sanity had visible effects on the map was a nice touch as well, as it helped to provide me with more cues as to when I needed to take my medicine and to add some depth to the otherwise monotone landscapes.\n\nI seemed to notice that Hunger also affected Sanity, and characters who were actively starving seemed to lose theirs faster than someone who wasn't worried that they would starve in the next few hours.\n\nThe Stamina that had affects in and outside of battle was another nice touch, as running on the overworld map decreased the Stamina that was available for me to use in battles. Therefore, I needed to be careful I wasn't running all willy-nilly through the city.\n\nI haven't stumbled across many games in the style of The Glow on the engine used, (either RPG Maker VX Ace or XP based on controls, menus, and tilesets) and I also wish to tip my hat to the developers for that as well.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198096210634", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1470890724, "num_games_owned": 113, "playtime_forever": 155}}, {"timestamp_created": 1458704970, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500639", "timestamp_updated": 1458705241, "recommendationid": "21995137", "votes_up": 2, "review": "The game looks fun enough.
