These developers took the risk of heresy to make a heliocentric simulator. It actually has the sun in the center of the solar system! Now that we have Celestrion, Copernicus' work will not be in vain.\nOn a more serious note, the game itself is pretty bare-bones in presentation but nevertheless reasonably priced.\n\nAdvantages:\n-Pretty cool looking graphics overall; the background is rough though.\n-It's accessible, cheap, and exactly what it says on the tin.\n-Basic but fitting music and sound. It actually has a good ambiance to it.\n\nDisadvantages:\n-May face religious prosecution from inquisitors.\n-Would not recommend sunscreen while on Venus.\n-It's a neat widget but doesn't have the most replayability. I feel like it could be a lot more interactive than it currently is.\n\nSuggestion:\n-Make the rotations of the planets affected by time, not just their revolutions.\n\nConclusion: It's cheap, basic, but nevertheless enjoyable simulator. It could do with a little polishing though. \n\nWould orbit again.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 8, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198043953515", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1453503799, "num_games_owned": 143, "playtime_forever": 31}}, {"timestamp_created": 1449659419, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507925", "timestamp_updated": 1449659419, "recommendationid": "19580554", "votes_up": 5, "review": "It is exactly what it says, its a display of a virtual orrery.
