Even though I often tend to stay away from RPGMaker games, I bought this one precisely because it chooses another approach than so many other of its kind. Instead of boring me to death with the gazillionth implementation of your typical run of the mill JRPG it chooses to utilize a combat system that brings the player back to the times where \"Secret of Mana\", \"Terranigma\" and \"Illusion of Time\" created some of your fondest gaming memories.\nSure, it does have its quirks (the on occasions rather strange grammar for example), and the bossfights (as far as I played so far) are rather simple (choose the right weapon/magic and smash/shoot/blast it to smithereens), but all in all I feel pleasantly reminded of the games I mentioned above.\n\nIn a nutshell: I can recommend this game to everyone who liked classics like \"Secret of Mana\", \"Terranigma\" and \"Illusion of Time\" and who needs a well earned break from all the typical JRPG like games out there in favor of a refreshing (albeit in no way new) combat system, where you beat your enemies yourself instead of waiting for your character to do it for you.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561197987094240", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1451997189, "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_forever": 1239}}, {"timestamp_created": 1461091679, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505419", "timestamp_updated": 1461165609, "recommendationid": "22520831", "votes_up": 4, "review": "Just an amazing game.\nMy short evaluation after finishing:\n\n(+)\n- exciting plot\n- much to explore\n- good riddles\n- witty comments\n- enough weapons and skills\n- if you're stuck or have problems with game or bugs, GeexGames / community helps you very fast (very good support on steam)\n- low price for amazing game ;P\n\n(-)\n- most boss-fights and fights generall are maybe to easy (you definitely can be overskilled: some rare fights are somewhat difficult, but than long roads you're just to mighty, \"sparing\" lots of exp helps!)\n- there are elements and alignment on the items etc, but i cant find out the meaning of it\n- some bugs, you shouldnt play just with one savegame (!)\n- no replayability, you can learn/ find & use all skills (spells) and weapons in one game\n\n \nI buy it for 50%birthday sale, but I also recommend it for the normal price.

Visually, it's pretty impressive for an RPG Maker game - at least I think it's RPG Maker since those resources (artwork and audio) come from RPG Maker XP. But the game just feels so very tedious, even for an open world kind of game, and there's no real rhyme or reason to anything you need to do or accomplish.\n\nThe combat felt okay at best, although the hit detection seemed off at times. It was also easy to fall into a pond or lake and then get stuck. In most cases, you fall into a pond or lake you'd lose some health and respawn on the land where you dropped in. But quite often the game would not remember where to respawn you at, and instead just keep respawning you right back in the pond or lake you fell into, and you're helpless to do anything but either reset the game or watch as your health slowly depletes away.\n\nConstantly having to navigate back and forth across a large landmass without any means of fast travel was another time waster for me. NPC's dropped meaningless clues or would send you on a large fetch quest that often times had you going back and forth across various regions far too often to be any sort of fun.\n\nThe biggest challenge in the game is trying to locate all the correct cracks in the floor and walls that will actually do anything of value. You spend so much time straining your eyes for any sort of cracks in the earth you can hit with a pitchfork. And then you get an explosion spell that can open up entrances in the walls. Except half the time one crack in the wall that will reveal an entry way looks no different than the cracks in the walls that do not lead anywhere, and you spend so much time wasting spell power trying to blow everything up, only to then have to leave the dungeon or cave or whatever to recharge your MP.\n\nSome might find it fun to spend aimless hours on a game like this, and that's fine. Maybe this is what all the hype surrounding open world games is all about. If it is, it's not for me.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more streamlined, and perhaps a bit more story and character driven, you might want to find a different game to play.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198071404648", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1479088845, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_forever": 1076}}, {"timestamp_created": 1459470934, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1459500967, "recommendationid": "22170030", "votes_up": 1, "review": "Real time combat (like top down Zelda)! Great controller support. I'll have to get used to the 2 decades old system of holding down a key to invoke strafing but since this isn't a 100% shooter/ranged combat, it shouldn't be too hard. I didn't come here for story, so no comment there (and I've hardly played). But if you're looking for a real time action combat system, this is one of those games. It still has tile based movement (I wish the movement was smoother, though. It kinda locks to either horizontal or vertical).

What do I mean by extra stuff? Well back in the good ole days(yes I'm old) you had some games like this, but if you really really remember they were pretty basic. This game has a boat load of spells(skills) to use, weapons, armor, items. It also has little side things you can do..mostly fetch quests but its nice to have little side things... Overall its not a long game or difficult skill wise because you get experience from killing mobs and also for doing quests and sometimes finding experience in a box. You can then use those experience to up your skills to your liking. I hardly used the spells myself and was all melee putting most into str so I was a wee bit too powerful and the game was on the easy side. Now there are some parts that are not easy but those are where you have to figure out what to do(what skill, item, weapon to use) or where to go but maybe that was just me.
