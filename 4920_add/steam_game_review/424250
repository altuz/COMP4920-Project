You can turn the survival aspect down a great deal if it's not your thing. Many different types of crafting and playstyles. RPG aspect reminded me of Baldurs Gate or Fallout. \n\nThough there seems to be a main quest, the game is not at all linear and you can progress and prioritize as you choose.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197995782440", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 117, "num_reviews": 53, "last_played": 1506123477, "num_games_owned": 531, "playtime_forever": 624}}], "success": 1}
