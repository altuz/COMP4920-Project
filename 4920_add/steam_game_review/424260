You're at an amusement park and each \"attraction\" is a mini-game of sorts. The developer has done a decent job of keeping the game updated, so I can only imagine how big this game could end up getting. I do feel like it would've benefited as being an Early Access title rather than getting a full release with only a few of these mini games to play, but at least it's still relatively cheap. \n\nSo far what I've seen is a lot of cheap jump scares. It's nice to see that in a game that's also pretty and has great atmosphere, no one seems to be doing those cheap jump scares anymore unless it's a 2D platformer or something. And the fact that the developer can create multiple different atmospheres you can jump between is pretty damn cool. But don't expect this game to be a psychological horror game, because it's not, it's more of a thriller. There are a few puzzles too, which weren't necessarily easy, but they weren't necessarily intensly difficult either.\n\nAlso I should point out again that this game is GORGEOUS. The dev built this on Unreal 4 and it really makes this game pop. The engine really helped with making the atmospheres feel believable if at times disjointed, at least in Black Hole. The audio was great, although I had trouble with music stopping sometimes if I left the area and then there would be no sound. Some of the effects for the scary portions are so strange that they're scary because you don't know what the hell they are...and for me that's good, but it may not work for you. \n\nWould I recommend you buy this now? Probably not. Would I recommend you buy this when more attractions are available? Probably. And maybe even then buy it on sale. It currently costs $8 and it's a little steep for maybe 3-4 hours of playtime, but of course there will be more later. Give it a try though, you might be surprised. \n\nThis is my first look at the game, I was playing the \"Black Hole\" attraction:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t38w04CB16Q", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 5, "author": {"steamid": "76561197991525141", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1457070084, "num_games_owned": 247, "playtime_forever": 116}}, {"timestamp_created": 1477187319, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498339", "timestamp_updated": 1477187319, "recommendationid": "26174165", "votes_up": 0, "review": "Nice Game\uff0cthe first horror game i bought\uff0cplz update game quckly\uff0cI\u2018ve been waiting for a long time", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561198273643849", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1504672240, "num_games_owned": 153, "playtime_forever": 328}}, {"timestamp_created": 1457562066, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494180", "timestamp_updated": 1457562066, "recommendationid": "21737028", "votes_up": 5, "review": "I made a more in-depth review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdTKcMB0ycw\n\nIs it worth the money? I don't think so. I would maybe pay $2-3 for it in it's current state, but definitely not $7. \n\nGraphics: 5/10 - It looks ok, but there is a lot of screen tearing when turning and some of it just looks out of place as well. \n\nSound: 5/10 - Some of it sounds very good, but again, some of it is just very out of place. \n\nGameplay: 3/10 - Not very good. It's basically a game with multiple mini-games; a FNAF spinoff, a few puzzles, and a tour of a hospital. But what really hurts this score is the broken english in all of the directions, which just makes it hard to understand the objectives of each mode. \n\nAtmosphere: 5/10 - There are some moments when I would actually feel scared, but after a little while I was completely aware of when something was going to happen. \n\nScares: 2/10 - Just not scary after the first few jumpscares, and that is all the game has to offer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 8, "author": {"steamid": "76561198058028963", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1457488365, "num_games_owned": 234, "playtime_forever": 79}}, {"timestamp_created": 1459464182, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494126", "timestamp_updated": 1459465973, "recommendationid": "22168814", "votes_up": 5, "review": "Is it all jumpscares? Yes.\nDo they work on me? Yes.\nDid I enjoy the game? Yes.\n\nThe game has a cool concept, as you go through each attraction as if it were a \"Haunted House\" type of attraction. They are all disconnected from eachother, and there is no story line. Each one has fresh scares and I found the game to be fun. Think of going to a theme park full of haunted houses.\n\nWhy the negative review then!?\n\nI liked Dark Room and Black Hole, but Terror in the Hospitol is GOD AWFUL. The puzzle is so broken. You need to do 5 steps, then repeat the process 3 times. The problem is that with the coins system, you will die. And die. And die. And die. Having to restart from the beginning each time. Doing the process once is hard enough, BUT THREE!? On top of it, I've fallen through the map twice in this attraction. I think you will need to beat all three attractions to move on to the new ones, and if that's the case, I'll never play the new ones, because I've completely given up on the Hospital one.\n\nI really liked the game up until this.
