Its pretty solid. Beyond the peculiar appearance of enemies in battle, the characters outside all look fairly well done, the general graphics are excellent for something which is custom made, rather than made using pre-made material, you wouldn't expect that quality of something like that.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty nice, very novel in style, you have a large amount of customizability for your characters and a small selection of characters at the beginning to chose from, frankly that selection is largely cosmetic at the point I am in the story, but still its pretty nice, hopefully more choices may be made available later, but for now in Early Access its still reasonably nice. Its a very good RPG game any way you want to look at it, not as simple as the graphics would let one believe, easily on par with some of the Final Fantasy games, except it was built on a infinitely smaller budget, which is pretty remarkable.\n\nNow story wise its also a very nice game, their is a great humor all over this game, it reminds me of Earthbound in style, the texts are a charm to read and very much worthwhile taking your time to read it all. Also it seemed to be very well written, excellent work really anyway you look at it.\n\nNext you have a nice little music playing with this game, it fits it quite well, now unlike Earthbound its not some goofy music, but more along the line of a proper match for the environment, its quite good soundtrack, more along the lines of games like Final Fantasy.\n\nNow my only issues with the game are the difficulty, its pretty rough, and considering how much it cost to revive and heal, in the early parts of the game its particularly difficult, also considering the lack of stores in that part... (EDIT: Alright, by first part I really it seem meant the very earliest in the game, you can fairly quick enough advance to a town where you'll be able to get stuff from stores and pilfer your way thru the town like most old RPG games, and the Inn is cheaper there.) well its not easy for sure, players looking for a challenge will have one. Each battle will hurt you and the money gained won't most likely be enough to do anything else than just keep yourself healed and revived, it could use a bit of a lowering in the very early parts, or make the battles a tad easier, either way, maybe a bit of balancing is required, I wouldn't mind a difficulty option for those of us that got less backbone than others.\n\nOtherwise the only other problem is the typical Early Access issues, some bugs, I suffered a crash while navigating some character menu at one point, it didn't happen again, but I tried being careful, overall considering how good the rest of the game is, I expect by the time the game comes out of Early Access that issue will be resolved.\n\nSo yea, I typically try to avoid Early Access games, I was tempted by the charm this game seemed to have, and the lack of attention shocked me and pushed me to get it, so that I could give it some attention and see for good or ill what comes of it. I am very happy with my new acquisition. So I do here recommend quite highly this game.\n\nEdit:\n\nA new patch came out and it brought so much new stuff to the game, its wonderful! I encourage everybody to buy this great game, its worth it, also I beg those that do play it to review it, the more reviews the more it will attract public attention, please players do review the game! I love this game and I can't wait to see it grow even more and I really wish people would realize how good this is and bought it too, the creators deserve the support.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561198017382987", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "last_played": 1461726622, "num_games_owned": 365, "playtime_forever": 249}}], "success": 1}
