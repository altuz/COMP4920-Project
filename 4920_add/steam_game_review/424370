TLDR will be added to the bottom for you lazies.\nI also have 370 hours on Path of Exile and well over 2,000 hours on Diablo 3, making me no stranger to what the meta will be and how to properly make builds. In addition to going over the entire game from a gameplay standpoint to give whom those read it an insight in the game's current state, this review is also an indication if the game is worth the $20 bucks or not yet. In the 0.5 build, it is not worth the purchase but it has gone a long way since I have added it to my wishlist nearly a year ago.\n\nIf you're interested in investing money into an early access game that suits your interest and you've been following for quite some time and have seen progress unlike other early access games, then it's up to you to purchase the game and give the developers the feedback they need to improve the game.\n\nIf a developer is reading this, this is to help you guys improve and what to work on. The game is heading in a good direction. There is also a bugs list in here as well. \n\nBefore reading the exhausting pros and cons list, I've only made 3 characters (all at lvl 20) thus far: a pure caster, a sword and board battle-mage using Titan's strength, a lightning arrow archer w/ elementalist nodes (2nd ring).\n\nPros\n-Casters feel rewarding to play when you synergize passives, making it something to really hope for\n-The passive tree yields a lot of variety and opportunity for interesting builds when the outer 2 rings are released.\n-The character creation is a nice touch, allowing you to shape your character (i.e. a large, pudgy, muscular man)\n-You aren't limited to a specific start, gear, or skills, allowing variety\n-Resource system allows for interesting inventions of builds (if you want to see how it works I suggest watching a video to understand it some more)\n-Visuals are great in the areas away from the Crypt, the area right before the necromancer's domain.\n-Housing system exists and allows you to have some creative outlet in-game. Currently no use outside of fun!\n-The battlemage playstyle plays smoothly currently\n-Potion system is an interesting twist. Potion charges recharge over time, each potion has an internal cooldown before you can use it again, and each potion has permanent effects as long as they're equipped.\n-Signature skills add an interesting passive/active twist to your playstyle\n-The game has an in-game day/night cycle and the vendors update their inventory every 24 hours at 6 am in-game time, you can sleep in-game to try and find what you're looking for.\n-Skill tomes aren't useless after you find them the first time! Using one with a skill you've already learned gives you half a level of your current skill's level.\n\nCons\n-Not a whole lot of abilities to play with. There were only 2 per category (bow skill, melee skill, fire spell, lightning spell, \"rogue\" skill) except melee which gets 3 skills and frost which only gets 1 in the current build.\n-Dexterity (dex) has movespeed, making it the go to for any and all builds that want to clear fast, making it a problem for other builds that aren't dex based to compete. Not to mention heavy armor giving -movespeed% also turns you away from playing a non-dex build even more. This shouldn't be taken lightly, developers, fix this!\n-Strength gives crit damage, making it counter-intuitive to strength builds as they'll have crits that do 400% of the damage but only have a 3% chance to crit since you reduce dex with heavy armor by so much.\n-Armor stat feels like a wasted stat since you can pick up signature skills that effectively increase your clear speed by a massive amount (ie: warrior, +25% attack speed and spellcast speed but -25% armor; thief, +15% move speed but -15% armor)\n-The warrior and thief signature skills are both strong but can be balanced to not be a staple in every build, especially the thief signature (+15% movespeed, -15% armor).\n-Casters have to chug umbra pots in order to sustain their umbra, you can't cast melee skills with a staff to dump rage making them \n-Fighters are very strong but are clunky without the faster rage to umbra conversion rate that you get from the current lvl 20 gear you can buy\n-Constitution feels worthless, only giving you 10 health per point and giving you a little bit of stun resistance which also feels equally as worthless\n-Dual wielding (DW) does not seem to scale with attack speed, or it scales in such a way that it's not noticable. The first 2 attacks for DW feel only somewhat clunky but the 3rd and final attack is an animation lock for 2 seconds that, yes provides a lot of rage, but is far too much for any build to need.\n-Generating rage for a bow feels clunky\n-Since there is only one frost skill and it's not a dps skill, there's only 2 elements in the game for casters: fire and lightning. Fire dishes out damage and holds its own pretty well. However, lightning's proc for Area of Effect (AoE) damage absolutely destroys fire's, which simply leaves a damage over time (DoT) on the ground.\n-Only heavy armor at the lvl 20 vendor outside of one single chestpiece that is for a caster. Absolutely no dex armor, staves, or accessories.\n-Rune system is incomplete for most abilities.\n-Runes that reduce the umbra/rage cost of an ability are useless and make the other rune the immediate pick. Runes that increase AoE or dps are immediate picks for builds (outside of some memes). I currently want to see more runes like Bladeslinger where all the runes are there (not necessarily 2 per tier) and each rune has a purpose somewhere.\n-Brutal Strike stomps the competition for melee skills with the tier 3 rune that: if an enemy dies from your brutal strike, cast it again at their location. Since this rune is on its own tier, making a build around this is simply any clear speed increase (AoE, damage).\n-Left clicking is the purchase button -_-\n\nBugs\n-Crazy FPS drops at the crypt and inside the crypt, everwhere else is fine. (This isn't a PC issue, this is definitely a game issue)\n-Critical Chance doesn't work properly! Each supposed 1% only gives 0.1% crit instead, Critical Damage works.\n-Frequent game crashes\n-Some of the lvl 20 gear doesn't scale properly and gives lvl 1 stats instead of lvl 20 stats\n-Staves sell substantially less than other weapons (white sword sells for 150g, white staff sells for 20-30g)\n-Really chubby and muscular men clip through shields and armor scales on them weirdly\n-Gold pickups dont appear to work or picking up the \"gold\" that shows up are phonies\n-Some mobs in the infinite dungeon spawn outside of the zone\n-Going through subsequent levels in the infinite dungeon and getting the same tileset has items that I skipped outside of the zone, above walkable locations but can't pick them up, \n\nTL;DR: The game is still in the very early stages of development and people like me analyze it for those who are skeptics. The game has very good eye candy but is nowhere near being complete.", "comment_count": "6", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561198066063886", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1505794362, "num_games_owned": 129, "playtime_forever": 1227}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505652769, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516479", "timestamp_updated": 1505652769, "recommendationid": "35022826", "votes_up": 9, "review": "Pros:\nDiablo HD - Powered by CryEngine.\nNo preset class.\nStats are manually allocated by player.\nSkills are learnt and powered up via Skill Books (no skill tree).\nPassives tree grants additional effects and bonus stats.\nAlso includes 1-2 room mini boss 'dungeons' from D3\n\nCons:\nNeeds a bit of optimization.\nNO bows :( Only Crossbows in the game.\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198014503096", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 420, "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1506173159, "num_games_owned": 293, "playtime_forever": 843}}, {"timestamp_created": 1506541523, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508031", "timestamp_updated": 1506577258, "recommendationid": "35248265", "votes_up": 6, "review": "TLDR - skip to (3.) \n\nI have only been blown away by two games in my life. \n\n1. Path of Exile - at a time when Diablo clones were everywhere and taking our money, out came this beautiful game made with absolute passion, and blew them out of the water. For free!\n\n2. Rift (before it was f2p) - MMOs were stagnant and always had the same problems - to queue you had to be at the right location; skill trees were uninspired and more like skill roots; everything was about rush to the endgame so \"you can start playing\", pve/p was a boring click fest, few bosses were voiced, fewer required any strategy other than dps spam. This game fixed all of it and more\n\nI can now add a third game to my list - Wolcen.\n\n3. Wolcen is a very engaging game and is doing something PoE is trying to do - address the endgame stagnation with more movement and strategy. I consider it a race between the two and Wolcen is clearly ahead, my character is always under threat no matter how much damage she can output, dodging and moving around is a requirement and I love it. The game is very enjoyable for the APRG fan, but there is a lot more to come - including multiplayer.\n\nThe core gameplay is already there, after an hour you can see where this game will go. Wolcen is reminiscent of passionate and outside-the-box games like PoE and Rift, it will be a success, so get in on the action at the very beginning!\n\nIf you're not passionate about the genre, it may bug you that it's still in alpha (plenty of content to enjoy nonetheless) so add it to your wishlist instead.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561197981624277", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 857, "num_reviews": 82, "last_played": 1506624680, "num_games_owned": 257, "playtime_forever": 857}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505680292, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1505680292, "recommendationid": "35032567", "votes_up": 2, "review": "I am a long time fan of Diablo/Bauldurs Gate western RPGs.

This is definitely a AAA level game, with enough originality and story to stand on it's own without feeling like a clone of something. I recommended it to my nephew, and he played it through several times, exploring the dynamics between the different magics.\n\nThe balance between physical sword and shield attacks, and magic is very well done, neither feels lacking, and the interaction between the two is a nice engaging additional dynamic I've not seen elsewhere.\n\nI very much look forward to playing Wolcen again when it is officially released.

That being said the movement speed is a little slow for my taste and the character creation tools need a look at (the women look pretty strange, and there aren't multiple faces to choose from).

The gameplay mechanics are interesting and fun.   It has one of the best gameplay systems for combat I have ever seen.   The potential for different builds is amazing.

It is still very early in the games life so these kind of issues are to be expected.  After all you are not going to fine tune balance when your still adding gameplay mechanics and skills.

It is very fun to see the constant progress the team is making every week.

So go try it and support the game in development.\n\nI choose to recommend this game because of what it can become........", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971816029", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1504804720, "num_games_owned": 124, "playtime_forever": 119}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505084840, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499348", "timestamp_updated": 1505084840, "recommendationid": "34872957", "votes_up": 2, "review": "Awesome hack n slash/spellcasting RPG, slick combat with great graphics, story and music/sound.\nUI is easy to use.", "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561197983301475", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 169, "last_played": 1505265170, "num_games_owned": 444, "playtime_forever": 219}}, {"timestamp_created": 1504650293, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500799", "timestamp_updated": 1504650293, "recommendationid": "34765617", "votes_up": 3, "review": "Woo! babyy, The gameplay is amazingggg.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561198117128978", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505299223, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 1547}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505593992, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501749", "timestamp_updated": 1505593992, "recommendationid": "35006601", "votes_up": 3, "review": "Has potential, but in its current form its akin to a skeleton.  Alot of systems are in-place and look appealing but they lack depth and purpose.  Campaign content is next to non-existant currently.  The 'any class or classless' claim is mostly the case , although the spec node system is not fully modular, it has specs layed on wheels that can be rotated in order to change connections it advertised this as 'limitless archetype combinations' but it is not exactly because the arrangement on the wheels are set (cannot be changed) so the amount of combinations possible is not fully arbitrary when you try to go beyond one inner-outer 'archetype' arrangement.  The more wheels they add, the more this limitation becomes apparent.  So in the end Im not sure the point of the current wheeled 'archetype' spec system as its format appears to limit combinations more than enable them.\n\nAs for the skills in the game, they are done with books that you get as drops or buy at the vendor, you consume them to learn the skill, the skill has its own leveling up process when happens as you use it and by reading more of the same skill book.  Most skills appear to have their own simple spec tree as well, although that content is yet to be fleshed out to a significant degree.\n\nAnyways looking foward to seeing this game grow some meat on its bones!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 6, "author": {"steamid": "76561197993895864", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1505589492, "num_games_owned": 136, "playtime_forever": 447}}], "success": 1}
