While I did want to channel the core ideas of freeform gameplay of my favorite classics like Deus Ex, my main focus was on drawing the player into the unusual setting and complex characters. So I wanted to keep the gameplay a bit more newcomer-friendly and let the story and world carry them through.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, would you mind elaborating why you found the story and characters boring? That's usually been the most praised aspect of the game (and one we iterated most on). Would be useful to know for my future work!\n\nEither way, THANK YOU for playing and supporting with the purchase even despite not liking it in the end.

I love mystery adventure games and really believed that maybe we have something new going on here.  What I experienced was nothing short of mediocrity wrapped in a blanket of promise. First let me say that the premise of the game appeared to be Agatha Christy like and that appealed to me. I thought I would give it a go.  At first it seemed like it was going to be a fantastic mystery but then things became monotonous and unchallenging. There is a plot here but it does not really matter at all. Lots of boring dialogue with very uninteresting characters that made the game feel more of a chore than a challenge. No puzzles or enigmas to deal with. Then we have the the stealth part that is nothing more than listening to footsteps. Really nothing here that I would call over the top.  There is no challenge, there is nothing at all actually. Very mediocre attempt at making a good experience.", "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561198013274120", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "last_played": 1457115011, "num_games_owned": 361, "playtime_forever": 1387}, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1457592523}, {"timestamp_created": 1485307368, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495690", "timestamp_updated": 1485307368, "recommendationid": "29473770", "votes_up": 0, "review": "Fun game.

I really loved the setting, and the suspect characters were very well done, each with their own potential motives.  Chances are you may not be able to decide on the culprit your first time through, and this makes you want to go back and look for more and more clues.  I was surprised by the amount of detail put into this game, and I'd love to play another just like this.  It might not be for everyone, but it's right up my alley.
