Seriously, you can get very similar games on your smartphone for free. The Xbox controller works fine in game, but not for menus, there's some nice voice acting from one bored-sounding, but pleasant dude (your commander, apparently), and mechanically there's nothing wrong with Bladestar. Just quite low production values and the gameplay is typical vertical scrolling shoot em up. Like another reviewer said this is purely an \"if you're in the mood for genre X\" type of title. \n\n5/10", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198026513613", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "last_played": 1456747161, "num_games_owned": 938, "playtime_forever": 229}}, {"timestamp_created": 1478994722, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495946", "timestamp_updated": 1478994722, "recommendationid": "26570014", "votes_up": 4, "review": "Different take on a shoot-em up.

I grew up iin the 1980's playing them and they are my favourite genre of games ( I dislike bullet hell ).\n\nI thought that I would like this but you can tell that the game is aimed at the casual gamer market, based on the frequent shield pickups and \"entire screen destruction\" smart bombs ( every few seconds ).\n\nThings that I disliked:\n\n- The neon colour scheme is blinding. The bullets are neon, the background planets have bloom and neon, the pickups are neon. The developer needs to tone down on the LSD lighting.\n\n- In story mode, when you repeat a section, you hear the same voiceovers, with no way to skip past them. I was rolling my eyes at one point.\n\nThings that I liked:\n\n- The controls are smooth.\n\nI was going to give this a thumbs up ( for the casual gamers ) but the blinding neon colours, with no way to actually differentiate the bullets from the background planet in wave 20-30 made me uninstall in disgust and request a refund.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 5, "author": {"steamid": "76561198029985509", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 82, "last_played": 1467810444, "num_games_owned": 246, "playtime_forever": 105}}, {"timestamp_created": 1453142778, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506397", "timestamp_updated": 1453142778, "recommendationid": "20610140", "votes_up": 3, "review": "There's something missing from this game -- seems empty.
