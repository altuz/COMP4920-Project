I expected cheap as dirt worst game ever. People say like it's the worst game ever.\n\nCommunity tricked me again. It's not. It's just mediocre, you jump around and slash some fantasy monsters (or your friends). And that's it.\nIt doesn't crash, I have 60fps on my 5yo old PC with everything maxed out. It's not downright ugly (UE4 makes everything shiny even if it's not supposed to be shiny), it's not downright broken. It's just mediocre, unpolished and low on content game. I've seen worse. Much, much worse.\nCommunity needs to stop overreacting over the smallest things. Yeah, we are buying and enjoying expectations and PR words these days, but can we stop making a fuzz about nothing at very least?\nI mean it's super-cheap and it's not the best game ever. But it could give a stupid hour of jumping around before you idle for cards and delete it. Don't pretend like it's price dented your wallet, you aren't poor african kid. It cost 24 cents for me and I got my hour of not-so-fun. The game is just ultra-cheap 'meh'.\n\nOn the bright side devs are still working on their game, and that's some dedication. I just want to support the devs (GO BUY ORBITAL GEAR, IT'S GREAT GAME, SRSLY)\n\np.s.: I say jump around because stationary moves are slow and useless (and hitboxes are way off).
