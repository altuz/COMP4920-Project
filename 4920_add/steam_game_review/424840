There are many little details and a soundtrack that might give you goosebumps. The atmosphere of this game is astounding and even though there's not one spoken word in this game it creates tension and fear it's unreal.\n\nEven though it's short, for me it was fully worth the price. The lovely crafted scenery, the creepy and disgusting characters as well as the cute nomes are reason enough for playing it, not to speak of all the wonderful ideas the team has put in, the awesome camera movement (the last games where i liked the camera angle and movement that much because of its unique design were resident evil and silent hill).

Although it is more like an action horror paced arcade puzzle game with what I personally call \u201cMario\u201d gameplay of jumping and doing timed passed objectives. Main character can't grab and pull out objects properly or cannot respond quickly on input commands. Instead, a player is forced to spend nerves on pushing controller buttons in frustration rather than spending nerves on actual atmospheric and spookiness of this great nightmare world.  I thought this is similar to Amnesia games. Where the story is told by exploring and the gameplay spooks and \"trolls\" the player almost passively. Where a lot of phycological tension going on but yet no fast-paced action. Only a little. \nThere is no narration and explanation to the works your are in. It might be a good artistic approach for the game to let player figure out what is going on and why. At least there could be a small written texts or notes scattered around puzzle levels to tell the player the story\u2026 Or maybe main character thoughts while being in the nightmare\u2026\nPuzzles are uninformative, there are no hints where to start unless if you take your time to explore and poke your noise at things to figure out.  That is, actually a good approach\u201d because it forces you to \u201cimmerse\u201d into this strange world and explore, look around. Although it does not apply if your character is under threat and a player needs to figure it out  the puzzle very fast. And here come trial and error. Tried once - fail - start over. Fail again, start over from the checkpoint. 2\u2019d and 3rd  try  give you an impulse/motivation to try again, especially in tense spooky situations.  After 10th failing you start to loose that atmospheric roleplay as you go the same thing over again just to be able to move into the next puzzle room.  You take off your high-quality headphones off, pause you immersive felling as it is no longer pleases you, turn off volume and look closely into the monitor with your fingers trying to do Olympic gymnastics to quickly press buttons for your character's movements to do quickly in sequential order as quickly as possible in the only sequence you have to do - there are no alternative routes, no alternative solution to puzzle solving. It is a straight up mono gameplay. At first I love the immersions of this game but out of frustration, gave up on this and have not finished it. Do not want to break \"RT\" button on the controller nor my mouse.  I genuinely wish I could put a \u201cso-so\u201d recommendation, although this small review looks like a \"rage quit\" big comment.
