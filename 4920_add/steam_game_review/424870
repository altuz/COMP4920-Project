So it's up to your party of characters to find out the what and why of their plans, and, of course, save everyone.\nThe game has an ordinary start as you build your characters abilities by playing in three differing groups before everyone comes together, but, like \"Midnight's Blessing\" from the same dev, as the story unfolds the pace quickly picks up and becomes one of those games that draws you in for one more area to explore, or one more battle, or one more task. As a good rpg should.\n\nThe characters are well fleshed out and easy to like, and there are several NPCs that help move things along as well. \nThe artwork is very nice, especially in the battle scenes.\nMusic is good ---- stays in the background yet sets the mood of the action taking place.\nI'm several hours in, and the story is really just beginning, so the game length is good.\n\nLots to see, explore, and accomplish here, and it is a must for fans of this type of game. Give it a try for sure.\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 9, "author": {"steamid": "76561198067119595", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "last_played": 1452429515, "num_games_owned": 1019, "playtime_forever": 539}}, {"timestamp_created": 1482534895, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495849", "timestamp_updated": 1482534895, "recommendationid": "28573688", "votes_up": 1, "review": "This is one of the more fun SNES-like RPGs out there. \n\nWell done devs!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 4, "author": {"steamid": "76561198352955326", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1484887536, "num_games_owned": 26, "playtime_forever": 484}}, {"timestamp_created": 1495899633, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488826", "timestamp_updated": 1495899633, "recommendationid": "31999455", "votes_up": 0, "review": "\ud83d\udc4d\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561198024502690", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "last_played": 1495899567, "num_games_owned": 189, "playtime_forever": 215}}, {"timestamp_created": 1482438290, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484914", "timestamp_updated": 1482438290, "recommendationid": "28536171", "votes_up": 4, "review": "yet another rpg maker\n\nclassic?  naw\n\nworth 1.99?  meh", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 9, "author": {"steamid": "76561198352549203", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1487183183, "num_games_owned": 33, "playtime_forever": 1487}}], "success": 1}
