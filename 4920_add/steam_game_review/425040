I am not sure why there have not been more reviews of it and can only surmise that it has flown under the radar for some time DUE to the fact that it does not have an approval rating. The graphics are colourful and surprisingly good at this game's price point and the story and the comic you play through is also fairly well made. I encourage anyone who likes TBS to snap it up and provide reviews of their own and I really can't understand why it has been overlooked for so long.\n\n*IMPORTANT* one word of warning - the devs have provided the comic itself in both high and low rez pdf. Do NOT, as I did, read that comic before you play the game as you will then know the story you play through spoiling the experience somewhat.\n\nI really hope they make more of these.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561197991657927", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 254, "last_played": 1501422905, "num_games_owned": 832, "playtime_forever": 170}}], "success": 1}
