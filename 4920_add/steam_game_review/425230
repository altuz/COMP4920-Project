Ill stick to the cubes i drew in middle school art class.\n\nI like the hidden areas, i most the time i spend on the game now is looking for hidden areas and chests. \n\nthe item combinations are cool, its nice to kinda get \"super powers\" ill call them. something that is completely origional, at least i havent seen it anywhere.\n\nthere really isnt anything i dont like about the game as when i find something that doesnt fit the developer fixes it or adjusts it promptly.\n\nif youre thinking about getting the game, get it. you wont regret it. its not that expensive, and its really nice to have direct contact with the dev to report bugs. (you might get in trouble at work, as the game is seriously addicting) i have 18 hours alone on my work computer and have only had the game 5 days...", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 3, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561198063091006", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1477164047, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 1578}}, {"timestamp_created": 1460088976, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501422", "timestamp_updated": 1460088976, "recommendationid": "22295155", "votes_up": 4, "review": "I love the retro gaming feel!

The logistics of the whole gameplay... I can certainly say I fell in love with the game.\n\nOriginally I was going to buy the game for my husband but instead I bought it for myself.\n\nAs it being early access, this game is worth every penny in my eyes because I really do have fun with it! -- As the developer once told me, you can make the game in any difficulty you would like, either just using the rear sword and shield, you can instead use other weapons in game.\n\n#80sKid #OldSchoolGaming", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 2, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198255511654", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1460674497, "num_games_owned": 73, "playtime_forever": 364}}, {"timestamp_created": 1473390615, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496806", "timestamp_updated": 1473390615, "recommendationid": "25420260", "votes_up": 0, "review": "Awesome game!
