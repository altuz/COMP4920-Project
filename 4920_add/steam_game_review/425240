Aside from the art though, the gameplay is really dull.\n\nThere are several major flaws to point out.  One is the very repetitive and uninteresting nature of the levels: they're all more or less the same, with slight variances in enemy types, but there is nothing memorable about them.  It makes me wonder why I have to \"drive\" at all, since they're all just a straight line up (with wobbly edges).  Yes, sometimes there are \"turns\" but 99% of the time you just keep pressing forward and the camera turns quickly enough that your car straightens itself out.\n\nAnother problem is the limited number of upgrades/parts.  They are all very dull and don't have a significant impact on your gameplay.  I would have preferred more varied choices and effects that build upon each other, to let me build a truly zany buggy with unique gameplay.  Even a fully-upgraded weapon still feels weak and ineffective.\n\nTo top it all off, there is only a finite amount of gold to be earned, so replaying older levels doesn't earn you another few hundred gold.  There is a set number of coins in the level, and once you've collected them all, that's all you get.  This is a particularly vile issue because you sell unwanted upgrades at a loss, yet can't grind to make up the deficit, so unless you know exactly what you want on your buggy, you will waste money and get frustrated because those upgrades aren't cheap.  Once again, it points to the creators' poor understanding of gameplay design, as a game with finite money does not require - not should it ever have - a money sink.\n\nOverall, it's a shiny, briefly entertaining shooter, but its gameplay flaws severely limit replay value.  I deleted it after about an hour, and won't be coming back.  I'm glad I got a very generous coupon discount, because this really isn't worth more than the 2-3$ I paid.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197996888000", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "last_played": 1505083539, "num_games_owned": 1511, "playtime_forever": 85}}], "success": 1}
