I have 7 and a half hours clocked in on the game and that\u2019s only because I got up and walked away multiple times. The total playthrough for the game is only between 6 and 7 hours and to be honest, I had a hard time powering through to the end. I found the game to be just\u2026 dull\u2026 and I really didn\u2019t want to come back to it after the first 3 hours. I don\u2019t even feel the multiplayer could save this game. Granted everything\u2019s more fun with multiplayer, the game is just too much a victim of it\u2019s own blandness and multiplayer can\u2019t even save it. Yes, the game\u2019s play time can be artificially inflated out of a desire to play as all 4 characters, but the boredom you will experience in the game will quickly overrule that compulsion.\nIt\u2019s just not a good game. Completely devoid of creativity, meaningful story, decent graphics, OR enjoyable gameplay, this game is a waste of space on my drive and I FEEL dumber for having played it. It is generic incarnate and it can be yours for $50! That\u2019s right! A slight discount from a full triple A release because even they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to try and justify a full $60 price tag! Probably because they knew that if they did it would have caused an uproar! But this game still isn\u2019t even worth half the $50 asking price and it\u2019s an INSULT at that price point! The only way I could justify ANYONE buying this bland, boring ass piece of shit is if it were $10. Maybe 15. That\u2019s all it\u2019s worth! DON\u2019T waste your money on this game until the price drops DRASTICALLY. There are simply too many other worthwhile games out there that will give you a lot more enjoyment.\"\n\nI can't recommend this game without a massive price drop.

A much better improvement over what sanctum of slime had.  The cutcscens for new missions looks better but it also way more lazy this time around. By that I mean that yes they look nicer but now between mission cutscenes are phone calls with a single static image.\n\nThe gameplay works fine but there is no variety added.  Everything you see in the tutorial level is everything this game has.  You are afforded no new weapons to buy or unlock.  Each character has one unique grenade and there is no changing that.  The enemy types are generic and with the exception of a few are completely interchangable.\nThere is a capture mechanic where you bash the \"A\" button.  All bashing the button does for you is get you extra points and you can't exceed the X3 multiplier without upgrades.\n\nThe levels themselves are slogs especially later on where a single stage in a level can take upwards of 45 minutes.  My problem with theses stages is that they are too huge for their own good and don't offer any change in scenery as you make your way through the stage.  Combine that with the fact that the characters constantly spout one liners and those one liners start repeating before long, can make things very annoying.\n\nAs far as the soundtrack goes, I swear this game only has three tracks to it for the levels.  At least that's they way it seems.  The music is very bland.  The only good song in this is the Ghostbusters theme but even that will get tiring due to the fact that it's the only song that plays when you are not in a level.  What a waste.\n\nLike Sanctum of Slime, this game has multiplayer.  However unlike Sanctum of Slime, The multiplayer here is Local only.  So if you were to play this on a computer with friends, everyone would have to connect their own controller with one unlucky person being on the keyboard.\n\nAs far as story goes, It really has none.  Other than letting you know that's it's a sequal on mutiple occasions, the game is just a series of levels strung together with no overarching narrative.  The only hint you get at a plot is in the phone conversations where the main villain interjects for about five seconds then disappears.  Hell the main characters of this game don't even get names, that's how lazily done this game is.\n\nDon't bother with the dlc.  it's four bucks just to remove the stripes on their uniforms and you can barely tell the difference in game.\n\nTLDR:  This game is a lazy cashgrab that isn't worth the 50 dollars that they want you to pay for it.  The way the game is presented and done feels like something you would buy for 15 dollars.

It's a fun little twin-stick shooter, a vast improvement on Sanctum Of Slime. The AI is a bit dumb (AI players will throw grenades before enemies even appear on screen), but the graphics are bright and colorful, the controls are tight, and the levels scroll smoothly.\n\nThe only problem I have is with the story. It's supposed to take place after the new movie. I liked the new movie (one of the few, apparently), so I was looking forward to taking control of one of the girls and busting some ghosts. Instead we get four generic nobodies that just barely fit into a Ghostbusters-themed Saturday morning cartoon, each one a single note character that elicits no emotion from the player at all. The writing around these characters is even worse, with just cursory references to the movie's characters (Abby and Erin are referenced at the start, Patty gets referenced once, Rowan is referenced in a collectable, and a few of the bosses are based on ghosts from the movie) and some questionable humor for what is, ostensibly, a game aimed at younger audiences (one of the major characters possibly has a heart attack in the opening sequence...maybe?).\n\nIn the end, though, the story isn't a gamebreaker. Just grab some friends, hop on the couch (horray for couch co-op!), have a few beers, and bust some ghosts.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 11, "votes_down": 171, "author": {"steamid": "76561198013939521", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1483836096, "num_games_owned": 211, "playtime_forever": 217}}, {"timestamp_created": 1469893762, "weighted_vote_score": "0.207448", "timestamp_updated": 1469893762, "recommendationid": "24617178", "votes_up": 17, "review": "As with the movie you'll either love or hate this game,\nI'll be the first to admit my skeptcism to both the movie and game but after keeping an open mind and ignoring any reviews out there I can honestly say I was wrong. The only real problem with the game is the price, its hard to justify paying $50 for it under any circumstances but that alone is the biggest downfall of the game. Its  pretty straightforward and easy to pick up as far as controls are concerned. There are four rookie busters to choose from each with their own inital speed level and recharge rate that can later be changed through the upgrade system they incorporate that allows you to add some fun customization to whichever character you choose. The weapons the busters brandish are different enough to add replay value to the game if youre going solo and makes it fun to team up with friends who have mastered a different weapon than yours if multiplayer is your jam. The levels CAN come off as repetive but I think thats an issue that plagues todays younger gamers, to me its almost like Super Smash TV: Ghostbusters Edition which personally is badass. So to wrap it up like a taco, this game gets a bad rep and the only reason it should is the price were this a 30 or 20 dollar game Im sure the reviews would much different. Lets face it though we've all paid more for worse so if you have the money pick it up its good, if you dont maybe just wait and download sanctum of slime in the meantime.", "comment_count": "52", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 26, "votes_down": 444, "author": {"steamid": "76561198147798602", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1470102458, "num_games_owned": 95, "playtime_forever": 754}}], "success": 1}
