However, if you want to just hit a few buttons in VR and hear some repetitive noise... this works. Don't bother trying to create anything really cool yet, just get Fruityloops Studio for that (the closest REAL production software to this). Couldn't go the online play for some reason, so I can only give comment on the single player experience. It was fun for about 15 minutes. It is, however, early access so I will gladly support the dev in hopes that it improves.\n\nNot exactly block rocking (yet), but definitely a GREAT concept and it is well done compared to the other terrible music simulators on Steam.
