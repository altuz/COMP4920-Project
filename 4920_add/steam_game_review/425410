The game is simplistic in theory, yet challenging and engaging in execution. It begins very easily, allowing you grasp the basics at a pace that I found to be exactly right. There are text instructions which guide you along the way, peppered with playful commentary from the developers. This kept the frustration of repetitive trials at bay as I made my attempts to both learn, and develop proficieny at getting the ball in the hole - trust me, it's not as easy as it sounds.\n\nSpeaking of sound, the entire idea behind the game is to follow the beat, to let the music guide you in order to tackle the trials which await you on your journey to the promised land of Ballhalla. Obviously this would be the case for a game with the \"rhythm\" tag, but it's worth noting that it is done particularly well in this instance.\n\nEach stage gets progressively more difficult, augmenting new elements of gameplay to keep you interested, helping to avoid the common pitfall of tedium and staleness that plague so many other titles.\n\nAs you play each stage, you are benchmarked on two attributes - your ability to collect all the gold, as well as the number of times you fail. You are rewarded with tokens - up to eight (four from each category) - which allow you to unlock new areas, styles of ball, and the option to take on \"Rush\" mode for that world, which is a timed run of individual levels.\n\nThus far I haven't completed the game. I'm about to enter Ballhalla, but I can see there are still a good deal of things to be discovered, and that excites me.\n\nIf you like N++ (a game I've known since the early Internet days, when it was a flash game called N) then I have a feeling you will enjoy this game. It's very similar, only your ninja is a ball. Just pretend it's Samus.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198015030667", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1500583328, "num_games_owned": 379, "playtime_forever": 395}}], "success": 1}
