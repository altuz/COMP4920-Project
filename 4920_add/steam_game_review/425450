I was really excited and as soon as it came out on early access, I bought it and tried it. I think it's already really promising, the esthetics are cute and very stylized, the concept of the game itself is simple but really lovely. It's sometimes the most simple things that are the best. I need to hop back into it and play more, I am very excited to try the other modes and I'm hoping to see more possibilities of customization for characters, it's always a plus on my end! I might have encountered little bugs with the controller where it sometimes switched to keyboard controls but that could be my own device that does that. But that's not gonna stop me from playing. Overall, I'd recommend to try it out, it's very fun and playing with friends definitely will add to it!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198024190311", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1498185283, "num_games_owned": 102, "playtime_forever": 27}}, {"timestamp_created": 1485125339, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508532", "timestamp_updated": 1485125339, "recommendationid": "29432716", "votes_up": 7, "review": "Wow, this is such a fun party game! Four player on the couch is an absolute blast, even my four year old son was able to knock me off the top spot a couple of times. This game really is fun for the whole family, but also has a great competitive \"smash bros\" feel to it when you have a group of lads/gals over for a few drinks. It plays great as a single player game as well. The CPU/Ai goats are pretty smart and enough of a challange to keep you playing for hours alone.\n\nLike all well designed games, GoatPunks is easy to pick up and start playing, but there are layers of complexity and tactics that take time to master. The various power-ups are imaginative and add a really fun element, plus each goat has it's own special ability and individual playing style, so it's fun to experiment and find the one that works for you.\n\nThe level design is really great. Each \"mountain\" has it's own unique feel and the level of detail in the artwork is amazing. I particularly like the steam punk inspired level with the moving cogs and plaforms, the lava/volcano level is beautiful as well.\n\nIn short, this is a great game and well worth the megre $10!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198016354498", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1485162908, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_forever": 110}}, {"timestamp_created": 1484914896, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506105", "timestamp_updated": 1484914896, "recommendationid": "29374382", "votes_up": 6, "review": "I've had this in my wishlist for a while now.
