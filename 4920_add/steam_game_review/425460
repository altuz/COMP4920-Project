If you are going to buy this game, make sure you have a controller to play on, preferably an Xbox controller as those are the button prompts that show up in-game. Even then, there are a lot of hidden menus and sub-menus that are not discussed in the game or its manual (like how to talk to characters between missions) which you will need to discover to get the most out of the visual novel elements.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197997838090", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "last_played": 1504114442, "num_games_owned": 586, "playtime_forever": 756}}], "success": 1}
