Oh, and it installs a bunch of other stuff without telling you.  And your virus protection goes wild telling you \"dear lord, why did you give me this garbage!?\"  Crisis averted, but you still need to burn stuff.\n\nSteam is nice.  It'll keep your apps up to date, and regardless whether the app is on some shifty website's \"Top 10\" list, you know it will at least be virus free.  You find CyberLink Power2Go.\n\nThe interface is nice and clean.  It's feature-rich.  It doesn't spawn other installs.  It doesn't panic virus-protection.\nNot only does it burn the disc image you wanted, it also supports virtual discs!  In fact, it sports media conversion, photo discs, audio discs, VCDs, DVD-Video, and media backup. \n\nYup! You're happy.  I positively recommend this.  :)", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198028003552", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1499138489, "num_games_owned": 334, "playtime_forever": 59}}], "success": 1}
