The ending of 2 makes me sad that it is over but still a great puzzle/pyschological horror game.\nThe soundtrack is great and ambient. It gives each area a unique groetesque feel.\nThe areas have a great helplessness feel to them (especailly the short level!).\nAll in all; if you loved the MYST games this is a game for you!
