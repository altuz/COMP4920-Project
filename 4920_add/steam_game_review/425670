You're stepping into the combat boots of the titular Seraph, an angel that just escaped from her imprisonment in a city-sized futuristic vessel. While [i]Ironcast[/i], Dreadbit's first game, offered a relaxed turn-based experience, this one is action packed and frantic, yet excels in similar ways.\n[i]Ironcast[/i] put a spin on match-3 games by combining the genre with RPG-like mech combat and a very stylish asthetic, and [i]Seraph[/i] also takes a well-established genre and twists it into something refreshingly different. \nNot having to aim in a game like this feels weird at first, but once you become more familiar with the games various means of avoiding damage (like [i]blink[/i]ing out of the way, using corners for cover, or just killing whoever is attacking you, thus destroying their projectiles), maneuvering around the levels feels just so rewarding.\n\nYour movement in [i]Seraph[/i] is swift, responsive,  and well-animated, although sometimes you might get stuck to a ledge that you didn't mean to hiold on to. The combat rewards taking risks, since enemies drop \"motes\" on death, that decay swiftly \u2013 so blinking into a dying enemy is the most risky, but also the most rewarding strategy. You dispatch your foes with a arsenal of different weapons that favor different play styles (my favorites have to be the autopistols). These weapons can be upgraded in-between levels. These upgrades are part of a global progression system, similar to a rogue-lite (although the game usually does not have permadeaths), in which you upgrade your weapons, skills and protective wards across runs.\n\nThis meta-progression is one of the core elements of [i]Seraph[/i], after a few runs you'll notice how much easier the earlier levels will become. But don't worry, the difficulty will become quite punishing later. Difficulty also scales dynamically: you're doing well and are dodging all attacks? Well, your enemies just got a lot tougher way more quickly. \nThis dynamic difficulty is one of the foundations of the daily challenge, and especially the weekly survival mode, in which you start a new character (but keep all your meta progress), and try to score the most points before losing the last of both your respawn tokens. For me, this mode became the most enjoyable part of [i]Seraph[/i], with enticing rewards for whoever reaches the top-tiers of the leaderboards.\n\nThe game offers a new game mechanic, in which you swap your progress for permanent stat improvements. While grindy, the core game mechanics just feel so good to me that I haven't gotten tired of starting a new run yet. Once again, Dreadbit has nailed it for me, and I can't wait to see what this studio comes up with next.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198002757537", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1502327600, "num_games_owned": 732, "playtime_forever": 2973}}, {"timestamp_created": 1502393778, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "timestamp_updated": 1502393778, "recommendationid": "34153470", "votes_up": 1, "review": "The game is all kinds of good until the overkillingly spammy-attacking unfairly random final boss that is definitely NOT in any way fair for an easy or normal mode and is a brickwallingly turning difficulty curve on the final stretch.\n\nWould recommend if balanced better.

The game that pushed me over the edge and made me get a Steam Controller. And that is an important thing to note folks; you can play this with a keyboard, but it is awkward and not enjoyable at all. You need to have a controller for this one. Now, with that out of the way, onto the review.\n\nThe story of Seraph is an interesting one, told piece-meal by start of level and end of level cutscenes, with numerous log files you can pick up along the way to get the rest of it together. Essentially what happens is that in the game's world, there exists Reality (where we live), Origin (heaven) and Terminus (hell). A divine being known as The Seraph left Origin and possessed the body of a young woman named Talia. Somewhere on the way, she was captured by religous persons, and held prisoner on a ship called the Corangelous for years, being treated as the object of a relgious pilgrimage (think Mecca). The demons of Terminus spoke to her, offering her freedom if she helped them enter Reality. Unwittingly she did, and the game starts with the demons invading the ship, and the Seraph needing to fight her way out. There is a bit more to it, but I don't want to spoil much more.\n\nThe graphics are good, but not exceptional, as that isn't needed in a game like this. There are five distinct 'world' on the ship with multiple levels each, and you can easily tell them apart by their appearance. The indvidual levels are trutly procedurally generated, so you'll never see the same levels twice, save for two boss fights. The music fits the game well, but sadly isn't anything memorable outside of playing.\n\nBut where the game really shines is the gameplay, which is the main draw and what you should be 'coming to the dance' for. As stated, each level is procedurally generated so you'll never have the same experience. The placement of the exit, enemies, and secret areas change each time. Despite this there is a familiar pattern, as each level involves you tracking down a high powered demon and destroying them, or finding multiple demon fountains and destroying them. This never gets boring or repetitive though as you don't know what you're going to come across each time and exploring the levels is a joy.\n\nYou control the Seraph, moving through the levels, running, jumping, and shooting. She will always auto target enemies so you focus on dodging while continually attacking. She gets two 'Blinks' which give the ability to transport around enemies rapidly, or reach new areas in the level. The Blinks recharge every few seconds, but it's a careful balance to avoid taking damage while ensuring your enemies are crushed. They start off easy but can get downright nasty later on.\n\nThis is thanks to the games scaling difficulty. When you defeat enemies they drop white 'motes' that add experience to your character. The more of these you pick up, the higher the difficulty scales. If you collect multiple motes in a row without taking damage, a meter fills up and this makes the difficulty go up even faster. So if you're good, you can end up in a rather tricky situation early on. As a matter of fact, I had to restart my own playthrough because it got too difficult. Luckly the game retains all your progress on upgrades when you do so. \n\nSo on that note, the progression system is great. You get experience from collecting the aforementioned motes, and level up as you would in any other game, each time getting a health increase and the ability to choose to power up one of four skills, which are selected for you when you start. You can put all your points into one skill or spread them out, but the fact you won't ever end up with the same set of skills twice adds to the replyability. However this isn't retained when you start a new game, so what is?\n\nThat's everything else. You gather components as you kill the demons, which allow you to craft stronger versions of your weapons, stronger accessories, and more powerful miracles (which are special attacks). As well you collect shards, which can be slotted into multiple skills throughout three skill trees. There are five rarities of shards, and you can combine three of one kind to make the next one. As well you need to have a certain number of shards in lower skills to be able to slot shards into the more powerful ones. So all the crafting and shards carry over. \n\nEven once you finish the game, you're not done. There are daily challenges which provide extra crafting rewards when you place well, and every week there is a special Survival Challenge, which puts everyone in a fixed version of the main campaign with the goal to go as far as you can and get the highest score, with again crafting rewards for doing well. Eventually, if you want, you can \"Rebirth\" which is equivelant to a prestige in Call of Duty/Gears of War; everything resets,  but you get small bonuses to all your stats, and this can be done up to five times if you're really that crazy.\n\nAll in all the package here is exceptional with tons of value avaiable for the price, and you owe it to yourself to at least try it.

Physics-defying gunplay and smiting ensue. What more could one possibly ask for?\n\nIt's hard to say... [i]Seraph[/i] is pretty damn good as-is. The controls and subsequent mechanics are solid -- well-polished. Everything feels as it should. Challenge ramps up appropriately via an unusual but well-executed difficulty multiplier based off your current performance; increasingly hard, yet forgiving.\n\nThis is a game that wears its inspirations proudly on its sleeve. From [i]Ninja Gaiden[/i] to [i]BloodRayne[/i] and sprinklings of [i]Doom[/i], there's a lot of enjoyable meta reference present. Expect some welcome familiarity. The music is spot-on, too -- techy off-kilter edge. \n\nVisually the game looks great, if not same-y. That's not to say the level design is bad; it's by all means good (there's more than enough walls, drops, and platforms to make ample use of Seraph's varying abilities), but aesthetically the repetition is disappointing. Every few levels there's a slight backdrop change, but never enough to truly shake things up.\n\nThere's an upgrade system present which I suppose is nice, but it feels... tacked on? Last minute? The amount of gameplay investment to get far along with shards and transmutations seems exponentially high considering [i]Seraph's[/i] existing lack of overall variety. Weekly challenges help, I suppose, but this isn't the type of game where minor online functionality is particularly valued in any notable regard.\n\nOverall, [i]Seraph[/i] is flawed, but above-average, enjoyably novel despite its shortcomings. Considering the low price tag, I'd say this one is a no-brainer for someone that likes their action platformers twitchy and hard as fuck.
