This is a perfectly fine game - competently designed, handles smoothly, controls like a twin-stick shooter should. It just feels slightly unambitious, or like Wizbyte got it as far as \"solidly functioning\" and chose not to go any further. Balance problems pop up early, with a bit of a \"hurry up and wait\" flow to the game. The fact that the main enemies have strict pursuit AI means that the game does not demand the chaotic hand independence of, say, Robotron 2084. There are a few instances of lacking in polish, too - I run the game in a downscaled resolution, and the bomb count and score multiplier are on top of each other, so I have no idea what my value for either is.\n\nIf you cannot get enough twin-stick shooters, or if you've never played one, you probably won't regret buying this, but it's hard to recommend when, even in my limited experience, I've played a few others that better capture the essence of this style of game.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198136487805", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1469317786, "num_games_owned": 152, "playtime_forever": 60}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505777097, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498084", "timestamp_updated": 1506237461, "recommendationid": "35054639", "votes_up": 0, "review": "Tags: Topdown Shooter\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Redundant with Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved. Just less polished. Play that instead.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/8400/Geometry_Wars_Retro_Evolved/\n\nThis game is mechanically solid. The hitboxes make sense, the aiming is precise enough and the incremental increase in difficulty works. However most foes will just chase you down and be bulletsponges so you will kite around the edges of the screen over and over as you wittle them down. Then turrets start happening and the bullet hell element does not work very well with the rather slow moving and large hitbox for your ship. I think the behavior of foes in geometry wars was a lot more interesting. This is also less visually busy which might be a good thing but the constant sound effects from foes getting hit and the firing of lasers sounded like popcorn popping... it was odd... and distracting... Finally this game has no resolution options unlike geometry wars. I think when you tally all the pros and cons it makes the decision fairly obvious.
