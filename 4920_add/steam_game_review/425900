I like it. Fits well with the tons of campy indie games I have. The rub, it doesn't currently run properly. Click \"Play\" and nothing starts up. Heading into the install directory and double-clicking the game's exe and the game runs just fine.\n\nSo, let's just set that aside and look at the game itself.\n\nPRO: Fun, simple, and easy to master. Plenty of levels and it's nice to look at. I really like the style.\n\nCON: See above. The jump mechanic needs work. Feels, off. Not sure why. Perhaps it would be better with a controller. Price seems a bit high for what you get. The game appears to be a bit glitch but I only noticed during recording. Needs further investigation.\n\nRecommend for now but if I don't see changes quickly to address issues I'd have to change this to \"avoid and wait for sale.\"", "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 2, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561197960546592", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "last_played": 1468869804, "num_games_owned": 251, "playtime_forever": 58}}, {"timestamp_created": 1474972207, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1474972207, "recommendationid": "25722672", "votes_up": 0, "review": "This is a fun, frustrating, and furious game... i rate it a 10/10 thanks Nebble for recommending this\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198092624633", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "last_played": 1473682484, "num_games_owned": 109, "playtime_forever": 181}}, {"timestamp_created": 1493841249, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1493841249, "recommendationid": "31530360", "votes_up": 0, "review": "The game looks cute, but don't think that means it's going to be easy: Adventure Lamp is an extremely challenging puzzle platformer.\nLevels are short, allowing you to restart them quickly so that's convenient.\nThe game also allows you to set its speed, which can be very helpful for some levels.\n\nWould recommend if you want to spend about two hours on a cute yet challenging game.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197988228093", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1500512957, "num_games_owned": 102, "playtime_forever": 139}}], "success": 1}
