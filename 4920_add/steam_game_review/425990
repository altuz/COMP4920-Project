There are some things to note; like obviously you need a VR headset to work as without it you're not going to be able to do anything, there are some minor bugs (like sometimes debris will remain on the screen longer than they're supposed to, but it's more of a niggle that an actual annoyance.), and some people might find this repetitive, but those people probably don't have souls so it doesn't really matter.\n\nI love the beginning of the game; you're in this cool little room with a bunch of diplays and it really feels like you're there, the scaling of that first room is done really well! Also, I like that you can just hop on it and there isn't a huge cutscene waiting for you, you can just immediately PLAY! I know that tends to annoy me, especially when game studios remove the ability to skip cutscenes - grr! So yay, thankfully I don't even have to deal with that with this little game.  There is an optional tutorial which I strongly suggest everyone goes through at least once, it will help you get your bearings and understand what you're supposed to do!  However, if you're one of those \"I don't need no dang tutorial--I'm a rebel!\" sorts then remembr, the tutorial is optional and you can just jump in and figure things out on your own if you so choose to. (Honestly though, just do the tutorial, it's short and pretty helpful.)\n\nNext the actual play-experience! It's pretty surreal, you're basically floating in space, surrounded by all kinds of debris floating around you, and it's your job to destroy as much debris as you possibly can. There's asteroids, aliens, lasers, boss fights, and things you can collect from the debris to up the ante on your laser; more destructive power? Yes, please.\n\nLastly, the difficulty will always keep increasing to keep you on your toes. So there will be more enemies, more lasers threatening to destroy you, and more boss fights as you continue on within the game. I was surprised by how much I actually enjoyed this, but enjoy it I did!\n\nSomething very important to keep in mind; you're literally in the middle of all this debris which means some of it will be super close to your personal space, the natural inclination is to move away... so keep away of where you are moving within your PLAY AREA, because it is easy to lose yourself in the game and start moving away from your designated play zone and start knocking yourself and your VR gear into the walls.\n\nTL:DR - It's like stepping into those old arcade games, but now you're IN it, surrounded by it. It's fun, simple, and at 5.99 pretty dang affordable.
