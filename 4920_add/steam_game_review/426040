It's certainly not asking an unreasonable price for what it offers, especially on sale, and it's certainly not anyone's definition of \"incompetent\".  It is, on the other hand, a little hard to imagine just who I would consider \"recommending\" this game to, bar perhaps those masochists out there who think that constantly moving between rooms as instructed to perform myriad menial tasks, whilst avoiding the floaty ghosts of butchered beasties, constitutes something resembling \"gameplay\".  Hell, it would at least be a passable time-waster if the saves were regular, but every unspectacular death just means several minutes of getting back to where you were beforehand, and the satisfaction of a job successfully completed is marginal at best.\n\n   Now...I know that this arguably sounds like an awful lot of games out there, including some which I hold in incredibly high esteem, such as Outlast.  I guess I maybe just require slightly \"deeper\" gameplay if I'm not going to be served oodles of ATMOSPHERE in the overall package, and the fine line between \"horror\" and \"retro\"/\"arcade\"-style antics is perhaps a little too skewed to the latter for my liking in this case.  It really may just be a personal taste thing, though, and the vegetarian in me definitely wants to like the sheer perversity of this crazy little slice of madness.  It's really, REALLY not \"bad\" at all.  Maybe it's just not my bag, and maybe it will be yours.  Hence the recommendation...that, and the lack of a \"neutral\" button for me to push, because this game really is about as \"middling\" as it gets in my book.\n\n   Let me try putting it another way:  If you like super-duper old-school \"arcade\" games, with just a splash of horror (and the good old red stuff) to give it a bit of context, then you may well enjoy this.  I don't think it's going to hit anyone's all-time top-ten lists, but it may well be worth the two bucks or less if you're feeling suitably indiscriminating and just feel like killing a bit of time while you butcher a few cartoon carcasses.  For me, personally, its appeal ran its course pretty quickly.  \n\n   Definitely NOT to be filed in the Lone Survivor/Claire-style category of genuinely \"creepy\" pixelated homages to Silent Hill, et al, though I guess it is at least marginally spookier than Commando or Pac Man.  The very definition of a \"take-or-leave-it\" proposition, methinks, and for now I'm choosing to leave it.  Good luck to the dev, though, as they seem sincere enough in their intentions, and who knows, may well go on to (much) bigger and better things...\n\nVerdict: 5.5/10.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 5, "author": {"steamid": "76561198048974498", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 429, "last_played": 1450628472, "num_games_owned": 1513, "playtime_forever": 54}}, {"timestamp_created": 1450502239, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511522", "timestamp_updated": 1450502239, "recommendationid": "19775334", "votes_up": 12, "review": "A cheap thrill. It\u2019s short but doesn\u2019t fall short of the asking price. \n\nThe game is playable, and the dev says there will be updates. Which I hope will be timed and built on towards 2016\u2019s Halloween as competing thematically with #Xmas and #StarWars doesn't sound like a good idea to me.  There\u2019s a lot of potential here and it\u2019s worth the asking price in it\u2019s current state.   \n\nPros--\n1) Music and sound are great. \n2) Map is simple.\n3) Controls are simple and work well when navigating the game.\n4) Graphics are retro and work with the tone of the game. \n5) Overall sense of fear is there. I felt tense and scared when the sound effects to opening doors. One door in particular was scary, and I thought a monster would be waiting for me. No monster, but I was scared during most of my first play through. \n\nCons--\n1) Story could be more developed and better. It would be nice if the butcher had a kid and/or a wife he had to provide for. Or, maybe someone will die if the butcher doesn\u2019t figure out the mystery at work. \n \n2) Lack of variant game modes or gameplay. I think if the story was developed more, the game could be better developed. Like having a metagame to take care of a sick child in a hospital, etc. Or heck, even a love interest who visits the Butcher during the day. Eventually, as I got better, the tension was less, and thus my fear lowered increasingly. \n\n3) Lack of caring about if I die. It sucks \u201cyes\u201d that you have to start over if you are killed, but I just feel I have to redo the work I did before, that the only reason I want to live is to finish my work and not a meta game or a compelling story. \n\n4) No Steam Cards or Achievements. \nUpdate was promised in the community when I post this review, but steam cards wouldn't add to the game as other things could.   \n\nAgain, I think this is rough version of what could be a better game for a higher asking price, and I hope come Halloween 2016 to see some major updates or even a sequel.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 5, "author": {"steamid": "76561198044429771", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1450500670, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_forever": 144}}, {"timestamp_created": 1481312533, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501699", "timestamp_updated": 1481312533, "recommendationid": "28275666", "votes_up": 1, "review": "The game is very slow-paced, and the levels get boring and too monotonous too quickly.
