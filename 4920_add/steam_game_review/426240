This is a hint of what is to come as overall the visuals are impressive with some very nice effects.

My interpretation was that we are exporing an abandoned alien space structure of some kind. \n\nThe initial 5 mins had me wondering what was going to happen and how the gameplay would evolve. I played with my nephew, at first we took turns and then switched to co-op where he operated the mouse for rotation and I used the control pad for thrust, shoot and scan.

Love the narrative and it has me hooked to find out what happens next. I like the visual style, and it made me feel slightly nauseaus and claustrophic, which seemed coompletely appropriate for the subject matter. (I discovered I could adjust the 'tilt shift' effect via a keymapping to make the visuals sharper; not sure which effect I prefer, but it's great to have the ability to change it). \n\nThe puzzling is compelling, mainly becuase it doesn't insult my intelligence, letting me experiment and explore to discover the mechanics of the game. The level variety is good, and I genuinely felt tense playing the levels, with the ominous sound track and sound effects. Definltey a game to play with good speakers or headphones. \n\nWell worth taking a look during its early access phase and seeing how it develops.\n\nIt is worth noting I am playing this on the latest 4K iMac at the highest settings.
