The bowling game is not even similar to a real bowling experience as you bowl 3 rounds with 3 balls and no score is kept.  Just abysmal.\n\nThe baseball game is very inaccurate and for some reason they give you a bat in both hands rather than designating one.  Furthermore, actually attempting to make contact with the ball is a far greater challenge than attempting to find a positive in the only other experience available at such time with this game; the lackluster and worthless bowling experience.  \n\nJust stay away from purchase as this is not even a complete demo at this point.  I wish there were some way to get a refund for such a steep price for a nearly worthless expenditure of your time and money.\n\n", "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 3, "votes_down": 5, "author": {"steamid": "76561198048827946", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1462576897, "num_games_owned": 168, "playtime_forever": 7}}, {"timestamp_created": 1462719543, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513381", "timestamp_updated": 1462719543, "recommendationid": "22864526", "votes_up": 12, "review": "Really don't know how this could have been priced so high.
