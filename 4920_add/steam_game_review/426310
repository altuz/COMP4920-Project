Some of the monster encounter are very scripted and the solution to survive is often close by. It would've been appreciated an emphasis on supenses when it come to the monster encounter.\n\nThe campaign is also very short i finnish the title under 4hrs\nThe gameplay itself is interesting and can look innovative at time. \nThe Xray vission of Cassie is very reminiscent of the x ray system in the Arkham series.\nThe level design can be confusing but that is to be expected considering the limitation of the gameplay. The story is great but it's does end on a weird note, you never get the feeling of having followed a full story ark it's feels more like an intro which is disappointing.\nCassie is a very interesting character she has a lot of personality and is a strong female protagonist\n\n6.9/10 Verdict: Perception is flawed but still manages to be enjoyable.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198014988667", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 91, "last_played": 1500192584, "num_games_owned": 960, "playtime_forever": 254}}, {"timestamp_created": 1503885666, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "timestamp_updated": 1503887915, "recommendationid": "34543197", "votes_up": 5, "review": "When I saw the game trailer, I loved the concept. Little did I know, that was all I was gonna get as far as gameplay goes. Most of the fun comes from exploring the house as a blind person and trying to unveil the story using the help of your cellphone apps; which was fun. Solving puzzles was also fun, but they were rare! The rest was mostly a walk/fetch quests and \"explore\".\n\nThe story was too vague for me to piece together; but maybe because English isn't my first language.\n\nThe game had technical issues and it was not patched for 2 months. I have encountered 2 crashes and a locked door. Every time something happens, I reload the game to fix it.\n\nOverall I give it a 5/10; its a mideocre horror game with fun explorations but lacks gameplay features.
