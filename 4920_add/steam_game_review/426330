I don't want to give anything away about the story so I will start with an analogy, *not* an actual example. Imagine you are asked by a story to choose your favorite beverage - water, cola, or liquor. You answer water, only to be told you would have preferred liquor and now you are sad because you wanted to get buzzed. I am? I did?\n\nAgain, trying not to give anything away about the game, but give an *actual* example of what I mean this time ... on my playthrough, the story severely broke down in the end. It was clear that the later elements of the story were written from the perspective of the character struggling against the crisis unfolding, even if your previous choices made it clear you did not view what was happening as a crisis. In other words, I had to choose the same option about six times in a row to get to the next page so the story could tell me how worried I was again, even though I had just chosen not to be worried. To paraphrase the responses ... \"It's terrible, you're distraught, you can't believe this happening. Now is the time to act!\" Why? I've told you six times I don't care. Next page please ... \"OK, but it's terrible, you're distraught, you can't believe this is happening.\" I can't? I have repeatedly told you to let it happen. Please just get on with it! \"OK, but you view your special item as your one hope to stop this terrible, terrible thing!\" No, I don't - get on with it! \"OK, but ...\" \n\nThe result of this defect is that for me, this title wasn't really choose *your* own adventure, more like choose *someone else's* adventure and be told how they feel about it. Therefore, I can't recommend this game based on my experience. I think the reason I don't find this defect in non-text-based games that feature choice is that there is no inner monologue to contradict how you personally feel about the choices. Just something to keep in mind, in case you are thinking of purchasing the game, but would be disappointed by such a disconnect should you deviate from the author's perspective. On the other hand, if you happen to agree with the viewpoint of the author, you would never notice the defect and might really love the story.", "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 35, "votes_down": 30, "author": {"steamid": "76561198013130865", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1450556088, "num_games_owned": 623, "playtime_forever": 177}}, {"timestamp_created": 1450686401, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640023", "timestamp_updated": 1450686698, "recommendationid": "19819800", "votes_up": 140, "review": "You\u00b4re appointed as new CEO of the leading firm for Hightech, Witchcraft and Extraterristic science.

If you're the kind of person that cares whether a game accomodates non-binary gender pronouns and the like then you'll find they've taken every measure for sensitivity's sake.  The power fantasy of running, lets be honest here Massive Dynamics from Fringe, is great fun.  \n\nThe Bad:  Unlike most of their games there appears to be one path to win, or at least a narrower set of them than the usual.    At points it becomes less-than-realistic.  There is way more randomness than many Choice of Games entries with your resources which are what determines how much you can do and thus how much you can make.  So a bit of bad luck or one bad decision quickly snowballs into an unwinnable playthrough.\n\nThe Bottom Line:  A great game, but not as superlatively awesome as others from this publisher.  The skill development system (which normally is a glorified decision tree system, if you've skilled up in a given area more than X times then you can sweet-talk the guard if not... he kicks your butt) is reused to provide more freeform options.  It's a shame that they never really go anywhere interesting with it because it boils down to \"have you checked enough boxes to win?\"  Relies a bit much on guessing, the results of actions are not always logically connected to the input: a fatal flaw in a text-based game like this!  This is especially apparent in the first act.  Also, a lot of threads like the Romance options seem shoehorned in so they can say \"has X romances!\" on the promo blurb and have no bearing on gameplay in a significant way.  In one playthrough I was gay, in the next a lesbian, and the lesbian romance option was slightly more fleshed out (ooh, controversial!) because they went on vacation with me.

This time out, you're thrust into the role of a CEO of a research company dabbling in making humans metahuman - sort of like superpower capitalism, except instead of being a superhero story, it is a cosmic horror story due to the price you have to pay for the research. Nice twist, that.\n\nUnfortunately, like some Choice of Games games, unless you choose a polarized approach and stick to it 95%, you're not getting a decent ending. This makes your first playthrough, the blind one, essentially poking at the game to see what major milestone mistakes you can make, and then prepare for a 'proper' run to see a specific storyline formed by taking a coherent approach.\n\nOn the one side, it's a good thing, since this allows multiple reruns of the same game while seeing tons of new non-repeating content. On the other side, like in imperfect gamebooks, you can clearly see where the tracks cross, like \"here's a dialogue option I would have picked if I picked THAT dialogue option two chapters ago... what I'm more interested in, is why there isn't a follow-up to the option I DID pick?\".\n\nThe game suffers a bit from what I like to call the \"Mass Effect Dialogue Issue\": sometimes, the options you are offered aren't 100% related to what your player character ultimately ends up doing, although it has a lot less issues with it than, say, Hero Project. It's also highly unclear at times whether a decision result is calculated based on your stats or RNGed, a traditional issue of Choice of Games games that messed up my enjoyment of Mecha Ace greatly.\n\nAll in all, yes, it's a nice addition to the collection and a worthy recommendation to anyone, especially since the corporate backstabbing angle is weirdly complemented by the cosmic horror setting, but if you had doubts about these games before, this one will not change your opinion in the slightest.\n\nAlso, if you don't mind me saying this, the ending feels somewhat rushed and disjointed due to the need to tell three outcomes as a singular story, since way more focus is given to what your shareholders think of you rather than what state you leave the world in or what your decisions or indecisions did to the various characters. Yes, this will make the next runthrough as a heartless embezzler easier to do, but also sort of undermines any intent to play a person with a stern moral compass, I'm afraid.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198023558710", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1459521842, "num_games_owned": 648, "playtime_forever": 129}}, {"timestamp_created": 1482696050, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500544", "timestamp_updated": 1482696050, "recommendationid": "28645750", "votes_up": 2, "review": "Great choose-your-own-adventure type book, and with replay value as well!
