To understand why it fails in this regard, one must inspect his super-ego via his geopolitical motivations. Notice, I described him as chaotic in action, but it was the systems of strangling bureaucracy and devaluation of Cybertronian life that was his call to power. Megatron seeks a particular brand of order that would see Cyberton united and lead to new conquests beyond the stars. The plot revolving around his haphazard use of \u201cDark Energon\u201d, knowing it would destroy all he works towards, belies what we should know about the character. Even beyond Megatron, Transformers: War for Cybertron really does not do justice for the complex cast of players in this game of death and despair.\n\nThe gameplay\u2019s aight."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506318225, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502678", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35196987", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152309575", "num_reviews": 53, "last_played": 1505684073, "num_games_owned": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 217}, "timestamp_updated": 1506318225, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I was a HUGE Transformers fan as a kid.
