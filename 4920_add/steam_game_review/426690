You can get two of them for free and they are also included here.\n\nWhat I liked: this is not a harem/waifu kind of story, nor is it an epic struggle of succeding against impossible odds, it is more about facing the inevitable and what kind of effects that has on the affected people and those who surround them. I loved the writing and it got to me in a lot of moments. My favorite arc is still the himeko arc. Just be aware, those are all sad stories. The soundtrack is completely worth it and takes me back to those scenes every time.\n\nWhat I didn't like: Only females have any voice acting as far as I've noticed and the art is nothing special.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197999902066", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1504229935, "num_games_owned": 184, "playtime_forever": 885}}, {"timestamp_created": 1501796998, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1501796998, "recommendationid": "34002705", "votes_up": 1, "review": "I'm not really into VN and for some reason i wanted to tried out one and this is the first come across.It took me unexpected and I got really into it..It all i could have wanted for.Got no regrets.\n\nGot no right word to express my feelings in this game.Great storyline and prefect soundtrack which add more feelings into the story.For all in my mind was its so nice yet in the sorrow and sad way.Give me mix emotion...countless of tears dropping.. and makes me more think abt life and death...and how little time one's may have.. or things had gone a little better just what if.....for all i can say it shows how sad when its come the time to facing the inevitable...10/10", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198059869890", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506594445, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 915}}], "success": 1}
