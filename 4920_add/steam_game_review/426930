On paper it sounds excellent and gladly in practise, it\u2019s superb fun!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qOKjFYV8LRU\n\nYour objective is to kill the guy inside your opponent\u2019s tanks.  This is done by first destroying the tank and then trying to shoot the ejected pilot before he can land back on a planet and respawn a new tank.  There's a variety of ways to die which keeps things fresh e.g. tank fire, bombs, being rammed by a fast flying tank, being off screen too long, impact to a planet/sun, etc.\n\nThere are a number of weapons at your disposal with more planned and it sounds like there may be possible load out choices in the future.\n\nMain things to consider currently is that the full early-access version is local multiplayer only, but the steam beta version which is easily accessible is online multiplayer.  This seems to be coming along really well and I've been playing games with friends with no problems at all.  I can't imagine it will be very long until online play is implemented into the full version.\n\nI had a previous concern about some of the weapons balancing and the developer has promptly addressed this issue.  Previously the siege mode a tank could turtle into was a bit overpowered meaning the game favoured the defensive player.  The developer has reduced some of the power of this mode and the game seems to now reward risk-taking again.  Great stuff!  \n\nThe game plays great with a controller and I believe they have designed the controls so that whether you play KB&M or controller there should be no distinct advantage.  So they've tried to balance things here too and apparently done a good job.\n\nThe physics are nice in the game.  Firing some shots requires either a mix of luck and judgement to account for the gravity pulls from nearby planets.  It's quite possible to actually kill yourself (I do it quite often!) if flying around space too fast and bombs receive a strong gravitational pull from a large planet!\n\nCheck out the video of the gameplay.  If this type of game is your type of thing I have no hesitation recommending buying it.  It's a very fair price and I'm very confident the game will only grow further during it's time in Early Access.\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 10, "author": {"steamid": "76561197996423236", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 81, "last_played": 1456823278, "num_games_owned": 2445, "playtime_forever": 286}}, {"timestamp_created": 1455009491, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510203", "timestamp_updated": 1455009491, "recommendationid": "21071660", "votes_up": 6, "review": "So this game has me all sorts of happy.

Mainly because there's no \"real\" online multiplayer, you can only play with people locally or online with those in your friends list - no lobby and no self-hosted games.\nIf you have 3 friends who want to play often, it could be fun, but for me I am too busy due to life/work, so I just want to jump into a match sometimes.\n\nTherefore I could just play a match against bots, which felt unsatisfying.\n\n\nOther problems imo:\n- controls feel a bit clunky sometimes, but are generally fine.\n\n- Not enough power ups & difference in weapons.\n\n- The automatic zoom is annoying and broken, manual zoom would be much better. Some user reported that he get's killed because the camera zoomed in and therefore he was out of the match area (which kills you after 3 sec).\n\n- No ability to rebind keys, set mouse-sensitivity etc.\n\n- Game menu controls are clunky.\n\n- No timer for your weapons, this is okay with the normal shot but when flying you want to know when you can shoot the carpet bomb to time your shot, which is important because of the gravity.\n\n- Only three maps, not enough variety in them. Could use more different scenery and interactive environmentals (like a black hole, nebula, shooting stars, ..?)\n\n- The sun mechanism is really cool, but feels unsatisfying graphic whise. It should look more fire like and less like a vector graphic.\n\n\nOther than that I have no complains, and I think if all this gets adressed, then this game could be a cool little multiplayer gem.\nPlus the team behind it seems to be very active in the discussion, which is a good sign.\n\nEdit: The developer said they are thinking about adding matchmaking.
