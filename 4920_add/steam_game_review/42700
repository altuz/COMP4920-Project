This Call of Duty has amazing Multiplayer, Zombies, and in the best story in Call Of Duty. Take's place in Cold War Era and Vietnam Era. With huge plot twists in the Campaign and meeting Renzov again in Vorkuta after the events of Call Of Duty World at War. The Campaign is amazing and is the best in my opinion. I would keep replaying since it's that good. It's the only Campaign I would replay all the time. The Multiplayer is great. Being able to put COD Points in Wager Matches (Not the COD Point system like Black Ops 3, that's shit) Being able to buy camos/weapon skins. Also the first Call of Duty to introduce Nuketown. The Zombies just gets better. 3 great maps to choose right away. Kino Der Toten, Five, Dead Ops Arcade. Then the DLC maps. Ascension, Call of the Dead, Shangri La, Moon. and the return of the World At War Zombies maps. Nacht Der Untoten, Verruckt, Shi No Numa, Der Riese. Most of the best Call Of Duty Zombie maps in one game. The Hardest Zombies out there also. This game is a solid 10/10 for me."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506618431, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35266478", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198248593524", "num_reviews": 56, "last_played": 1469388324, "num_games_owned": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 166}, "timestamp_updated": 1506618431, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A classic call of duty experience, my childhood game, still holds up today.
