I was so wrong!\n\n+ Solo campaign with nice and sometimes funny (I actually chuckled when saw card called Power Potato) storytelling\n+ Smooth gaming experience. Doesn't require much of learning (can figure out most if not all by trial-and-error)\n+ Card upgrades and other small, but neat extras\n\n- Visually game still looks like a social network's flash game or shitty mobile port\n- Design sometimes seem inconsistent (some characters look like drawn drunk, progress map heavily reminds of Kingdom Rush's) and plain boring. Templates?\n- Somewhat hard to tell what card exatcly will do (probably subjective - not a fan of this type of games), therefore unintentional fuck ups are almost guaranteed\n- Lack of sounds, voiced dialogues and quality music\n\nObviously the game tries to cut some share from Hearthstone's success and at some point it does that very well (campaign, upgrades).", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 1, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561197988593254", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 1478379916, "num_games_owned": 494, "playtime_forever": 737}}, {"timestamp_created": 1484684504, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505694", "timestamp_updated": 1484684504, "recommendationid": "29323741", "votes_up": 2, "review": "I really wanted to like this game\nbut early on, long before you even get to the chapter that allows \nupgrading cards, you're pitted against impossible situations that\nearllier level cards can't defeat.
