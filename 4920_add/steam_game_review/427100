Some textures are really low detail.\n\nSound is decent; nothing much that you can expect, beside engine noise and other effects.\n\nThe bus drive decently, it is not a full sim; and matter not that the game support spring physics. There is some parallel wth how a big rig should drive, but you can tell that it is not a full simulation. Pushable controls are nice, although you need to get in a specific view to interact with them; so can't drive and push controls, unless you have them mapped to keyboard.\n\nThe gameplay could be interesting if the AI of the cars would be decent; instead you get stuck in neverending jams because AI is so atrocious that does not find a way to avoid other cars or back up. This was OK 10 years ago, not today. Also you can run over red lights with no penalty. There is no damage to the bus to repair, so you can go offroad or on sidewalks, withouth any penalty. \nThe progression in career mode is not affected by mistakes; you get few penalties on the xp, but it is usually 1-3 points per infraction, against hundreds of points you gain for reaching the stops. If you are late, no big deal, same if you run red light, speed cameras, hit other cars, drive like a maniac.\n\nThe idea of getting out of the bus is nice, but all you do is to check ONE BY ONE the passengers, and either they have the right ticket, wrong ticket or no ticket at all; they interaction is close to 0, and simply disappear; like Train simulator,  instead than hopping on the bus. Beside fueling and check tickets, there is no other gameplay for the first person part; nice to add it but if there is nothing to do with it...\n\nAnd in one year that this game has been released, some serious bugs are still there since launch; the devs seems interested in DLC and new games, instead than fixing this, so it is disappointing to see such behavior, when some serious issues still persist.\n\nI can't suggest this game, until bugs are fixed and AI improved radically, The only nice thing is the bus, with clickable elements, but if the rest of the game is sub par, there is no incentive in playing it.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561197967524117", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "last_played": 1505026015, "num_games_owned": 108, "playtime_forever": 99}}, {"timestamp_created": 1505226678, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503648", "timestamp_updated": 1505226678, "recommendationid": "34902337", "votes_up": 3, "review": "Game had been working as best as it could.

I saw reviews here on Steam about bad AI and stuff like that I must say I enjoy playing this game. Driving bus with my Logitech G25 is just what I was looking for. It was easy to setup, graphics are nice hopefuly in future we will get more maps, buses and companies implemented in game. So far is good but there is still place to improve.

I have played this game now for about 11hrs now and like many people you need to spend some time setting things up. Steering I hear people struggle with but I set mine up with really no issues. I'm using the THRUSTMASTER T150 racing wheel which i have been using with ETS2/ATS. If you want this sim and you want to use a steering wheel you're going to need to set it up. Click here for an easy way https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZMFTNGN-gQ\n\nAlso the graphics, I had a few issues. When I first load up the game everything was on EPIC. My PC is kinda mid-spec and runs games like DIRT RALLY no problem, and should run this game no problem but it struggled lagging big time. I basically turned everything to MED with a few on HIGH and now its perfect and graphics are still great, no lagging issues and nothing suffered gameplay wise. I must of spent around 2hrs messing around with all the graphic settings getting the game to run and look good.\n\nOnce all set and I was happy i'm now having a lot of fun with this game. Still it has so so so much potential even so to be on par with ETS2/ATS. I know Fernbus is now a year old and had a lot issues to begin with it is now getting better. Still like I said the AI is one thing that needs massive attentionMASSIVE ATTENTION. Still loads of updates to come as well as DLCs like Swiss-Austria and France. Usedom will be a free DLC and a Bundesliga DLC which all sounds great. \n\nI recommend this game highly and take the setting up with a pinch of salt.
