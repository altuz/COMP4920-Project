They left the game in it's original state and it plays like the xbox 360 version. If you haven't played Dead Rising One lemme break it down, this game is not for everyone. You can mess around in a mall all day but if you want to play the story, it takes an amount of fitting in fun with work in a challenging way. There is a time limit, but in my opinion I think it's a quirky mechanic that allows the Dead Rising Franchise to stand out. Every mission you complete gives a sense of pride and fullfillment due to the fact that the time limit creates tension. Survivor AI is extremely stupid so I suggest you do one run that you ignore the story and have fun, and the other playing the story. Really if you want a unique zombie game this is for you. The Bosses are one of the biggest highlights and you always hear people talking about em.
