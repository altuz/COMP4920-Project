I came back for the first time in more than 6 months today and it really is something special among VR games. The polish is there, the user friendliness is there. The only complaint I could make is how often the huge number of objects in strategy mode forces the game into reprojection, but maybe that just means I need to upgrade. Some big-ticket games are twice this price for half the fun. There is also no risk for motion sickness and little dependance on manual dexterity, which makes this game a no brainer for every single VR owner.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198002871405", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "last_played": 1501136689, "num_games_owned": 455, "playtime_forever": 334}}, {"timestamp_created": 1504378368, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500155", "timestamp_updated": 1504378368, "recommendationid": "34692632", "votes_up": 1, "review": "The most polished game on SteamVR, IMO.
