However it isn't the same as the first two were in the level of engagement and interest. It crashed out a few times and the windowed loading screens just seemed odd considering the first two titles were smooth playing and great looking games. At this time I cannot recommend it. Its by no means a bad title just not what I expected after playing OMD and OMD2.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198017534950", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1501815014, "num_games_owned": 93, "playtime_forever": 68}}], "success": 1}
