Why?\n\n1. Because I won 2 elections in a row, during my first 2hours playing this game.\n2. Because you can only be the good guy, helping woman, eliminate criminal, improving education, etc.\nThat's very not Africa. The country where I come from is famous for corruption, money laundring, bribe. etc.\nWhich you can't do in this game. As a president of a thirld world country, you should think about your stomach first, and the people second.\n\n3. You are not able to amass a huge sum of money either from corruption, taxes, fake projects, etc. and use it to rig / bribe for the next election. You should also be able to \"sell\" some ministrial office/chair to super-power country like the USA/China. Why? Because that's how the real thirld world works. In return, we can protect American oil/mining company by putting our military in the premises or clearing and killing several villagers to open a new mining pit for the American.\n\n4. This game also prevent you from teaching propaganda and false education to control the people.\n\n5. Most annoyingly, this game is only about making a good policy.\nYou don't have to worry about some criminal boss killing you for not letting the importation of illegal drugs or pirating activities, you can't rape and kidnap the wife of any political faction leaders, heck YOU CAN'T EVEN kill your own people??!\n\n6. THIS GAME will make you a feminist trying to save humanity and protect WOMAN RIGHTS in the heart of Afrika.\nSERIOUSLY???!! WHO DOES THAT IN THE REAL WORLD?? THIS IS NOT A FRIGGIN NETHERLANDS!\nPeople are starving here and you throw money to save woman?\n\nWell anyway, at the end of the day.\nSince we do not have superpower country to satisfy, crime lord to be protected, and military coupe 'de 'etat to be worried about. This game is a piece of cake. Check my achivement, I won this game 2 times in less than 2 hours.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nIf you want to save woman and motorist in Afrika, Yes.\nIf you want to know how stupid is the first world country game developer making a game about a third world country, Yes.\n\nIf you want to be the next Supreme Leader of Peace Loving Country of Wadiya, No.\nIf you want to be the next General Khadaffi, No.\nIf you want to working on developing nuclear weapons to attack Israel, BIG NO.\n\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 4, "votes_down": 6, "author": {"steamid": "76561198090339123", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1501211694, "num_games_owned": 66, "playtime_forever": 420}}], "success": 1}
