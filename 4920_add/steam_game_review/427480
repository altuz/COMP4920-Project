I couldn\u2019t change the board configuration. Think like the color of the squares or the kind of chess pieces I wanted to use. I couldn\u2019t load any of the 3D boards. I tried to get a refund, I haven\u2019t received one yet. I\u2019ve contacted the people over at ChessBase. They have told me if I don\u2019t receive the refund that they send me access to a download to their website. When you install the game on steam it will give you an activation code. Make sure you save that right it in a notepad file. In my case they completely remove Fritz off my games list but I\u2019ve received no refund from Steam. I\u2019ll update this review if I do. Until Steam fixes this issue my recommendation is NOT TO BUY this from steam. Just go to ChessBase or another site that sells the program. I can tell you that the customer service over at ChessBase is much better. Their fixing the problem and they didn\u2019t even sell me the game. That tells you a lot about the customer service of steam. Another company willing to make up for another company\u2019s lake of customer service. So, if you want this program don\u2019t buy it here. If I recieve a refund I'll let you guys know.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198031566076", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1499050670, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_forever": 497}}, {"timestamp_created": 1501002011, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_updated": 1501002076, "recommendationid": "33790387", "votes_up": 2, "review": "Fritz is great for analysing games only and perhaps pitting chess engines against each other and running deep chess analyses overnight. Chessbase 14 is for managing all of your games and also building your knowledge without killing your processor with long calculations.\n\nIf you are interested in buying Frtiz , please do some due dilgence and research on Fritz before buying, I personally believe that FritzChess 15 should NOT be used by those new to chess or beginners.  This is very important and really should have been included in the game's description.\n\nIf you are serious about learning chess, please invest in Chessbase 14 along with the Chessbase membership AND be forewarned that you will need to spend additional funds for training that can purchased through the Chessbase shop  (which are are very good and recommended). The membership also has many perks that are totally worth the money.\n\nIf you still prefer to only use Fritz, I do recommend it for its purposes, but please have the right expections before you buy.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197997033722", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3249, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1507159129, "num_games_owned": 59, "playtime_forever": 44766}}, {"timestamp_created": 1500094990, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502322", "timestamp_updated": 1500094990, "recommendationid": "33551561", "votes_up": 1, "review": "The interface in this game is just terrible.
