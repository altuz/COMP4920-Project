The hidden-object scenes are easy but plentiful.\n\nThe big disappointment, however, is the point-and-click adventuring: it's illogical and even idiotic. At one point I had to melt ice and was carrying a magical staff that could melt it ... but, no, I was not allowed to use this staff and had to find a magnifying glass instead. At another point, I tried to take one item, and got a message telling me that I shouldn't take it before finding out if it belongs to someone. Uhm, taking stuff is exactly what what I've been doing the whole game until then! A hermit asks me for a \u201crare plant\u201d that I immediately see growing right outside his house. Early on I think I found 5 axes in a row, and kept using them only to find new ones to use again. Can't our protagonist just keep the axe? Or how about thinking of a puzzle that requires a new kind of item? Too many puzzles involve an item being stuck and you have to pry it out. One of the hidden objects -- I kid you not -- is a \u201creset icon.\u201d Etc. etc. It's just insulting.\n\nFinally, the story: the Tibetan flavor seems to be window dressing only. The legend of Shangri-La seems quite Westernized, the main and even most side characters are all Western, and in any case nothing of the history and religion of Tibet gets involved. I even think one of the puzzles involved Meso-American runes!\n\nSo, though the gameplay is generally OK, I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down. You hired excellent graphic artists, why not hire some capable writers, too? Or at least insist that they don't smoke up while on the job?\n\nStill, thank you, devs, for supporting Linux!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 3, "votes_down": 8, "author": {"steamid": "76561197969267147", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 181, "last_played": 1460257061, "num_games_owned": 5296, "playtime_forever": 397}}, {"timestamp_created": 1472246359, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528279", "timestamp_updated": 1472257329, "recommendationid": "25169248", "votes_up": 16, "review": "OK I promised to write a review once I stopped laughing.  Why does this game make me laugh so hard - all the out of place and out of time items throughout the game and in the Hidden Object scenes. (Too many to mention)  Please Brave Giant (developers) this is the age of the internet, your research and development team and quality control team simply could not find enough items of Tibetan origin?  From the 1920s?  Tibet is an ancient culture, heavily influenced by repetitive Chinese invasion and Buddahism, but still a culture completely its own.  So where are the prayer wheels? There is not a single prayer wheel anywhere in this Tibetan Quest.  The icing on the cake, however, the most out of place thing in the entire game had to be the Komodo dragon.  Seriously?  Komodo dragons live on a few remote islands in the TROPICS, are longer then people are tall, and WILL EAT YOU for lunch without warning.  How could it possibly stay alive in the Himalaya Mountains in sub-zero weather?  At least I did not have to feed it bread to make it go away or that would have made this game beyond dumb. \n\nEnough kvetching about out of place/time objects - Storyline: Late 1920s. Larisa and her boyfriend leave for an archealogical mission in Tibet.  Time goes by and the aunt does not hear from her niece.  Instead she (the aunt, you as the player) receives word from Tibet Consul her niece and company have gone missing.  Off to Tibet she goes to find her niece.\n\nGameplay:  Fairly standard storyline. Beautiful, detailed, colorful artwork - the water is absolutely sublime.  The cut scenes short and long are worth watching.  There is a fast travel map, but not really needed.  The game is very linear and is completed by areas of possibly 4-5 locations each area.  \n\nPoint and click, find and use inventory and hidden object scenes.  The logic of the inventory items for certain tasks is highly debatable.  In one case a pointed seashell is used to chip out a \"granite\" rock yet in another case a pickaxe is needed to break \"granite\" rock.  This happens frequently so be creative and try everything, it might work.  Other then that the gameplay is fairly simple and easy to figure out. Very linear even in the point and click inventory - nothing gets held over from area to area.\n\nHidden object scenes are fast, simple and easy.  However there is an object or three that are just a bit more well hidden so will take a little longer to find.  Nothing unfairly hidden, just so many out of place and out of time objects it is amusing. \n\nThere are the standard extras (concept art, cutsceens, music), and a very short bonus chapter which is basically an epilogue.  There are four extra hidden finds throughout the game and can be accessed directly from the game menu.  Plus the finale is a Boss Battle with the dragon.     \n\nIn conclusion, family friendly, fun, relatively easy, hidden object with a DRAGON (who can go wrong with a dragon even if it is chasing you).  As for price: the game itself - full price, all the out of time/place distractions - look for a sale", "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 3, "votes_down": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198141404871", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 119, "last_played": 1471488906, "num_games_owned": 596, "playtime_forever": 425}}, {"timestamp_created": 1460358189, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522373", "timestamp_updated": 1460358189, "recommendationid": "22353050", "votes_up": 18, "review": "Your niece Larissa embarked on a journey to the mythical Shangri-La, however, her party goes missing during a snowstorm. Not caring at all for your life, you follow her footsteps to rescue her...\n\nThat's the plot of the game: as usual, Artifex Mundi knows to choose the games with interesting stories. I really liked the beginning, though the ending was a little less well-written: it cuts abruptly and it's clear that it needs at least some more explanations or a sequel. Also, I'm wondering how the heroin, which must middle-aged and with a lot of money, ended up with nothing to advance a little more faster and fly a plane. It means that she was at least an adventurer in her youth.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty standard: find items, solve puzzles, clear hidden objects scenes (list or shaped). There is a little minor problem: the balance between the list of words and the list of shapes isn't great as you have more of the former than the latter. The puzzles are as usual easy to finish. You even have some passages (like the repair of the plane) where you're guided step-by-step and where you'll need to use objects you found earlier (or that you will find after when you can't advance anymore). You have also a game of mahjong (not really developped as there are only 2 or 3 different patterns and you can't be stuck, as it's shuffling automatically) if you don't want to play the hidden object scenes.\n\nHowever, some actions aren't making sense: I've a staff that can melt ice and I need a magnifying glass at one moment for that specific act. Or also, a giant lizard is blocking the way and you have a sleeping potion in your inventory. My first move was to give it to it. Well, no. I needed to give it first a rake, so that I can get a pole, then use it as an harpoon to get a fish and to give it to the animal. And the sleeping potion. Well, apparently, it's better to use it on a spider than on the lizard...\n\nWhile I loved the graphics and the beauty of the temples or of the mountain, there are two problems: I didn't like how the characters were animated. It's not fitting really well with the rest of the game and besides, I don't know why the faces were weird. The second little minor problem is probably how the developers are seeing Tibet as I was more under the impression to be in another province of China than Tibet itself. Besides, given the era where the story is set, I don't think that Tibet was already ruled by China at that moment. I suppose that they let their imagination (and their own view/stereotypes) instead of using a little more documentation and to avoid some clich\u00e9s.\n\nI liked the soundtrack, that's a real strong point here. It was very enjoyable all along and fitting to the ambiance.\n\nTibetan Quest isn't perhaps the best in terms of gameplay but I've been hooked into that magical world (even if it's not really Tibetan in itself). I liked it a lot. As usual, Artifex Mundi chose well. However, the next time, if they can at least choose a game with a better ending or publish the first The Secret Order and the others Vampire Legends if they managed to get the rights for Steam, I would be very happy.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 4, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971532357", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 352, "last_played": 1460154530, "num_games_owned": 2214, "playtime_forever": 321}}, {"timestamp_created": 1460192614, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519761", "timestamp_updated": 1460201965, "recommendationid": "22314870", "votes_up": 16, "review": "Why doesn't Steam have a 'neutral' voting option? This game has points going for it and then it has also quite a few against it. Overall I really can't say that I disliked it, but that's about as positive as I feel about it.\n\nThe presentation is good. The graphics are colourful and well done, the animations are awkward as in most hidden object games, the music is nice and the voice acting isn't awful. Some locations feel 'shoehorned' into the Tibetian setting though, but overall it doesn't break the immersion.\n\nThere are quite a few hidden object scenes, so if you like those this game is definately for you. The inventory puzzles are rather weak with quite a few feeling really forced. A few examples: You have a magical staff that can shoot fire, but in order to melt some block of ice you have to use a magnifying glass. There is a huge lizard blocking your way and you have a bucket full of sleeping potion, but you rather use the bucket of sleeping potion on the ground under a spider in order to make the spider fall asleep. You need to put a lantern next to a rock and use a flint to light it up even if there are lit candles very near. The list goes on and it really gets on your nerves after a while. The minigames aren't bad, but they are either really easy (match the shape/colour) or quite difficult.\n\nOverall the game offers a couple of hours of hidden object game play, but if you are more into casual adventures that make at least some sense then this game might disappoint you. Certainly one of the weaker Artifex Mundi games and I can only recommend it in a sale or a bundle.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 3, "author": {"steamid": "76561198108852006", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 206, "last_played": 1460200916, "num_games_owned": 7606, "playtime_forever": 635}}, {"timestamp_created": 1460166149, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521561", "timestamp_updated": 1460166149, "recommendationid": "22310290", "votes_up": 15, "review": "What can I say. This game had me gripped from start to finish. So much so, I ended up playing it through twice which I like to do for most HOG games.

There are alot of hidden object scenes which I don't mind at all but I would prefer there to be not so many in the game. That said, they fitted in perfectly with the puzzles and this balanced it all out for me. The only drawback I have with the game is the lack of people and voice acting.

Artifex Mundi always have a variety of interesting puzzles in their games and although they can't take all the credit as only being publishers of this game, you could see that they put their stamp on it. \n\nA very enjoyable game which is very good value for the price with it being a collector's edition.
