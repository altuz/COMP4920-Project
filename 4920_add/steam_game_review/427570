If you want something different than a Master of Orion clone, give this game a shot. Its pretty polished and tons of fun. I am not sure why the other reviews consider this game to be full of mediocrity gameplay mechanics. While this game is no Stellaris or Endless, it does rank in the top 5 space 4x games released in the past 5 years.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198026567839", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1492327436, "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_forever": 183}}], "success": 1}
