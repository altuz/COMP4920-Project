At the beginning you have two towers at your disposal, one shoots rockets but without any area damage. Their targeting is bonkers, they don't target the nearest enemy and let some through. There are no keyboard shortcuts and the icons are unclear. I sold towers because I thought an icon meant \"upgrade\".\n\nMaybe it gets better later but time is short and there are so many games in the backlog.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561198032768860", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "last_played": 1502112268, "num_games_owned": 534, "playtime_forever": 8}}], "success": 1}
