So, that's not really a good start, since failure doesn't really do much. \n\nHonestly, there isn't really much of a story or even humor or anything I could tell. You just did the tutorial and had the attack with the kidnappings, then you're off. The dialogue from there is just, you need to flip a switch and there is the kidnapped person. You get a tiny bit at the end, but eh.\n\nYou can't turn an shoot and that gets kind of awkward, but it works fine for the most part. There really isn't any reason to not shoot since you can hit targets off screen, but you can blow past important information that springs up.  I'll put it here since I mentioned it. If you are being talked to, you can still be attacked, so fun times. \n\nPowers are pretty bland. Most of the damage moves don't really need to be there since they come out pretty slow or you would better be suited to saving that energy for something else, like flying. The rest do what they need to, which one at the end kinda defeats the point of a large amount they expected you to use at the time. \n\nThis game has a bunch of bugs, whether its getting stuck going up stairs to the game spawning you in the floor after dying, at least for me at the final area. \n\nThe camera is a huge pain in the ass in the game, which if you aren't spamming your weapon, usually results in cheapshots or possible instant death when they start putting lasers just beyond the reach of the camera. \n\nThe stages don't really feel all that well put together, it feels so blah going through the areas, especially with the limited amount of reused enemies and no real good reason to explore, as far as I could tell. You just keep walking by or doing what you have to and the stage just keeps going and going.  \n\nBosses tend to be a bit dumb. Some have gimmicky ways to kill you off in one hit, which, since there isn't much of a punishment, doesn't matter too much. Usually though, you can just run behind the target and smash the fire button till your finger flies off, with no real challenge. I liked the concept of the final boss, but it falls really flat once you realize one of the abilities trumps the other ones the game wants you to use. \n\nOh, almost forgot to mention, the hitboxes, ya. Just a tad bit off, alot.  Usually coming from the bigger enemies. \n\nOverall, it was a generally dull experience. I found some items that might do something interesting, but really don't want to fully explore the levels again to just get a slight more meh. \n\nWouldn't recommend it.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 1, "author": {"steamid": "76561197966489900", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1462546483, "num_games_owned": 1259, "playtime_forever": 147}}, {"timestamp_created": 1461935896, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501739", "timestamp_updated": 1461935896, "recommendationid": "22704177", "votes_up": 7, "review": "More Mega Man than a metroidvania.

I've never read the book. However, I do plan on doing so soon. Now, back to the game. At a first glance, the game looks like a normal game. But, it is in early access. So that means that there is bound to be much more improvement in the future. I have not played a whole lot of the game, but from my experience, the game is relatively good as is. That leads me to my ups and downs.\n\nUps:\n* Features a character selection, you can choose either Emily or Alex\n* Has a unique power up system, with lots of variation\n* Includes character dialogue, offering hints, which you can't find in some games, making it very difficult to achieve victory in a level, per se. \n* Offers a tutorial level, explaining powerups, enemies, movements, Etc.\n* Has a weekly update to improve bugs, glitches and other pesky 'things'\n\nAnd now, I will talk about some of the downs..\n\nDowns:\n* Limited settings\n* Can be quite glitchy at times\n* Has no save/ checkpoint feature\n* Although you can choose a character, you cannot customize them, like purchase hats, or shirts, Etc.\n\nOther than that though, It is safe to say that this game has loads of potential (In my opinion, of course). Bugs can be fixed, features can be added, and besides, it is early access. It is evident that a lot of thought and work had/ will go into this game. And even though I am cheating, and playing before reading *ding*, the game is quite enjoyable. And I bet more understandable once I read the book. Either way. Your dev. crew should give themselves a pat on the back, because they have earned it, and so have you, Jeremy (If you even read this)! I look forward to playing more of this amazing game!!\n\n\n*Completely unrelated not to Jeremy*\nIf you do in fact read this, I will feel like a Starwars prequel getting a mere 500 sins. I think that you are doing fantastic at CinemaSins, and I also enjoy watching your videos on CinemaSins Jeremy and also MusicVideoSins. Anyway, you are doing a great job. Can't wait to read your book!\n\n-tylerdataco", "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 2, "votes_down": 8, "author": {"steamid": "76561198132327508", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1450564777, "num_games_owned": 74, "playtime_forever": 25}}, {"timestamp_created": 1451422352, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493532", "timestamp_updated": 1451422352, "recommendationid": "20081570", "votes_up": 2, "review": "I am a big fan of Jeremy's work. I really enjoyed the book, so when I first learned about this game, I knew I was going to buy it. These are my unbiased thoughts of the game so far.\n\nPros:\n- Good looking graphics, somewhat reminiscent of Mega Man games.\n- Beautiful background music.\n- The gameplay works well, starting off fairly easy, then sending you into a real challenge quickly.\n- The boss fights are a nice challenge, taking me a few tries to beat them.\n- A wide variety of powers at your character's disposal.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of customization for characters.\n- Only half of the levels are currently available.\n- You can't control where the fireballs go. There are times where you want to hit a certain enemy, but they will go after a different one.\n- The hand blasters can only fire directly in front of you. I wish you could control the direction in which you fire like you do with the laser eyes.\n- I never like it when enemies in a game follow a pattern, preferring that they react to the player. Some of them do that, but a good chunk of them don't.\n- During the boss fight in the Beach Cave, there is a point where it's impossible to avoid taking damage, that being after he summons the mini Supernovas then uses his powers to fly to the other platform at the top of the screen.\n- During the Transportation Center level, the difficulty seems to suddenly spike too high out of nowhere.\n- Also during this level, the game will start lagging when a lot of enemies spawn at once.\n- As you're entering the boss fight of this level, there is a glitch where sometimes the screen will leave without you, automatically killing you.\n\nSins:\n- What's the point in having super strength as an optional power if punching becomes obsolete once you obtain the hand  blasters? There should be a way to switch between blasting and punching.\n- During the first level, why is it that none of the other students are doing anything? Why do they just stand there until they see me, then give me their powers so I can do all the work?\n- Where were the teachers during all of this?\n- During the Downtown level, why is the player running in the middle of the street instead of on the sidewalk? They could avoid the cars a whole lot easier this way instead of jumping over them.\n- Game does not contain a lap dance.\n\nOverall thoughts:\nThis game has a lot of potential. At only $9.99 (though I bought it during the holiday sale) it is a definite purchase. It does have quite a few problems that need to be fixed, but I'm sure that once they are, this game will be all the more enjoyable.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 4, "votes_down": 5, "author": {"steamid": "76561198266257834", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1469679525, "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_forever": 281}}, {"timestamp_created": 1455577915, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499520", "timestamp_updated": 1455577915, "recommendationid": "21241414", "votes_up": 1, "review": "A fun game based on the book The Ables.
