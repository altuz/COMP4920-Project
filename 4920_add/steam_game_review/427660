As a big fan of the Clock Tower series I had to play this game no matter how bad the reviews were. Let me put it this way: I am overjoyed and very grateful that the creators are playing around with the series again BUT I really wish they had put a bit more effort into this. Allow me to explain: my biggest complaint is the crashes. I have a gaming desktop so this game shouldn't be a problem for it.  But boy did it crash. Not every single time. But quite often and at the worst times (like in the middle of a chase).  That aside, the characters movements were... Interesting. I applaud the creators for making each character model unique and organic looking (as in not all characters look the same with different hair and eyes).  But when it came to the Faithful, the character models looked like early Rockstar material.  The storyline was subpar for a Clock Tower game. Not even interesting enough to make me want to finish playing despite being minutes from finishing. To sum up all my feelings about this one let me say this-- what makes this game a no for me is ultimately the fact that the story just wasn't interesting. As a lover of old PC games from the FMV era even, the graphics were not a deal breaker in the slightest, but the lackluster storyline? Yeah, you betcha. All that being said, I implore the creators to try again and make a remake of the original games, ir some kind of sequel or prequel that honors the feeling of uneasiness the old games provoked.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 0, "votes_down": 2, "author": {"steamid": "76561198138526753", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1500319185, "num_games_owned": 43, "playtime_forever": 516}}, {"timestamp_created": 1499469909, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494262", "timestamp_updated": 1499469909, "recommendationid": "33357426", "votes_up": 10, "review": "Ok, for starters let\u00b4s get to the point, this game sucks, really sucks, sucks like the protagonist, sucks life like a leech and sucks your soul, the movement is horrible and the game is a complete waste of time, if you want to torture someone with a game, well you can use Nightcry, I\u00b4m amazed they made Clock Tower and then they created this shitty game that looks like something from 2000, is buggy, is broken, is bad, bad as my ex mother in law.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "votes_funny": 6, "votes_down": 10, "author": {"steamid": "76561198039926018", "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1499810081, "num_games_owned": 647, "playtime_forever": 299}}], "success": 1}
