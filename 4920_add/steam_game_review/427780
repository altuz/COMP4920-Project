I really really really wanted to like it.\nI love the concept of rotating objects to reveal the shapes. \nHowever, this game falls way short.\n\nIt feels like something someone made in Blender. Transitions are low resolution, plastic-looking, and low-framerate.\nThe levels range from super-easy, to \"are you freaking kidding me?\" with no coherent progression. (Easy levels and hard levels are all thrown together in no order)\n\nThe \"story\" is cringe-worthy. Sure, I want to know what happens next, but the voice-over feels strained. The levels often feel like the end-object was arbitrariarly chosen just so it could fit with the story. But worse, at times it feels like the story arbitrarily bends itself just to justify whatever the object was. It makes no sense.\n\nSome levels are so incredibly \"unfair\", it seems like it's by-design how unfair they are.\nOh, but luckily there's a hint system. \nClick the hint button, and it'll show you the shadow of the object that you're looking for. \nNot enough? Click the hint button again, to get a sort of \"radar\" color, that will change to green as you get closer to the target shape. \nThat sounds lovely. \nEXCEPT for the fact that you're only given 10-hints to start with. OH, maybe they give you more hints after solving a level on your own? NO! \nOnce you use up the 10-hints, your only option next is to BUY MORE hints. \nSeriously? I already bought the game, and I cannot continue because I can't figure out this obtuse, intentionally frustrating level, because I don't have enough hints, and I must pay more to continue? \nSkip. That.\n\nNot to mention that the entire interface looks like it was designed for touch-screen. (Including some early on-screen prompts).\n\nAnd there are ADVERTISEMENTS in the game directing you to their website for other (mobile) games.\nOn top of the in-app purchases, in a game I already spent money to buy? \n\nI'm done with this game.. I wanted to enjoy it so much. But there's no love here.\nSuch a shame.\n\nIf you read this far, you really should check out \"SHADOWMATIC\", which is available for iPhone/iPad. \nI guarantee that you'll like it more than \"perfect angle\"", "comment_count": "6", "author": {"num_games_owned": 5393, "steamid": "76561197993156502", "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 114, "last_played": 1450928323}, "recommendationid": "19895908", "votes_down": 23, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.575678", "votes_up": 70, "timestamp_updated": 1450929140}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1450962053, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Pro:\nHard puzzles..sometimes.\n\n\nCon:\nUnskippable narrative after each puzzle.\nPoorly made jumpscenes.\nRepetitive puzzles.\nIrritating puhing messages about hint system when all I want to do is to find the solution.

First of all they developers decided to embed the puzzles into a narated story that slowly unfolds when you succesfully solve the puzzles. We've seen how this good can work when it's done right from games like Portal 2 and the TALOS principle. But the execution in this game fails. The connection between the puzzles and the story is weak, objects you've discovered are often shoehorned into the story. But even worse the story is narrated by the most dull and emotionless voice I've ever heard in a game. The accompanying stills are amateurish at best and do not help to draw you into the story. The other problem I have is with microtransitions. You actually have to buy clues to help solve the puzzles when you're stuck. A recent update will give you a free clue every five minutes (if you're at zero clues) but since most puzzles have no title (until after you've solved them) are not linked together by theme and also have no visual clues you're bound to get stumped every ten puzzles or so. I don't mind paying for DLC that adds new puzzles to an existing game (I recently bought the DLC for the TALOS principle) but paying for something that would otherwise be free leaves a bad taste in my mouth. \nWith a better told story (both in story telling and in voice acting) and more natural clues for the puzzles (by linking them by theme, giving a clue in the name of the puzzle and/or by giving subtle visual clues) this could be a pretty good puzzle game. In it's current form however the negatives outweigh the positives.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 3097, "steamid": "76561198017392185", "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 117, "last_played": 1452467514}, "recommendationid": "20466552", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506018", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1452510715}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1451016619, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Was hopeful on a brand new game - took a chance for under $10, but it just didn't play very well.

Ultimately the player needs to understand more than the mechanic of the game/level.  They also should understand the goal of each level and game.  Now in no way do I think this means giving the player the answer*.  The player should be able to deduce what it is they are looking for.  The game is broken into these \"series\" and (I feel) these seires should have puzzles that flow together to form a \"theme\".... And they sort of almost acomplish this.  But I am still at a loss in each puzzle what I am looking for.\n\nFor example.  In one puzzle I end up making what appears to be a \"Chess Pawn\" and the next level I ended up with a comb.  Now it turns out that the \"Chess pawn\" was supposed to be hand soap on the guys Bathroom Sink.  But this idea and theme was not communicated till all the objects had been found. \n\nWays to fix this.  The backgrounds instead of being used as advertisment space** should be used to help descibe the theme.  For the scenario above the backgrounds could have taken place in a large bathroom(s) with the broken pieces scattered in different bathroom looking backgrounds.  This makes me think What might I find in a bathroom and work from there. \n\nThis allows the player to feel acomplished and know what they are looking for.  There were several puzzles (Especially the seahorse one) where I had no idea what I was looking for until the game said (unexptedly) I had the solution and showed me what I got.\n\nTLDR: In short A player in a puzzle game should never be surprized that they got an answer.  This does not leed to a feeling of acomplishment but stupidity and shame. \n\nThat being said Nice Graphics\nNice Controls\n\n*(You can BUY \"hints\" to do tell you what you are looking for 'Cough microtransactions on a paid game Cough' but this isn't what my complaint is about)\n** Oh Yea that too", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 283, "steamid": "76561197992800920", "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1466200590}, "recommendationid": "23621860", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1466201632}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499061005, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Very good game.
