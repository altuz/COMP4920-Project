When you start playing, there's nothing much beyond the Hitman theme to really grab your attention - the static scenes are way alien to the vibrant visuals of the Hitman games, the puzzles are all rather easy, and as a legacy of the game's mobile origins, the click-and-drag control method is a bit annoying.\n15-20 minutes into the game, however, it all changes gradually. You start to appreciate the expertly crafted 3D game boards (one level - one board), the excellent sounds, and may even forget about the controls. As you progress, the game keeps adding new mechanics (as it should), and while the basic level objectives are rarely difficult, many additional objectives are decent head scratchers. \nAltogether, Hitman GO is a very pleasant 100+ level romp through a static but very atmospheric Hitman universe, where you only need your logic skills for successful takedowns. Certainly recommended.\n", "comment_count": "5", "author": {"num_games_owned": 807, "steamid": "76561197991465987", "playtime_forever": 549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 549, "num_reviews": 73, "last_played": 1506968373}, "recommendationid": "35426411", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506971355}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505708579, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "The puzzle seems fairly simple and mainly consist of running back and forth a requisite number of times for the moving people to line up correctly so you can move to the objective.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 189, "steamid": "76561197997161318", "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1505708513}, "recommendationid": "35038707", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.487991", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505708579}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 36, "total_positive": 182, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 218}}
