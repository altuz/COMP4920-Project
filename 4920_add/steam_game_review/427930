It was a fun little story about a person (pick your gender) who happens to be a half breed of the old gods from Lovecraftian lore that needs to amass an army to destroy Innsmouth. However this game does it in a Visual Novel type presentation that also happens to be an RPG, cause you have a few stats here and there that affect the game. Also there are multiple branching paths you can take depending on your choices throughout the game. You can tell a lot of time and thought was put into the design of the overall product and how it functions. Also the humor reminds me a lot of the sarcastic, trope ignoring, 4th wall breaking, pop culture referencing, snarky humor you'd find in a game like The Bard's Tale, and I enjoyed that quite a bit actually. It's what kept me playing to the end. \n\nThat being said, this game isn't going to appeal to everyone. The humor type alone may put off some people, while amusing others. Also you have to get past the art. The way it's presented is with photo backdrops with artistic renditions of the characters that are talking. The art and characters aren't bad though, you can just tell it's done with multiple artists with different art styles (which strangely works for the type of quirky game this is). This can be jarring at first but I was able to quickly look past it. \n\nOverall I was looking for a fun story with Cthulhu/Old Gods type mythos in it, and I got it! Also the price point is cheap enough that even if it slightly piques your interest in it you should go for it! \n\nTL;DR  \nFun Visual Novel/RPG Hybrid game with qwirky Bard's Tale type humor which you may love or not that suggests multiple plays due to branching story paths. Also if you can get over the inconsistent art style and photo backgrounds and see the charm in it then you'll enjoy it.
