The music fits each and every scenario perfectly, The art style was decent, the girl was cute as heck, and lastly, you get a [b]free digital dakimakura[/b], which is very nice. \n\nWhen it comes to the story itself the plot had a good potential, only that it wasn't developed more since the story was kinda short. But if you plan on looking for a visual novels with mature contents such as [spoiler]smooching, cuddling, and f******[/spoiler]. Theeen I guess this one is for you. \n\nFor the hentai lovers out there, you might want to install its \"uncensor patch\" to optimize your experience. All in all i'd give this one a 7.5/10. Still nice to read tho.\n\nLooking for the patch?\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/427980/discussions/0/451852118778491405/] Click Here[/url]", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 46, "steamid": "76561198367882132", "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 143, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1506252946}, "recommendationid": "35172759", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506253684}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 22, "total_positive": 94, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 116}}
