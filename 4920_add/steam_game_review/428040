But there are few things I am not happy with. Firstly the length is quite short in my opinion and the idea is vaguely similar to Psy High, another product of COG, altough the setting is quite different. Loved the attempt of solving myteries but I could not feel any real impact of the investigations. The consequences felt as very minor. \n\nThe game takes one case to another quite abruptly and doesnt give time to adjust ourselves. It could have been expanded between cases for more character development and approach to cases more naturally.It is like one minute you reading conclusion to one case then boom next chapter you chatting with someone else then comes next case. Maybe thats how mystery novels are written but I am not comfortable with it. \n\nPlus sides are the writing were short and good. Doesn't lose me half way through the page. A good one but with some minor flaws. Get it if you want to be school detective.

There\u2019re really quite diverse cast: rebel kid, cute girl, nerd girl, smart boy and creative boy \u2013 each with their own personality and interests. Chatting and spending time with them are really fun, it\u2019s like you back in your childhood, but without bullies, bad teachers and homework! And if you nice enough, you\u2019ll see pretty cute teen romance. And have a date. And a dance.\nStill you should know that the game is a short one (you can finish it in two hours) and there not so much replayability as you might hope for. For me it\u2019s not a big deal \u2013 the atmosphere and the story are good and that\u2019s what I looking for.\nSo, yeah, I highly recommend game for fans of children\u2019s detective books\\movies\\comics\\etc. It\u2019s really nice and you\u2019ll have a good time.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 212, "steamid": "76561198074691072", "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "last_played": 1453063475}, "recommendationid": "21277637", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504479", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1455819746}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1459138271, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I loved the game... its was awesome and fun and I cant wait to play another one of these kinds of games or maybe a sequel to this one.
