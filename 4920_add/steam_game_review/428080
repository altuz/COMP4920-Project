After hitting her hand rather hard on the office desk and thinking nothing of it she continued to play. By the time i walked into the room it looked like a murder scene with blood splattered all over the walls, ceiling, carpet and pc.\n\nThis game is awesome!!!\n\nI have a 2m x 2m space which is just enough (learn to flick your wrists rather than use your whole body to swing). A truly satisfying game that keeps me coming back for more. Each hit of the ball delivers a super satisfying 'boom' and the music gets you pumped to keep going.\n\nIf your are in doubt about purchasing this, try the free demo (more games should offer this).\n\nEDIT: The unwind feature that allows you to untangle your headset at the end of each round is simple but AWESOME!! All other developers take note. This simple but highly effective feature will save headset cable damage and tangles, well done!", "comment_count": "3", "author": {"num_games_owned": 33, "steamid": "76561198072476328", "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506670377}, "recommendationid": "34917017", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505125", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505451141}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504746531, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "This is by far the most frequented game in my VR library.

This game is fantastic. The newest update is a HUGE improvement. If you haven't played it in a while you need to pick it up again. Everything is on point: The music, The graphics, The gameplay, The multiplayer. It's hard, like all racket sports are. It's easier to learn than tennis but it's still hard.
