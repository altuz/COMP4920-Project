You must work together to fight this evil, before being returned to your own time. The plot is very well told, and has a rich cast of characters, some of whom join your party. The game, however, is painfully short, given the broad scope and careful setup of the story.\n\nThe world map is quite extensive, and can be explored for a number of monsters which can be killed as side quests. Prompting from the game's characters, however, strongly urges you along the main story sequence. There are a few, but not many, side quests that involve missions other than monster kills.\n\nEnemies are visible on the map, and most can avoided with some skill, but if you get too close, they will rush at you. Battles are sometimes difficult, and it is sometimes necessary to return to your safety zone for a rest after only one or two battles. At the start of the game, you have four party members, while towards the end you have 7 or 8, but must choose which four to use in battle. You are allowed to switch party members during battles, but this is rarely a strategic advantage.\n\nThere are stores to buy weapons and armour, but unless you go for the side quests, your progress will go much too fast to equip all your characters with all the best stuff, and the game is easy enough to beat without it.\n\nOverall, it's a great game, but very short.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 32, "steamid": "76561198035680861", "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "last_played": 1503261255}, "recommendationid": "34404166", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1503355339}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 21, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 22}}
