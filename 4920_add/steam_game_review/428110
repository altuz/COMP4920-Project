The Game itself is nice although it has no graphics options. Unlike other Match-3 Games it also has Hidden Object Mini games which I enjoyed alot.\n\nHowever after reaching lvl 36 the game wont start anymore and has no error Code with it. There is others having the same problem and other Problems in the Forums, yet there is no answer from the Developers.\n\nSearching around for a little while I noticed that this Game looks exactly like Spooky Bonus, only that it came out a couple of days later. Which lets me think the decs might copied it and just sold it for cheap without even looking properly after Game.\n\nI'm really sad about the fact that this Game wont run anymore as I had so much fun with it. However since it is abandondend by the developers I think steam should take it off from the Store.\n\nIf you do like Match-3 Games I recommend getting the Original Spooky Bonus (it has graphic settings as well) and not the Cheap Remake.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 638, "steamid": "76561198062558470", "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 154, "last_played": 1477288663}, "recommendationid": "26194317", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.518960", "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1477289282}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1477526214, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": " Save Halloween  has vibrant  graphics !
