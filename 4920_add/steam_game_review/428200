It's hilarious to show us a cut-scene with FULL Chinese text in an English version of the game. Even better, once, some comments in Chinese were saying \"no-translation provided\" on the screen. It took me a while to figure that out. What about \"translation server error\"? LMAO Use google translate dude! At least make the full game playable yeah?
