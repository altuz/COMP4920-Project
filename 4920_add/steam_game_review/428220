The game would be absolutely great, if not for the occasional runner levels, which fall flat for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, the runner sections don't fit the pace of the rest of the game, which encourages exploration and moving back and forth. Add to this frustratingly placed and occasionally glitchy savepoints, the very precise movements and foresight required for good scores, and the occasional buggy invisible platform, and the runner levels bring a very annoying difficulty spike at the end of each section.\n\nIn general, the game is good, just be prepared for the occasional period of frustration.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 459, "steamid": "76561198001478346", "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1500799468}, "recommendationid": "33729846", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.507272", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1500757630}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500498347, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Lovely graphics, well-designed levels (some of them can make you think for a moment) and an interesting idea behind it all. \n\n\nTo sum up- a truly de[b]LIGHT[/b]ful experience. :)", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 93, "steamid": "76561198403486741", "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1505292161}, "recommendationid": "33659518", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500082", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500498488}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504427128, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "happy to have it :)", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 8, "steamid": "76561198362509668", "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1503822817}, "recommendationid": "34705753", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.495357", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504427128}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 8, "total_positive": 25, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 33}}
