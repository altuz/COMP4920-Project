Why? Well, uh... oh! Because you have a human lover, yeah! Do you ever meet said lover? Oh. No, no you dont. So you actually have no investment in becoming human. Or any choice in the matter. \n\nIn fact, the 'gameplay' largely involves becoming a more powerful vampire. I guess? There arent any descriptions for the various one-cast spells you learn, so you go to one place and click 20 times to earn some pennies. Then you go to another location and click another 20 times to spend those pennies. Occasionally, one of the awful npcs who are bland and forgettable beyond imagining will give you a quest to go and click 20 times in a different location! Every now and again you get to play a hidden object game - but there are no timers, or consequences for clicking on wrong objects, so... click away!\n\nHeady stuff, I tell you.\n\nEventually, you reach some arbitrary level of power and the game finishes. Poof! You are no longer a vampire, love conquers all. You still do not meet the paramour for whom you, supreme vampire dark lord, have given up your 'Darkness'. \n\nThere is absolutely no replayability. The storyline is absent possibly dead, the graphics and music are bland as three day old porridge, and I feel terrible for wasting the several hours I spent completing this. Taking a page from its namesake everything in the game is some overweight, middle-aged housewifes idea of sexy vampires.\n\nThere are no redeeming features, no badges or even achievements to help you force your way through. Do not follow in my footsteps. For you there is still time!\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 577, "steamid": "76561197964605430", "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1480075200}, "recommendationid": "27438648", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.511176", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1480076039}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1482604644, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I enjoyed this game.
