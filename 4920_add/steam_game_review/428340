If you enjoy making pixel or voxel art, this is right up your alley.\nThere are just a few things i'm missing however, or at least not able to find.\n1. Being able select all layers at once and moving everything selected on the screen.\n2. Mirroring a selection (not just inverting it or flipping it).\n3. Editing the glow of every layer individually instead of globally. (I know there's a glow option on the layers, but it's maxed out already.)\n4. I also had problems with the animator, i cannot seem to get the opacity working, it's stuck globally so every frame has the same opacity, which is troublesome if you want to make something utilizing the opacity options.\nThen there are many other minor tweaks but that's just going into detail and nothing to add into a review, it's long enough as it is already.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 39, "steamid": "76561198037245954", "playtime_forever": 832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1499537392}, "recommendationid": "31549311", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.530632", "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_updated": 1493938070}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1498344499, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": " Marmoset LLC  thanks guys !
