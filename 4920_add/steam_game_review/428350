Pull a wrong lever by accident and you lose 12 people. Incredibly infuriating game. Not to mention passengers complaining as soon as they get on board. The game won't let you send supplies to their carriage until the next day, so there's literally nothing you can do if they decide to get in an empty carriage. Building defenses also doesn't do any bloody good. \"The carriage was completely defenseless.\" my arse. I had you build and complete 3 defenses for that specific enemy.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 482, "steamid": "76561198042771716", "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 102, "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1506549695}, "recommendationid": "35250247", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506549921}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 11, "total_positive": 30, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 41}}
