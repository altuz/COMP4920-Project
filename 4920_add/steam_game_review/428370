Takes a little while to get used to it, though.\n\nI cleared the game in 'normal' difficulty first and loved it. Then I started a new game on 'easy' (devs should REALLY give us the option to skip the story, by the way...) and I loved it even more. Is WAY more fun that way... it feels amazing.\n\nI think, along with 'Climbey', this is one of the 'must have' titles for every first-person platforming fan.\n\nI have pretty strong VR legs and this game made feel anxious and exhilarated more than once with the feeling of height and the fluency of its movement.\n\nI think it's not that difficult to master it, and once you get the hang of it (npi) you end up performing some pretty sweet stunts... I really felt like Spider-man at times... I wish they'd make a game just like this but with an action component... some flying combat, some 'hookable' flying enemies... basically I want '2-bionic-armed Bionic Commando VR'.\n\nIf you love stuff like Mirror's Edge, Spider-man games or Bionic Commando 2009 (because of the swinging, not the shooting), you'll have hours of fun with this game.\n\nThis was an amazing VR experience.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 322, "steamid": "76561198009059089", "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 66, "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1506793202}, "recommendationid": "35034867", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505689209}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504939424, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I'm glad to see a developer make a game that doesn't restrict itself to gameplay designed for everyones sensitivities to locomotion in VR. This game clearly states that it is a high intensity VR motion game and it doesn't lie. If you get motion sick easily this game probably isn't for you, but there are a number of comfort options that will accomodate many users. I myself am largely immune to the effects of motion sickness and vertigo but some of my friends who have played this game are more prone to the dizzying effect of swinging by a rope high above the ground. I find this game a blast. I haven't beaten it yet due to the fact that I keep getting distracted by the thrill of picking up momentum a launching into the air. The landscape design does get a little boring but considering the low price (I purchased it on sale for less than $10) and how fun the core mechanic can be I say it's worth overlooking some repetitive treescapes.

You will swing and fly and jump through the air with your spidey web, I mean hooks.  Of course, there's the platforming/puzzle challenge that goes along with that.
