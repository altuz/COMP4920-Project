This game is rich in its representation of historical content, if you accept that it is based entirely on the Bible. It makes extensive use of RNG, which I understand is not popular among many gamers, but is a very appropriate way to represent human behavior. Not that it is random per-se, but in life humans will often either surprise you, or at the very least the number of things they might do is so varied that trying to make a specific prediction in a moral-political context is not likely going to be accurate. It really feels appropriate to have so much RNG in this context, but there is a little you can do to maximize your output. In short, this game uses mechanics that are generally not very popular, but in a highly appropriate manner for the subject matter. \n\nFrom a Christian perspective, this game will definately encourage you, or whomever you encourage to try this game to read the Bible more, especially if they already have any interest in history. As a Christian myself, I have always been fond of my faith from a theological perspective, but this has expanded my horizons to appreciate the culture of the ancient Hebrews from which our faith is based even more. I highly reccomend \"study\" mode in particular.\n\nIn both cases, note that I am generally not fond of shoe-horning in quizzes into \"educational\" games. In fact, I am not fond of the typical \"educational game,\" especially where many of the tactics used in this game are employed inappropriately. However, in this game I find the Bible trivia blends incredibly well with the content of the game, and the mechanics of the game aren't simply a haphazard reskinning of drills, but genuinely enjoyable even with the theme removed, albeit with the theme removed being at the mercy of RNG constantly would be a lot more frustrating than when the player is aware that RNG is being used to indicate sociological specifics from a historical society. \n\nAs you may have noticed, in short I find this games uses a lot of mechanics that are typically unpleseant, but employed so well that they are actually enjoyable to me. Thus, a lot depends on how much you can appreciate the theme and the appropriateness of the mechanics to that theme, either from a religious or historical perspective.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 97, "steamid": "76561198025604634", "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "last_played": 1502027887}, "recommendationid": "33131451", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.518032", "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1499001958}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1498859397, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Great game.
