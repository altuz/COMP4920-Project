Darkest Hour is also very good, perhaps just as good, but to me this one is the definitive thing. \n\nIt sure is a much better game than HoI4, despite it's age. And it is not better or worse than HoI3, just different in which the organization of your army is a little less punishing. \n\nSo: \n\na) Its either this or HoI3 - the latter being more tailored to those who wanted more control over their armies' organization; \n\nb) It's this over HoI4, for sure;\n\nd) It's this over vanilla HoI2. \n\nSo in any case. .. this is it!"}]}
