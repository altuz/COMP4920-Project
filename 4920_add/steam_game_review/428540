Yes, it made me feel emotional, and honestly when I finished it I walked away from the experience feeling sad and appreciating the game. I really wanted to like it because it was about a gay relationship, which is so rarely seen in any form of media. But the more I think about it, the more obvious flaws I see. Fragments of Him isn't actually about Will and Harry. It isn't even about its protagonist Will, whose defining characteristic is his sexuality. This game centers around the tragic death of a queer character--a tired trope which we in the LGBTQ community have seen far too many times.\n\nMost of the game is spent in the shoes of the straight people in Will's life: his homophobic grandmother and his supportive ex-girlfriend. In fact, by the end of the game we know more about Will and Sarah's relationship than we do about Will and Harry. Harry's perspective is entirely focused on him coping with the loss of Will, which would be fine if this wasn't a story all of us have heard a thousand times. We know next to nothing about their life together. If the writers had truly wanted to do something novel, they could have at least given the gay relationship more development, or even a happy ending. By all means, game developers should tell stories about queer characters, but they must try to do better. Games like Gone Home prove that it can be done well.\n\nSo who is Fragments of Him intended for? Well, certainly not LGBTQ players. We're meant to feel more sympathy for Will's homophobic grandma than Will or Harry. Yes, it's a game about loss. It's a game that made me feel sad. So to that end it achieved its goals,, but the underlying messages behind this game's tropes and design is rather upsetting. I believe the developers of Fragments of Him had good intentions in the same way Will's grandmother did, but we owe it to ourselves to hold queer representation to a higher standard than that.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 27, "steamid": "76561198058577335", "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1503110185}, "recommendationid": "34362412", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502806", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1503190009}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 8, "total_positive": 28, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 36}}
