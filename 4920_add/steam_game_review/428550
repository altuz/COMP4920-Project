Would've been especially fun to be able to have the flame upgrade with both arrow upgrades.\n\n- I was also expecting to find a second upgrade for the bow's charge speed, and something to make the air-dash regenerate faster.\n\n- Eventually you realize that you can just dash through all the obstacles, except for the bosses, which then trivializes the game to a degree.\n\n- The map's design is a little weird, as it has a lot of indentation shapes that I thought would lead to places. For the most part, it does a good job of showing you that something continues in this direction or not, but there are some spots where the walls on the map don't match up with the fact that there's something in that direction. It wasn't really a problem though, as it's easy enough to traverse everything, and that problem is also solved by simply dipping into each room you pass by, so an uncompleted path opens in that direction.\n\n- For NPCs whose dialogue can change, they could've had something like a [ ! ] symbol above them to indicate the unique dialogue.\n\n- Momodora could've also used more miniquests with sub-stories. Would help make the game world more tangible and fleshed out.\n\n- I was confused about what the green thing was that popped up at the windmill leading to the Fresh Spring Leaf. It's the only thing I looked up a guide for, because it's something you can come across many times before you're even close to actually unlocking it. Could've been explained better, with something like an NPC that explains its history and how wind magic is needed to make it work. Perhaps a spirit who appears when the nearby enemies are defeated.\n\n- After a while you realize that you can easily stun every enemy with first attack. This is somewhat rectified by the bosses, but I suppose having more endgame enemies that shield or even counter immediately after shielding would've been neat.[/spoiler]", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 117, "steamid": "76561198043554063", "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "num_reviews": 65, "last_played": 1506874619}, "recommendationid": "35023496", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.507542", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1506603972}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505971468, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Great little metroidvania.
