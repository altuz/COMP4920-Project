The base game is easy to pick up and get into, the design is well thought out and beautifully crafted and customizable (which is usually a plus in general), as are the campaigns. Lovers of tabletop games in general should not hesitate to at least TRY it. The developers seem invested with their users and appear to take into consideration any suggestion they may offer. Do take their advice and, I say again, TRY BEFORE YOU BUY. The free demo is more than enough to give you an idea of what you are in for supporting. Overall, the game shows a great amount of promise and I am eager to get my hands on the final build.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 14, "steamid": "76561198278256460", "playtime_forever": 1953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1507187461}, "recommendationid": "34809244", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502638", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1504853950}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505561750, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "I'm only about 2 hours into the game so not a lot of playtime.  I purchased this more for the solo gaming aspect and not so much to build my own tabletop experience.  I must say, it is one of the harder hex-based games I've played in a long time.  It reminds me a little of Wartile, which I love.  However, in its current solo state, it lacks balance.  You have a handful of units that you can place in specific locations on the board.  And, in all the battles I have played thus far, the computer AI always gets to go first.  There is no initiative roll, etc.  Maybe that changes as you move deeper into the campaign.  The very first battle against the bandits was tough and took me abou8t 8 or 9 playthroughs before I was able to defeat it.  The next few encounters were much easier.  Then, I was trying to assist an outpost defend against an undead army.  There were about 3 friendly units that were overwhelmed almost immediately.  I had three units to start, a wizard, a friar and a healer.  I was pitted against about 10 or 11 enemy units.  The battle was impossible.  I spent a good hour trying various tactics to win and was barely able to scratch their units before my pitiful band was consumed.  Very disappointing as this game has great potential.  Maybe the product is geared more toward mapmaking, army building via cards, and sharing with your friends rather than the native solo battle.  I will asking for a refund for this due to its current state but will revisit it in the future to see if any improvements to the balance have been deployed.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 352, "steamid": "76561198007820722", "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1505565990}, "recommendationid": "34994596", "votes_down": 4, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.507933", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1505561750}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 28, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 29}}
