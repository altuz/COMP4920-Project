It originally reminded me of the Sims and that's why I enjoyed it... I am able to forgive all the repetitive game play but there were a few things I could not ignore. From small things, for example, not being able to put down walls when you're playing turns in to a huge distraction. When you're playing a simulation game, you want to be as in control (or not) as you want. I also tend to become rather anal when it comes to camera direction, which was finicky and horrible to manipulate around the screen. On top of that, NPC's would freeze and become next to impossible to set to a task. This game gave me high hopes but is all but unplayable now. I can't look past its potential and what could have been, especially now that it's full release.

I remember when I picked it up thinking how great it will be when they add more career paths, more options on what to do. choices etc. All those things were promised, and even though some of the gameplay was somewhat repetitive, I didn't mind because it was enjoyable working toward a better place, more earnings etc. But then one day I decided to see when the next big update might be.......and I looked and saw it wasn't early access any more........it was full release. I was slightly shocked because I was wondering where all the new content was that was promised......not only that but now the game is $28..........doesn't feel worth it. I'm only glad that I picked it up when it was on sale and I got it for about 10 bucks. That's about the top price tag I'd put on this to be honest, unless they do release a major update - for free - I wouldn't bother with it, unless it gets some major updates. It's too bad because it really had such promised, and it IS somewhat fun, but you will get bored with it after a while and with limited career path options, it just takes so much of the fun out of it. Hopefully one day someone else will come out with a game and it will be what this should have been.\n\nIt's definitely not terrible, so don't think that, just not worth anywhere near the price tag they have on it. I'd suggest only getting it when it's on a mega sale.

If you think about whats in it and the scale of it, you'll be able to see this is definately a complete game, however, that doesn't mean that there aren't things people (Myself included) wanted more of.\n\nIf you look at all these reviews you'll more than likely see a bunch of people saying that the game isn't a full game, but it is, I could understand how it might not feel like one to others, but again, that doesn't change that it is. The developers decided to phase out a few ideas (Some channels they were considering or planning before), because with the way the game was modeled, the gameplay wasn't that different and the mass of users ended up only playing one channel type, but even when presented with that, people are still upset for some reason about the lack of channels. Anyways, that's just my personal view on the people that negatively reviewed this just for the sole reason of me being personally annoyed. (I ran into a person on the forums that was whining about being \"entitled\" to a refund, and he was quite literally slandering the developers and trying to urge others into false reporting the game so he could get one for himself; disliking the game is one thing, but you shouldn't attack people or their product to that severity just because you dislike what you invested in.)\n\nAnyways, onto the game itself and not the development stand-point\nIf you like this genre, you will like this game. When you start and get into it, I believe you'll most likely enjoy it. However, there are people out there that say they like this genre but only like instant results, so this isn't really targeted at them. This game will be easy, and it might feel repetitive from time to time, but there will be twists and turns for quite a bit that make it more interesting. Now, there could be more to it, as there could to all games, but the amount of content in it should keep you playing for a few hours if you're an actual fan of games in these genres. There are three channels currently, potentially more in the future, but while the channels have new objects, a few new mechanics and other things, the gameplay itself is the same. After all, this is a game where you take up the role of a youtuber and aim for the top; the channels are more or less just different paths you can take. \n\nThe development itself has come to a standstill unfortunately, however, before this, a few updates came out along with a roadmap. I'm choosing to trust the roadmap, just because it tackles a lot of the issues I've seen some people upset about. They clearly state that they plan to continue working on the game, and to add more things; however, long term, not short-term. However, at the time of writing this, it's possible that the development will start up again sooner or later, as one of the staff members that work with the developers (I don't mean someone chosen as a forum moderator, I mean an actual paid employee that shows up to their offices.) has started becoming active. It seems like they took a break, which, was well deserved considering the game they released.\n\nTl;dr\n\nIf you like games in this genre, buy it. If you aren't satisfied with the amount of content, even though theres enough for it to be considered a full game, then don't. However, if you do buy it and play over the two hours, don't feel like you're somehow entitled to slander the developers and demand an unjust refund.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 44, "steamid": "76561198080683296", "playtime_forever": 3575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505648380}, "recommendationid": "34975025", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.507749", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1505490231}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505238577, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "EDIT: OH MY GOD ON THE FULL REALEAS GAME CHANGED PRICE FROM 14.99 TO 23.99..DO YOU ARE FUCKING JOKING?
