(pun intended)\n\nThe game nicely integrates components of bullet-hell style SHMUPS with a buyable upgrade system, enabling you to augment your weapon systems to your liking from one level to the next levels. \n\nWith attractive visuals, nice particle effects, and an invigorating orchestral soundtrack, this title effectively captures the steampunk vibe integral to its setting that is every bit as fun as it is pretty.\n\nOne may find the player's hit-circle to encompass a slightly larger surface area than the miniscule center-of-the-center-of-the-center-of-the-center hit detection component prevalent in CAVE-style shooters, so veterans of this genre may wish to steer slightly clearer of incoming projectiles than they're accustomed to.  Not to suggest that the game isn't well balanced, and the difficulty level is nicely compensated for with the ability to replay the most recent level in which you perished.\n\nDefinitely a recommendation.
