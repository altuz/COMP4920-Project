You are forced to restart the game whenever you get a ending instead of being able to pick up where you last saved which can become frustrating. I do like the fact that it'll keep me occupied for awhile since there are over 20 endings to do. This game is very unique but definantly not for everyone.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 23, "steamid": "76561198322470828", "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1505368751}, "recommendationid": "34944591", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505377974}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 11, "total_positive": 54, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 65}}
