It was certainly different than  Close Your Eyes. It was more rough, not as polished or consice, but in no way does that mean bad. The horror element was quite nice, unexpected at some points, but still nice. Again, a little reminiscent of Silent Hill.\n\nI thought the fact that you made the Demon King a Let's Player was really creative, too. At some points, the story was a little vauge, and other parts were realy fleshed out, but other than that, still great.\n\nVery excited for Red Haze in the next few days! ^^ Keep it up!\n\nIf you're a fan of RPG Maker horror games, play it.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 26, "steamid": "76561198038981717", "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1491030530}, "recommendationid": "29753692", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1486435862}, {"votes_funny": 4, "timestamp_created": 1486599676, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I didn't really have any expectations of this game, it met those expectations.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 20, "steamid": "76561198197765881", "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1486599422}, "recommendationid": "29792023", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501221", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1486599676}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1487385354, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "i played this game", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 76, "steamid": "76561198039462498", "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1465778950}, "recommendationid": "29998377", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.497100", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1487385354}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 4, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "num_reviews": 5, "total_reviews": 5}}
