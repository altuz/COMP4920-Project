The writing is funny, the graphics are retro cool, the spells are fascinating, the combat is tactical brilliance, and its mechanics feel great to play.  The things that Elder scrolls lost to corporate overhaul are treasured in The Quest.  The indy devs love this craft and have been dedicated to this for quite some time.  This is my 2nd copy, having it on my phone.  It is good enough to replay infinitely.  The options and choices make for a true open world with many expanisions to come.  The HD looks smooth and plays fast.  It was a pleasant suprise after playing the SD version for so long to have updated graphics as well.  I love alchemy and spend a lot of my time looking at flowers and mushrooms;  They have new breath!  The spirit of the Old games is here in spades.  It has the treachery of Wizardy, the dark humor of Ultima, the system play of Elder Scrolls, & with The Quest's modern controls I find myself playing it more than the old favorites.  The Quest deserves rightful place in history's Golden Age of Video Games.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1233, "steamid": "76561197996382739", "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 174, "num_reviews": 116, "last_played": 1506499372}, "recommendationid": "35122839", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506067915}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506017080, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "The quest: set in a beautifully hand drawn fantasy world. you will be pulled in by its simplistic beauty, as well as its style of gameplay which is a tride and true throwback to the good old days of rpgs on pc such as Daggerfall, and Might & magic.\nthere are missions a plenty and interesting characters to which your gameplay may change the way you are viewed by whom you meet. all sorts of monsters, beasts, barbarians, and amazons, witches and warlocks, goblins to orcs to fight galore! you'll come across beautiful forests, a variety of cities, dungeons with corpses strewn about, and lairs of the undead! its all here with several in game expansions which open up even more to dive into and explore! join the nostalgia! join The Quest!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 18, "steamid": "76561198076313075", "playtime_forever": 1953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 71, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506273536}, "recommendationid": "35110324", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506017080}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 21, "total_positive": 140, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 161}}
