Sounds start and cut off seemingly at-random and are so badly edited many start at the wrong point in the WAV and have artifacts and crackling at each start.\n\nThe background is that insane pinwheel and it never seems to change.

Main game contains 4 levels during that you listen to funky bitpop music.\n\n[b] Gameplay & Story: 5/10 [/b]\nThere is no story in Linea and the whole gameplay consists of only dodging platforms and incoming objects to survive more than 60 seconds. The game feels smooth and reacts well to user's input. The control consist of only pressing WASD or the arrow keys to control the camera. \n\n[b] Combat & Challenge : 7/10 [/b]\nThe challenge of level 3 and level 4 is what makes this game so much fun. The first level is only for introduction, second showing that it will get harder while the third starts to actually take few tries to get past it. The fourth level took me about an hour of total tries since you have to concentrate for 60 seconds straight and its not that easy when colours flashing all in a quick manner all the time.\n\n[b] Graphic & Interface : 5/10 [/b]\nThe interface is absolutely simple containing only the needed buttons for starting a leve, checking achievements and high score and the settings. The graphic is containing only the needed elements to play the game, so not much to rate here.\n\n[b] Progress & Mini-Games : 4/10 [/b]\nThe progress felt nice for the levels existing, but I would definetely have enjoyed more levels and a bit smoother progression. The hit from 2nd to 3rd level was quite hard and level 4 felt at the start quite impossible. After a while you get the hang of it, but still compared to 2nd level there are world between. Smoother progression in challenge would have felt much better.\n\n[b] Audio & Immersion : 6/10 [/b]\nThe tracks were not bad, but something for bitpop fans. I turned the volume off at the fourth level since it felt like being distracted by then. The immersion happens only when you are really into playing a quick level but for such a mini-game talking about real immersion would be silly.\n\n[b] Side-Notes [/b]\n[list]\n[*]This game is single player only.\n[*]This game contains steam achievements.\n[*]This game contains steam trade cards.\n[*]This game is really short - I finished all the levels and got almost all achievements in 2 hours playtime. Progress can be reset anytime if you want to repeat the game however.\n[*]This game offers some replayability if you want to retry some levels.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Summary [/b]\nI would suggest to get this game if you want to try your reactions, since 3rd and 4th levels are quite hard even for a hardcore gamer. The bitpop tracks are quite fun to listen to for the first time. It gets some time getting used to the level styles and way of dodging the obstacles, but once you figure them out its fun retrying to get best highscore and compete on the ladder list.\nShort playtime and lack of replayability are the biggest minuses, however since the price is not that high either, the game is still recommended.\n\n\nI hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game.
