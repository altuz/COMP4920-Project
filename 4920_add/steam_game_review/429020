To improve upon this version, please add missions and quests such as \"Kill 30 'Creature things'\" or \"Kill 50 Enemy soldiers\" and once complete the player will be rewarded cash or a weapon. Sidequests seem fitting in this game as it may help increase the game's playtime. There should also be features such as crouch or quick melee as guns are literally the only thing that kills in this game. I've noticed that after shooting a gun for a while it would disappear, I assume the gun has 'broken'. Please add a meter that that will show the gun's conditions. On the topic of breaking guns, I would like to suggest that the player's starting weapon should be unbreakable or breakable but have free restock at base as I broke my starter weapon and had nothing to shoot enemies with and had to scavenge for fallen foes' weapons, that was the only way out of the problem. Since the game is open-world, it would benefit from having vehicles to make travelling around the maps easier. To make the game more atmospheric there should be more ambient noise or sound effects instead of just looping bird chirping. Rustling trees or wind sounds would be nice. Upon traveling to Earth, the landscape was very green (full of vegetation) but very little of buildings, I would suggest you change Earth so that it is more like an Urban area such as a city, take New York for example, an empty ghost-city with abandoned buildings crumbling to the ground and moss and vegetation growing through cracks in roads and buildings would make for a very interesting landscape. \n\nSo far, the game looks promising and it has the potential to become a great open-world survival game. \nPlease take these suggestions into consideration. \n\n4/10", "comment_count": "4", "author": {"num_games_owned": 146, "steamid": "76561198054414382", "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1501854993}, "recommendationid": "33393955", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500057", "votes_up": 1, "developer_response": "Thank you for the feedback! v1.00 will feature a new HUD with a lot of useful info, and I can look into adding quests/missions to do for money/rewards. :) v1.00 also features a weather system, so that will help with sound effects.
