Certain towers are powerful against certain zombies and on the flip side some zombies are quite invincible against certain towers. While some are easy to work out, some levels are quite hard and will take some trial and error to work out a strategy.\n\nFor instance Cannon towers are powerful against flying zombies, but useless against everything else. Electric towers are great against poisonous spiders. Freezing towers slows everything coming through and doubling that tower with a flame tower can really chew through the health points of your enemies. Sniper towers are great against mummy waves etc.\n\nThere are 20 levels all up, with two difficulty levels normal/hard, both requiring you to get through them. The first 5 levels can be blitzed with a simple 2 tower combo, but from level 6 onwards things start to get much harder requiring a whole assortment of defence. The hard difficulty while it contains exactly the same amount of waves as the normal, it changes by giving you less money to work with and on some levels it tries to ban you from using some towers at all, usually the towers you need the most.\n\nThe assortment of enemies start from your normal zombies, flying zombies, poisonous spiders that kill soldiers quickly, mummies with a tank of health, some zombies that regenerate health, some zombies that explode into smaller versions of itself, zombies that can heal other zombies, zombies that seem to have super speed and just rush past everything and one or two more types as well.\n\nA lot of the time your tower defences will not be enough against the onslaught, so the developers have given a few more things at your disposal to help you. You have a transportable soldier with limited health, a small collection of landmines which can placed as a booby trap and a small bomb which can be dropped from the air and helps take out a small amount of enemies. All these tools replenish on a timer. You also have three more weapons, but these cost money and do not replenish once used. Dynamite, a freeze bomb, and a satellite laser. The most helpful is the dynamite and I would often spam the last level for money so that I could buy heaps of dynamite, this way I could go for a three star rating on each level.\n\nThere are a few complaints by other gamers regarding its difficulty especially in regards to levels that have a large amount of mummies in them as they are very difficult to attend to due to their outrageous amount of hp. However there seems to be a few bugs with this game which I was able to use to my advantage and I\u2019ll share them with you now.\n\n1) Before actually starting a level, since the landmines replenish on a timer, you can actually lay a whole map full of landmines before you even begin.\n2) As stated before some levels dictate certain towers can\u2019t be used. There is a way around this. Spend your money that you\u2019re allocated at the start so that your bank is lower than the price of the tower you really want. For instance a Fire tower is 120 gold coins, so you want to make sure your bank is under that. Then click on any vacant spot and click on the fire tower option. As your other towers begin to make money by killing zombies eventually you will have 120 gold coins and because you already have that option ticked with your mouse icon it will now allow you to put that tower on the spot chosen even in a level that dictates you can\u2019t have that tower. If you want two of those towers just repeat the above trick.\n3) Spam the last level on the normal difficulty, you will get 480 gold coins. Buy dynamite!\n\nThere is little to no story with this game other than you simply have to stop the waves from getting through and there is no proper ending to this game either. There are quite a few achievements but they all seem pretty lack lustre and I would much preferred if the achievements got a gamer to try various things. For example...\n'Win a level with only 1 tower'\n'Win the first 5 levels with only 2 towers'\n'Use sniper towers only on a level'\n'Have 1,000 gold coins at the end of a level'\n\nBut alas the only achievements are get level 5 on this tower, get three stars on all levels, complete all levels etc. which let\u2019s face it most people are going to do all those things anyway. Still if you\u2019re after something different and you like tower defence games, I can actually highly recommend this one, it should at least keep you entertained for quite a few hours.\n\n\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 2624, "steamid": "76561198112866114", "playtime_forever": 1286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 183, "last_played": 1470325037}, "recommendationid": "24710551", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503826", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1470328522}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1463078429, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I love Tower-Defense-Games, but this  is the worst TD-Game i\u00b4ve ever played.\nI have no idea how this get a single positiv review.\nThe first game i ever refunded.\nDONT BUY IT! \nNOT EVEN FOR 50 CENT.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 500, "steamid": "76561198035802491", "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1463078206}, "recommendationid": "22931053", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.498902", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1463250267}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1463139829, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "When you play this game it feels like that you get money for playing this piece of shalalala bamba. \nThere is nothing more to say.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 188, "steamid": "76561197963663751", "playtime_forever": 1156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1504716898}, "recommendationid": "22952734", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.496892", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1463139829}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1467813583, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "The mummies have no weaknesses so despite trying over, and over, and over again there is a level I cannot get past and it is irritating.
