Really good with friends, the game has lots of good jokes and humorous moments. Sure, the mechanics pretty easy to learn and are very basic. But the power system and how to conjure powers is pretty unique. It's a great little game to run through. Not much replayability or endgame content but well worth the purchase."}, {"votes_down": 11, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504885144, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477987", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "34817119", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119547648", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1503929641, "num_games_owned": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 39}, "timestamp_updated": 1504885144, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Hi Guys!!
