It seems to be a direct port from a tablet or smart phone, keeps telling me to press screen to continue. In the config menu before the game starts it shows a joystick menu and config, yet in the game itself there is no joystick support, its too bad really. It uses the mouse, although a little strange at first, its quite easy to learn. Its actually quite fun and the only TEMPEST spin off I have ever played in my 35 years of gaming. Also another thing, its got autofire which also confirms its a tablet/smartphone port..... Its most likely $2 on googleplay, yet its $5 on STEAM, go figure.....", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1533, "steamid": "76561197987999692", "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 200, "last_played": 1454823942}, "recommendationid": "20838433", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.513595", "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1454120110}, {"votes_funny": 3, "timestamp_created": 1453568112, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "      This game is fantastic. I like the aspect of using the mouse to control the spaceship in this game. I enjoy the single player mode for its replayability and superb enemy and boss design. It also reminds me of the 80s arcade shooters Gyruss, Tempest, and Sinistar. The multiplayer aspect is extremely fun as well. I had hours of fun playing this game along with friends and family. \n       \n       Also, there is really cool guy on youtube named Saiga GeneCast who did a Let's Play of this game.
