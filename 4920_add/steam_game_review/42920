Crashes to desktop in short order.\n\nEveryone is a smartmouth and the tutorial abuses you with information overload. I played this before so I know from experience that it is an overmap tactical game with instances in which you bring in troops and micromanage theatres of war individually. It was not all that bad but given the technical problems, the harsh learning curve, the dated nature of the game with unconventional control scheme and mechanics and weird content such as Saraceans from outer space and you start to see the wisdom of removing this title for library declutter."}]}
