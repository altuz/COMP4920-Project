As things are changed via updates I will eliminate the gripes that are no longer applicable. Its getting better and I think the dev(s) will continue to improve the title. At this point, I think if youre a retro game fan, then it is worth buying. But be aware that there are still needed improvements\n\nI will address the \"Cons\" first but I caution the reader that a gripe over a specific feature is not a reason to dismiss or not buy a game. My car has some stupid features. But I still bought it because its fast, gets chickenheads, and has impeccable styling. \n\n\n1) Without the ability to have some horizontal movement or speed control (aside from a dashing slide that gets you to the center of the screen) whats the point of bringing in multiplayer? The two of you are going to be on the same place on tha map making this even more confusing\n\n2) The platforms you run along (at least at first) are the yellow and black construction diagonals. But the ones you cant run or land on are also the same color and just slightly darker. Now, I normally wouldnt have a problem with that but its so taxing on the eyes that it causes my eyes to scream. On top of it, My mind doesnt register where I can and cant land all the time. Rule #1 in platformers, your platforms need to be different from the background. They have ignored this rule and seem to want to subconciously torture you.\n\n3) Weapons against bosses are single-use. For a game this difficult I think each hammer you pick up should translate into 2 throws. Right now, you grab a hammer, toss it at the boss, and have to wait to pick up another. Or better yet, keep the hammer single use, and put in a weaker weapon that, when picked up, has more than one shot/use\n\n[b]A few things the game does well[/b]\n\n1) Sounds. Spot on for a retro theme game\n\n2) A level that changes/procedural generation on each spawn. Cool feature that makes a game more challenging\n\n3) Challenge mode allows for using rescued workers as currency to unlock upgrades. I beleive story mode does this too but I cant confirm that because the color scheme irritates my eyes. I cant play it for more than a few minutes.\n\n4) Standard double-jump with collected energy drinks giving you 3, 4 multi-jumps. Only reason why this is a \"good\" thing in this game is because the yellow and black construction stripes tend to really strain the eyes. And being able to stay in the air longer and higher give your eyes a moment to relax\n\nConclusion: Is it worth $1.60? I think so. Two days ago I said \"No\". But the devs respond to feedback and make changes. Im not great at too many games. But the games I am good at are the retro and retro-inspired games. They are my forte. I was in 4th grade when NES came out. So my 8 and 16 bit history is long and detailed; my skills on the platforms are top-notch. I have a NEO-GEO Pocket Color in my desk drawer in front of me. I try not to be overly critical of retro-inspired games. But they have to at least play correctly. This didnt at first. Everything is just a little off on this game. Ive played almost as many bad games as TAVGN. So I know how to quickly ID a bad 8bit or 16bit game. I want to like this and if the changes keep coming then its going to be easy to wipe the gripes right off of this review. With some fine-tuning I think this could be great. For example, first boss, have the hammers get two uses. This gives you that little bit of room to navigate the level. It also lets you discrimante between which hammer you are going to try and pick up. But if I have to tell them that then I should just make the game. The story is dumb enough to be awesome and the artwork is great. The sounds? Couldnt be a better fit for the style. I feel like its 1989.", "comment_count": "6", "author": {"num_games_owned": 343, "steamid": "76561198108652055", "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 174, "last_played": 1456968250}, "recommendationid": "21237602", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.513874", "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1455824113}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1456167665, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Bad game. \n\nIt's not only just a runner but you also never really know what's an obstacle and what not.

The game design is wrong, you can only jump and glide, and you have to avoid objects on your way, but the the graphisme are so ugly you have to learn which is a wall or a box you can jump on. this causes many problem since either you think its a wall, you take it in the face and you die, either you think its a box, try to jump on it to avoid an ennemy, it wasnt, you die. theres a lot of weird mechanics, that i dont understand but the game is so bad, i dont want to play it anymore.

Easily worth the price, and then some. Want to see the gameplay in action? Check out my video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MlnGhO3wI\n\nOn the surface level, it's a basic free-runner style game. You control a construction worker, jumping and ducking your way through the stages while rescuing your friends. Each level consists of two stages: a normal running stage and a boss battle.\n\nThe art direction really shines in this game. The pixel style brings about nostalgia while not feeling too overdone. The colors are bright and vibrant. The soundtrack is plenty catchy too, utilizing NES-era sounds to go with the graphics.\n\nNot to mention, this game isn't a walk in the park. It's simple enough to learn, but you'll have a tough time mastering it. I'm looking forward to playing more with the new patch that was just released.\n\nAll in all, a fun game worth playing.
