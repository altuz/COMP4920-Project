FullBlast's theme of an alien/insectoid threat destroying cities and a military being deployed to deal with them is nothing new, and has been depicted better in many other titles. After you're done \"Welcome to Erf\"ing a few levels of enemies you begin to really notice how repetitive the enemy and level variety are, with the attack patterns and enemy types mostly all looking the same. You occassionally run into a large boss, but when they all appear so similar it doesn't make the excitement of wondering \"what's next\" as you go through the levels very rewarding. The effects from enemy atacks (and your own) are pretty bland as well, lacking much flash or complexity to them, instead settling for very generic explosions with an accompanying cheesy-looking \"BOOM!\" text display with every single enemy death.\n\nFor me some of the more appealing aspects of a SHMUP game are large, screen-filling attacks from you or your enemies, large, complex boss designs or intricate enemy patterns you have to navigate through. Unfortunately, FullBlast lacks any of these with much distinction, and what little effort it does put forth in trying to attain any of them has been done better by many other titles in the genre. I would only recommend this game on sale if you are a hardcore SHMUP fan and running out of titles to experience, but for me it is one of the worst in that genre that I have played.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 799, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "last_played": 1504844185}, "recommendationid": "34807685", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.510147", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1504844434}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 5, "total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 11}}
