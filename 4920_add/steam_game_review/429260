I think what bothers me, and this isn't super important to gameplay I admit, is the art style. On the one had we have these quite charming 8-bit style sprites such as the characters you play as and some of the enemies. Then other enemies look like they were thrown together in MS Paint and are utterly hideous. These sprites just look dreadful and I found them a little distracting, why not stick with the blocky pixel art for all of the sprites? \n\nStill, you can't go wrong for just a few bucks and it's fun enough with enough different powerups and a decent difficulty curve to make it worth a laugh. Playing co-op is probably really fun too as the screen can really fill up with all sorts of chaos.
