This game isn't going to tax the little grey cells too much; it's more something you can play when you have a few minutes to waste, or just want to play something mindless to relax. Instructions are clear, the story is simple and the gameplay is fun. So far - and I haven't played much yet, but I play a lot of these games - this promises to be one of the better examples of this genre. Haven't found any negatives yet but if I had to be picky I'd say it was actually too easy.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 170, "steamid": "76561198049920893", "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1461396117}, "recommendationid": "22581665", "votes_down": 7, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.515332", "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1461394268}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1}}
