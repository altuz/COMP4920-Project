Has received some new content after release, which is always nice. Gameplay is easy to learn but gets pretty challenging on higher difficulties. Might be a bit short on content as a single player experience, but this game is clearly intended to be played with several players, and is most fun with 4 players due to most game modes having been designed to work with group of 4.
