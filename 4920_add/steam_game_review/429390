Newbies will find it very difficult until they start to understand the various synergies on offer with division, troops, abilities and when to pop them.\n\nIt'd be nice if it was cross platform with the mobile app versions too.\n\nInterface is a bit clunky, but it feels like the desire was to stop misclicks. Take a little time over what you are doing.\n\nThis is a direct translation of the board game. I have to say it's nice to play this without the long set up times! Artwork is excellent on the closeups, if macabre. This also has the advantage of making sure newbies aren't accidentally breaking any of the game rules, or may expose them to actions and play orders they never realised playing the board game version. I personally thought the rule \"book\" that came with the physical board game was cr@p, leaving us shrugging several times and just going with whatever we *thought* they meant. The PC/mobile app versions will set you straight.\n\nAll in all,  if you'd like a tricky deck builder that requires a bit of brain matter, then you could do a lot worse than grab this. Stay away if you have no attention span and/or expect the game to treat you like a special snowflake and let you win everytime.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 322, "steamid": "76561197965179153", "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1493534884}, "recommendationid": "33399917", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1499595464}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1501192892, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Exactly what I was looking for, a difficult card game I can play by myself or localy with friends at an affordable price. You can zoom and the cards look lovely. My one con would be th UI is slightly unresponsive.\n\nIf you like this for solo play I also recommend the first Chainsaw Warrior game. Its also a brutal card game AND has dice! \n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 116, "steamid": "76561198070899330", "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "last_played": 1501704564}, "recommendationid": "33842296", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1501192892}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 11, "total_positive": 19, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 30}}
