After it came to my attention (rather sideways), I saw it looked better than the average Early Access game. \n\nThis is a point in it's favor, much as it shouldn't have to be. Early Access should have lots of quality games like this one, rathder than the usual crud that seems to collect there (and in Greenlight) these days. As a reviewer, I haven't done a lot of these games, but after a good look at it, I simply had to ry it and try and find a way to tear it apart. \n\nI failed. Not in playing it, which I did rather nicely-- in tearing it apart. There have been a few things in the Discussions that people have complained about, and I didn't run into any of it. There's a tiny amount of controller lag, but not enough to create problems even for people that don't like platform-y action hacky-slashy games. \n\nThe only real gripe I have with the game is the controller information image that's displayed on one of the loading screens-- it would be nice to have that available to people using controllers from the escape menu or someplace else where they can refer to it rather than a quick peek and gone to who-knows-where forever. \n\nThe game is good at tutorializing in an unobtrustive, easy to ignore fashion, but after awhile it goes away and if you've put it down for awhile and come back, it might be a tad difficult to pick up again. The progression elements are quite nice, and all of the pickups are easily identified and have functions with the exception of a gold-colored pickup that I never found out the purpose of.\n\nThis was the second game we covered in the stream, and for my money it was an excellent buy. It's one of the rare games I want to play more after the review. It was easy and intuitive to pick up and play, and the difficulty curve wasn't steep enough to frustrate, but it did provide a challenge as I got further into the game. Never enough to make me want to uininstall it, but enough that I didn't feel all-powerful. \n\nSome people will find the first couple of levels incredibly easy, especially if they have a lot of experience with this sort of game. I don't, so your mileage may very. The main character is yet another draw-- not in the way she's dressed, but in the history of the character that the game is based on, and the bits of lore that surround the Tyrfing Cycle (which is a proper Norse legend). \n\nGrab your favorite control method and some popcorn, fire the game up and enjoy. For even the full price of $8.00 US, the combination of solid gameplay and pretty 2D graphics that evoke the culture from which they were derived is worth that and more. The dev is repsonsive, and is trying very hard to get reported issues dealt with in short order. \n\nMy thoughts on the game in more detail are in the video below (including footage of me sucking at it). \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEfxVrAqgKs\n\nAfter this review was posted, Mellow_Online1 and I had a chance to sit down live on the air with DemonSword, who was kind enough to invest a couple of hours of his valuable working time to talk to us about the game and the game and the way he designs games. He responds to the good, the bad, and the ugly for us. \n\nThe video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjPHCMSFN_w", "comment_count": "5", "author": {"num_games_owned": 2586, "steamid": "76561197978976857", "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "last_played": 1461521690}, "recommendationid": "22582824", "votes_down": 13, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.496567", "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1461541499}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2}}
