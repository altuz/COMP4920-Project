Not a game for anyone but excellent to those to want challenging battles and strategical planning of controlling many different units with vastly different abilities having to fullfil specific goals under limitations (number of turns). \nFactors from cover, ground type, unit type/abilities affect the outcome of the battles between unit pairs. \nLeveling heroes and units by adding skills and using artifacts add a light RPG element to the game. \n\nWith respect to difficulty it is quite easier than the original Elven Legacy, getting all missions with gold rating is not super difficult. \nI have to disagree with some reviewers, once you understand the strategic rules of the game it is not too difficult.\n\nDrawbacks: rather mediocre graphics and definitely not tailored to a casual player."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1452719505, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507944", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "20511998", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198000378204", "num_reviews": 32, "last_played": 1452634490, "num_games_owned": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 678}, "timestamp_updated": 1452719505, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Know that Ranger doesn't bring anything new to the gameplay (though I like the idea of a hero scout), but it's still the Elven Legacy you know and love.\n\nSo if you enjoyed Elven Legacy and want more, don't hesitate.
