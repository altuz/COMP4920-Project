{"success": 1, "reviews": [{"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505241594, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Ok, as in my other reviews for such sims you need to ask yourself the question:\n\nWhy do you want to fly such an old simulation?\n\n- You are flying a F-16 with the avionics of an \"A\" model (characteristic is the radar/electro-optical display and the stores control panel) and additionally via seperate addons the F/A-18 Hornet and the MiG-29 Fulcrum.\n\n- Participation in a serious and big training course. Lot's of Red Flag preset and theoretical training missions (Defensive BFM, Head on BMF, Offensive BFM, Lessons from the manual etc.) and you can create and edit your own missions.\n\n- Pete Bonnani's fantastic video lessons called \"The Art of the Kill\" are included. Learn how a dogfight is done properly, learn maneuvers, learn to manage your energy (altitude for speed, speed for maneuvering), apply all this in the training missions at the Red Flag menue. \n\n- Record your flight's, analyze and evaluate them in the ACMI.\n\n- Relive one of the first (if not THE first) effective padlock features in a simulation.\n\n- Plan or edit missions, add another flight to perform a CAP over your target area or fly as the CAP and let your AI colleagues do the dirty job.\n\n- Pilot's have different skill levels, changing over time in one of many campaigns (Israel, Kuwait, Bosnia etc.)\n\n- Does work with modern peripherals. I tried it with my TM HOTAS Cougar + ECS Rudder and with my TM 16000M. DOSBox needs to be configured properly and the function to be tested. Watch out for the Swap34 = true (or false) and timed = false. Example: It's important to set the joystick = 4axis (for 3D Joysticks).\n\nThe truth is, that you could go for Falcon 4.0, install BMS 4.33 and go for the real and modern F-16 simulator, which simulates various \"C\" models. Or you just want to relive, refly it and just be happy with the big content which this simulation is providing and really spend some time in it. \n\nI tell you, the atmosphere in most older sims are really worth it. You use the assets which were state of the art over 20 years ago. You enter the 90's world, the 90's known war-topics (short after the end of the cold war) at the time (no terrorists, no F-22's or other fancy technologies). If low-res graphics can't shock you, go for it. You will be dragged into the complete 90's world of Falcon 3.0 Gold.\n\nIf you liked Falcon (3.0) Gold, try:\nDigital Intergration - Tornado & Operation Desert Storm (PA-200 Tornado)\nMicroprose - Fleet Defender Gold (F-14B Tomcat)\nMicroprose - Strike Eagle III (F-15E Strike Eagle)\nMicroprose - Falcon 4.0 + BMS 4.33 Mod by one of the greatest communities (F-16C Fighting Falcon)\n\nIf you want to test your knowledge regarding energy management, have no missiles, no doppler radars, guns only:\nRowan's MiG Alley (F-86 Sabre F-80 Shooting Star, F-84 Thunderjet, F-86 Sabre, F-51D Mustang, MiG-15 & bis Fagot)\n\nRemember, older games do work within DOSBox, still it is recommended to aquire some skills in configuring your DOSBox and test various configs. You got lots of options. If your joystick doesn't work as intended, you got some lines to change to get it to work. If you have questions, just ask. \n\n[I]Streaming and conserving old simulators as well as other military pc titles on known plattforms.
