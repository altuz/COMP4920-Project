Truth is, the only thing that makes this game stand out is its main character, whose name  is right up there in the title. The pacing of the episodes is fairly good, while the length of those is shorter than an hour, with a total of 3 episodes. The narrative comes full circle with some pauses, hallucinations that the main character can't escape and the only thing that it stops her from taking out the entire horde of walkers. \n\nFrankly, without Michonne, the game is nothing special, nothing you haven't seen before, nothing that a 15 year old can't make up in his first draft of their fan fiction. Michonne, however, is a breath of fresh air, a satisfying breath I might weirdly add. Machete being her weapon of choice, she gets up close and personal and massacres the walker one by one, even reins them up at some point to pass through the horde when she doesn't have the time to chop them. What is truly so reinvigorating about playing as such a character is that from the narrative's perspective, for the first time around, every choice can feel right, the pressure of the consequences not being there due to Michonne seemingly being able to handle everything, not just with her machete but with her judgment. The one flaw she has and can't escape is hallucinating over events of her past. It's nice when it comes to personality types to choose between being the one that scares the monsters away, the savage and the human but really tough one. By contrast, I find her more intimidating than Bigby Wolf(from the Wolf Among Us) People who watched the show are the comics might recognize her, but it's no problem for those that haven't done either: despite being short, it's still a well told story, that centers around Michonne.\n\nNot much else to say really, same old with the rest when it comes to performance, typical plot situations where things can go wrong no matter what, but you have Michonne to comment on why that always happens. Save someone now, they go away later. The ending was more satisfying than the typical TellTale game. What's new in terms of mechanics are black bars showing up while the combat starts, which is a tad idiotic in my opinion, as they don't emphasize an aspect ratio as much as cut away and I'm not sure it's the combat that should have been more cinematic, but for some reason, some action sequences are left out, due to a bug or by design, I don't know. Not that big of an issue, considering one won't see them that much and they don't cut away from the immersion.\n\nHonestly, I would have given the game a negative review, but because I find Michonne to be that great of a character and her own personal \"mind segments\" can keep the player invested,  I find the rating to be deservedly positive.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 520, "steamid": "76561198068873044", "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 215, "num_reviews": 29, "last_played": 1506356149}, "recommendationid": "35206880", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.511094", "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1506360729}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505847044, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "[H1]The Walking Dead: Michonne[/h1]\n\nAnother classic TTG title.
