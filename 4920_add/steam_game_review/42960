It is my 2nd favourite Paradox game. I love (almost) everything they have put out - EU4 is one of my favourite games of all time. CK2, HOI3, Cities are all terrific games. Stellaris is... you know, it has great potential. Vic II is special. It isn't perfect - but it is a game that I keep coming back to, and that I keep playing constantly ever since I bought it. \n\n(Disclaimer - I noticed that Steam says I have 1.7 hrs played, with 0.1 hrs in the last two weeks - after playing about 15 hrs in the last two weeks. Not sure what that is all about but I assure everybody I'm a decent source for Vic II gameplay over here with many, many hours on it an many games played)\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n[list]\n[*] This is the most unique strategy game out there. It came out 7 years ago and there has been nothing like it since. This is a pro for the game in the sense that it scratches a gaming itch for me that I never even knew I had. It is grand strategy, but with aspects dealing with political power, the Industrial Revolution, imperialism, and technological advances throguh the Victorian Era. \n\n[*] I love the amount of detail. I'm a huge nerd for things like detailed maps and intricate mechanics in my 4X and Grand Strategy games. Vic II has everything you could ever need from that standpoint.\n\n[*] This game is just plain fun. It really is. It has politics, goverment mechanics, warfare, the race for colonization, building of an industry/navy/army, power and prestige, trading, population management, teching, and a fantastic Great Power mechanic. It has anything and everything you could possibly need or even want in a strategy game. \n\n[*] One pro I'd put on this game above even EU4 is that for all the detail that is packed into it and all you get to do, it has a solid and satisfying game length of about 15-20 hours (depending on your speed/country/amount of automation). No 40+ hour EU4 games where you abandon halfway through to be found here. \n\n[*] This is another one of Paradox's masterful \"endless content\" games. It is impossible, from a time standpoint, to find and play every country and figure out every strategy for them all. You end up learning to improvise and figure out your strategies intelligently, while also being able to play a huge array of countries. If you are worried about not getting the bang for your buck, I assure you, you'll be fine. \n\n[*] While you do need the 2 pieces of DLC, they are at least both quality pieces of DLC and they don't make the full game cost 1.2 million dollars like EU4 and CK2. \n[/list]\n\nCons\n[list]\n[*] The learning curve for this game is immense. This game makes no sense at first. What do you even do? Do I just sit around all game? Why can't I just declare war on people? The tutorial is also not super helpful, which means that this feeling of having no idea what to do will remain for quite a few games. \n\n[*] Some of the mechanics are obfuscated to an extent that understanding them can be difficult just because the game tells you so little. The POP, immigration, and trade mechanics are the main offenders here. Luckily most of these things are out of your hands, but it would be good if the game itself gave a little more detail. It is basically the same issue I have with PUs in EU4. \n\n[*] The game isn't totally balanced. This is my one real negative with the game. There are, for instance, certain things you can promote in your provinces which are necessary, and others which are totally useless. Filling your navy up with only Ironclads is an actual strategy because they give you so much colonial power at the time you can build them. There are certain trade goods that are just garbage, and some which are essential, which will mess up your industry if you are an expert at this game. There are quite a few examples of this kind of stuff.\n\n[*] While not a con persay, this game isn't great (or even remotely good) at appealing to a wide slice of the gaming audience. It will forever remain a \"cult game\", even among Paradox fans. This means there is a chance you will just not like this game at all, and that fact that it takes a lot more hours than the Steam refund window allows is not great. \n[/list]\n\nAll in all, it's not for everyone, but if you think you'd like a Grand Strategy-Victorian Era political simulator hybrid with copious amounts of diplomacy and warfare thrown in, you'll probably love Vic II. If you don't get it at first, give it some time - I promise you, it deserves it. \n"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506255277, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508570", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "35179240", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199150261", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1506965391, "num_games_owned": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1141, "playtime_forever": 1169}, "timestamp_updated": 1506255277, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Taxes abolished, long live anarcho-capitalism!\n\n10/10 happy capitalists."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506190348, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35160393", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198099262890", "num_reviews": 45, "last_played": 1507067294, "num_games_owned": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6561, "playtime_forever": 12701}, "timestamp_updated": 1506190348, "received_for_free": false, "review": "European imperialism and colonisation simulator.

When I (as the US) started the US-Mexican war i not only had to take the territory I wanted but every single province in Mexico for me to win. As Japan when i wanted to take British malaya once i had took british malaya i still had to get more warscore to take it meaning I sent my army to India killed their army and then i could take it. Also the fact that China could mobilise 1 million men against me in a month when i tryed to take manchuria. And despite having 400K men in a province with no infrastructure that seemed to take little or any anttrition and were able to fight my forces perfectly. IRL that army would completly disentegrate due to lack of supplies. This game forces you to win major victorys even if your literally fighting for tiny scraps of land. Instead of taking a piece of territory I also have to seemingly slaughter huge ammounts of my own men and my enemies to take it. Oh you want that tiny scrap of land from me well I hope that even after you have taken that land unless you go on to kill my entire army and conquer more land that you didnt even want you won't take the land. It a shame because this game has a lot of good stuff in it and lots of potential and I know this game is not exclusivly about conquest but it is still a large part and the conquest system is completly broken."}]}
