Indeed, publishers changed: it is now in Artifex Mundi's catalogue and I can understand why as they have the sequel already in it. Anyway, apart adding trading cards and taking time to put achievements, I didn't see any difference between the previous and this game. Anyway, I don't care having paid for this one. A -40% is a nice discount and the game at full price is less expensive than previously.\n\nAllow me so to take my previous review and to put it here.\n\nFor your first investigation, you have to solve the mystery of several children's disappearances in Charmeville. But what to do when you realize that your main suspect isn't maybe as malevolent as you thought?\n\nI should have began by this game first before playing the sequel. The gameplay is the standard one (hidden objects scenes, puzzles, items to find) but at least, it's easy to find the items needed, even in the hidden objects scenes, compared to the sequel. Anyway, or I was blind in the previous release, or it was added because I found finally a map, which is easier to go through scenes.\n\nThe graphics are correct, I love the fact that it's set during one night and that you're visiting locations like a crypt, graveyard, sewers, etc.. I love mainly when Artifex Mundi publish games that are supposed to be dark and creepy. It's better when they're writing and developing games but well this one is good enough. Besides, cutscenes are perhaps not animated but the people speaking are. Voice acting is also good.\n\nGiven the price tag, I would say that now, you can go ahead. Even if you already own the previous game, it's still a good bargain. Anyway, I don't know if owners will get a copy. It's the same game, without improvement, apart for cards and achievements. It's just a change of publishers. True, games that were re-released were or given for free for owners or with a very interesting discount (Sleeping Dogs, Zombie Army Trilogy, Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey are fine examples of that). But I didn't mind buying it again. I've quite a soft spot for Artifex Mundi.\n\nAnyway, free copy or not, the game is still worthy for any newcomer.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 2214, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 352, "last_played": 1452264276}, "recommendationid": "20392680", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.550084", "votes_up": 36, "timestamp_updated": 1452250600}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1476984646, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "[h1][u]Game Information[/u][/h1]\n\nFairy Tale Mysteries: The Puppet Thief [CE*], is a HOPA* game, developed by The House of Fables; Gogii Games and published by Artifex Mundi.\n\nThis is the first installment of the series. The next installment of the series is 'The Beanstalk.'\n\n*CE - Collector's Edition\n*HOPA - Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure.\n\nSince this is an collector's edition game, it comes with some extra features, that aren't available in the regular edition game.\n\n[h1][u]Game Visuals[/u][/h1]\n\nI want to mentioned that the visuals for this game is nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the option menu.\n\n[h1][u]Game Audio[/u][/h1]\n\nI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even if it's simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the option menu as well.\n\n[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]\n\nThere are only three difficulty game modes to choose from: Casual,  Hard and Expert.\n\nDiary Notebook it keeps track off all game's objectives and notes.\n\nThe interactive map allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates there are tasks that needs to be done at certain locations. But it isn't immediately given at the start of the game.\n\nAll of the hidden object scenes consists of traditional word list with little or no interaction.\n\nMost of the game's puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.\n\nThere are seventeen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements do has some requirement before they can be unlocked.\n\nThere's a bonus chapter, but it can be access, only after the main portion of the game is fully completed. This bonus chapter is the direct sequel to the main story.\n\n[h1][u]Miscellaneous[/u][/h1]\n\nThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts, I've found this game enjoyable to certain extend. The replay value for this game is low.
