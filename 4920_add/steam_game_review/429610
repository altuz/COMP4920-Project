But I want to draw attention on one thing right from the start : [i]The Emerald Maiden- Symphony of Dreams[/i] is not a game for HO confirmed gamers. And be aware that as far as Artifex is concerned it's the first time I experience such a disappointment with one of their HO games (and I've enjoyed more than a dozen of them).  I see that on this one Artifex is only the editor and not the dev' team so it's understandable that the game may not be as great as theirs. But as the publisher Artifex should prevent some things to happen (I will give some specifics, later in this review).\nFor me this whole game looks like a slapdash job. Some features showing this : \n -  For starter it's very short : [b]10 hours [/b]is the time it took me to finish the main chapter [b][u]3[/u] times [u]+[/u] the bonus chapter[/b].\nWarning for achievements hunters :  I missed a rose somewhere I couldn't go back. Gathering them all is necessary to get one achievement (thanksfully there's a good guide for that and I used it during my 2nd playthrough, just to be sure). But then I had to run through the game a third time because one achievement (something involving baby cats) was still missing after 2 playthroughs ! For this I had to google translate some German discussion on the topic to understand what I was walking by ! \n -  Than, the game is more than casual, it's very very easy.\n -  Puzzles (mini-games) are, as the whoole game, easy.\n -  Graphics are average. \n -  The storyline isn't thrilling, nor immersive. I lost interest for the plot midway. \n -  HO scenes are not very detailed.\nNow are things I can't accept (about Hidden Object Scenes):\nIn HO scenes it's not impossible to see 2 objects that can be labeled the same way, like 2 rings on the scene where you need to find one. You can't click on the one you see first, you have to look for the \"right\" ring, that is, the one the game wants you to click on.. Strange. \nI noticed, at least, one lexical mistake (a magnifying glass labeled as a spyglass, while in other scenes it's correctly labeled!).\nI also noticed a same object from one scene to another, quickly after. If it's necessary to use the same objects in the different HO scenes, at least it should be done on scenes that are far from each other, not just next to!\n\nThe game and its atmosphere are not dark like some games, this one is cold, icy. \n\nNevertheless, [i]The Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreams[/i] is a good HO game for beginers or children. \nThe little bot that accompanies the character through main chapter is quite charming. The child part of me liked its sounds and animations\nYou have to gather little kittens which are cute enough.\n\nI just wanted to stress on the fact that this game is not for confimed gamers and keep in mind that this is not an Artifex/Artifex (publisher/developer) but only Artifex as publisher. \nNot a bad game though.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 465, "steamid": "76561198015324296", "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 637, "num_reviews": 23, "last_played": 1507137016}, "recommendationid": "35477561", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1507195235}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 7, "total_positive": 31, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 38}}
