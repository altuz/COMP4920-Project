But first, I'll talk about why I keep playing this game and what pushes me to finish this game.\n\nI'm not someone you can see playing JRPG's and this game was an exception I could make after hearing about it on Youtube and seeing the reviews. I told myself \"what could possibly go wrong? I can always refund it if the game's bad\", I'm not saying this is a bad game, it's a decent game but that's that. It's not great, it's not perfect. Why? Let's talk about the story first. Story is deep, emotional and serious and surprisingly it's far from being clich\u00e9 as we're awfully familiar with other revenge-based stories. The story was what impressed me the most about this game, the game also successfully manages to keep the balance between dark-serious theme and humour and some of the jokes characters pull are really quality jokes. I haven't seen all there is to see yet but as far as I can tell, the story is on point. Secondly, characters. All the characters, even the villains, make you love them. They don't feel like robots and they certainly feel \"human\" so to say. Their dialogues are natural and they develop themselves over time and they really make you feel like you're playing a roleplaying game and not an action game. Expedition system is pretty cool too. If I am happy with these, why am I complaining? What initially brutally murders this game is the gameplay. Maybe it isn't a gameplay for me, maybe it's just boring. The combat doesn't feel fluid at times and it kind of gets repetitive after a certain point. Let's not forget to mention the game's not open world, you'll be teleported into zones as you pass certain \"checkpoints\" and you'll have an invisible loading screen. You're always limited with invisible walls, you can't swim and there isn't really much you can do in the game(at least for now, I don't know if something gets introduced after a certain point in the game). I got sick of the soundtrack that I had to mute it too, I don't know if it's a JRPG thing because like I said, I am not someone who plays JRPG and this was an exception but the soundtrack is repetitive in the sense that a song is made of the same tone over and over again and you keep hearing that same song every time you enter a new zone. Even if there's no action, you'll hear the music changing and getting faster and it makes you think as if you'll encounter a boss or something, I don't know but nothing really happens. The game sort of encourages exploring as it awards you with chests and souls in areas you don't have to go to, you'll also encounter \"red daemons(?) I forgot how they call them\", basically daemons that are VERY powerful and have the chance of dropping a quality item while exploring. \n\nDo I still enjoy this game and recommend it? Hell yes, the story and characters alone can keep pushing you to finish this game and a lot of people still enjoy the gameplay so it could be me.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 102, "steamid": "76561198095875248", "playtime_forever": 1532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 41, "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1506375788}, "recommendationid": "35090535", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.515048", "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1505935277}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505420720, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Really excellent combat system.

The story in this game is hands down the best story  have experienced in a video game right up next to Nier Automata. There was never a dull moment throughout my almost 50 hour playthrough and I loved it. The characters are all very enjoyable to learn about and every single one of their personalities is unique and charming. You feel for every single one of them, whether it be sadness, anger, happiness, hatred, they all feel so real and relateable. The presentation is also very well done throughout the game. Animations are very fluid most of the time, dialogue is animated in a visual novel style and it always looks great and is pleasant to look at. The cutscnes, whether they be in game or the few anime scenes, are all very well done. The soundtrack is good, not great but nothing bad at all. The combat system is fun and is awesome to watch but I always felt like I was just spamming buttons and hoping for the best. The game is pretty easy overall which is a shame but it definitely makes this a good entry point for those who have never played a JRPG. My only real complaint for this game is that the world you travel in feels like a bunch of empty wastelands filled with enemies. Exploration isn't really something I liked doing in this game at all. This is also my first Tales game and I was genuinely pleased with it.

I don\u2019t blame you, this is pretty long.\n<No intro, conclusion, or good formatting due to space limit, sorry>\n\nStory/Characters\nThe main highlight of this game is the story and characters. They're not your typical band of friends on a quest to save the world or whatever; they're actually very morally gray or sometimes bad people. For example, the main character Velvet just wants to kill one particular man really fucking badly and she has little to no remorse destroying, killing, or using people to her advantage. For most of the game you don\u2019t even get the sense that your party are even friends, more like \"allies of necessity\", teaming up for survival and a mutual goal.\nThat isn\u2019t to say id call the main characters the villains, since the \"good guys\" can also be morally gray also. This lack of a true \"good guy\" plus the fact that it\u2019s Your Party VS The World gives the game a more somber tone than you'd see in other Tales games.\nDespite all that though, I\u2019d say the characters are very likable (or unlikable if the situation calls for it) and are voiced appropriately, with my personal favorites being Cristina Vee as Velvet and Ian Sinclair as Zaveid.\nIf I did have some complaints, it\u2019s that one of your side party members is an annoying fuck who won\u2019t go away (you'll know when you see him), and that Velvet's talk of hate and revenge can get a bit too \"crawling in my skin\" at times.\n\nDuring the course of this game you also learn about the origins of certain things from Zestiria, like the first Shepard, the Lord of Calamity, the Armatus, Malevolence, and the Seigfried gun. Ironically, this game does such a better job of world building that it makes Zestiria more interesting by proxy.\nSomething else I was surprised by is the script for this game. It\u2019s big, really big. Not only are there numerous skits and cut scenes, but every sub event is fully voiced. Every single one. Unfortunately sometimes the sheer amount of dialog can be a bit much. There were a few times where I got access to 4 or 5 skits at once, and while most of the sub events are enjoyable or interesting, there were a few that I straight up skipped because it was telling me things I didn\u2019t care about (no really, tell me more about how your town peals poisonous potatoes I\u2019m SO interested).\nTheres also a good amount of detail put into skits. The uh\u2026\u201dcharacter artwork sprites? Yeah there is quite a few of those. Even side characters that are only in a few or even just one skit get their own sprites. That\u2019s kinda awesome.\n\nBattle System\nThe battle system is simple yet fun to use. Every character can do a certain amount of attacks each combo, but you can use one of your combo souls to execute special abilities unique to each character (EX. if Velvet has 3 souls she can do a 3 hit combo, or she can use one which will bring her down to 2 souls for a 2 hit combo). Velvet swipes with her demon claw to gain a power up and unleash up to a dozen special finishers, while Eizen can throw a giant ball of fire at downed enemies. It\u2019s a kind of risk vs reward that makes you think about how you want to go about fighting the battle.\n\nThey also added in a new use for the blast gauge. Not only are they for doing your mystic artes, but 1 BG can be used at any time to switch to a party member in reserve, which is very useful if you're almost dead or are low on souls to attack with, and it can all be done with the simple press of a button even mid combo. This is the only Tales game I\u2019ve played where I wanted to learn to use every party member, since switching during combat is very beneficial.\n\nBosses\nThe bosses and mini-bosses are very rewarding. Almost every one you kill gives you a unique passive item that does various things (EX. run faster, upgrade gear higher, get better gear on X difficulty). It makes you want to hunt down the side bosses just to get more of them and feel like you have more options. These items also give you an incentive to play on higher difficulties which can be changed in the menu whenever.\nA glaring issue with *some* of the bosses though is that they can be cheap asshats. When they get down to the last bit of their health they start spamming strong multi hit (and possibly multi person) attacks that kill you very quick, and it feels very unfair when it happens.\n\nGear and Upgrade System\nThe gear upgrade system is\u2026not implemented well. You can use spare parts that you pick up randomly or from dismantling gear to upgrade your gear to +1,+2,+3 ect, however there\u2019s two problems with it.\nFirst: the parts aren\u2019t as abundant as you'd like them to be. I can upgrade a few weapons to +2 or 3 before I run out of supplies for some time. Some parts you will have literally hundreds of, while most others that you actually need to upgrade your current weapon you'll get a few of.\nSecond: gear mastering. Every type of gear as a special mastery trait that you fill by getting grade after a battle (EX. Iron sword has +5% chance to stun). Once you master that trait it\u2019s on that character forever, and with the amount of gear that drops and how long it takes to master it, it becomes less about \"what has better stats?\" and more about \"what haven\u2019t I mastered yet?\u201d You'll be switching out gear for the mastery so much that there\u2019s no point to upgrading most things.\n\nLevel Design and Sound\nWon\u2019t sugar-coat it, Bandai Namco still hasn\u2019t picked themselves out of the level design rut they\u2019ve had since Xillia. Caves look like every other cave, fields look like every other field, and it\u2019s all pretty dull and boring. Exploring these places usually boils downs to \u201cpress X to kick this rock/burn these plants/jump this gap\u201d, and the game feels the need to explain to you like pressing a button to remove an object in your way is such a foreign concept.\nThere\u2019s also some fair amount of backtracking in these places too. The game does give you portals and magic bottles to help you get around, but half the time these things will be disabled because the game wants you to walk and view a cutscene on the way to your destination.\nMusic is\u2026there. It fulfills its purpose just fine. I\u2019d say there are only a few standout tracks while most of it is forgettable. Not much to say really.\n\nGraphics\nHonestly not improved much from the last game. I get that they\u2019re going for a certain art style, but at times it really feels like they\u2019re dragging their feet on this. One could argue it\u2019s for the benefit of having this game run at 60fps on consoles which is a fair point, but it still feels like they need to up their game.\n\nPC Port\nPlenty of options, and full keyboard and controller support as well as keyboard specific shortcut keys. It runs well (see graphics), and can actually hit 60 fps without the need for a mod like Zestiria. No real complaints, they\u2019re getting better at this.\n\nTL;DR Bullet Points\nThe Good\n-Good story                                                                                                                                        -Good characters\n-Interesting tone                                                                                                                        -Good world building\n-Fun battle system                                                                                                                        -Very good PC port\n-Rewarding bosses                                                                                                                         -Good voice acting\n-Lots of dialog                                                                                                    -Skit artwork for a lot of characters\n\nThe Bad\n-Sometimes TOO much dialog\n-Same dull levels and environments the series has suffered from since Xillia\n-Music serves its purpose but most tracks aren\u2019t particularly memorable\n-Bosses can be super cheap\n-Pointless upgrade system with how much you\u2019ll switch gear\n-All the good alternate costumes are stuck in overpriced DLC.

Tales of Berseria feels true to this sentiment, though the idea of doing something different is wholly embraced by its developers.  It may get bogged down at times in genre tropes and long-time design traditions, but it makes up for it with an entirely fresh and daring plot with characters that are truly unique and complex.  If you have the patience to see it through and the ability to enjoy the ride for what it is, you'll be treated to one of the most captivating narratives in a JRPG in years.\n\nThe story follows Velvet Crowe and her quest for revenge against the man who killed her brother.  Along the way she meets various other shady characters who join her for their own reasons, most of which are similarly tinged with malice.  The characters in Berseria are not heroes, or even anti-heroes, but villains each with their own flaws, single minded desires, and histories.  That isn't to say that they are devoid of all good qualities and simply want to see the world burn, just that their goals are against societal norms.  It's an interesting dynamic, and thankfully, doesn't overplay its malevolent hand by shirking scenes of levity or emotional progression.  These characters may be villains, but learning their motivations and seeing them become more comfortable with each other along the journey is compelling and creates a welcome balance, allowing one to connect to the major players of the plot despite their irredeemable natures.\n\nThe gameplay involves adventuring through maps and encountering enemies in real-time battle.  The battle system is multi-faceted and generally consists of choosing attacks (or Artes) for each character as they unlock them in flashy and effective ways to combat foes.  You can take direct control of your favorite character and set up AI parameters for the rest of your party such as fighting aggressively or being more defensive.  As you play, you level up, collect gear, and engage in other JRPG staples, though a layer is added into the mix in the form of Master Skills tied to each piece of equipment.  As you use a piece of equipment in battle and gain experience (or Grade) points for the gear, you earn a permanent upgrade associated with that gear which applies to your character even when the gear is not equipped.  It adds an extra depth to the normal stat-raising gameplay that is typical of most JRPGs, though unfortunately, it doesn't entirely save the experience from being repetitive at times.  It's a trope that Berseria falls into when progression is very closely tied to raising stats to become stronger, and oftentimes, this can take the form of grinding out battles on the map in order to be ready for the next big encounter.\n\nYou can forgive Berseria for this though, and you should.  The overall experience is well-worth seeing through to the end even if that means having to trudge through some repeated encounters for that extra level or Master Skill.  Perhaps this experience would've been better suited as an Anime however, because the story is stellar and hits many engaging beats along the way.  It may not have escaped the grating grind and restricting conventions of its contemporaries, but it propels itself high above most because its journey is just so different and well-executed.  Tales of Berseria is definitely a rough gem, but when viewed from the right angle, it can shine brilliantly.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 918, "steamid": "76561198052705243", "playtime_forever": 3134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1504693072}, "recommendationid": "34784171", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506218086}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505901968, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "awesome game!!!!

You can decide to roll with the simple combos if that is what you want, but you can also make it a lore more complicated. By mixing different attacks for long combos, aswell as swapping betwen differenc characters mid combat you can get a really amazing setup of combos. \n\n+Story is quite good, and resembles some animes if thats what you like! :) \n\n-Everything that you can learn in the game can be quite intimidating from time to time.\n+On the other hand! you dont need to use the mechanics thay do not intrest you!\n\nIn short i would say that this is a fast pased but long JRPG with a beatiful world to explore.
