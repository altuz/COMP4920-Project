This plus regular campaign missions makes it easy to buy new packs every day. You will NEVER have so spend a dime to get anything in this game, you can get it all by just playing.\n\n- An efficient ressource system\nThe level/mana combo gives an interesting strategy approach and the possibility to exchange a card to pick a mana one every turn removes the death mana plays you can find in other games\n\n- No RNG cards\nDon't count on RNG cards to win a game. Yeah, you're in charge!\n\n- Daily tournaments\nSome for free, some with a \"ticket\" entry. Tickets can easily be bought with in-game gold. Various types of game proposed makes it interesting to play.\n\n- You can even gain real money\nYes you read it right. Every month there is a minimum poll of 250$ plus a percentage of the money spent in the game by all the players given the winner of the monthly tournament. Did I say the registration for this tournament was free? A serious taunt to competitive players!\n\nI really encourage to try this game and if you need a little boost to get started just let me know, I'd be happy to sponsor you in game which will grant you a nice 75k gold to start with when creating a new account.", "comment_count": "3", "author": {"num_games_owned": 54, "steamid": "76561198076698165", "playtime_forever": 14623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1504252051}, "recommendationid": "29440041", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.507979", "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1485166483}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1487534447, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I give this game something between good and bad.

Also, by knowing what strategy you have and the opponent have you can guest know who is going to win, no matter the luck or how hard you play. There is no much strategy, besides the deck building, and winning decks are hevily based on golden cards. \n\nSome mechanism are confusing, like flying, or blocking.

The game itself is good, if you like Magic: The gathering, you will probably like this too. \n\nYou know something is not right when you look at the top 10 players and 6 of them are with a Darkness deck. Basically there are 2 strong factions and if you play anything else you will struggle to win. \nUnlike in most games there are no counterspells and no reaction phase where you can react to an enemy spellcast. Combined with the fact that Darkness for instance has really cheap \"Destroy Creature\" cards and by cheap I mean they are often cheaper than the creature they destroy. Yes,the enemy can instantly kill most of your creatures without you being able to keep them alive and does this with the same or fewer resources. \nExample: \n\"Destroy a creature with 2 atk or less\"-2 mana,level 1\nMy collection of ~250 DIFFERENT cards has no creature with the same or less cost that has 3 attack or more and most that have a higher manacost get destroyed by just this card as well.This game really needs to have weaker or more expensive creature shots.\n\nI know it seems like a bad reason to not recommend something,but when you play 6-7 out of 10 games against the very same decks and basically have no chance to win unless you do it as well the whole thing becomes extremely repetitive and loses diversity.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 29, "steamid": "76561198027118178", "playtime_forever": 2551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1494180650}, "recommendationid": "29467124", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505721", "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1485280882}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487017871, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Well well well\u2026 first of all, I wanna apologize if my English is not the best. I\u2019m still learning\u2026\n\nABOUT SPELLWEAVER:\nOK, first thing first, I wanna say that normally I don\u2019t write reviews, but for this time I wanna make an exception. This for try to help the title that I personally think IS GOOD.\n\nNICE GAME, BRILLIANT, BALANCED and IT\u2019S a REAL FREE TO PLAY (NOT A PAY TO WIN)\n\n- NOW I'LL START THE REAL REVIEW AND IF U HAVE ANY QUESTION, I CAN ANSWER U WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM :)\nI HOPE THIS WILL HELP U! -\n\n-\n\nPersonally, I found this game really nice and interesting with good potential.\nObviously, it is a little bit similar to others famous TCG, but is even true that Spellweaver has something particular and personal. Surely this is a game that can \u201cgrow\u201d further, but honestly I think it has not a lot to envy compared to others TCG Free to play.\n\nHERE THERE ARE MY MOTIVATIONS:\n\n1)SIMPLE AND FUNNY BUT NOT BANAL AND BORING.\nThe game in itself is simple but not banal, easy to play for everyone but reserve anyway moments where is necessary to think a lot about what decision to make or the strategy u wanna adopt during matches.\nBasics of this game are easy to understand and it is possible to learn mechanics after just few time of game experience. BTW, to become an expert and great players is necessary to invest time and make some practice.\n\n2)WELL BALANCED, GOOD OPPORTUNITIES TO WIN FOR ALL PLAYERS.\nI noticed that a lot of cards are well balanced. Yes, of course there are maybe just a couple of really strong cards, however, the game is updated time after time and effects or cards that are OP get Nerfed most of times. Furthermore, honestly, I think is Obvious that there will be always the possibility that a couple of cards still powerful: it is part of the game in itself\u2026 \nBy the way, as I said before, the game is pretty well balanced.\nAfter all, even if, yes there are few cards a little bit OP, normally there is the possibility to create a deck really not bad even after few time of gameplay (later in this review I\u2019ll cover this point) and use decks that can mix functionality and fun.\nObviously, in rank games and in tournament there are decks more popular than others (META DECKS). However, a great part of the game is based even in fight AI and in friendly matches where u can see and find a good variety of decks, cards and heroes (is even true and I have to say that for my personal experience, DOMINIUM as archetype is used a lot).\n\nSo, in the end, even if there will be always cards a little bit too strong or heroes with better powers (it depends which patch is active), this doesn\u2019t compromise the possibility to win matches with budget decks or decks that aren\u2019t META decks and full of rare and epic cards. \nU can create a deck that u like (for example I like soldiers a lot) and, if it is a minimum balanced, IN MOST OF SITUATIONS u will have the opportunity to play a good match.\n\nOf course in Spellweaver luck factor is important\u2026 I mean is a card game. So ok\u2026 u cannot think to win every time, nor with Budget decks, nor with advanced decks.\n\n3)THIS GAME IS A REAL FREE TO PLAY ( NOOOT A PAY TO WIN).\nA really good thing of this game however, is that even when u lose, it still a funny game and pretty, but even more important u can receive a pretty good reward.\nSould I be honest? Well\u2026 compared to others TCG which I have in mind (more than one\u2026), rewards here, in terms of GOLD and FAME are pretty high in my opinion. If u win and even if u lose.\nThis point is important cause, thank this, lose in this game is not so frustrating and humiliating. Even when u play versus a strongest opponent, well u have the opportunity to play for, at the end of the match, earn a good amount of gold and fame.\n\nThis aspect of the game, brings few great consequences:\n1)\tOK\u2026 EVERYONE likes to WIIIN, but even if u lose the reward is good.\n2)\tThis game, especially compared to others games I played, IS NOT PAY TO WIN.\n \nReally. This game is not a pay to win, It is a real free to play\u2026\nWait\u2026 maybe I\u2019m crazy!\nNO, really, listen\u2026\nOf course if u spend moneys, u can increase the possibility to find more cards and more rare, epics\u2026 and some\u2026 but honestly, I had access to good cards even after only 12/13 days of gameplay\u2026 (and I don\u2019t have a lot of time to spend on this game\u2026).\nEven without to spend a penny, after a modest amount of time and a little bit of experience, is possible to build a respectable deck :)\n\nObviously, if u wanna win a lot in rank, things are a little bit different. Same for tournaments.\nBut after all, even in those contests, is just question of time: It's REALLY EASY and possible to play and continue to play well this game without spend moneys. U just need few more time for find enough packs but, for what is my experience, u can obtain enough good cards for free, and the opportunity to find rare and epics is not low (and, after all u can even craft what u need).\n\nObviously, Epic cards can give u a good advantage\u2026 and u can always find someone more expert than u or with a better deck, but 80% of times, u\u2019ll have the opportunity to play a fair and balanced match (and even if u lose, the reward still pretty high!!!).\nThis is why this game IS NOT A PAY TO WIN. This for me is really important.\nU know\u2026 a LOOOT of free to play, costs more than others (normal) games if u wanna have the opportunity to play those well or in a \u201cnormal\u201d way. With Spellweaver is different :)\n\nIn conclusion, and I wanna thx u if u had the patience to read until this point, I think that Spellweaver is a pretty good game, funny, with good aspects and GOOD potential.\n\nA great THX to everyone that read all\u2026 AND\u2026 MEET U ON SPELLWEAVER :)\n", "comment_count": "3", "author": {"num_games_owned": 16, "steamid": "76561198205141660", "playtime_forever": 8848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1488225663}, "recommendationid": "29908567", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499294", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1487017871}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487116134, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I share FALLOUTFUCKINGFOUR's (most helpful positive review so far) opinion on this game.
