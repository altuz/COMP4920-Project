The game communicates with the player directly through files it creates as you play, which essentially makes this game a virus(?).\n\nYou are forced to think outside the box to clear some puzzles either through messing around with the game's files or outsmarting the things that are all too happy to accelerate your bowel movement.\n\nSpeaking of bowel movement, this game is absolutely horrifying. The tension and atmosphere while playing the game is perfect. Just *mwah* perfect.\n\nSo buy this game of you're feeling constipated.
