It's painfully obvious that it isn't complete, but no one acts like it is. It's like trying to get a baby to work heavy machinery. It can be fun at times, but for the most part, it doesn't really work. You might go to attack a skeleton that looks like something out of a nintendo 64 game with less polygons and then you target it and can't attack, then walk away, only to have a slew of damage numbers fill the screen and kill you from a hundred yards away from the skeleton. Then the revive button won't work.\n\nOne thing, however, is that, from what I've played, it's MUCH less pay to win than other  mmorpgs, which is nice, it's actually free, the in-app purchases feel more like donations with exclusive perks than something you HAVE to get in order to play the game without hundreds of hours of grinding. \n\nSo with all that being said, I look forward to this being a damn fine game someday.
