Victoria is one of them. It is unlike any other game out there, except perhaps Victoria 2, which is basically the same game, only ported to the 'clausevitz' map engine, which was a progress. Vic-2 also changed some of the game dynamics but not that dramatically, in such a way that most reviews would apply equally to both games, sort of. \n\nBefore I start, let me warn ye people that there is an EXCELLENT wiki on all things Victoria, at www.victoria1wiki.com. Never get bogged down by the game's complexity! Just browse this wiki and find your answer there. Invest in this game, it deserves it. \n\nSo what is it all about?\n\nIn usual Paradox style, you are a Nation, whose goals you pretty much decide on your own. It is an industrial-revolution era game, starting 1836 and going up until a few years before ww2. There are events to force decisions on some historical matters, intricate diplomacy, armies you can use when things get hot. What you usually get in said games.\n\nWhat makes this game shine is that, much like EU and CK, simply managing your country to keep it manageable is already enough challenge. And V-1 does this in a delicious way: a VERY COMPLEX economical, political and social portrait of what those countries were at the time. \n\nEconomy in this game isn't just collecting taxes. There are dozens of commodities produced around the world, and industries you can build (don't expect Uruguay to become a industrial powerhouse though). Industrializing is what differs major nations from minor (and conquerable) nations. Let me give you an example of how complex the game is. Wanna export artillery, for large bucks as it is expensive and few countries produce it? Ok. It is made in a factory that depends on iron, steal, coal, explosives and ammunition (all of which, commodities themselves). You need to have steel works, ammunition factories and explosives factories too, the other two are raw materials and do not need to be manufactured. You have all of that, but all the sudden, you realize that both explosives and ammunition depend on \"sulfur\" commodities... which you don\u2019t produce. Lets buy it from the international market then. What? No...? Oh yes, there is only so much output of it, and a higher-ranking country already buys it all, leaving nothing for you. Too bad: those artillery pieces were not only supposed to be sold for a profit, you also need them to build armies and heavy ships. So your power projection also suffers. \n\nOnto the actual workers. All provinces contain \u2018pops\u2019. Your population is divided amongst classes: aristocrats, industrialists, laborers, craftsmen, clerks, officers, soldiers, clergymen\u2026 you need craftsmen and clerks to man your factories, soldiers to fill your manpower pool, etc. The thing is, they all require varied goods and money to live well \u2013 another intricacy arising from the industrialization aspect of the game. But to make things worse, they all have ideologies, a \u2018consciousness\u2019 level (how aware they are as to their ideology being fulfilled) and a militancy level , which rises when they are unhappy. Too much militancy, and they rebel. Taxes are too high, prohibiting them of buying their needed goods? Militancy rises and they rebel. Is \u2018socialist\u2019 in ideology, and the government prohibits unions? They rebel.  Wars have being waged for too long and war exhaustion levels are high? They rebel.  Press is made free, allowing consciousness  levels to rise, and thus, them realizing how awful their life really is? They rebel. It\u2019s tough to keep them happy.  You actually have to run a good government. \n\nThere is also a complex level of economical management. For instance, you can subsidize imports, so that your pops can buy more easily imported goods, which you do not manufacture yourself. However you can also tax imports, giving you that extra cash for moments of hardship, though it makes it more difficult for your pops to buy their needed things (and they eventually rebel).\n\nPolicies is also a complex thing. Your government can have different ideologies, within different areas. For instance \u2018laisses-faire\u2019 governments cannot build their own factories, they must rely on their industrialists to do that for themselves. Free enterprise, eh! But in \u2018state capitalism\u2019, not only you have to do it yourself, your industrialists are prohibited from doing it. Imagine what effect that has on their own militancy. And so it goes for voting rights, having a caste system or otherwise a system where everyone can rise in ranks (changing its own kind of \u2018pop\u2019 that means, like laborers becoming industrialists), whether those chances are allowed for everyone or only your main culture group (like for instance, in Prussia can everyone ascend, or only Germans?). Even slavery is there. Events are also a typical cause of trouble, like demagogues that appear eventually and rise everybody\u2019s consciousness level in a province. \n\nThere always different political parties or factions in a government. You can also expect trouble in that direction. And there are reforms, regarding  voting systems, free press, pensions and funds, unions\u2026 and you guessed it: because of ideology and consciousness, all of that is liable to make your country ungovernable if you don\u2019t do it right. \n\nAt the end of the day, all of that pertains only one thing: how prosperous, prestigious and militarily important is your country? Because there is a \u2018rank\u2019 of major powers, minor powers, minor nations and colonial nations.  And they will fight for that rank. The 19th century was a bloody thing and the game mimics that well. Fielding a major army or navy is an important thing, very expensive too.  The drain on your economy is palpable, to an extent where you are really caught calculating \u201chow much army expending can I afford, before it burdens me so much that I am not really developing my country?\u201d\n\nFor that reason alone the game deserves a lot of praise. War is there to wage, but most of the time you would really not want to, since competing with other countries requires you to make money, modernize your industry, raise your people\u2019s standard of living, while at the same time bringing your country more and more towards a more liberal, free and inclusive society. Going the other way is a sure path to many rebellions and coups (yes you can suffer coups, if militancy is high enough. Usually the new government will be the opposite of the later, so in late game communist revolutions are normal). And constant war only makes things worse, because of the loss in materials, money, and human life (yes, human life. To field a large army you have to convert other pops into soldiers, and when they die by the millions, who is going to man your industries?). \n\nStill, for those who like it, all major wars of the 19th century, and also WW1, are more or less scripted to happen (but with a lot of variation), so you can\u2019t just be a peaceful silly country all of the time. The balance is good. The opposite is also true: go to war with everyone all the time, with no solid reason, annexing the hell out of them, and a secret score called \u2018bad-boy\u2019 starts to rise. Eventually everybody gets fed up with you and start declaring preemptive wars to wipe you out.\n\nHeck, even the American civil war is there, waiting to happen, after a long series of very challenging choice events. The Italian unification, the franco-prussian war (with the german unification to \u2018perhaps\u2019 follow it), dozens of colonial events...  you can civilize japan and china, colonize Africa, play as Argentina or Brazil (and make them world powers, perhaps!) \u2026 the richness is unfathomable. \n\nSo to sum things up: this is one of the most wonderful games ever made. But it is a VERY ADULT game. Expect no casual, soft-core entertainment here. But if you are willing to get acquainted with it (which takes some time), it will reward your patience manifold. \n\n"}]}
