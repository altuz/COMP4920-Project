Therefore, I was able to get away with playing about half a level.\n\nAbsolutely worth it. I've played much worse for much more than $3.\n\nThere is absolutely no teleporting. Essentially,  transitions happen naturally as you explore smaller rooms in the room allocated in your play area. This really gave me the impression that I was actually walking, sliding along walls, and crawling through a series of rooms in a facility, Also, crawling through vents is more fun than it sounds and should be.\n\nIf you meet the minimum required space, this is absoulutely a no brainer. If you're close to it and don't mind $3 for 15 minutes of fun room exploration, then buy it. Worst case scenario, you'll still walk away from the experience and realize you've regretted more expensive potato chip purchases more than your inexpensive purchase of a fun concept.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1539, "steamid": "76561197999740790", "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1504586335}, "recommendationid": "34562486", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504252217}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1502561310, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I have a whole room dedicated to the vive and still not enough space!
