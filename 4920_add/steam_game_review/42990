It makes more sense and the actual requirement from the battle field drives to research weapon that proves relevant damage pattern.\n\nThe fleet tasking system seems unituitive for some players, but not for the ones who are used to delegation and tasking system of many other strategy game. It is actually easier to handle numbers of fleet when your empire grows bigger by the mission system, instead of by giving direction to any single ship. \n\n\nAfter being released for four and half years, It is still the best space combat game with ship customization.\nI cannot find a replacement which proves more entertaining combat simulation for me.\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504364890, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499017", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34687589", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197984915496", "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1404782647, "num_games_owned": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2048}, "timestamp_updated": 1504364890, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The nicest thing about this game? \n\n\n.........I just remembered how much this piece of shit crashed."}]}
