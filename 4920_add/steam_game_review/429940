It's quite typical of the genre but nonetheless this game was very entertaining.A strong point of this game was that it had very well developed characters which resonated really strongly with me. In particular emmeline burns reminded me of this girl I used to know back in middle school. We sat next to eachother in art class and we both had birthdays in september. Anyway we always talked in class and I felt like I had a lot in common with her. She was just so great, like there was this thing about her, that made her stick out from the crowd, like she was special. I used to dream about her every night and so eventually I got the courage to ask her out, and she said that she liked me but she couldn't have a relationship because her mom would be angry with her if she did. But like this game really reminded me of that girl from my art class and what we could have been together. All around I rate this game really well. Also Rose if by some miracle you are reading this review just know that I still love you and there is still hope for us just add me on steam and we can go from there <3 \"penguins can't fly???\" haha I still remember how you said that it was so funny haha.", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 2, "steamid": "76561198328979978", "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1487206605}, "recommendationid": "29952751", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499176", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1487206616}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485020165, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Excellent artwork with a solid story featuring interesting characters.

That game was a piece of sh**.\n\nThe Sad Story of Emmeline Burns is about an Angsty Story of Toma, a girl who doesn't like her name and is troubled with thoughts of death and has remained shy her whole life. That is, until, she meets a strange girl named Emily in a graveyard who tells her the story of the deceased Emmeline Burns... and then the sad story kicks in!\n\nThe Sad Story of Emmeline Burns is a sad story about a girl named Emmeline Burns who is a lesbian in the 1800's (I think) and then she dies. So sad.\n\nI won't spoil anything major, but both stories aren't that particularly well-written or presented. It's all about finding confidence in yourself and coming of age and blah-dee-blah-dee-blah, but the progressive \"choose who you want to love, no matter if they're your gender or not\" edge did make me a little more keen to support something like this.... If there were some actual g****** conflict in it.\n\nSee, the idea of the story is interesting. A lesbian couple in the 1800's! How do they get away with it? Do their parents find out? Does the whole town find out and punish them? No. They just go off and make out. There's nothing at stake with anything that happens in the story. Even the cause of Emmeline's death seems very sudden and forced (Seriously, those motivations are very weak. No spoilers. Just saying.), and Toma's frame narrative is equally as uninteresting. She doesn't like her name. She goes to a grave. She hears a ghost tell a story. And then she feels better about herself. She's not a very interesting character and, again, nothing is at stake for her because there is no conflict.\n\nThere is a little something towards the end (after the credits of all times) when things look up for Toma but it's too short and too late for me to care anymore. It's after the f***ing credits! Why should I care?\n\nPresentation is also pretty low, but that's what I've come to expect from these interactive novels. Still images poorly animate and low-quality sound effects play over some stock music the developer found for free. But they have the protagonist as one of the still images... and they have both characters (including the protagonist) looking towards YOU the player, which makes no sense. I'm supposed to be Toma, right? She's my insert into this story, isn't she? So why is she looking at me in these conversations? It's a very unusual choice and I don't think it helps the story in any way, shape, or form.\n\nI think Emmeline Burns has got some heart deep down inside. There are certainly qualities in it that I like... but it's bogged down by some lousy writing and some low presentation quality. That and the story is pretty linear. There's no replay value because the game takes about an hour to beat and you make no choices throughout the whole story. So why should I go back and play again? Because I loved the \"deep\" and \"compelling\" characters? Thanks but no thanks. I'm giving The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns a 4/10. It's got some good ideas, but.... there's a lot of sh** piled on top of those few good ideas.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 284, "steamid": "76561198049105851", "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 171, "last_played": 1485021136}, "recommendationid": "29403750", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.496415", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485021841}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1485282284, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 398, "steamid": "76561198025543872", "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 450, "last_played": 1485282280}, "recommendationid": "29467556", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.492804", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1485282284}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487644457, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Very nice story, though N.B., it's just a story: no choices.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 160, "steamid": "76561198064988566", "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1486877463}, "recommendationid": "30070646", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487644457}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485019708, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "A cute little story, nice soundtrack too :)", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 173, "steamid": "76561198287966307", "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1485021489}, "recommendationid": "29402998", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485019708}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485958109, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "100% Achievements\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 153, "steamid": "76561198044073431", "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "last_played": 1485958093}, "recommendationid": "29628342", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485958109}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487022122, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "That was intense...", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 135, "steamid": "76561198170393490", "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1487022001}, "recommendationid": "29909743", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487022122}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1486528053, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This is more of a guided story, but it was very well written, and very pretty", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 28, "steamid": "76561198148299822", "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "last_played": 1481854257}, "recommendationid": "29774830", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486528053}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1486766448, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "A short and sweet kinetic visual novel with thoughtful, pensive writing, a budding romance that strikes true, and a character I could relate to.
