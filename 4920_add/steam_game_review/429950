The bad news is that those titles are far closer to the barely functioning Cheetahmen than they are any 'instant classics' as this game bewilderingly touts itself.\n\nI was hooked in by the Mexican horror theme as there is precious little of it to be found in gaming but nothing feels particularly culture-specific about shooting down a tedious Halloween gallery of ghosts, bats, cats and, uh, monkeys for some godforsaken reason. The boss fights, although clumsily handled, are a little bit livelier, recalling the milder confrontations of the original Castlevania trilogy but out of a total of five of them, two are against the Grim Reaper and one is against an alien overlord so that really leaves you with precious little of what Abo Mando promises you.\n\nThe two biggest problems here are that every stage looks like crap on account of being one colour (whether or not that is an artistic choice becomes irrelevant the minute it starts to affect enemy and platform visibility) and the fact that enemies constantly spawn on top of you, sometimes in mid-air, of which you can either shut up and like it or quit to refund (my personal option). Trying to sell this as a 'Mega-Vania' hybrid is, frankly, insulting to both of those games and even the several generations of knock-offs that came after them.\n\nA disappointingly lazy effort.
