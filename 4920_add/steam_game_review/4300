Now I got a little story to tell you.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nI was away from my country to visit a few friends of mine that lived in Ukraine. While exploring some of the Ukrainian shops I found a game named Roboblitz. I was very interested in this game, and so I bought it, went to my apartment and started playing. It was the first game that gave me an unbelievible amount of stress and strugle to play the game, this game was very hard as I was a begginer. After a few 10 to 20 times playing the game, I then was able to master it! Now note that this game was abought in Ukraine so everything in it was in russian, no english no nothing no Steam.\n\nWhile playing the game I had lots of questions about it. I had found strange things happen in boss levels, but they were very fun to watch. I really liked the mechanics of this game.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\n- Good Graphics\n\n- Good Puzzles\n\n- Fun Boss Glitches\n\n- Great Upgrade Mechanics\n\n- Long Gameplay\n\n- Level Editor (can be used if you're an experienced person with the kind of modeling software they use)\n\n- Language Selector\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\n- Very hard for begginers\n\n- Very easy for pros\n\n[h1]FAQ[/h1]\n\n[b]Question[/b]\n\nIn one of the boss levels, when I try to hit NOED with the stun rod and he gets hit, just when I get to attack him he gets up straight away. Is this a bug?\n\n[b]Answer[/b]\n\nThere is a chance for him to get up straight away after he falls, and if you had hit him with the stun rod and he gets back up straight away, then you need to get a better hit on him.\n\n[b]Question[/b]\n\nThere are a few boss glitches in almost each lvl, why isn't this in your list of cons?\n\n[b]Answer[/b]\n\nI had lots of fun watching the glitches happen so I don't have any negatives about that.\n\n[b]Question[/b]\n\nThe game says that there is a dash, when I attempt to dash it doesn't work. Help pls?\n\n[b]Answer[/b]\n\nThat took me a while to fiqure out, it seems that you have to tap in the same direction very fast, not just ordinary \"fast\". Try being [h1]Sanic[/h1] and double tap as fast as you can. Basicly try spamming.\n\n[b]Question[/b]\n\nI'm bored with the ordinary attacks and abilities. Got any tips to make combat more fun?\n\n[b]Answer[/b]\n\nYes yes, there are loads of attack combos that can be mastered.\n\n1. Pick a weapon, equip the super high double jump upgrade, then double jump press Q to spin, and while spinning in slowly in mid air, try spamming the Q button to spin and hold attack, this is a very awesome combo.\n\n2. Use the surrounding objects that you can pick up. Remember that sticky gun? Where you shoot a glowy orb at anything then it floats? Use it on one of the sides of the long crate, then grab hold on the other end, then volia! Spin around while holding it and all that, very good long ranged weapon.\n\n3. Try using that magnet thingy that magnets you to areas that you shoot it at, use it and swing as Tarzan while shooting from the air.\n\n[b]Final Question[/b]\n\nThe level where I have to go to the top of the tower to where is the Antena is very high. I just fell down and now I don't know what to do and the pathway back up is too long. Got any ideas?\n\n[b] Final Answer[/b]\n\nUsing that \"magnet\" thingy that I mentioned earlier in this review. Use it to climb your way back to the top, or maybe even higher!\n\nK. Sorry for such a long review, this is my fav game after all! 10/Potato 2016 would play again. \n\nRecommended, BUY IT!!!"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1309713144, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499586", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "3673751", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198025867997", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1396958474, "num_games_owned": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 678}, "timestamp_updated": 1309713144, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Ok, I will not lie, this game IS short, very very short, but its mechanics are very nice, and even not being long and hard it can give you tons of fun, about 5 Hours of gameplay only, what is pretty sad =/, but even those 5 hours are very enjoyable, also, it comes with a level editor what makes it even more enjoyable, I dont know if you can download and play user made levels but you probrably can.\nEven with all the bad aspects such as short and kinda easy I certainly recommend that game. =)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1444605920, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500713", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "18435985", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971986620", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1381140857, "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5458}, "timestamp_updated": 1444605920, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A very unique physics platformer with a variety of puzzle elements.

GET IT ON THE Xbox360 INSTEAD BECAUSE THE PC PORT ISN'T POSSIBLE TO FINISH BECAUSE OF THE BOSS FIGHTS THAT DON'T WORK.\n\nThis was the first game I'd ever bought on XBLA as a kid, and it's still one of my all-time favs. As soon as I saw it on Steam I knew I had to get it, and I was VERY dissapointed with the PC port.\n\nHere's the good things about the PC port.\n\n-Make your own levels\n\n-Play the game with headphones (And be amazed by the fantastic soundtrack)\n\n-Turn up the graphics to the max which makes the game look better than on the Xbox360\n\n-Play the game with a MUCH higher framerate so the controls feel much tighter and more responsive\n\nBut, then there's all the problems with the PC port. (These problems are not on the XBLA edition which I recommend you get instead)\n\n-Dashing doesn't work quite right.\n\n-Buggy boss fights. Here's some examples of them:\n\nOne boss got stuck and I had to nudge him out in order for him to get to where he needed to go in order for the final stage of the fight to start.\n\nAnother boss isn't even possible to finish (And therefor making the game impossible to finish) You're supposed to get it to charge at you and smash into the gears you're standing above, but it doesn't charge, it just slowly hovers towards you instead, meaning that it doesn't get the impact on the gears needed to finish that stage of the boss fight.\n\nThe rest of the bosses are just as frustratingly buggy making the boss fights completely unplayable.\n\n0/5 - Impossible to finish.

That is, this isn't one of those games that are remarkably bad that you see on Steam so often. I played the Xbox 360 Demo back in very early Xbox 360 Arcade days and thought it was fun. And for the most part? Its actually not really straight up bad, its just below par and it has a number of issues that make it impossible to reccomend.\n\nPros:\n-The game itself might not be amazing, but when it was made on the 360 it was only 50mb in size. The PC port obviously doesn't have the same strict size limitations that early Xbox Arcade titles had of course (and they seem to have increased the game's overall size to over 300mb, probably higher quality sound and textures were the result). But still, considering that it originally was very small and yet still a fairly pretty game for its time is an engineering feat one can at least apreciate.\n-Has good music.\n-Very pretty art design.\n-Core gameplay concepts for a 3D physics Puzzler are at least amusing and it has a generously wide selection of weapons and tools.\n-Has a sense of humor.\n\nOK, now the reason why despite those things I can't reccomend this title:\n-The game crashes. Only an hour and a half into it I seem to have run into a part of the game that constantly ends the game and brings up an error code.\n-Incredibly bad difficulty curve, some of the levels are absolute boring cakewalks (namely combat) and then the game will throw you into a 'boss puzzle' that will have you pulling your hair out in frustration as you try and figure how to beat a boss that constantly curb stomps you with plasma fire.\n-Glitchy and inconsistent physics which make getting around in the levels a bit of a pain at times. This isn't that huge of an issue though.\n\n\nWith all this in mind, I am going to jump back into the game and see if I can't complete it anyway despite the game ending bug.\n\nEDIT: I was able to get past that part that kept crashing but only 30 minutes later I ran into another issue, a door that was supposed to open at the end of a boss fight failed to open (I think its because the boss got stuck on some level geometry and the door just never triggers) So yeah unfortunately I'm not going to finish this one."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1497402631, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32401222", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198326860020", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1497475005, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 205}, "timestamp_updated": 1497402631, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I remember playing this game back when it came out on the xBox.
