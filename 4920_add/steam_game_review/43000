Story is predicatable but the gameplay itself is great. Beat it in one sitting so I wouldn't count on a long haul. Community seems dead so don't count on multiplayer either. My only real complaint (gameplay wise) is the movement while using the boost; seems very rigid for something that is supposed to be evasive.

I just cant give this game the credit because it was ported from console to the PC for one and a bad port control wise.  They tried but I feel like it controls wrong even after remaping half the buttons to meet my needs and makes me feel you nood a game pad to get the full experience.  I will admit I felt like I was in the world of Front Mission but the cut scenes are too long for such an engagement based game. \nPros:\n- Front mission world done right\n- Decent Graphics and visual effects\n- With game pad it's a decent FPS\n- Decent Enemy AI for wanzers\n\nCons:\n- Keyboard and mouse controls are just wrong\n- Cutscenes are too long and make you feel pulled out of the action\n- Some characters are great while I feel the main charatcer was lacking\n- Friendly AI left most of the fighting to me and sat back doing nothing\n- Enemy AI for almost all \"mobile\" platforms sit as open targets.\n- Sound could use some more work.  Many of the weapons are too quiet."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505601053, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506173", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35008751", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197983215263", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1505600966, "num_games_owned": 631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 319}, "timestamp_updated": 1505601053, "received_for_free": false, "review": "One crash per level in the middle of the level, and the crash results in you having to replay the level.

However, I can't say I loved it, and so far, I've had no interest in going back to play it again.\n\nThe plot and dialogue are mediocre at best, and the overall design reminds me of something built within the limitations of an older console like PS2.  It also tends to be ridiculously easy, until the final boss encounter.  I don't remember what the controls were like, but I don't think they were too much of an issue, other than not being customizable.\n\nI don't recommend paying more than $5 for this game."}]}
