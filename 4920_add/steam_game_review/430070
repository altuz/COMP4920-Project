I actually like it enough that I think I'm going to replay it to find anything I may have missed just for the hell of it. As is expected with early acess/alpha games there are a few elements that need adjusting, but overall I really liked the concept, puzzles and gameplay. The scares were good too. I have high hopes for where Never Again is going.
