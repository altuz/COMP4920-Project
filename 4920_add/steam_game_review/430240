But first, let's look at what the game could have improved on.\n\nMy main complaint with Duplexer is the fact that all the levels I've played (the first 20) appear to be too finicky. Most of them require large amounts of push-pulling to get to the exit due to the abnormally large size of the level, even though it's absolutely clear how to do so; level 3 alone requires at least 20 pulls.\n\nThen there are a number of levels where you literally have to parkour your way towards the exit (after push-pulling the blocks). Combined with the over-sensitive jumping mechanic (which only allows you to jump up one space but along about 5 spaces), this results in large amounts of unnecessary failure which means continually re-solving the level again and again until you FINALLY not overshoot the block you're trying to land on (this happened four times to me in the same level).\n\nThe green pillars can only be pulled; the red pillars only pushed. It goes without saying that this creates the real potential for softlocking if you accidentally pull a green pillar one space too far, or push a red pillar one space too far. It's 2016, what sort of madman still puts softlocks in their games?!\n\nLet's not forget about the fact that you can't move a pillar you're standing on (while I see that it prevents the player from being squashed, it also creates extremely annoying situations, like having to move two pillars at once and repeatedly jumping between them in order to climb higher). As well as the fact that trying to pull a pillar through a cube is impossible for no good reason, meaning you have to click on that tiny tiny sliver of pillar not obstructed by the cube.\n\nGiven all of these drawbacks, you really expect me to slog through 100 levels of this mess?! Before you claim that there's some mechanic later on that will make everything better, note that that doesn't change a thing about my complaints based on what I've seen so far. Either cut out the finicky shit and condense the good parts of your game down into a 20-level pack, or if you're literally incapable of doing so, don't even try to sell this on Steam.\n\nAll in all, an overly-finicky game that does little to show that it is even trying to appeal to puzzle gamers. Given what I've played so far, I wouldn't even play it for free. Save your money for Q.U.B.E instead; a game with similar mechanics, actual puzzles, and a jump that isn't oversensitive.\n\nOh, and as for that \"First\" title? \"First game edderiofer is refunding.\"", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 468, "steamid": "76561198051304382", "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "last_played": 1467391002}, "recommendationid": "23990183", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506383", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1467392582}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1458612685, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Ok here is the first REAL REVIEW:\n\nI finished the game on principle alone.  The only reviewer who actually finished.  I still cannot recommend this game based on certain aspects.\n\nFirst, you will fail. \n\nThis is a running joke in this game as you are forced to fail at random times.  Not my style of hardcore joking?  This is built around speed racers, and as I know speed racers, you die a bazillion times before you master the level.  This is not my style of game play, but that's what the developers wanted to cater towards.\n\nLEVEL 44 and VARIOUS random levels:  Beware this game is not like others, no previous clues will help you understand that maps are never mentioned or that guessing (getting lucky) is a skill.  No, this is not.  It is tedious and forces a failure.  \n\nIf this game was designed so you die, then memorize everything as you die, it's exhausting.  This game is not forgiving.  Jumping/glitching balls/ cubes etc, somethings will collide in unexpected ways.\n\nAfter finishing the 100 levels, jumping is not very well polished, even though you can learn to master it, if you die five billion times.  You will be forced to adapt to the jumping sensitivity that is presented. USE LIGHT PRESSURE.  When moving through certain mazes with jump pads, make sure to look down and stay centered on cubes as you tap lightly with a keyboard.  This game can be unforgiving later on, which is a speed runner mentality in design.\n\nIt's not all jumping, there are some good puzzles... and SOME of those puzzles are about 70%+ of the game.  Only a small portion is truly tedious... if you can get to it...\n\nAlso, the steam achievements do not work first try.  I'm missing some that should have completed.  Still is what it is.  \nRated 6/10   \n\nPrice point: $5 would be what it's worth in reality.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 63, "steamid": "76561198026029198", "playtime_forever": 1027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 1459476589}, "recommendationid": "21975127", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506121", "votes_up": 3, "developer_response": "Hi DrewIsNotJewish,\n\nI understand all the problems you have, to begin, Level 44 is not simply a \"glitch\" to make your way through the floor, there is a map provided on the wall which shows the location of the hole in said floor.\n\nSecondly the jumping mechanics, it does take some time to get used to the jumping mechanics however we received [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198277893006/recommended/430240/]some feedback[/url] that there was not enough air control given to the player and adjusted the values accordingly, this did have the adverse effect you are feeling of you acceleration too quickly and past the point you wanted to jump to.\n\nAs far at the Steam Achievements are concerned, if you completed the level by going through the teleporter (and not using the console commands) while being online on Steam then the achievements should have registered.
