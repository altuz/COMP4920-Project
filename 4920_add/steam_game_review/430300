You control a small triangle that is put up against an onslaught of bullets with only one live. One kill you're dead, restart. The great thing about this game is the mechanics: any time you shoot, or while your shots connect, you will be invincible for a short while, indicated by your triangle turning red. In order to give you enough invincibility time, you can not only lock onto enemies, but also bullets. The game quickly ramps up its difficulty very quickly, so it's not for the easily angered.\n\nBeware though: options are extremely limited: no key rebinds (360 controller is supported), no fullscreen option (only 1:1 scale and a 1.5x increase of that resolution).

I have played several shmups, but not really any with lock-on shooting (the only one that comes to mind is some of the DLC in DariusBurst Chronicles Saviors).  This game is very simple:  lock onto enemies and bullets, shoot, watch them explode.  As you watch them explode, you are invincible, which is the key to survival in this game.  This becomes surprisingly addictive and I always find myself pressing A to start a new game even after I told myself that my last run would be my last for the day.  There are no options, setting, cut scenes, ship select, or text to go through when starting a game...you are in the action immediately so this is a great game to play for only a few minutes (though you may end up playing for much longer, like I do).", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 82, "steamid": "76561198055981406", "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "last_played": 1467240074}, "recommendationid": "23685306", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499822", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1466514498}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1498041330, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I rate the game Minus Zero 1/5. Bad.\n\nThis is a (very) basic 2-dimensional Schmup arcade style of game with extremely minimalist graphics. Nearly all graphics consist of mere geometric shapes, some of which are hollow and others of which are solid and glowing. The music is similarly basic, consisting of various obviously computed generated sounds in the chip-tunes style though it is not particularly well done.\n\nUnlike most Schmup style games, in Minus Zero you have to move your ship so that a targeting reticle projected a few inches above your ship is able to get a target lock on to each enemy. Only after a target lock has been achieved will the game allow you to fire your homing missiles (your only weapon). This unusual style of schmup gameplay wouldn't be so bad though (though it does take some getting used to) if it were not for the fact that explosions often severely hamper your ability to see enemies and enemy projectiles. Worse still, from the outset, this game gives you but a single life. Get hit just once and you have to start from the beginning of the game.\n\nThe game runs fast and is free of bugs. The menu and configuration options are extremely basic but the game technically works well (thus causing me to avoid rating it 0/5) and the default controls feel adequate. As you progress however, explosions become increasingly plentiful and it becomes increasingly hard to see where your \"ship\" is and where enemies and their projectiles are at any given time. By level 3 the game becomes a jumble of explosions which merely serve to block your view. Because of the extremely poor visual design of this game I cannot recommend that anyone else waste time playing it, not even for the ultra-cheap 2 dollar price tag. Ultimately, Minus Zero's poor visual design cause it to be far more frustrating than fun. Whether or not the poor visual design was created intentionally is irrelevant; the intentions of the game's designers don't change the fact that the game is still frustrating.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 269, "steamid": "76561198075673573", "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 149, "last_played": 1498036799}, "recommendationid": "32614730", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498041330}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1470286962, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Great game!\n-Reduce 'splosion fx so player tracking is viable\n+The leaderboard and replay systems are great and should be in every score attack game", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 61, "steamid": "76561198019649412", "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1470340318}, "recommendationid": "24702224", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.494477", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1470286962}, {"votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_created": 1466158750, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "If it wasn't for the odd choice of special effects vomit all over the screen the game would be pretty decent.
