You attackers may win without capturing the enemy base, they can kill all the troops.\n\nSo, yes I recommend this game to you and your friends,  better start training for Stratember is approaching (Strategic Map) the latest update brought old and new players into the game preparing for strat, and no the game isn't dead.", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 214, "steamid": "76561198053756278", "playtime_forever": 10844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1272, "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1507140687}, "recommendationid": "34886857", "votes_down": 12, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.520395", "votes_up": 38, "timestamp_updated": 1505153051}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505301584, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Of kings and men has had a rough time and the original developers of the game under the pressure of the publishers promised things that simply were not ready to be released and making false promises while setting their admissions too high for their first game. But the one thing they did do right was make an awesome combat system so I commend them for that. \nWith the new devs coming in and taking over the updates and content has been in full force and it finally seems like we are getting somewhere. This really excites me and the rest of the core-veteran players who have stuck with the game through its community dubbed \u201cdark ages\u201d.\n\nCombat: The combat system at its core is an 8 attacking and blocking directional system. But its soo so much deeper than that! Within the combat there's shoves, kicks, quick high risk high reward counter attack parrys. Also you can stop your attacks mid swing and faint your opponent and change your attacking angle or you can faint even more than once and really try to trip your opponent up. But you know don\u2019t go overboard or it will look like your character is having an epileptic seizure mid fight. Anyway the point is trying to get to is that the combat system is very very deep and provides an almost endless combination of attacks and fighting styles. Often new players will be woefully bad at the beginning and get destroyed by the veteran players. Most of the bad reviews of this game are from players with very low hours which I suspect is because they are bad gamers and didn't understand or were overwhelmed by the combat in this game then just quit. I've even seen reviews from these low hour players who have said the combat is simple, again i suspect they didn't get into the more advanced fighting mechanics that you need to fight at the top level.\n\nStory: So I like combat games that have a nice story element to them. Unfortunately Of Kings and Bois Does not have any real story elements as of yet. Hopefully we will see some more story features in the future. \n\nGraphics: The graphics In my opinion are very nice and fit the feel of the game well and really set a nice medieval atmosphere. In terms of specifics the artists have gone for a realistic style and that can sometimes lead to higher poly assets that you wouldn\u2019t find in a more cartoony looking game, but the artists have done a good job making low poly, well textured and normal mapped assets and terrain. This is great because it's easier for us to play it on low end rigs and get high fps. \n\nPlayer base and community: So this is another area that all the negative reviews focus on, and yes the player base is low but telling people it's flat out dead is a lie. Every night there is more and more players on and it finally feels like the game in becoming alive again. At the moment this game is very much a peek hour game on EU and US servers so to really experience playing in big teams with others you will have to join in peak hours (6-10 gmt +0). As for the community in the game it's a very alive and tight knit one with a few main clans that have regular fights and organised wars. If you want to get involved you should check out the official OKAM discord and forums, and if you want to get the most out of the game you should join a clan and experience organised combat as well as training from some of the best players.\n\nFinal thoughts: As you can probably tell I very much like this game, I\u2019m completely enamored by the combat system and its depth also the community in this game is a lovely one to be apart of, it keeps me entertained. I understand that this game might not be the most user friendly game and very approachable to casual gamers who just want to exercise a medieval battle or two, but i implore you to give it a shot and learn the mechanics. I really want this game to succeed! P.s sorry for the long read I didn't mean for it to be this long.  \n", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 81, "steamid": "76561198118806429", "playtime_forever": 24326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1266, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1507045585}, "recommendationid": "34917555", "votes_down": 7, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.511811", "votes_up": 27, "timestamp_updated": 1505301584}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505303942, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "I have 690+ hours in the game and I have mostly have a good time.

The Combat seems to work as it was intended with archery needing some work with the aiming, but still works. (current aiming system has quite the learning curve, with tracking the arrow/bolts being difficult.)\n\nAs of now the game has quite the weapon selection, ranging form several Arming swords, hand and a half swords, two handed swords, Axes, blunt/maces, Polearms, pikes/spears, bows, and crossbows alongside a selection of shields that will continue to grow. \n\nwith the game taking place in a medieval time period we of course have a selection of different armor and parts that complete the medieval soldier and also ever expanding.\n\nBeing a Media artist and Animator myself, I take more interest in the Aesthetic part of the development since I have a far more of an Understanding in the matter. \n\nThe Animations still need alot of work as there are many secondary animations for the players character that are missing that makes the character seem less organic for Ex. The Movement is missing alot of secondary action that takes place while bearing arms like swords and bows that will have a negative impact on personality if not addressed, but i have seen some changes to animations that have improved on that issue quite a bit.\n\nwith the Aesthetic part of development taking more focus later after the core parts of the game is closer to finished. content for the game comes out as fast as possible. since the game is still pretty early in development most of the focus is on the more complicated side of the games development it will seem a bit slow. The developers do have a test server that the Early access community partakes in active testing for new implementations for game modes, game mechanics, new weapons, armor, character customization, and maps.\n\nNow we all know what comes with purchacing an Early Access and i feel some people forget that the warning that comes with an Early Access shouldn't be taken lightly. Most of us hate waiting and i understand that, but proper development of a game takes time as many trial and error will be in the path from beginning and even after the end. \n\nIn conclusion, i do recommend the game to people who wish the help the developers financially support the development of this game, as the world we live in, money is unfotunatly important for funding projects especially projects as expensive as game design. I hope this review helps with seeing the game in a perspective that Early Access Projects should be looked at, and as many people of the OKAM community including myself hope to see this game flourish as the game starts to take its true form.
