Cards don't work as intended, the interface is convoluted, quality-of-life features like being able to save progress between matches is curiously absent, some of the information you'd expect in a card game is unaccounted for, and sometimes it just stops.  Full-on game-killing stalls. I have yet to be able to finish a game as the zombies, which is quite the problem in a game based on two playable factions.  \n\nExecution excepted, the design is top notch.  The long-term collectibility and progression are exactly what an online CCG needs.  The variety of ways to play is a delight.  And I freakin' *love* the R-rated gore-hound aesthetic, featuring slick photography instead of anything that might slip into an uncanny valley.  The models, cosplayers, make-up, expressive poses, and CG additions are like no other videogame I've played, and they put Night on Earth to shame.

So many traps or other cards instantly kill a survivor.
