Maybe it was because I played it at daytime, and not usual nighttime when I play VN. Maybe because I felt like it was too rushed because of my wrong choices, but I couldn't feel sad about the outcome of the main story.\n\n[spoiler] BUT MAN, THAT FRIGGIN REUNION PART TORE MY HEART TO FRIGGIN' PIECES!!! I was so friggin' sad for that dad, I was waiting for the son to come, I was waiting all along, I was saddened at the fact that he may not come when it became nightfall, and daaaamn that letter was so harsh it became hard to continue. Sure the dad was a piece of damn [b] sh*t [/b] but he didn't deserve that! He changed! Being able to change at such an age is incredible, so that ending was so damn sad...\n\nAlso, idk about you guys, but that android the dad got before it became Lucy was damn nice, wish she had voice lines as well. [/spoiler]\n\nAll in all, a better VN than I thought it'd be after 2 hours of playtime, went from the usual to better, and better to DAYUM SON. I wouldn't call it clich\u00eb, but other than the Extra, [spoiler] Reunion [/spoiler] , it wouldn't have hit me as hard as it did, and it deserves its fair share.\n\n[b] Art: 8/10. [/b] Thinking about the fact that it was only for 10 euro, not bad. There are a few CG's (like, a page and 1/4th of a page), but what mattered was not just the CG, it was the whole game, right? Even when people were at their usual scenes, art was actually quite good, though not astuonding.\n\n[b] Music: 7.5/10. [/b]  Got too used to the music of the game tbh, nothing way too special about it, but when it counted, the music hit in, not bad, not bad at all.\n\n[b] Characters: 9/10. [/b] For the low amount of characters in the VN, I actually liked every character that was somewhat important. What annoyed me slightly was that we got to see some random man and he got a character, but we didn't get to see [spoiler] his dad as he was old in Reunion, nor Doctor Ryu [/spoiler] . Their personalities were damn nice though, each and every one of them. Dr. Gears is my brother from another mother.\n\n[b] Story: 9.2/10. [/b] It was quite dear to the heart, and the concept was good, but yet hit a few cliches from time to time, whether that is good or not is up to you, for my taste, I'd rather have it totally original and for itself. Extras were nice, and not what you'd expect from extras\n\n[b] Overall: 8.4. [/b] Not a bad score, not a bad game, not bad at all. Some people may argue it was way better (for its price, perhaps, or just that it was simply that good), but maybe it's also because of myself that I couldn't feel too much during the main story. I conclude that it is quite a good game, and you should give it a try, 9.99 euro ain't much, and it's even less on sale, so for what you get, it's definetly worth it.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 102, "steamid": "76561198073966092", "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 433, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506873422}, "recommendationid": "35388190", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500011", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506875268}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505001522, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This was a really good visual novel that highly exceeded my expectations.
