It is very similar to a RTS game where you control the movement of your Peeps, collect resources, and fight of enemies. You have an end goal and you try to get there as quickly as possible. I enjoy it and I revisit the game to try to better my fastest time. The game is well made, very polished, and fun. If you enjoy RTS games then I completely recommend that you at least try this game. You can enjoy it in VR or on a 2d screen. I have never played it on a 2d screen but I dont think one way is more enjoyable than another. I hope they may a Tethered 2 with more cools features soon.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 83, "steamid": "76561197970032389", "playtime_forever": 4460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 365, "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1507145300}, "recommendationid": "34978823", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.496499", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505501506}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505964831, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Watching the little guys doing their stuff is amazing on VR, the game looks beautiful, and the touch controllers work great. As and RTS game is empty and repetitive, there are no many relevant options and you basically have to build one or two buildings of certain type to win. Very relevantly: there is no continuous gaming option, so you only get to \"play god\" for a little, fairly stressful time, and don\u00b4t get to see the results of your good management: It would be nice, after the level is done, to have the chance to sit back and relax, just adjusting things here and there, and spend some time watching the little guys do their stuff, which is the most beautiful aspect of this game. It would be nice to have a sort of \"Free level\" with much more space and building options.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 182, "steamid": "76561197986202561", "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 371, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506805172}, "recommendationid": "35096652", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506011083}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 6, "total_positive": 73, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 79}}
