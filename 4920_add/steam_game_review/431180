I remember back in the days I used to come home and just hang with friends and enjoy the single player mode, which as amazing re-playability considering I am AGAIN playing the game after a long break from it. SO much has changed since 2007 (I believe), more animals to hunt, graphics have improved, weather and day varies throughout, multiplayer has improved greatly, ranks have been added, more customization and maps to explore etc etc. The game even began to include human impact, which is a natural event of life these days, almost portaying that the game is keeping up to date with the world, I like that! Now that the game also has achivements to reach, the game is more challanging and sucking me in a lot more AGAIN!\n\nIf I had to criticize this game in anyway is that the public chat became painfully tricky to enjoy, considering the last time I tried it most of my sentence turned into ??? because the team have heavily filtered down some words to the point it became hard to enjoy, although I understand the reasoning behind it, but I believe maybe in the nearby future that a more less stricted chat for those who are more mature (This meaning in the sense you can say 'he' and 'she' for RP purposes because I've noticed in those aspects it's hard to create a sentence without those terms). Again I am unsure if there was any updates about this but this is going on a couple of years ago when I used to be heavily playing the game on Multiplayer instead of single player.\n\nEDIT: It seems that my point was based on the older versions of the game, the chat has HEAVILY improved since I last played it! I'm so impressed!\n\nI really hold this game dear to my heart, even my brother remembers helping me downloading the game way back when I was young and found out about this game through Youtube. Thank you Wolf Quest for being my escape when I was young and my escape now!\n\nP.S. I had this game before I had it on Steam, I recently purchased the game on Steam to enjoy again!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 30, "steamid": "76561198352028762", "playtime_forever": 1181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1181, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506801043}, "recommendationid": "35220906", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506586836}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506165453, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "this game is amazing.

I hope you keep updating it and making more animals and such. I love it because it captures the life of a wolf hunting elk and the grappling, taking care of pups feeding them growing them and protecting them. I really hope everyone loves this game! Keep up the updating and the hard work! And i was wondering (i know this is about wolves) but could you add, playing as an elk herd or a moose in multiplayer?
