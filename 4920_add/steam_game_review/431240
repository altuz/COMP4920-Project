Now turn that shit up to eleven. Golf With Your Enemies\u2122 is a game that pits you and your former friends, compatriots, and allies against each other in a high stakes game of golf to the death. \n\nDoes this shit have ball collision? You bet your fucking ass it does.\n\nDoes this shit allow you to jump your ball like you\u2019re fucking Tony Hawk at the X-games? What kind of pussy question is that? Of course it does!\n\nCan you get pissed while you play? Abso-fucking-lutely!\n\nGolf With Your Enemies\u2122 is all about destroying your friends and making them cry. You can DUNK them! You can CLASSIC them! and you can CUSTOM them to death, too!\n\nThis game is more badass than Jason Bourne punching Jack Bauer in the mouth using an armed grenade as brass knuckles. Candyland may be pink, but you know it gets more chicks than you ever will. Haunted may be buggy as hell in its current Early Access state may be impossible to par, but who cares?\n\nThis shit is gonna have a level editor.
