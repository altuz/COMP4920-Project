I somewhat enjoyed the conquest by numbers, however theres a mechanic that completely ruined the experience for me. It's called the morality system.\n\nBasically if you successfully defend or upgrade some buildings your morality goes up. When it increases, troops defend buildings better and become stronger. The main problem with this is that it punishes players who attack first and can expand faster. You're forced to attack second if you want a gaurenteed victory. You wait until the enemy attacks, get your moral boosted than go on offense and steal a building and repeat. \n\nScenarios take forever because you just wait and wait and wait for the enemy to make a move, you have to wait for the enemy moral to go down, you have to wait until your troops fill back up. And it ultimatly becomes a waiting game. It's a decent game, not worth $11. \n\nAlso theres no one to play multiplayer with.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 127, "steamid": "76561198048564701", "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1499049565}, "recommendationid": "33164322", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.535621", "votes_up": 19, "timestamp_updated": 1499356469}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1499202912, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "So YEARS back, I played this browser game called Civilizations Wars. It worked pretty much the same way: Your buildings generate people and you command them to bash their heads against enemy buildings until only one clan is left.\n\nWhat Civilizations Wars didn't have was an upgrading mechanic for buildings. What you captured is what you got. The controls weren't as good, to select multiple buildings you had to keep your mousebutton pressed and mouse over all the ones you wanted. And it always sent out half of the men in a building.\n\nWhat Civilization Wars DID have however, were spells that you could use, perks you could upgrade for your clan, boss battles, slightly different clans, later versions had heroes, and more. Additionally the maps looked really pretty compared to the bland, flat ones here and the art style had a nice touch.\n\nThis made for a more engaging game over a longer period of time. On this one, I got bored about an hour in. I played the maps on hard in hopes of unlocking something, but the \"rewards\" were just little achievement icons.\n\nThe gameplay is so basic, that I didn't feel like investing any more time.
