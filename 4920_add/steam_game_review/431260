Granted, the story wasn't great, but I've played plenty of HOGs/adventure games with much less coherent writing that are just as campy and cliche, if not more so.  At least it was fluent with a plot that made sense despite being pretty ho-hum.  The gameplay was enjoyable enough, although I found myself missing the occasional hidden object scene.  Ultimately, you spend most of the game finding key after key after key, but I was okay with that as long as I was given beautifully painted locations to search through. And the artwork is indeed beautiful!  It's definitely worth it for the gorgeous graphics and monster design alone (there's some really awesome looking uglies in this one).  Just don't expect too much of the story and you'll be fine.", "comment_count": "4", "author": {"num_games_owned": 2214, "steamid": "76561197999732661", "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 201, "num_reviews": 67, "last_played": 1506884926}, "recommendationid": "35393721", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.620251", "votes_up": 66, "timestamp_updated": 1506885971}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 50, "total_positive": 97, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 147}}
