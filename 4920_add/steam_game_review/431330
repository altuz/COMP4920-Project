Would have stuck with this if it was in Early Access. I love the genre of RPG Roguelikes, as this type of game happens to be my favorite. I've never found myself having to figure out button mappings and being one hit killed at full health on so many different occasions. I read the sign and it didn't say anything about \"Y\" on the controller being the interact button for Enchanters. I was looking forward to playing this game and have been checking the store for it everyday up until it came out to see if the Dev said anything. It's just simply not finished and I wish there was any sort of mention as to whether or not there will be any further updates anywhere on the store page because I can't seem to find one. I understand one hit kills and everything after having played games like Spelunky and Nuclear Throne and games of the like, but this is absurdly unplayable. I'll keep checking back in on it to see how it does because I really wanted to have another game to constantly do runs and level characters in. It's not the time waster that I was hoping for. All negatives aside, the game is charming in its artstyle and could be really fun with a little more polish.\n\nEDIT: Good on the dev for adding the interaction button to the list of commands so soon after this review was written.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 398, "steamid": "76561198044958707", "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1452059043}, "recommendationid": "20343097", "votes_down": 8, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.516610", "votes_up": 17, "timestamp_updated": 1452160608}, {"votes_funny": 4, "timestamp_created": 1452222538, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Pros and Cons\nPros\nI Like how old school it feels and does make a great challenge \nGood amount of wepons and such\nYou cant just run-in melee every where, you have to think about your actions\n\nCons\nThe movement keys are hard to learn ( for everyone else, just change them )\nIt's not the game you want to start off with, but fun\nYou didn't do go in too much detail on the keys ( which leaves me madly pressing all of them )\n\nHowever\nNo games 100% purfect on the relase and i want to see what this game give us ( player ) in the feature\n\nWhat i think you should do\nMake the controls a-tad simpler to learn\nHave a button in-game that pops up the keys and what they do\nAdd a quick, small starting level for us to try and test different key-combos\n\nIn the end it needs some work but can turnout to be a top game\n\nKeep up the work!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 45, "steamid": "76561198271130364", "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1452621528}, "recommendationid": "20388856", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.497447", "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1452222538}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1452350543, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!\n\nIt could have been ok if the dev put ALOT more work into it.

Ihave to alt  tab out and close application? this game would have been a lot better if these issues and other minor issues were adressed not sure why these small things sliped through.
