[i]The Legend: A University Story[/i] falls into that category. I generally don\u2019t mind early access games, and I\u2019ve bought dozens, but this doesn\u2019t even seem to be in any sort of playable alpha phase. The developer also states in the early access info: [i]\u201dFurthermore, we hope to use these proceeds to examine the possibility of our next title: \"The Legend: Tales from the Bayou\u201d.[/i] That\u2019s all well and good, but I\u2019d like a working game first, before another one is made.\n\nI bought the game on July 27th with the intention of playing it then and getting some video, but I wasn\u2019t able to due to time constraints. I played it the next day, finished chapter zero and played a bit of chapter one. I intended to sit down today (Sunday), take a video and play it fully, but after a recent update, I now can\u2019t. Whenever I try to start a chapter, it puts me into some weird looking water. I try swimming, but get nowhere. Blood slowly takes over my screen because I\u2019m clearly drowning, I die, then the game crashes to desktop with two errors.\n\nFrom my little time with it a couple of days prior, it was interesting, albeit very rough. Chapter Zero has you playing as a security guard in a university library. You need to check out six specific areas, which you can roughly relate to collecting notes in Slenderman-type games, while avoiding a mysterious figure who doesn\u2019t ever seem to walk toward you. If you get up behind him, he\u2019ll continue walking away, and as long as you don\u2019t touch him, you\u2019re safe. If you\u2019re in front of him but not directly in his path, he\u2019ll go right past you. I checked the six areas, proceeded to the basement, found a ritual sort of thing, then the game crashed.\n\nUpon restarting, I tried out chapter one, which is where you play as the rookie security guard who was talking to you in chapter zero. You\u2019re supposed to monitor a bank of cameras for an intruder, while occasionally getting up to walk around the area and check it out. Unfortunately, once the other guy stopped talking, I was \u201cstuck\u201d on one of the screens, and couldn\u2019t switch to another camera or get up to investigate. After pressing all the keys the game told me to use for that chapter, it crashed.\n\nI didn\u2019t bother with chapter two. Apparently there are more chapters coming, but it would be fantastic if the developer fixed what was wrong before adding new chapters which will inevitably also be buggy.\n\nThe only thing I can say with certainty is that the game looks fairly good, and for something that\u2019s running on CryEngine, it should.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list][*]It\u2019s cheap\n[*]Potential is there\n[/list]\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list][*]Doesn\u2019t keep resolution setting upon exit, requiring you to change it each time\n[*]Doesn\u2019t always keep resolution change upon setting, requiring you to ALT+TAB out and back in to refresh it\n[*]Mouse inversion defaults to on for some odd reason\n[*]Many, many crashes\n[*]Main menu needs to be loaded after every item (go to game settings, click back, load.

It has potential, and the few minutes I played before the developer broke it was interesting enough that I had intended to play it some more. Unfortunately, their hotfix broke chapter zero (I didn\u2019t test the others), and they\u2019re already talking about another game using the proceeds from a game that doesn\u2019t work. When many issues of the game extend to simple UI functionality that doesn\u2019t work, or is flat out broken, it doesn\u2019t bode well.\n\nIt has potential, and I\u2019d like to see how it pans out in the future, but at the moment, I can\u2019t recommend this at all. I will keep it installed and will RSS the news feed to stay on top of updates, and will gladly change this review when, or if, things change for the better.\n\nTo the devs, good luck with the game. You do have an interesting premise, it just needs a lot of work.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 2003, "steamid": "76561198040987377", "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "last_played": 1469975554}, "recommendationid": "24634849", "votes_down": 7, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.545221", "votes_up": 28, "timestamp_updated": 1469975578}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1469825914, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "From what I remember, this game was greenlit a few years ago, when all those Slender games were possible. The game, if I'm not mistaken is built from the Cry Engine.\n\nSo far I have only played the first chapter. It looks like there are three Chapters available, however the name of the last one is cut off so I am not sure if it's actually ready or not. You can definently tell it's an early access game, there are a lot of sound glitches and it's fair share of graphical glitches as well however it doesn't take away too much from the game play. \n\nThe atmosphere of the game is spooky for sure, the ambient soundtrack and musical cues add a lot to that. I don't know if it was my machine or not but playing the first chapter there was a constant static like fog over everything and it could be adding to the atmosphere of the game but at times I feel like it made it annoying, especially when looking at the screenshots, old and new, it doesn't seem to have that filter on them.\n\nI am a chicken when it comes to these games so my threshold may be a little bit lower than most people but so far, the game has its horror down pretty well. It had only a few jumpscares and mostly relied on trying to stay alive while escaping whatever is chasing you. I'll be including a game play video so everyone can get a feel of what gameplay is like.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbNkuhCv0L0&feature=youtu.be\n\nOverall, not a bad game. It's being made I think mostly by one person so I feel like a lot of the issues in the game I do have to let go. If you're a fan of the Slender games from a few years ago, I would say give it a try. If they are able to polish the game up, I feel like it will be a pretty solid horror game.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 144, "steamid": "76561198042111984", "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1470067717}, "recommendationid": "24602809", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.507415", "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1469825914}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1469947193, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Extremely far from being properly playable.\nrequires a very significant amount of polish on the first chapter alone, as well as actually finishing the three available chapters to a properly playable standard.", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 472, "steamid": "76561198012139879", "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1469797336}, "recommendationid": "24628654", "votes_down": 8, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.497948", "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1469947193}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1470110802, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "For an Early Access game, selling at like four bucks, this was definitely worth my time and money.\n\nPros\nGood Storyline\nFocused and Intense Atmosphere\nNear-Daily Updates for Bugs\nClearly still expanding\nVR & Co-Op Support (eventually, if I remember correctly)\n\nCons\nCryEngine 3 has some issues with saving settings & loading some levels\nOlder computers won't be able to handle the graphics\nStill in development, so an understandable amount of bugs\n\nReading some of these \"Not Recommended\" reviews, I've really had a spark in my curiosity.  I feel as though an Early Access Game, if it makes it past the Valve Team (initial build test), should not be held to a standard where players expect minimal bugs.  Half of the fun of Early Access games is experiencing these bugs and helping to mold the product by giving your feedback.  Furthermore, I don't feel as though titles like this should be held to a smilar standard as products like The Forest or Ark. Especially considering the size of the development team.  I think its only 1 guy, with a few people doing sound or something.\n\nFor all of these reasons, I definitely see the potential.  Plus, for all of the constant communication the developer has shown with the community, I give this early access title a 8.5/10.  Keep it up!
