Very realistic, but also very un-Hollywood like. It is even worse: you may very well have caused this disaster. In the meantime the radio keeps playing, the camera keeps recording, life keeps going on as though nothing is wrong. Except that it is.\n\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 60, "steamid": "76561198076527114", "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1492165499}, "recommendationid": "31132886", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1492166304}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1491882648, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "If you are a type of person who wants to interact with objects, etc. Then this game is not for you.
