I love marble rolling games.\n\nBut this is so obviously a ported mobile game, it's cringeworthy. The UI is huge and obnoxious, and everything is represented with symbols rather than text so you have to guess at what the button does...the controls are....horrible and clearly designed with tilt-controls, not a keyboard or controller. The game gives you power-ups (which you don't NEED) and doesn't explain how to use them...[Found it. It's ALT. But I only discovered that by pressing every key on the keyboard]\n\nApparently there's a story. But it has NOTHING to do with the game itself and might as well not be there. Dying is completely pointless as you have infinite lives and the game just puts you back on the map...so there's no point to it except wasting your time.\n\nAnd as for the \"egg\" sections... grr......! ONE level would have been enough as a novelty. We didn't need SIX.\n\nI dunno. I really wanted to enjoy this game but the bad controls and strange design choices make it very unpleasant to play.\n\nDON'T play this game with a controller - you'll want to snap it in frustration.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 2138, "steamid": "76561197989591969", "playtime_forever": 718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 150, "last_played": 1498827509}, "recommendationid": "30191873", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504405", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1498827535}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487733409, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I'm going to start off this review with the typical \"I wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't\" trope, because that pretty accurately describes how I feel about this game. It does have a rather nice graphical style and the musical tracks are decently varied, but the rest of it just falls short.\n\nFirst, right off the bat, the gameplay camera and controls looked nothing like how it was presented in the video trailers. I took note that the game was supposed to be played off as a sort of Super Monkey Ball concept, in which the environment is tilted instead of the ball. But instead the ball was being controlled while the environment was left motionless. I tried messing around with the controls and camera views, but the closest I got was the backdrop/skybox tilting and turning while the platforms remained firm, which actually got very disorienting after a while.\n\nThe controls of the ball itself are pretty subpar as well. While I don't have a problem with how it rolls around the jumping is absolutely pitiful; it just barely gets you over the pitfalls and a holes you need to crossover, but it's practically useless in every other situation. I also cannot forget to mention the amount of torment that was the \"egg\" section of the game, where your perfect sphere character is transformed into a more egg shape, and while it was probably intended to be a quirky gimmick played off for laughs it just makes the platforming even more grating and irritating, as going up slopes are a bigger obstacle than the actual obstacles because of your unorthodox shape.\n\nPower-ups are extremely expendable, and rather than them being mandatory to help clear certain gaps or obstacles they're basically there just so you can take short cuts and skip integral parts of the level which, in hindsight, isn't a completely bad thing if you're going for a speed run, but otherwise they are just something that is there, but not really important to have, aside from one particular boss battle. And speaking of boss battles...\n\nBosses are also pretty much worthless. Even if you get killed you respawn instantly and the battle continues right where you left off. Dying essentially has no consequence during these boss battles and rather than it being a big reward when you finally defeat them it just becomes an inevitability. It's not fun.\n\nI wasn't disappointed at this just because it turned out to be yet another mediocre Steam game that lacked a severe amount of polish, I'm especially disappointed because marble/rolling ball games are some of my top favorite games to play anywhere, and this was yet another blemish within this genre of gaming that I had the dissatisfaction of playing.\n\nMazement misses the mark, and is not something to feel bad about skipping out on.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 67, "steamid": "76561198090318829", "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "last_played": 1487731206}, "recommendationid": "30091894", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506678", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1488033105}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1466934347, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Fun little game, got it on sale and finished it in 2.5 hours.
