Given that its only EA at this point in time, there will be more to come. I got the game on sale which is going on right now for a little less than half the original price and I am liking it. It does not feel as mature as Creativerse, but what it has already got the better of my curiosity.\n\nWhat I liked about it.\n- Its premise is based on fantasy and magic. (This was the main thing for me. I was looking around for a minecraft like game with better graphics and based on magic. BINGO!!)\n- It has a unique way of crafting in the game, through assembling blocks into shapes then casting a spell on it.\n- There are some very powerful functional controls given to players where creative mode crafting is involved. You can even make your own customized weapons, and other items. (I have not explored this area much yet, but from watching the available video I thought it was really facinating.)\n- You can make your own golems of various shapes and sizes by assembling the blocks into a recognizable shape and casting the spell (I doubt there is another game out there that lets you do this). And, you can command said Golem to mine for you.\n- Lots of blocks, colored blocks, materials, to allow you to get creative with your creations.\n- You can fly, throw fireballs, and shoot lightning.\n- Graphics definitely looked better than the pixilated stuff you see in minecraft and its clone.\n- The ingame map where you actually see all the activity going on in an area around you, including where the mobs are, what they are doing, where are the resources for you to go mining for, and where are the guarded chests-o-loot which you could go killing for.\n\nWhat I didn't like (it is my greatest hope that they exist now because its in EA)\n- Even though the graphics are better that minecraft, it could still be better.\n- There are some annoying bugs but not totally game breaking at this point. \n- Not much of a tutorial going on at this time.\n- Not a whole of lot content in terms of fun and interesting encounters.\n- The mob AI could be drastically improved on.\n- No caves and dungeons to explore (\"Yet\", I hope).\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 7, "steamid": "76561198371728422", "playtime_forever": 3355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1499584233}, "recommendationid": "31115582", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.529026", "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1492087153}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1497345194, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "With all the survival games out these days this game gives it a new twist that makes it stand out from the others I have tried.

It needs a tutorial, but you can figure things out fairly easily.  It's still in Early Access (EA), but it is one of the better EA games I have played!  It isn't nearly finished, but it is already fun to play!\n\nThe world that was generated for my first experience is beautifully rendered is high quality graphics.  I set the anti-aliasing from 1x to 2x (your only two choices) and it slowed the game down a bit.  It wasn't that much better, as the graphics already looked awesome!\n\nSound is good without any pops or glitches.  There was a storm brewing and it sounded awesome!  Creature sounds were great and scary at times.  I was being persued by a beastie and thankfully I found a building to hide in! I let my pet do the fighting while I ran away! lol  He died, but he showed up later when I was building stuff, so I guess he respawned?\n\nIt looks like a good deal of work has been put into this game already and it has some really great working ideas!  It still needs work, but it is playable and I never felt I couldn't advance in the game due to an unfinished part.  The map generated for me is HUGE!  It will take some time exploring this map! You can enter you own seeds for map generation.\n\nThere are beasties to fight, if you can figure out how to build a weapon! lol  I'm not that far into the game yet. If you die you just respawn, so it's not that punishing.  You'll build things like windmills and lightning rods to capture and harvest resources.  It's pretty cool!\n\nAs I said, there are some really great ideas here and many of them are already working and playable.  KUDOS to the dev's as this is looking to be an awesome game!  Please don't stop developement on this game as it could be one of the GREAT games here on Steam!!!  It's already fun and interesting! :-)\n\nThe game runs very smooth on my MacBook Pro:\n\nHardware Overview: \n\nModel Name:  MacBookPro 11,5 (Mid 2015)\nProcessor Name:  Intel Core i7\nProcessor Speed:  2.8 GHz\nNumber of Processors:  1\nTotal Number of Cores:  4\nL2 Cache (per Core):  256 KB\nL3 Cache:  6 MB\nMemory:  16 GB Type:  DDR3  Speed:  1600 MHz\nVideo Card:  AMD Radeon R9 M370X, VRAM 2048 MB\n\nOperating System: OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6 (64 bit OS)", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 790, "steamid": "76561198073648775", "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 119, "last_played": 1492115466}, "recommendationid": "31123925", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.508361", "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1492275658}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1495671427, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "good", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 16, "steamid": "76561198306613947", "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1493327944}, "recommendationid": "31943318", "votes_down": 27, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.443585", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1495671427}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 11, "total_positive": 37, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 48}}
