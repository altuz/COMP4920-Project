Don't be fooled by the simple game mechanics. To hit the exact right spot can be tricky.\nThe piano music is soothing and should prevent most players from rage quitting.\n\nIt is a good game to spend a few minutes now and then to unwind. As it is on sale at the moment for \u20ac 0.74 there is really no reason not to buy and try the game.\n\nThe game has trading cards, a fact not mentioned on the store page for reasons unknown. You can't take screenshots with the Steam overlay. I did it with Radeon Relive and uploaded them with SteaScree.\n\nYou have only two choices 'Save and Quit' and 'Save and Continue'. Once in the next level, you either have to finish the level to be able to exit the game or use brute force Ctrl+Alt+Del to get out of the game (I'm not aware of a key that lets you quit at any time).\n\nAs your performance is rated from one to three stars depending on how many 'strokes' you needed there is replayability for perfectionists.\n\nMidnight supports 4K resolution and runs well for me. The only glitch I noticed when your 'fairy' lands on a slope you have to wait until it slides to a horizontal area to be able to perform the next move.\n\nIt's an entertaining game which I recommend.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 2656, "steamid": "76561198167772276", "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "num_reviews": 47, "last_played": 1506040526}, "recommendationid": "35062767", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501250", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505824153}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 9, "total_positive": 14, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 23}}
