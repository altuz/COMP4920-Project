I was very excited to get the chance to experience something new and to support an indie VN developer. However, I am genuinely sorry to say that I have never before have I been so absolutely and utterly disappointed with a game. I wanted to like it so badly. It looked so promising, so interesting and it fell completely short. If it wasn\u2019t already too late, I would request a refund. Since that isn\u2019t an option, I\u2019ll try and provide as thorough of a review as I possibly can. \n\nART\n\nThe art is lovely, as long as you only look at the sprites. While I saw some inconsistencies with the sprites, overall I would say they are of amazing quality. The sprites are by far the strongest aspect of this game. But only the sprites. The backgrounds were obviously stock and clashed horribly with the art style of the sprites. At times the sprites looked fuzzy and out of place because of the backgrounds, considerably diminishing the immersion. \n\nMUSIC\n\nI see so many people complimenting the OST that I have to wonder if they were actually listening to the same music I was. The tracks are bland and uninteresting and obvious stock material. The tracks do not loop very well, making it painfully obvious when a track suddenly repeats. For the most part, the tracks did fit in well, except for a few that felt incredibly strange and out of style compared to the rest of the OST. You could play this game muted and it would make no difference. \n\nWRITING\n\nThe writing was by far the weakest point of the game. The Protagonist is vapid, confusing, and inconsistent. The game provides choices that would suggest you\u2019re about to get some world building, and then immediately back pedals and undermines the player\u2019s curiosity and desire to know more about the world by saying \u201cask me later\u201d and never bringing it up again. A\n\n character is introduced as a stranger in the game\u2019s prologue, and once you purchase a route you are supposed to believe that he is the Protag\u2019s long lost friend, and then he is never mentioned again. Every unique thing about the protag that is established in the prologue is strangely forgotten until it\u2019s suddenly convenient to bring it up again. Each character route is advertised as its own complete story, but at the end (of at least Shinji\u2019s route) you know absolutely nothing about the protag. You never find out more about her powers, there is hardly any mention of what happened to her mother or the impact on her family or future, she never focuses on her magic beyond plot device, she never deals with her curse, and she has no resolution to her own dilemma. As the game progressed, she became increasingly annoying. Her character development is somewhere between nonexistent and shoddy at best.\n\nEvery single time skip felt awkward and unnatural. At times, the game introduces concepts you are simply supposed to accept without questioning. What is this gear thing that instantly changes your clothes like some magical girl anime? Why does the Protag not react to suddenly losing her glasses whenever she transforms? Who knows. I sure don\u2019t.\n\nIn Shinji\u2019s route specifically, I was completely disgusted how their fight was handled. They did not talk. They did not apologize to one another. They did not address their issues. Instead, everything was resolved with sex. And that was it. The subject was never brought up again. Because sex resolves everything and fixes all relationship problems. Who needs communication? I\u2019m very glad this is the lesson I walked away with. While I enjoyed Shinji as a character far more than the Protag, he had his own fair share of problems, beyond the whole sex solves everything dilemma. It is stressed multiple times that he is a kind a helpful person, but no examples are ever given to prove this. His big secret with the death magic and ghost possession business feels completely irrelevant. Even when it does come into play, it feels disorganized, like a first time writer trying to make their first OC as cool as possible.  \n\nI found multiple typos while reading and dialogue presented underneath the wrong name. I\u2019m pretty certain that Shinji did not intend to call his own father \u201cmy darling husband.\u201d On top of that, the GUI is bland and uninteresting. \n\nIn the end, I was left starving for more than what I got. I hate the Protagonist, I hate the lack of explanation for anything, I hate how absolutely needless half of the scenes that could have expanded on lore and side characters (who I adored, they were far more interesting than most of the main characters) felt. There was so much potential in this game, and I feel like all of it was wasted. Since I bought this game with Christmas money from my twin and I wish to honor his gift in every way, I'll continue to play what I purchased. Maybe my opinion will change, and I desperately hope that it does. If so, I'll gladly update this review.\n\nBut as of right now, honestly, in my eyes the only thing that made this game even remotely worth my poor brother's money was Shinji ripping out a still beating heart. That was beautiful. \n\nTL;DR\nPlay something else. There are other indie developers more deserving of your time and money.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 53, "steamid": "76561198086702903", "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1488072802}, "recommendationid": "29717783", "votes_down": 11, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.532466", "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_updated": 1486299825}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1480955201, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Story and Characters\n\nI have to admit, this is the best character route to date. Takumi has significant character growth and shows a lot of different emotions throughout the playthrough. The main story I believe, is the strongest yet out of all the routes and takes the player in for a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Like previous character routes, I really like how most characters appear in the other story routes and add depth to the development to the world and storytelling.  I also enjoy that unlike most Otome's where the answers are cookie cutter and easy to tell which are the \"bad\" answers, this game does not insult your intelligence and instead has more complex dialogue between the heroine and romance interests.\n\nArt/Animation\n\nOverall, animation was amazing. I have played a lot of Otome games in the past and this is one of the few that I can always remember for being visually stunning. I get lost just looking at the backgrounds and all the subtle changes in facial expressions each character shows. \n\nSound\n\nMystic Destinies: Serendipity of Aeons overall has an AMAZING soundtrack. I was really impressed with the music and sound effects in this game. Takumi's route in my opinion has the best music so far. The music fits the plot, characters and is so darn cool~ Of course that's Takumi approved.\n\nEnjoyment\n\nI am in euphoria at finishing Takumi's route. Takumi's story was intriguing, captivating, and thrilling at the end. It felt bittersweet when I finished and it kept me wanting more. By the end of the game you can really feel the power of the love that is shared between the heroine and Takumi. Takumi is a really well written character and with the strong plot it makes the player wanting to finish the game in one sitting. All this, with a really good soundtrack and one of the best romance routes in the game, I recommend this game because it is one of the best Otome games out right now. 10/10.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 115, "steamid": "76561197998178486", "playtime_forever": 1041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1498271257}, "recommendationid": "28205451", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500458", "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1480955201}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1486077893, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I'm pretty picky on what games to get let alone buy.

Each DLC has a unique story, with beautiful art and magical mystery thrown in it, that leaves you breathless and wanting for more. And it gets better with each DLC. I got to play the previous parts thanks to my friend, that recomended it, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on the latest part myself. The characters are realistic, distinctive and the story itself is emotionally engaging. Each story tells you a little bit about other main characters, just enough to pique your interest, and let you to get to know them just a little bit better (plus, I can't wait to finally find out what's up with the elusive 'mother' and her reasoning behind all of this).\n\nTakumi's route is my favourite one, though, tightly followed by Shinji's. I don't usually fall for 'childhood-friends-to-lovers' trope, but this time I fell and fell hard. I just love how gradually and slowly the relationship builds, how they overcome and face the troubles together. I'm a sucker when it comes to tragic endings, but this time, I thanked the creators this is not the case.
