I can see a lot of potential here with a nice intuitive interface and an effort by the developer to provide relaxing backgrounds. That said there is still a lot of work to do with the backgrounds lacking polish and the screens that you utilize not having as crisp a resolution as would be ideal (but that may be due to the Vive's limitations currently) All in all the developer seems to be moving in the right direction with this software. If you want to help support software that has a lot of promise then I recommend this, at least to keep in your library until it has a little more polish.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 467, "steamid": "76561198004196149", "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1478017623}, "recommendationid": "26441959", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502937", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1478374202}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1482255255, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "No improvements since launch.
