Settings are surprisingly comprehensive and there is even an option to select which monitor to use. Very nice if you have a TV attached to the computer and playing on a couch with controller.\nThe game is not so easy that you could just shoot at everything brainlessly, but you actually have to plan your moves at least until some point. It offers fast and easy fun, the first missions takes a couple of minutes but after that the missions gets tougher and last longer.\nImpressive first product from the team, highly recommended!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 202, "steamid": "76561197974378873", "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1467044239}, "recommendationid": "22532692", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.520866", "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1461156019}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1461141903, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "A great buy all-around. Mouse controls are simple and fun to use. You have to plan your actions most of times, can't just run n' gun through the game. That'll get your squad finished off in no time. Levels are not at all repetitive, it feels like I'm going somewhere, not just grinding the same corners over and over again. There's some definite challenge especially in bossfights. It took me fair amount of time to figure out the first boss. Shrapnel and bodyparts flying everywhere.. it was hell I tell you!! Everything was going fine and dandy before that moment.. I lost many good men that day. Haven't finished the game yet but felt the need to give these guys my thanks and support.

I think I'm about halfway through, and although it's simple, it has been fun and rewarding with each mission complete. If you use proper strategy, things will go smoothly. If your strategy is a bit messy, things can still go smoothly and it might be more exciting! There are definitely some \"puzzle\" elements sometimes. \n\nIt could use some AI for the enemies, so when they are under attack they don't just walk predictably into your line of fire. Other than that, it has been a fun experience and I intend on finishing! As you collect \"intel\" you get to see parts of the backstory and lore in graphic novel form, which is nice...I just am having trouble determining which order they go in!\n\nOverall, definitely worth purchasing and supporting this developer!
