There are 3 \"Quest Mode\" missions like in Doodle God, too, which are nice, but a bit more obscure.\n\nWhat's annoying is the new \"Hero Mode\", which is basically your character running forever to the right on a terrible grind fest. You're supposed to be able to collect gold and xp while you're away, but this worked only once for me. You basically don't do anything, you just wait and/or keep completing Gold Fever quests (the other quests take insanely longer). It's a completely unbalanced mode put there just so there's \"new content\".\n\nAll in all, it's an ok game if you disregard Hero Mode.

Certainly overpriced -you'd better wait for a sale. \n\nPros :\n+ Original concept\n+ Nice interface and funny little details\n+ Casual and relaxing\n+ Somehow entertaining\n+ No microtransactions\n\nCons:\n- Dumb Hero minigame which is required to play in order to get all the achievements\n- Absolutely no replayability\n- Extremely short\n- Figuring which elements to combine is sometimes beyond my logic\n\nLet me explain you the concept of the game. You start with a few items (in unlimited quantity) which you can combine with each other in order to produce new things, which can themselves enter into all sorts of combinations. The goal is to create everything. For instance, combining `Life' with `Cave' gives you `Trolls'. Combining `Magic' with `Parchment' gives you `Scroll'. And so on. So, yep, all you have to do is to try all your items to find out which ones can be combined together. \n\nYou have hints at your disposal. One hint is free and it reveals one of the element that you can obtain with what you already have. You can spam this hint as much as you want, though sometimes it won't be of much help. The other hint shows you two categories of items and tells you that there exists a combination between two items drawn from each of those categories -you still have to figure which. it reduces considerably the array of choices and is quite useful. Once you have used this hint, it reloads with time (I'd say one minute or so).\n\nOnce you have completed the main game, which takes one hour approximately, you can do quests. Quests lie on the same principle of the main game : combination of items to get what you need or what you want. You have little stories to go along with the process, which most of the time has no interest (the Necromancer's campaign being the must funny). Those quests are shorter than the main game.\n\nFinally you have this stupid mini game of a running hero who slashes monsters. You have nothing to do except clicking on heal when he is hurt, on reload when he is out of stamina, and on the occasional chests on your path. You can then buy upgrades with the goal, but frankly, it does not change anything. This is completely devoid of real interest but it can be captivating somehow (mindless clicking at a slow and dizzy pace ; perfect when you are utterly tired). \n\nAlso, this is a mobile port, so it says `tap' instead of click, but it is of no consequence.
