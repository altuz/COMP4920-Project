First things first, I absolutely [b]LOVE[/b] the soundtrack and now I understand why there's an option to download it seperately \u2014 definitely worth a buy! It sounds truly astonishing and nailed it on making people immerse themselves in the game environment. Kudos to the composer! It can't get enough praise, really.\n\nLet's get back to the game itself. The main characters, ION and ANI, are adorable. The A.I. narrating, however, is a bit on the annoying side for me personally, but not to the point where I couldn't continue playing. When the game tosses you in the world, it's a bit hard to know where you're supposed to be going. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily because the game world is pretty beautiful and it urges you to explore, especially knowing it's an indie game surprised me even more.\n\nI'm not entirely sure why people claim the game has bad optimization. Either their computers equal the computing power of a potato or they're simply lying. I don't think the game is [i]that[/i] demanding. On my end, the game ran pretty smoothly with everything on maximum graphics. \n\nDo I recommend this game?

Because this game is mostly one long escort mission.  Once you find the companion ANI you need to have her around to finish the game, but then have to spend your time making sure she does not die.  And she does not seem to take that nearly as seriously as you have to.  For instance, you can tell her to stay put while you go an explore some perilous situation, but eventually she follows you anyway.  WTF, ANI?  She also talks incessantly, but while every other AI in the game speaks words you can understand, ANI just makes R2-D2 sounds and her words appear on screen as text.  Remember this is an exploration game, so looking around and paying attention to your environment is important, but you now have the choice of (a) doing that, and missing everything she says, or (b) not doing that and reading all the words, then wishing you hadn't  because most of them are not important.

From all the games I played, it's close to the most *frustrating* game I know. Since it's a \"No\" review, I'll concentrate on the bad sides, and leave the good sides to others to describe.\n\nAssuming you haven't played it yet, I'd say that the game is about exploring, gathering resources, crafting tools and supplies, and looking after a \"suicidal girl\" (and that is my main issue with the game).\n\nMy issues with it are:\n1) The \"girl robot\" is not immune to the environment, like the player is. There is no way (that I have found so far), to undo the damage. That in itself would be an acceptable gameplay element, if it wasn't for the following issues.\n2) The \"girl\" apparently cannot walk-and-talk at the same time! I only know one girl like that IRL; she's 90 years old and obese! If *I* was a girl, I would be greatly offended. \"My girl\" definitely agrees with me on this.\n3) There are constant sand/rain/snow-storms, which damage the girl robot. Guess when she likes to start to monologue at length about flowers and butterflies? Yeah, in the middle of the damn storms, which are literally killing her!\n4) You have some minimum \"thrusters\" that allow you to go up, but as you go up, you loose the ability to move forward, which makes it nearly impossible to get to some places. In particular, if you're on a mountain and it gets too steep to \"walk\" up, using the thrusters usually result in you falling down, rather the going up.\n5) The devs have refrained from using the traditional \"invisible walls\" at the edge of the gameplay area, so that you (or at least I), regularly end up \"outside\" the part that the player is meant to \"stick to\", and it's usually impossible to come back from there. So make sure NOT to overwrite your last save, and keep using new slots.\n6) To force you to at all put up with that \"girl robot\", there is one kind of resource you need to gather for the end-game, which only she can \"sense\". And if you somehow lock her \"somewhere safe\", than the game will literally make the resource invisible, until you go back and bring the girl robot with you.\n7) There is \"coating\" you can apply to the girl robot so she takes less damage. I assumed she took damage when it was all gone, but it seems the damage is a percentage of the missing coating. Of course, the game only clearly tells you that once your half-way through the game, and she's already half-dead.\n\nI haven't finished the game yet, and suspect I won't, either because the girl will \"die\", or because I'll get to the end, only to notice that I have only 46/48 required \"special resources\" to finishe the game, most likely.", "comment_count": "11", "author": {"num_games_owned": 116, "steamid": "76561198011335672", "playtime_forever": 1288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505162152}, "recommendationid": "34858381", "votes_down": 20, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503242", "votes_up": 21, "timestamp_updated": 1505038934}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504584212, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "So far I am 40 minutes into this game, I am about to rescue the robot compani Ani.
