Safe to say, if you liked the last titles, you will like this one.\n\nIn fact, if you like turn-based tactics with a touch of RPG, and you don't need fancy graphics, this is a safe bet.\n\nInstead, I'd like to point out the additions to the series:\nThere is now an overland map in which you can pick multiple optional missions as well as the branching within missions sometimes.\nWith the two new armies there are many new units to choose - and you will meet a lot of units known from the last games.\nA bunch of new items and spells.\nThe graphics themselves have improved, even if just a bit. \n\nMy gripes with the series are still mostly the same:\nEnter or space do not end the turn. This is a standard in the genre and should be in this one, too.\nEDIT: This has been improved, enter now ends the turn.\nUnits can not walk around a corner, which is annoying. Instead of just the initial walking circle, the actual distance walked should be counted. At the very least, units should be able to walk as often as they want until their range is \"used up\" or they did some action.\nSometimes, after a while of playing, the performance when doing any action tanks and I need to restart the game.\n\n\nPS: lol @ Lorem Ipsum in demon speech ;)", "comment_count": "6", "author": {"num_games_owned": 520, "steamid": "76561197968907104", "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "last_played": 1505215406}, "recommendationid": "34790849", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.522570", "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_updated": 1505211824}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 5, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 6}}
