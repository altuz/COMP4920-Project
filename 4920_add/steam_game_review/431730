Instead of hand drawing a messy modle per frame and have to clean it up I isntead just make a new frame and shift a few pixels around to create smooth and awesome sprites in no time! Thank you David Capello for making such a wonderful game dev tool for 2D artists!\n\nIF you are looking for a sprite tool THIS IS WORTH IT! I mea think about it, 15 dollars for a GREAT tool or 15 dollars for a burger? 10/10 will eat raman for lunch again for this program.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1315, "steamid": "76561198065629888", "playtime_forever": 1761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1761, "num_reviews": 27, "last_played": 1507179517}, "recommendationid": "35462124", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503194", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1507088339}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 2, "total_positive": 307, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 309}}
