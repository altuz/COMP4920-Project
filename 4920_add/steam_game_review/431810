I have played it on & off & on again. I feel I need to say however that, despite my seemingly limited number of hours, I have felt the change and growth over the time that it has gone up until now. It has gotten a lot better as in comparison to the early stages.\nI remember back in the day, the first thing I did was just die. I died a lot and this genuinely made me angry because I simply didn't understand, but after dying a few times, trying to use stuff and my inventory was filling up with junk equipment I finally saw the disassemble button. The game then opened its' doors and said \"welcome\".\n\nRencounter is a Dungeon Crawler with turn-based tactical elements, minor roguelite elements &  nearly no RPG elements. These aren't points against it. I like my random name the game gives me every time. It adds flavor to my run. I don't like I can't get a random clone when I die, and always end up coming back as the model I call Dick Rockjaw, just slightly bigger or smaller but what it does have is:\nStat building, passive traits, a minor crafting system, gear management & Food rationing. This is enough for me right now because I really find myself very interested in the world that we are playing in.\nI haven't beat Rencounter yet but I have high speculation and a ton of the in-game scrolls and I get pictures of the overall plot. I imagine the ending will be along the lines of \"you are in a VR program to see if you are worthy for real life\" kind of situation. That's why I think you're allowed to come back as your character, until they die. \n\nEdit: I beat the game. I have seen the surface. I hope there will be a sequel. This game has so much potential for an expanded sequel. I am glad that my guess was wrong.\n\nREAL WARNING: if you're playing and you are invested in your main character, if he dies, You will play whoever is left over. I know this should seem obvious but it really comes as a super hard shock to you as a player, so Remember this: Invest in your team mates. They could be your new Player Character.\n\nI have had many good team mates. In the early days, I actually didn't understand what the rooms meant. I didn't understand what Ice was or anything. So I just killed them and looted their bodies. Some people will tell you that this is a good strategy for early on in the game, but you Will Need friends.\n\nI've had characters that I have admittedly abused through perk manipulation. Had one guy that used Path of Pain and a few other things and got my character up to 10K health. There is mechanical fun and challenge to be had if you know what you're doing.\nI like the lighting, the shadows- I like the Look of Rencounter. I like the ruins, the fungal altars, the drowned rooms, the nearly-aztec style masks, the shift to near-medieval with plate and then the severe comparison to things like the Hacksaw, or the Star Killer. You feel very lost in time if that wasn't already felt from your slow departure from the cloning pods.\n I intend to beat Rencounter soon. I have been inspired by a rare instance in-game that meant something to me.\n\nI got a Crab. I got the egg and opened it up and I got my very own crab. I thought to myself, after it saying \"Hey give it a name\" that I would pick a name that just makes me laugh. His name was MEME. I was going to make him into MEMELETTE but I didn't have the space.\nI saw, that you could Feed your crab and it would always cost 500 to feed. This was the most cost-effective thing I had seen in the whole game. By now I have a character with like 500 levels or so, so I can't afford upgrades but not only could I level up my crab but actually sate its hunger was a great deal. \nFor a long while, it was just MEME and I. People would come and go, they would be healed and armored and treated well but MEME was the MVP. He soaked damage, ignored water and consumed smaller crabs. \nThat ended.\nMEME was actually pummeled to death by a smaller crab. I murdered the fuck out of that smaller crab.\nSo it was just back to my guy & me. I am on floor six. I am getting ready for whatever there is to happen but without MEME I'll be real, it's sad. \nI have had a lot of good moments in this game, because of its hardline stances on its mechanics and universe. It's very basic, very enjoyable and sometimes there are small textural or typographical flaws but I can forgive that because I can feel the effort.\nIf Rencounter never gets \"finished\", then it will still be known to me as a very solid title to me.\nIt's fun, it's fast, it reminds me of a lot of classic 90's fun & its' price is justifiable.\nGet it now for wholesale, or on a discount but please give Rencounter a chance. I thought it was going to be a garbage title & I was happily wrong.\n\nSo I recommend it Entirely.\n\nSO HERE ARE SOME TIPS:\nInvest in your stats first and foremost. You will always find better gear.\nBuy EVERY recipe. They will literally melt the difficulty away as you collect so many ingredients that you can do anything and make super valuable stuff in a flash.\nUltraviolet herbs are the best deal second only to attribute potions at the sellers (the ice crystals and the circle icon on the map is a store)\nGoing to a Mushroom Altar will always feed you and then you will always recieve a mushroom or two. Don't spam mushrooms as soon as you leave, just in case you aren't paying attention.\nYou will need to reload your gun every shot, but you will need shot in your inventory pouches to reload also. Except the Heater, the Heater is a revolver.\nYou can use Healing Grenades in your inventory.\nThe Star Killer seems to always take like 90% of your health but it will usually 1-hit kill anything strong. Boost your stats and you can get away with upper-end 4 number swipes. I think I got like 5K one time on a dude who needed only like 1000.", "comment_count": "3", "author": {"num_games_owned": 377, "steamid": "76561198034979373", "playtime_forever": 1128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1505353612}, "recommendationid": "34873438", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505065", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1506902910}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506204028, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Very repetitive.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 28, "steamid": "76561198268382028", "playtime_forever": 526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1504553834}, "recommendationid": "35164930", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.497121", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506204028}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 16, "total_positive": 22, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 38}}
