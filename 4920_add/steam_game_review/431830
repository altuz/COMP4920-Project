The UI could use some improvements, and a brief tutorial would probably help, but overall it's pretty fun. I hope the developers continue to make improvements.\n\nThe core gameplay is essentially fixing problems on the ship, researching new abilities/technologies, crafting upgrades, and maintaining your hunger, thirst, morale, and health. The upgrades and technologies do things like make your thirst or hunger decrease more slowly, making the med bays more effective, and even give you an option to land your spacecraft before the whole thing explodes. You load resources into the storage unit attached to the console (of which there are an abundance within the storage rooms throughout the ship) and kick off the research cycle.\n\nThe ship is broken up into 5 levels (T-2, T-1, T0, T1, and T2. This could be vastly simplified by levels 1-5 as the first three games I played I thought there were only 3 levels and got lost a ton), each level having one or several functional bays: comms, medical, lab, water recycling, etc. Every time a day passes, one of these might break, new breaches might be ripped in the ship, fires might break out, etc. You risk injury by putting out fires, fixing leaks, and breathing poisonous gas which you must manage through medical items or the medbay. Each of these injuries, if left untreated, worsen every day.\n\nThe weakest part of this game for me has been the way they handle the ending of each day. It feels like you're on the clock every day (maybe this was a design choice), but it completely pulls you out of the game at the end of every day to (ostensibly) save and then generate a daily report. The problem is that daily report is unclear and is lost in what looks like a chat log -- there's no clear way to scroll through it and there's rarely enough information for it to be useful (it will tell you there's a fire onboard, for instance, but it won't tell you where). The only thing you end up seeing are these icons sliding down on the left side of the screen, which you can't hover over or click on because there's no intuitive way to free the cursor. Some of these may be design choices, but most of them just feel sloppy.\n\nOverall, it's got some interesting intricacies, but it lacks polish.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 426, "steamid": "76561197961317918", "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1502777299}, "recommendationid": "34260665", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1502819727}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 6}}
