Do you want to turn your computer into a furnace to heat you up during those cold nights in the winter? Well, you've come to the right place! Introducing 3DRPG! This wonderful treasure of a game is guaranteed to fry that graphics card you've paid hundreds for! Enjoy the wonders of having 300-1000+ fps due to a thing we like to call \"No V-Sync\" that's right folks No V-Sync! 60 fps? HA! Who needs it. 1000 fps equals faster and smoother gameplay.. But what if you really want 60fps.. No one will never play this at 60 fps.. Not even the nvidia control panel can stop our \"No V-Sync\" That's how you know that we mean business! Get your graphics card fried today for only $9.99! \n\nIn all seriousness though.. this game REALLY needs either v-sync or a 60fps cap.. I refuse to play a game that will overheat my GPU after a 1 hour session.. Unless someone can tell me how to force the game to cap the frame rate to 60..Maybe then, I'll give the game a second chance..", "comment_count": "3", "author": {"num_games_owned": 204, "steamid": "76561198045504150", "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1494809688}, "recommendationid": "31760284", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504577", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1494810884}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1498598164, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "need to improve Control and camera angle", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 151, "steamid": "76561198095060465", "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1495014235}, "recommendationid": "32889358", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498598164}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1492305213, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "The first few times I played this game, I really had no clue what I was doing.\nthen it slowly started to click, now I'm having a great time playing this little game.\n\nFirst off, this game should be *needs to be* played with a Controller, be it Steam or Xbox, it's just easier. (I had problems with it not responding to my keystrokes on my laptop, controller use is near flawless (you'll occasionally charge an arrow and have it drop as if it didn't register the charge.)\n\nThe idea is you've been killed, but your soul escapes the underworld are you come back to life. you choose a \"challenge\" to keep your life, be it killing your killer, making money, or killing monsters, amongst other things... additional challenges unlock with subsequent playthroughs, you can only start with \"Killing your killer\" or \"exchange your soul for another\"\n\nWhen you start, go to a town ASAP, talk to people, add one to your team, you can have up to 6, with 4 active, this is based on your influence or level (+1 to party to every 5 levels gained, max team size by lv. 30) and whether or not you fill their requirements, (stat levels, skill levels, number of kills, amount of wealth, etc.)\n\nMoving, searching for treasure, and clearing mines takes food. if you don't have enough food, you'll be forced to gather more. you can hunt/fish/gather it from any tile but towns, make sure you cook it before you leave the area. it's super easy, point and shoot, then pick it up, push a button to cook it, simple as simple gets.\n\nCharacters can learn each others skills by setting them as  one anothers mentors, this makes for skill raising to be an easy task (I'm dealing 3k-5k damage with my strongest attacks), the stronger the skill, the longer the combo, and the longer to learn it (I've seen as high as 8 hit combos). different weapons and classes make for different skills, some can be learned regardless, (my whole team knows Lunge and Triple Strike)\n\nEach tile has a level, if your lowest team member's level is lower than the tile, the number is increasingly red. If your lowest level is higher than the tile, it's increasingly dark grey. a white number is equal to you. I DO NOT RECOMMEND going more than 1 or 2 levels above your own, you're gonna have a hard time.\n\nThe controls are simple enough, choose your attack, your target, and hit the A button when the two moving squares line up. if they're not overlapping, you miss/break your combo, the closer they are, the critical hit chance goes up. all in the reflexes.\n\nThe isometric graphics are meh, and the camera has ADHD during the battles, and there's a terrible blur in a couple areas... Redaval Town is almost unviewable, but I discovered its that way for a reason, FYI...\n\n-expect it to move slow in the beginning, expect to die in the beginning. it's just the way of the game.\n-check EVERY MOUNTAIN for mines, the monsters are great for grinding (you'll have to sooner or later) and the resources are necessary for decent progression.\n-always go for the investigate events, it's a valuable farming resource.\n-Craft often, you'll need the skill 100% Maxed asap.\n-you'll run out of leather more than anything.\n-sell everything you don't use, there's no reason to keep it unless you're one of those 100% sive file completionists.\n-you WILL grind. and grind, and grind, and grind, and grind, and grind, and grind, and grind, and grind....\n\nall in all, I'd give it 8/10 certainly replayable, but quite repetitive.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 46, "steamid": "76561198172045789", "playtime_forever": 983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1493925249}, "recommendationid": "31168117", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500825", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1492305213}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1495078855, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Was it a good game?
