Always nice when such is the case in this kind of game as it does allow for more tactics.  I do wish some of the other traps worked on the baddies as well, but the pit traps were very useful.  Especially in Rogue mode to avoid Morph fights.\n\nOverall, one of the few to make it out of Early Access and be a good game.  Does what it says on the label and has been enjoyable.\n\nA lot of reading if you want to get into the backstory (not really necessary).\nI appreciate that the developer put the effort into detailing theories on magic and the planes of existence and how it relates to the game universe.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 2273, "steamid": "76561197971689303", "playtime_forever": 1868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "last_played": 1493997846}, "recommendationid": "31471013", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.510612", "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1493837599}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1498620148, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Castle Torgeath is an interesting little dungeon game.
