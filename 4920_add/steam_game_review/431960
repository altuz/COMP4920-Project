Okay so moving on now that you know how to use a computer.\n\nEven though if you don't feel the exact emotions that I portrayed above (because I am known to exaggerate reactions of people including myself), you will still definitely have a \"Whoaa, that is so cool!\" moment. Like, many many times. Even if you have experienced moving wallpapers before.\n\nAnd even after you purchase this software, use it for a couple months and get used to the concept of moving wallpapers, you will then transform your interest into different things. Like, you will start creating your own stuff. Hell there are even achievements to get in this app.\n\nI have only 2 softwares purchased from Steam. And they are both fucking gold. One of them is this. I am 100% supportive of this app, and all the revenue it makes is completely deserved.
