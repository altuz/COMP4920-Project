With this being said, the title fails miserably within its genre, and the somewhat frustrating half-hour of content that it houses is nowhere near worthy of the $3.29 price tag. Supposedly, you're playing as a guy who has slipped into what is called \"locked-in syndrome\"; instead of explaining it here, just give it a quick search. Anyway, apparently his only means of escape is \"solving the puzzles of his conscious\".\n\nThe puzzles of his conscious are easier than spreading melted butter on a slice of toast, and mostly consist of pushing a button or platforming. The only reason anyone would find this game even semi-difficult is due to the horrendously developed nature of the control system; the jumping mechanic in particular. There's a section where you have to move boxes in order to climb up a huge box, and then go over the ledge, but good luck with that because the character literally sticks to the moved boxes and doesn't jump properly. I personally gave up at this point and just watched the rest of the game on YouTube, because the controls were just that infuriating.\n\nThe graphics are garbage, and the soundtrack is literally non-existent save for some droning ambiance. The only enemies that you fight are paper mache men that come in two varieties: ones on the floor, and ones that stand up. They're easily killed with a led pipe that you find, but for some reason you cannot use the pipe and the flashlight at the same time, so enjoy either being well equipped and in the dark, or in the light and vulnerable. There's no save system, and no checkpoints, so if you die you go back to the beginning of whatever level you're on.\n\nLocked-In Syndrome is boring and uninspired to say the absolute least. Actually, it feels more unfinished than anything. It isn't fun, it doesn't have any interesting moments whatsoever, and the lack of a good control system makes it completely frustrating at some points. Do yourself a favor and forget that you came to this store page.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.5/5.0[/b] - Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork#curation]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "comment_count": "5", "author": {"num_games_owned": 2338, "steamid": "76561198049701098", "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 203, "last_played": 1496707146}, "recommendationid": "32210622", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.529337", "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1496708694}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 7, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 8}}
