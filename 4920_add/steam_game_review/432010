It was shorter than I would have liked but I genuinely had a wonderful experience. It had fresh ideas for festivals and I found myself very excited for every festival because I didn't know what to expect. The minigames were enjoyable, especially the aggressive soccer-esque game Lockball. The story was interesting to follow, especially as new characters were unlocked. \n\nThe controls were a bit awkward but it ran like a general RPG maker game. I liked that I didn't have to use my mouse and could casually use just my laptop. The inventory system was a bit weird and I would have liked somewhere to store my extra junk and the veggies I was hoarding for cooking. The energy system was also excellent. It made sense that having your character sprint everywhere took some of your stamina. It was easy to regain because of the benches placed throughout the map. The benches were not only great for stamina, but for passing time! Store doesn't open for five more hours? Just fall into a short coma on a bench. \n\nThe game is charming and memorable. It flows nicely because of festivals and Paxel's visits break up the boring daily life. The characters have personalities and I enjoyed talking to most of them, even with repetitive dialogue that games like these generally have. The characters, while generally feeling like same-face, had bright color palettes that differentiated them from each other. \n\nI would have liked more romance options in the game but I was very happy about my relationship with Quint and thought each romanceable was great (I would have killed to marry Paxel, though). There were four of each gender available, and you unlocked more characters who I thought would have been fine characters to romance. There could have been a bit more variation too, with most of the romanceables being young and similar. I married Quint, whose flaw seemed to be him griping about marrying an old man like him. I would have liked more for relationships in the game. The romantic festivals were well done but I would have liked events with the characters, something like the heart events from Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. I also think it was a great addition to choose your character's orientation as the game began. \n\nI would have liked more clothing available earlier in the game because by the time I unlocked more things, I was already done with 4/5 goals. \n\nSomething that made me really happy was your dog. You start the game with a dog who you can have follow you around and he'll sniff out coins and be generally adorable. When he likes you then you can even send him to the store to buy seeds or animal feed. \n\nWorld's Dawn puts you on a very small plot of land. You have two small fields that can each hold twenty seeds. There is already a barn for you to buy animals for, which is convenient. I think the model for the cow looks slightly concerning, kind of like a ghost or zombie cow, but it's more funny than anything else. I would have liked more farm space available because if I had more field room then money goals would have been easier to meet. \n\nThe mine is kind of lackluster. It's small and you just run down to the bottom, get the better rocks, and go back. This would have been easier if you didn't need a table to eat. I understand the concept of needing a table to eat complicated things but nothing could stop me from snacking or drinking standing up. The fishing on the other hand, has a unique minigame that you play for it. I thought it was a great addition to make fishing more interesting. \n\nThe mixing was actually a lot of fun in this. You collect ingredients in bottles and mix them together. I had a wonderful, very glitchy, experience when I made what apparently was a hard alcoholic beverage and my character went black out drunk. I was supposed to have a plot dream that night and the game wasn't sure how to handle me waking up at the sentinel's house without having the dream. The result? Quint, your house is flashing back and forth with a bear in it. \n\nThe game is beautiful too. A great map with wonderful cutscenes for festivals, plot elements, and the opening. It made the game feel really complete and shows the effort put in to it.\n\n\nAll in all, it's an enjoyable game. I would absolutely replay it again and probably marry Quint again because I'm a sucker for him. I still have more to do in my game but I would definitely recommend this game for someone looking for a casual experience. It's not very hardcore unless you're achievement hunting but it's definitely fun if you enjoy cute festivals, interesting takes on mechanics, and a charming presentation. It definitely reminded me of the older Harvest Moon games and I loved it. \n\nI have so much more to say, but this is long enough.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 92, "steamid": "76561198121406324", "playtime_forever": 1436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1496529915}, "recommendationid": "35002101", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505581319}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 51, "total_positive": 230, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 281}}
