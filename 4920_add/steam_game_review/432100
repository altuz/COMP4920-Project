Only men think that.  Real lesbians prefer to work in book stores and agricultural communes, unless they're one of the lucky few who can play Golf or Basketball professionally.  Anyway, the owner promotes Hannah to the position of Manager (despite obviously lacking in any managerial experience and skills) when the previous manager quits, and Hannah is immediately tasked with hiring one of three potential new employees:  Charlotte the quiet student, Jasmin the exotic dancer, and Sophie, the loudmouth daughter of the owner's friend who's in search of a job.  The player must choose the correct actions (which are usually choices of things to say in response to questions), and hope that Hannah will be able to make the right choice upon who to hire.\n\nGraphics and Sound:\n\nGiven the nature of a visual novel game, the \"be all, end all\" are the girls in the game, and the three potential employees for Hannah to pick from are all cute.  I wasn't a particular fan of Jasmin's smile. (The girl on the left in the below picture.)  But I've seen far worse-looking people and facial expressions in anime visual novels, and this is the only thing I didn't like about the graphics.  \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1147030474\n\nThe scenes for all of the locations in the game are all typical of visual novels, but every so often, a non-stock picture will appear in the more interesting parts of the game.  I do like how many of the text boxes have lacy frills on the edges, which helps reinforce the theme that the game is set in a lingerie store.  \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1147083063\n\nI thought that the breasts on all the women tended too strongly to all be the same (large) size, but at least there's one character who's less-endowed than the rest, but with the uncensored patch, I did appreciate the fact that not all women had the same amount of pubes.  (If any at all.)\n\nNegligee's soundtrack isn't the best, but it does help with setting the mood, which is the most important thing the music can do in a visual novel.\n\nPositives and negatives:\n\n(Note:  I combined them both because while there's things I don't like about the game, it's not to say it's a bad thing, and in at least one situation, the negative was a good thing because of it's function.)\n\nReplay value is the number one reason why people buy video games, and Negligee has that.  With a large number of endings, you're sure to be playing over and over trying to get into a girl's panties.  Or if you want to see what a bad ending looks like to a game, there's a few of those you can have.\n\nHannah never actually has sex with anyone during the normal course of the game.  Is it unusual from other H-Anime and date sim games?  It's not what I was used to from playing True Love and Little My Maid, but unless you're lucky the first time, you won't be seeing too many ladies get naked besides Hannah.\n\nWhile Jasmin, Charlotte, and Sophie are believable characters, Emily the owner isn't anything what I've come to expect from a store owner.  (Unless her backstory is that she's a millionaire who bought the store for the sake of buying lingerie at wholesale prices.)  The most unbelievable thing about Hannah, is that she sees pictures of a naked woman, and reacts much the same way a man would. Jasmin says something along the way that doesn't strike me as being true, especially given the way that I've heard about how most real life lesbians don't care if their partner had sex with a man.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1149560406\n\nBut this isn't real life, this is a sex game, which means you can throw realism out the window, and jack up the heat!\n\nI don't know what the standard is in visual novels that have a \"harem ending\" where you win over every single girl, but in Negligee, the player must go through all of the good endings (and probably also all of the bad endings) in order to get the harem ending.  The worst part about the endings, is that there's no endings that involve Emily, and I don't give a golly gosh darn if she does like men.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is Steam, and this game is...  Steamy!  You might have to work for the hot pictures, but there's quite a few that are easy enough to unlock, and the sexual situations are H-O-T!  So get this game, get the uncensored patch, get your girl (or boy...  Or toy, or lube), and get ready to yell Hentai or DIE!!", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 35, "steamid": "76561198246234164", "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 357, "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1506647142}, "recommendationid": "35278379", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506067", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506656875}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1507004667, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "solid story, good visuals. 10/10 langerie", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 75, "steamid": "76561198055890912", "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1507004592}, "recommendationid": "35435263", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502296", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1507004667}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505421968, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Positive: Good little Yuri VN, nice plot (and nice \"plot\"), and the art looks really good. Plenty of CGs to unlock considering the length of the game, which I finished 100% in about 6 hours while taking my time. There is a harem ending (all Yuri VNs should have this)! Definitely recommended if you're a fan of Yuri/Ecchi.\n\nCould Improve: A wider variety of music would be beneficial to the experience. There were several parts where for a few lines I'd notice glaring typos/grammatical errors. The Jasmin Bad Ending... my god. I didn't have a problem with the other endings, but this one was just bizarre. CG spoiler: [spoiler]This is nitpicking, but the harem ending really needed a scene with ALL the girls having sex.
