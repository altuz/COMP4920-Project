Lovely pixelart and a decent game for the price. Now to find those easter eggs.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiDLLLuNYA0\n\n@ Dev\nGamepad issues (wired 360),\nPopup mentioned deadzone was out of range.\nSoundfx needs a tweak, contact hits are too quiet.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 10172, "steamid": "76561197985036092", "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 262, "last_played": 1472430487}, "recommendationid": "20549710", "votes_down": 16, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.524347", "votes_up": 35, "timestamp_updated": 1452901794}, {"votes_funny": 3, "timestamp_created": 1452907673, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "I feel like my last review wasn't clear enough about what I disliked about the game, so I will edit it down to be more concise:\n\nThe game itself feels unfinished, like it was a weekend project being churned out to make a quick buck, in this case literally, since the game itself, upon this review, is about $1.79 to play.\n\nSo, what makes this game unfinished? Well, many of the sounds are missing, mainly around the player character. Considering the character is a knight, it's generally expected you'd have a \"whoosh\" whenever you swing, but in this case, there's no sound. When you take damage, there aren't any indicators, visibly nor audibly, which makes managing how many hits you've taken rather difficult to maintain. Minor complaint, but it serves as a disconnect to the gameplay, in my opinion. Also, for some reason, there isn't even a death animation, so when you die, it says \"Game Over\", but you can still move around and attack.\n\nAs for the layout, it's rather linear. A lot of the rooms appear to have other areas to explore, but in reality, it's just a small cell where you defeat enemies and move on, much like Binding of Isaac, without the variation.\n\nStory-wise, well, there isn't much of one, to be honest. The main antagonist apparently kidnaps and tortures princesses, but in the illustrations, it shows him murdering, maiming, and dismembering them, FAR from what the story leads to believe. And apparently your role is to save your princess...as far as from what I can tell, she's probably already dead. Apart from the story, as this game is being catered to an English-literate community, more effort needs to be made into proofreading, since there are many mistakes that need correction in that regard.\n\nOverall, the game is an interesting concept, despite the flaws. For now though, unless the developer adds more content and variety, asking for people to pay, even the current $1.79 as of the re-writing of this review, is not acceptable in the game's current state. Until more is added and the game is better completed, I cannot recommend the game.\n\nUPDATE: 2-3-2016\n\nBlack death potions have an unnecessarily large hitbox, being miles away when I accidentally pick them up. Updates don't seem to have done much to the overall gameplay, except you don't go straight to the title screen anymore, which is a huge plus.\n\nUPDATE: 3-13-2016\n\nGame hasn't been updated in well over a month. Hope the game dev hasn't abandoned it and run with our money.

What I was found gave me mixed feelings. The game \"Silver Knight,\" while looking like a school project thrown together in a week at first look, is actually a decent game. Its nice, simple use of pixelated graphics compliment it nicely with the environments. However, the gameplay can be rather dull. It boils down to you entering room after room, killing all inside before moving on. I've yet to find powerups or anything that could spice it up a bit. It feels slower than it should be, but that issue is easily fixable through the game's \"dash\" action. Something I actually haven't seen much use of in other RPGs. The battle is pretty hit and miss, but the rooms being so small limit your ability to actually do much first off without falling flat on your face and having to start over. Each enemy will aimlessly rush you with no sense of surprise or actual strategy, and bombs will be the lifeblood of your playthrough. The controls, to be blunt, are awkward and shoddy, the whole character stops moving when you swing your sword in a decently-lengthed animation, but in crowds this becomes a futile task that only dashing out or using a bomb will fix. \n\nOverall?: 6/10 as a game, 7/10 for the price, even on sale.\n\nIt's something that will fill the gap of boredom, but won't leave you with a lasting impact or sense of replay.
