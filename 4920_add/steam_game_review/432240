It is not scary, it is not spooky, it is not creepy.  It has an atmosphere and that is it.  It regularly uses audio and visual 'screen flood' jumpscares, which I don't mind, but if that's all you have, it quickly loses value.  \nAfter the first part of the game, you are introduced to the game's stealth mechanic, which the second part heavily relies on.  This 'mechanic' is simply crouching in one of the specific spots in an area before a monster that looks more like something out of an adventure game than a horror game comes into the area.  You *have* to use these spots.  It doesn't matter how much you think it wouldn't conceal you, if you try to use something that would offer far superior concealment, it will immediately spot you.  It can spot you through walls despite being totally oblivious to you when you can look at it dead on in *plenty* of these 'hiding' spots.  Especially the first one they use to introduce and demonstrate the stealth.\nThe questline has you constantly backtracking and relying on this broken mechanic.  It quickly becomes tedious.  I would not recommend this game for purchase.  I hate writing negative reviews but this was genuinely disappointing.

A horror game with some stealth and puzzles thrown in.  Unfortunately as the game unfolded I realised this was not the case.\n\nThe majority of the game involves hiding from a wraith, represented by a floating skeleton with some extra skulls thrown in, with a pretty flimsy stealth mechanic where in essence you just crouch near a wall.\n\nThe biggest crime the game commits is in the final section of the game where you have to avoid the ghosts of dead miners.  This was truly horrible.  You walk at an absolute crawl, the run isn't much faster, and you have a stamina bar which depletes so quickly and replenishes so slowly.  Coupled that with the fact there are very few places you can hide from the ghosts, you can't manually save, and you are forced to repeat the section if you are caught is a recipe for disaster.  Speaking of the miner's ghost, special mention has to go to the design decision of how they were to be represented.  They could have gone with a reskinned wraith.  But no, they went for a collection of multilated corpses, advancing through the corridor, one ridiclous freeze-frame at a time.  It looks stupid.  Thankfully there was nothing in the way of scary atmosphere to ruin by this stage.\n\nGraphics were nothing special at all, particularly for a game released so recently.  But I'd be willing to overlook this if the gameplay was there.  Music is just there.  Standard throw-away piano tinkling.  There are a couple of effective jump scares, but most of the time the game just throws a random scary sound effect out.  The first few times I heard it I was thinking \"Have I missed something?  Did I just look the wrong way there?\"  But no, it's just a random scary sound.  The other sounds to build ambiance are pretty weak.  Standard whispering, or sobs, or breathing.  Nothing amazing.  The wraith sound effect is particularly lacklustre.  \n\nFinally the game gets to cliff-hanger to-be-continued ending and that's it.\nAvoid!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1113, "steamid": "76561198035599199", "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1491057743}, "recommendationid": "30878353", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.533818", "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_updated": 1491058541}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1458922265, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "First silly question:  Is this a cheap Amnesia: The Dark Descent knock-off?  Yes.  I'm also told that it's a port of a mobile game, renamed for Steam because it originally had the word \"Slenderman\" in the title (why is anyone's guess, as there's not a Slender in sight).  Next silly question:  Is it anywhere near as GOOD as Amnesia: The Dark Descent?  No.  Of course not, you preposterous excuse for a human being.  The good news, however, is that it's not as bad as it could have been, given what I've just stated.  Alas, this ain't exactly the second coming of Frictional... \n\n   Something which this game does a mostly decent job of emulating is Amnesia's ATMOSPHERE.  The visuals are nice enough, all things considered, and the sound is pretty effective apart from the occasional jarring moment of abruptness, when a ghoulie departs the area you're in with all the subtle smoothness of someone pressing the stop button on an old cassette walkman.  There's also some - emphasis on SOME - reasonably half-decent puzzles to be found in the game's three to five hour playing time, and the story is...well, alright, even if the ending brings new meaning and depth to the word \"unsatisfying\" (\"To be continued\"...yeah, right, sure...we'll all hold our collective breaths for that one).  \n \n   So what does the game do not-quite-so-well?  Well, for a \"stealth horror\" game, the actual stealth mechanics are kinda dodgy to say the least.  Many is the time that I crouched in a corner, with my lantern off, assuming that the ghostie chasing me surely couldn't see me behind this pillar and...nope.  He found me.  See, the early part of the game, at least, works off pre-designated hiding places, clearly indicated to you by a closed eye symbol which appears on-screen, and you just have to trust the logic of said hiding places...even when they seem way more out in the open than other places which would appear, to the logical mind at least, to be more sure-fire safe-spots.  The second half of the game raises the bar of stupidity some more by removing the closed eye symbol altogether, and replacing it with some incomprehensible gobbledygook written on a scroll about hiding in a particular area of the tunnels or some-such...a message which I clearly had little chance of making heads or tails of, given that the only language I'm currently fluent in is English.  (Google Translate really does need to be taken off the internet altogether, as it evidently does more harm than good.)\n \n   Then there's the completely illogical back-tracking.  Oh yes, you're gonna love the back-tracking.  Remember the holy water you forgot to pick up in that area way, way back...the area which you've already combed from top-to-bottom five times already?  Nah, me neither.  But there it was, just like the ritual knives I couldn't pick up the first time, and so on and so forth.  I guess it's a \"realistic\" change from the usual video game antics in which you pick up almost everything in sight, somehow just KNOWING you're gonna need it later on.  So in the interests of grittiness, Underdread makes you wait for a journal entry telling you to go look for said object...before promptly saving you the hassle of spending another ten minutes searching areas you've already been by letting you PRESS A TIP BUTTON which generates a magical blue light which leads you straight to the object in question.  What was that I was just saying about realism?  Oh well.  They tried, I guess.  And it did save them the bother of having to, y'know, make more maps than was absolutely necessary to pad the game out to a vaguely reasonable length.  \n \n   Oh, and to add to the aggravation of the ceaseless back-tracking, they of course had to put a \"stamina meter\" in to ensure that you can only sprint for so long before you have to walk for a while.  You can, on the other hand, sprint while CROUCHING, so maybe some of you may consider that something of a novelty and/or consolation.  Me, I just thought it was kinda silly, and could only imagine how unintentionally creepy my character must look WADDLING along at that speed...\n \n   Look, it's not entirely \"bad\" - certainly better than many independent horror games recently released to Steam which DON'T even have the excuse of being mobile ports - and does manage to be moderately spooky, even if the relentless presence of certain on-rails enemies becomes highly repetitive and predictable after a while.  But it's mostly okay, and I'm happy to recommend it to anyone who's played The Dark Descent to death, and is desperate for a game that's ostensibly similar without being even a fraction as good.  To anyone else, seriously:  What the fuck is wrong with you people?!  Amnesia: The Dark Descent.  Buy it now.  And everything else in the Frictional catalogue, for that matter.  And Outlast, while we're at it.  And Alien: Isolation.  And Among the Sleep.  In short, there's a veritable SHIT-TONNE of \"stealth horror\" games out there which you should play before you bother with this one.  Go play those instead, and I don't want to see you back on this wretched excuse for a Store page until you've bought and played all the games I just mentioned.\n \n   What's that you say?  You HAVE played them all?  At least FIVE TIMES EACH?!  Oh, alright then...buy the fucking thing.  We horror game addicts are nothing if not BEGGARS, let's be honest here...\n \nVerdict: 6.5/10.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1513, "steamid": "76561198048974498", "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 429, "last_played": 1458832483}, "recommendationid": "22044999", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.510639", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1485959068}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1457152089, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Well..

In fact he discvoers from the locals that a detective had just gone there a few days before looking for the kids. Off you go and what follows is a brilliant piece of gothic craziness.

The Slender Man intellectual property banhammer is swung hard at everything from movies to books these days so the developers weren't exactly left with much wiggling room in that respect.\n\nAs it stands, [b]UnderDread[/b] is a solid title; perhaps a little expensive for what it actually is considering the original's going for less than \u00a31 on Google Play at the minute but still charmingly spooky in its atmospherics and inventively expansive in contributing to the Slender Man mythology.\n\nYou play a father searching an isolated castle for his kidnapped daughter, as well as stone keys, ancient coins, holy water, daggers, potions, switches, planks of wood and anything else the game can conceivably force you to hunt down as you are stalked by various monsters from which you must hide like a coward. Some aid is offered in the form of Tip Scrolls that will lead you to your next available item and Shields that banish your supernatural adversaries for a spell. It's simple but becomes repetitive quickly as you're forced to backtrack large distances in the name of guesswork. The holy water quest in particular exhaustingly drags you back to the start of the chapter without giving you any indication of just how much of the bloody stuff you're supposed to be looking for. The only way you'll know is to head back to where you're supposed to be using it to be met with a 'Not enough yet, bucko!' taunt. I fail to see what harm a counter or track would have done to combat the sluggish recharging of the sprint meter there.\n\nThankfully, [b]UnderDread[/b] abandons most of its scavenger hunting just over halfway through. There's just enough gloss and plot to keep it interesting throughout and some of the enemy designs are lovely, particularly the portable corridor of vengeful corpses that stalks the tunnels under the castle. Worth a go but maybe wait for a sale.\n\nFull video review below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0srV2CdxoI", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1789, "steamid": "76561198169311898", "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 158, "num_reviews": 115, "last_played": 1505739416}, "recommendationid": "21648885", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499826", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1457206360}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1457011580, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Have only played for an hour so far.My only concern is that the game only saves at the end of a section.I was killed near the end of one and had to do the whole section again.Save games would have been nice.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 72, "steamid": "76561198052305101", "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1457722411}, "recommendationid": "21602041", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499964", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1457011580}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1457226502, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "THIS GAME IS A MOTION SICKNESS NIGHTMARE!  why do developers think that the bopping up and down while walking MAY be natural but  theres no fooling the inner ear !!
