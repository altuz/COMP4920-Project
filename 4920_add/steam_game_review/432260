And you get to complete the speedrun challenges.\n\nAnd then there is a randomized endless mode where you have to be careful, but still quick enough not to get left behind on an expired ground tile.\n\nI do have to warn that simple 4-directional input (arrow keys) is definitely not good enough. I used a thumbstick (gamepad). And that's all the controls you need. The physics feel much nicer than in other ball-rolling games.\n\nAnother warning is needed: the initial learning curve may seem insurmountable, but it gets easier afterwards.\n\nGraphics are great: shiny untextured triangles are very pleasing to see.\nHas a great selection of fittingly frantic electronic music. \n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 936, "steamid": "76561198010360684", "playtime_forever": 867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "last_played": 1469644006}, "recommendationid": "24360957", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.525545", "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1468704004}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1459339053, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "A hard n fast ball game! If you have never played a ball roll/tilt game before you are going to find this game really hard. Can unlock more balls; one ball per level per star earned. Good luck getting more than a single star per level. Cool dance-beat soundtrack. Challenging and fun. Good control system and options. With the ball reward system, the game wants you to go back and earn more stars i.e. balls. After finishing level 10 I went back to level 1 and tried to get another star for doing it faster.
