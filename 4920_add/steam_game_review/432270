The only problem with this game is the fact taht it rox a little too much! At times I was so pumped that I would yell, \"Sick Trick!\" in the dead of night and wake up my grandma! \n\nMy little girlfriend also loves it! She's too small to play so she stands atop a soapbox so she can use the keyboard and mouse.\n\nBefore you freak out, she's 62! She's got a disease. It's called rocking too much!\n\nIf you don't like this game, don't add me, don't message me, don't follow me, and DON'T thumbs down this review. I'm tired of grassmen constantly giving me bad ratings on my reviews just because they can't get their tiny heads out of htheir little b-holes. This has been happening for LITERALLY years! Liliputian homunculi, tiny girlfriend having freaks! (I'm an exception)\n\nIf you can't ride a bicycle well this game ain't for you. Stick to CS;GO or whatever game makes u feel like a little strong boy because u can't shoo t freaking gun in real life (I'm at the chooting range now)!\n\nAnyways, 8/10. I didn't like the \"Dabs,\" keep that GARBAGE in youtube rewind 2016!\n\n- Dave 2003\n\nWhy do we repeat things that we know will not end well? Is it because we think that if we continue to do it, something good may come out of it? Is it because we are scared? Scared of what what may happen if we stop? Scared that if we stop now, we will have to face change?\n\n= This game is actually broken do not buy =", "comment_count": "7", "author": {"num_games_owned": 540, "steamid": "76561197977486548", "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "last_played": 1482208345}, "recommendationid": "28480420", "votes_down": 40, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.436587", "votes_up": 39, "timestamp_updated": 1482215844}, {"votes_funny": 3, "timestamp_created": 1482377343, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This game is not working and i want my money back!!!!!", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 3, "steamid": "76561198335953854", "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1482377323}, "recommendationid": "28520935", "votes_down": 11, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.491104", "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1482377343}, {"votes_funny": 3, "timestamp_created": 1482250624, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "In this game.
