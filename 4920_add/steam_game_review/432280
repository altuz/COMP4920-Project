That being said, BattleStorm is a great game. I really enjoyed playing the game and beating it. First off, I have played some shoot-em-ups in the past but I don't play them often. I like the genre and the concept of high scoring is something I really like to do. This game gives the player plenty of opportunities to rack up high scores and points, and the more skillful you are, the better your score will be. Powerups are random and that adds to the random aspect of high scoring; it's very likely no two runs will end in the same score. Keeping your score multiplier alive is key to getting good scores. Gameplay overall is not too deep, you just face a lot of enemies and have to destroy them to survive. This game has no story-line but doesn't need one; it's more of an arcade game. Shoot to win!\n\nWhen I first played the game, the original control scheme was an issue. Most players did not like it, and it was handicapping the game. It was holding it back, and I could see the game's potential beneath that. Once the new control scheme update was released, the game became way more playable, fun, and re-playable. The only downside is that the game did become a bit easier, but I think the difficulty balance is good as is. Instead of moving in the direction your ship is pointing in, you can now move freely around the screen no matter where you are aiming. The controls just feel way more useful and natural. I wish there were some difficulty options, but it isn't a big weakness of the game. The game's music is good, while the graphics are nice as well. The gameplay itself is great as you can fight via ground and air mechanics. Knowing when to shield, shoot, move, and how to play is essential to success. The options menu has some nice choices too, and the game at its core feels solid.\n\nBattleStorm is great, but doesn't feel completely polished. There are numerous bugs in the game and the menus/formatting lack professional flavor. However, those criticisms don't detract from the actual gameplay, which is good. The game isn't long at all, as it has 25 levels to play which are all autoscrollers. The game has a ton of re-playability though, which is its biggest strength. If I had to choose things I wanted to see in the game, they would be multiplayer, difficulty options, and perhaps more modes of play. If you are into competition and getting high scores, this game is for you. If you aren't a fan of the shoot-em-up genre, you probably won't find this game too interesting. Regardless, I can see many arcade gamers liking this game.\n\nTo sum it all up, BattleStorm is definitely worth its pricetag. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it given that it is this development studio's first game. The game has potential to be played for a long time given that the scoring system is detailed enough, and the developers did a great job for their first project. Props to them for getting an update out within days of understanding what needed to be done; that is the mark of good customer service. I am eager to see their next project!

It's a rather short game, took me about an hour and a half to beat all 25 levels (5 worlds with 5 levels each), with each one getting progressively harder. The fifth world is brutal compared to the first 4. I should be done with getting all the achievements by the time my playtime hits 6 hours (will update this once I've gotten all achievements). It's worth the three dollars, and if it is on sale for cheaper, then it is definitiely worth it if you are looking for a decent top down shooter.
