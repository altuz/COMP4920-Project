Rytmik is programmed with the UNITY 3d engine and it is not capable of being used as a DAW plug-in nor MIDI synth.  This is not a synthesizer. It is a very limited audio loop player. You cannot use it with a MIDI conmtroller nor can you actually \"play it except via a QWERTY keyboard.\n\nWant to be able to expand your sounds and export your \"songs\"?\nYou can buy sound upgrades and export capabilities by buying the \"Ultimate\" add-on and additional sound packs but if you want to use your own your own samples you are out of luck. All of the configuration and sounds are stored in UNITY native compressed file format. The application does not allow you to import or save your own sound banks.\n\nIf you want a real chiptune tracker app try OpenMPT https://openmpt.org/ which can do the things that this app cannot.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 84, "steamid": "76561198147930465", "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1503606978}, "recommendationid": "34516882", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505118", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1503842762}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1500417952, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "10\\10 would make music again", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 13, "steamid": "76561198203188228", "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506877908}, "recommendationid": "33639818", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500417952}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1501435799, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I do not recommend this program.
