Due to its mathematical nature, I wasn't 100% sure that I would gel with it, but I gave it a shot. I'm very glad I did.\n\nHydra Slayer is one of the strangest roguelikes I've played -- and I mean that in the best way possible. At the core, it's a mathematics-orientated game, where you have to use basic maths functions in order to defeat hydras. Your weapons come with a power rating, which dictates how many heads it chops off a hydra in one attack. When a hydra loses all of its heads, it dies. The downside is, you can't make an attack with a weapon with a stronger power rating than the heads on a specific hydra. If you had a sword that did 8 damage, you can't use it to kill off a hydra with, say, 6 heads.\n\nThe idea is that you equip yourself in a way that you can cleanly kill the hydras you come across. If there's a 14-headed hydra and you had two swords, one doing 8 damage and the other doing 3, you can attack once with the 8 (14-8=6) and then twice with the 3 (6-(3*2)=0) to kill it. It seems simple enough, until you learn that both hydras and weapons carry an element to them, and they react with each other in set ways. A flame dagger (power rating 1) against a 2-headed ice hydra will take off one of its heads without any regrowing; a bone dagger, however, will cut off one but regrow two more! \n\nMore heads means more attacks and more wounds, but sometimes allowing a hydra to populate heads puts it 'in range' of a bigger weapon, allowing it to perform a clean kill. There's even an item in game that makes a hydra grow more heads and become more powerful, with the benefit that the amount of heads that grow makes the hydra more optimal to slay than before the item was used. Other items include a potion that tells you the optimal weapon usage for killing a specific hydra, a potion that gives you another weapons slot to play with, and even a scroll that turns a hydra into mushrooms (should they prove to be totally unhandleable).\n\nIt's important to note that newcomers shouldn't stick with the Human player race, assuming it's the easiest to play. While its the easiest to start learning the game with, it's not the easiest to [i]progress[/i] with -- even the game tells you that. Once you get a grasp of the game and want to progress big time, try Echidnas. They have the permanent power to attack with any number of weapons they like, so their strategy is all about one-shotting hydras. When playing Echidnas, you want to set yourself up so you can insta-kill [i]any[/i] hydra you come across with the weapons you have. When you begin, you'll have a strength 1 and 2 weapon, which means that any hydra with 1-3 heads can be removed instantly. When you get a third weapon, you can raise the 'ceiling' on the hydras you can one-shot. Equipping a second strength 2 weapon will allow you to murder 4 (2+2) and 5 (2+2+1) headed hydras. Keep raising the 'ceiling' without losing the ability to slay [i]every[/i] hydra below said ceiling, and you should get pretty far. There's an optimal loadout in the Guides section that you can use -- see if you can work it out for yourself, though!\n\nAnd if you're not very mathematically minded and a little intimidated by the nature of this game, realise that I'm terrible at maths and, at time of writing, currently [url=http://i.imgur.com/La6hzs4.png]16th in the world for Human playthroughs[/url]. If I can get that far, so can you!\n\nTo finalise, Hydra Slayer is the perfect addition to a roguelike enthusiast's library.
