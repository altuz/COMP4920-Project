What a TEASE!\n\nYou'll log into the game and be teased with what looks to be amazing graphics and a vast world to explore with lots of dangerous monsters to defeat!  You'll think \"WooHoo! I just got a DEAL baby for this at under $4!\" \n\n..And then the reality will hit you.\n\nYou'll notice the bizarre, unconventional camera and the unfriendly, buggy UI.  You'll notice that the massive starting city is nothing but empty buildings and dead streets.  You'll hopelessly run around looking for the first event and then be happy with all the special effects as your first spider mob is born in spectacular fashion.  And that's when you'll really see how clunky and awkward this game is, especially with the weird camera and bizarre and unresponsive control system.\n\nAfter two reviews, the second one coming after the developer seemed authentic in saying that the game and camera was \"soild\" now and much better.... It's a little better, yes, but still just a massive mess. \n\nThe Unreal4 engine is nice, as are the stock assets used in this game.  However, it's going to take a little more then just gluing them all together with random and rushed flow diagrams in the U4 engine to make this a solid game that's worthy of even a $4 price tag.  I'd rather play a text adventure game that isn't rushed and programmed correctly then to play this \"beautiful mess\" as I called it in my first impressions launch day video.  \n\nBut NO people.  Save your $4.  This is just yet another example and further proof that graphics don't make a game good.  This game is all show and zero depth, zero content, mainly ZERO FUN.  Not only that, it takes up a massive 8 GB+ on your hard drive due to all of the U4 assets that have to be downloaded to be used in this mess.\n\nGame Re-Review Video on Feb 2, 2016 After developer promised big changes had been made:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxuLrIiNza4\n\nMy Score:  \n------------------\nVALUE: 0 out of 40 (even at $3.59, yes.. no value at all)\nFUN: 0 out of 30.. (Yep, nothing, nada, no fun at all, no bs)\nCONTROLS & BUGS: 2 out of 20 (Horrid controls, buggy combat, buggy UI)\nGRAPHICS & SOUND: 9 out of 10 (Yay.. this is for all the Graphics \"horz\")\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMY TOTAL SCORE FOR THIS EPIC GAME:  11% (Yes, 11 out of 100)\n\n\nTo the people who play this game .1 or .3 hours and give it a postive review just because of the graphics when you know you don't ever want to actually play this game.. You should be ashamed of yourselves for dishonesty and helping \"sucker\" more people in who will quickly regret spending any money on this.. money that could have went toward a real toilet plunger or maybe a bottle of Tylenol instead.", "comment_count": "19", "author": {"num_games_owned": 957, "steamid": "76561198053422627", "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 292, "last_played": 1454456425}, "recommendationid": "20837381", "votes_down": 17, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.548374", "votes_up": 52, "timestamp_updated": 1454474945}, {"votes_funny": 13, "timestamp_created": 1456141374, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "I've bought this game to give the developer the benefit of the doubt. I've played both Time Ramesside and Sacred stone... and both I've had to refund after 15 mins of play because it's so awful. Note, I do not refund games often... I have most of Digital Homicide's crap in my steam library, and alot of generally awful games (rpg maker games that appear to be done by 10 year olds with no spell check). I enjoy bad games. I actively search for bad games to collect  them just to have them.\n\n... I refunded both Time Ramesside and this game. Do you understand how bad a game it has to be for someone that loves bad game to say this is too bad to even have sitting in their library? Purchase it yourself... when you do have fun downloading the 8gb file... god help you when you enter the game. \n\nYou know in minecraft when you try to dig to the bottom of the world? That's Jason Welge's games. His games are the bedrock... the absolute bottom of the barrel.  I doubt you can get worst than his shit... other games are bad, but charmingly adorably bad... his game is bad in a way of watching a newborn puppy being flogged with a sack of quarters YOUR QUARTERS THAT YOU PAID TO SOME SHADY MAN... you look on in awe, disgust, and  feeling sorry for the puppy. Just as you feel you need to look away the puppy looks in your eyes... and it's just ... no... NO JASON STOP! STOP MAKING GAMES! This is awful... this is awful... save the puppy, stop beating it.
