Not worth it at all for $20.\n\nI understand the game is new and in EA, but half the controls don't work, they give you two things in your inventory to base build I assume?  Either way, you can't use them, and if you try to place them on the ground they just disappear.  The camera angles are stupid when you're trying to gather materials, and you can \"cheat\" and aim at a tree or rock half a mile away and still harvest stuff from it.\n\nThere's no combat that I could find, no way to hit anything, but maybe you need a sword or something, but again, I couldn't craft anything either.\n\n+you can turn into creatures\n+semi-pretty environments\n\n-literally everything else", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 185, "steamid": "76561198048628640", "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "last_played": 1488652216}, "recommendationid": "30327890", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.510821", "votes_up": 12, "developer_response": "We are sorry you felt that way. \nPlacing objects on the ground normally does not make them disappear, maybe you have discovered a bug and we would love if you can report it to us in order to fix it for you.

Here are my first impressions:\n\nPros:\nThe game is visually stunning right of of the gate.  It has a real sense of \"atmosphere\" to it.\nThe music is peaceful and I can't imagine it will become offensive to listen to for long periods of time.\nThe controls are fairly intuitive if a bit \"clunky\".  I imagine these will only get better.\nThere is a good but small set of initial stuff you can craft which really shows off the potential of where this game will go as more content gets added.\nThe monsters you can transform into all appear to have unique powers.\n\n\nCons:\nCamera control seems too \"fluid\".  It makes camera movement really smooth, but feels like your cameraman is slipping on ice at times.  There doesn't appear to be ways to customize this yet.\nMonster spawns appear random and not tied to particual biomes or anything.  I could be mistaken on this one.\nBuilding placement is somewhat difficult because of the viewing angle, and figuring out how to move things once you've placed them is not obvious (if possible)\nCustomization/decoration is pretty limited at this point.\n\n\nAs you can see, considering this is day 1 of early access with limited playtime, my gripes are pretty minor.  I can see having a lot of fun with this game.  I haven't tried multiplayer, but I'll probably pick up copies and play this with my family once it gets a little more filled out with content and stuff to do.\n\n\nEdit:  Forgot to give a final TLDR - If you like picking up cool indie early access titles that appear to be \"going somewhere\", give this game a shot!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 60, "steamid": "76561198011486635", "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1490837730}, "recommendationid": "30304659", "votes_down": 8, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.514993", "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1488588175}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1488592139, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "So I wanted to give my honest thoughts on the game as it launches into early access, and I like to give a balanced impression. Ludoria is finally here and sure it's a bit rough around the edges right now, but I do think it shows some promise. They are some pretty unique and well executed ideas here. Such as being able to transform into the monsters you collect, and the crafting of elements by breaking materials down to the atomic level is really cool too. I managed to learn the basics and get my base up and running. It took a bit of guess work. There are some improvements to be made in terms of how intuitive the game is. But I think there is a solid enough foundation here for something quite unique and interesting. I'm interested to see where the devs take the game!\n\nHere's the gameplay of me learning the basics: https://youtu.be/nbMZJaLN7fo", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 236, "steamid": "76561198030892712", "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "last_played": 1488832007}, "recommendationid": "30305463", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.508560", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1488592139}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1488751789, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Look i've been anticipating the launch of this game for a while and although a bit pricey for an early access game its pretty good the graphics are stunning bbut i do have some complaints\nA.There are some bugs for example semi-regularily glitching into the sky(not a big deal)\nB.Not a lot of stuff(yet)\nC.Leveling up is to darn hard!(easily fixable though)\n\nthese are all minor complaints so you should buy it to support the devs it can only get better from here!\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 37, "steamid": "76561198294242913", "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1503182804}, "recommendationid": "30346570", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.498586", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1488751789}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1488842270, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "So far this game is pretty fun.
