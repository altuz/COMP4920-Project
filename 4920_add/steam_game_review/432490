There is no 'straight man' (and here I mean the comedy stock character) to make it work.\nThe single relationship is rushed and is not really an integral part of the story.\nThe story structure is well thought out but incredibly short.

Long story short, this is what happens when someone mixes Yuri with Pulp Fiction. Sounds awesome, right? Wrong!\n\nIt seems like a great concept but I'm pretty sure the developer was drunk and asleep when this was cobbled together. To start, when Pulp Fiction jumps around with the timeline, it's not too hard to follow. When I played this, I had to stop and think and try to decide where in the timeline it was with hardly any context. Next, the art is just pitiful. It looks like hentai flash games I played when I was in high school, only worse. I went so far as to patch the game so I could get the full 18+ experience and half of the H scenes are just randomly thrown in there. I couldn't even fap to them and I wouldn't if I could. \n\nThe background music wasn't too bad at first but I turned it off about midway through because it just grates after a while. There's lots of cursing and slurs used but they seem forced. Almost like the whitest kid you can think of in a slacks and a tie saying, \"What's good, my n*****?\" Just so ridiculous he wouldn't even get his ass beat. And the overall dialogue? I didn't laugh, I didn't crack a smile, I almost didn't bother reading the damn frames so I could get through it faster. But I didn't. I forced myself to read every word and I was done in a scant 77 minutes that still lasted entirely too long. \n\nThis game is a bigger disappointment than Panzermadels a game I actually knew existed and followed only to be let down by its hype. It's just a cheap, boring ripoff of Pulp Fiction that actively tries to be bad. A flimsy script, lousy graphics, cheesy H scenes, and an ending that would fit better in some 80s American cartoon just makes me wish I had never even bought the game. The best part was the announcer at the title screen whenever you would mouse over an icon. Do yourself a favor and go use your money on something else. Don't even pirate the game. Just run.\n\n1/10", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 50, "steamid": "76561198081392653", "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1460014847}, "recommendationid": "22281404", "votes_down": 9, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.442829", "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_updated": 1478834925}, {"votes_funny": 26, "timestamp_created": 1456882732, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Uhhhh.
