I think the developer tried, and succeeded, in making it so frustrating it is not fun to play.  I got hooked on puzzle games with the Myst series and loved them all.  Then puzzle games seemed to disappear from the stores.  I was so excited when I found out steam had some of these, I tried Talos and it was OK but nothing compared to Myst.  Then I bought Monumental and was totally disappointed.  For example the hints are not helpful, there are hardly any clues to solve the puzzles, the game is jerky and slow, on the disco puzzel a slight mis-step and the wrong tile activates so you have to start over.  I have given up on it. To frustrating.  I have given up on steam also if they don't check out these games before selling them.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 2, "steamid": "76561198273705755", "playtime_forever": 964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1461289839}, "recommendationid": "22560048", "votes_down": 10, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.486754", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1461290647}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3}}
