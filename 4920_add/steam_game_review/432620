Although I just bought it on Steam, I've spent TONS of hours playing this game. (I was fortunate to play it at tons of parties and events over the past couple years as it was developed.)\n\nThis game is super fun. Usually results in lots of yelling, throwing of controllers, etc., which is always a good sign. (It's one of my son's favorite local multiplayer games.) It's [i]really[/i] well balanced and pretty easy for new players to pick up. It has that secret sauce of \"easy to learn, difficult to master\".\n\nInfiltration is easily my favorite game mode. CTF is probably one my favorite game styles is this is a really novel twist on that type of gameplay. Same kind of strategy, planning, intensity, and so forth. That feeling when you snatch victory from the enemy at the last second... oh man, love it. :D\n\nAnd the art! Feels like something straight out of the Tron games grid, but with an alien twist that I love. And the music is perfectly matched to the gameplay. Keeps the intensity high.\n\n10/10 - definitely recommend, super fun, easy to learn, perfect for parties and with friends", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 266, "steamid": "76561197972683527", "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1463597865}, "recommendationid": "23058320", "votes_down": 7, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503696", "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1463592999}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1463621445, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I'm a sucker for local multiplayer games, and we loved this one!
