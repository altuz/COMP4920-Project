However my main problem with this game is the price point.  In no way can I see the value of this game being anywhere near their $6.99 USD asking price at launch here on Steam.  I'd say $3.99 max, so if you like this sort of game and it drops down to $2 or $3 on a sale, pick it up, otherside I have to give this very simple. very high RNG game a thumbs down.  \n\nI can imagine zombies attacking me in my head and roll some dice on my desk to determine the outcome for free, this game is only a small step up from that.", "comment_count": "7", "author": {"num_games_owned": 960, "steamid": "76561198053422627", "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 292, "last_played": 1453484309}, "recommendationid": "20683349", "votes_down": 31, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.537333", "votes_up": 55, "timestamp_updated": 1453488067}, {"votes_funny": 11, "timestamp_created": 1454875965, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I do not believe I have seen a crappier game then this in a while.

And it's decent...\nI would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed either of these titles... \n\nYour shelter/resource contains the genetics of TWOM, including: crafting. cooking, defense, sleep/exaughtion, weather/temp, and health/mental upkeep. The military-time day/night counter runs continuosly, with every task requiring said amount of time to complete. It's a pretty basic formula for those familiar with TWOM, mostly proritizing what to build to initially survive versus the race to prepare for, and survive, the oncoming winter...\n\nThe DNA of ZH:D is found in the travel/exploration/combat aspect of the game. Diffrent area nodes will become available as you progress in the game. It consists of timed travel, requiring a few hours to traverse the debris to each destination. Each node has a set number of rooms to explore for potential resources required to survive, occasionally finding secret areas, or you could get attacked... Battle is pure RNG with fast flavor text, there is no \"action\" here. \n\nBefore initializing combat, a threat level is given indicating the severity of the encounter. Low threat means fewer and weaker zombies, with higher threat levels sometimes raising not only enemy numbers but their severity. And yes, you can avoid battles by either not walking into the next room containing zombies or by running away if attacked while traveling. Enemies will usually start four meters away. As the distance closes, you will fire your ranged weapon, if you have one, and then engage in melee combat until victory or defeat. Ammo is universal for each gun, but save those bullets for tougher battles later in game...\n\nThis is a tough little cookie, but doable after you figure out how to proritize your base growth. Also, there are crucial NPC's that will eventually appear asking for resources. Each can be visited at a stationary node after they make initial contact, trading necessary materials and accepting favored items as gifts to raise your companionship level. Higher levels means not only better trades, but also more varied items. Dont ignore your neighbors...\n\nAll in all this is an enjoyable game if you don't mind rage-quitting a window mode only mobile port with little to no feed back from the developer. I'd sorely love to see a full screen mode with a pause option, other than the quit/continue screen, in shelter strictly for viewing resources/stats, but the non-stop timer otherwise adds to the direness of the situation. Also, while outside of your sheleter, there is no way of identifying the materials you gather. Some icons are self explanitory, such as food and wood, but otherwise it's memorization of what's what till you get it home to inspect... \n\n\nAll negative reviews and aspects aside, I personally rate BuriedTown 3.5 out of 5...", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 510, "steamid": "76561198021608101", "playtime_forever": 3115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1457227980}, "recommendationid": "21531496", "votes_down": 7, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.498488", "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1457052143}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1472855926, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "An indie-er, entirely turn-based This War of Mine, with a zombie spinoff\n\nPros\n- Good survival\n- Base Management\n- Permadeath (Makes survival meaningful)\n- Progression trough permanent unlocks\n\nCons\n- Windowed (about a 3rd of the screen for me on a 1920x1080p screen)\n- Poor sound design, reused assets from other games\n- Automatic combats, based on equipement and RNG\n\nI'm really happy to own it, if you wanted a This War of Mine, with only one survivor and zombies, try this game !", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 984, "steamid": "76561197987258179", "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "last_played": 1472855325}, "recommendationid": "25314069", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499550", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1472855926}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1456947072, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I'm surprised it's even letting me post a review for this game, since I was never actually able to play it to begin with. Normally I wouldn't review a game prior to playing it, but honestly, this is more of a review on the developer, rather than the game itself.\n\nLet me first start off by saying: The mobile version of this game is pretty good, and I'm sure most of the people who were looking forward to this, would probably agree. The developer mentioned within the mobile version that a Steam version of the game was going to be released, and I was pretty excited. I thought that bringing the game to Steam would mean that they could make the proper modifications and give the game some additions that the mobile version lacked, and really make this game something awesome. I thought wrong, sadly. So, if you are thinking about trying this game, don't. Download the FREE mobile version instead (it's free on Android, not sure if the same is true for Apple devices), and try that one out instead. It's really good.\n\nThe developer of this game is a perfect example of a what a horrible game developer looks like on Steam. It seems as if they took full advantage of the people who played and enjoyed the mobile version, and exploited their following of the game. They half-assed released this game on Steam, way overcharged for the game (yes, $6.99 IS way too much for this game, considering the fact that it looks like over half the people who tried purchasing it and playing it, couldn't actually play it), and then when these people tried contacting the developer, to find out what was wrong, find out why they couldn't get the game to load or play properly, or to even just find out when a fix for this would be released, the developer did......nothing. Has the developer released any sort of news or information about these issues that so many people are having with the game? Nope. Has the developer even gotten back to me (or any of the people who have posted their complaints or issues on the Discussions Page), to even just apologize for the issue/bug? Nope. Haven't heard a peep from them, or seen them post anything. It's as if they released this game, well before it was ready, slapped a price tag on it, and let it go from there. It's as if they just took the mobile version, and slapped it onto Steam. And whatever profit they make from it....then that's what they make, and who cares about anything else. Who cares about putting the time, effort, and even money into improving the game, making the fixes that are needed to allow the game to actually be playable, and make even MORE profit on the game. That doesn't seem to be their long-term goal at all - whatever short-term profit they make on it, that's all they're interested in.\n\nIt's sad to me that Steam even allows this game to stay on here, considering the lack of playability for most people (it seems that the game is mostly unable for people who run Windows 10, and even for some of those who run Windows 8...Sooo, considering Windows 10 is free, this includes A LOT of people, lol). Also, the lack of any type of communication from the developer is pretty disturbing, and also makes me wonder why Steam isn't stepping in on this, in any sort of way (whatever way they may be able to do that... I don't honestly know).\n\nAll in all, don't play the game. Or don't try to anyways. Luckily, I was able to get a refund on the game, but from what I've seen/heard, not everyone was so lucky. Even though it's not a huge amount of money, it's definitely better spent elsewhere, since the game is totally free (except for IAP, of course) on Android, and maybe on iPhones too.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 10, "steamid": "76561198161510552", "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1454189037}, "recommendationid": "21589545", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499174", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1456947072}, {"votes_funny": 7, "timestamp_created": 1453517425, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "only plays in windowed mode.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 236, "steamid": "76561198029566774", "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1478751161}, "recommendationid": "20691685", "votes_down": 30, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.461892", "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_updated": 1453517425}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 6, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "num_reviews": 8, "total_reviews": 8}}
