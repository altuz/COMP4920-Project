I feel like the game is challenging and pushes me to go farther while I swing from orb to orb like spiderman. That being said, I still think there can be (a good amount) of improvements to make the game the best it can be, but let's compare pros and cons first!\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n-Pretty minimalistic design (Hey, I like minimammalissm)\n-Challenging levels\n-Replayability (honestly this might be the game I'd love to speedrun)\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n-Poor player model (Looks like stock, poor shading during parts of gameplay)\n-Confusing controls (What even are the keys to make a tether go up and down anyway??)\n-Not much to look at (Although minimalism is great for the game, there's just a straight level with no pretty scenery or aesthetics, just blocks...)\n-Lack of diversity (1 orb, 2 orb, Red orb, Blue orb)\n\n[h1](Room for) Improvements:[/h1]\n-[b]Change Gameplay[/b]\nAlthough the gameplay right now is enjoyable, it really is annoying to have to wait until I get to a certain point to be allowed to lock onto an orb and even MORE annoying to miss an orb and have no way to recover as I fall to my imminent death. I would [b]absolutely love[/b] if the tether length was unlimited and you just have to aim it to hook onto the orb, similar to games such as \"The Story of My Uncle\" or \"Windlands\".\n\n-[b]Change Player Model[/b]\nI'm going to be blatently honest, the player model looks like shit. The texture quality is pretty bad and the entire thing looks like the hands of a 60-year-old man. What I think would suit the game a lot better is a white, shiny, futuristic robot with a center palm and floating fingers, like something out of a sci-fi movie. It would fit the minimalistic style while also fitting the vibe of the game.\n\n-[b]Steam Workshop/Modding[/b]\nI know it is already planned, but I want more than just a level editor, I would love to have access to mod the game with new mechanics, environments, etc. For it's minimalistic design, this would be a great improvement for others to add more to the game.\n\n-[b]More... depth[/b]\nRight now the game is kind of bland without any scenery, atmosphere, or story. Adding little structures of civilization or ruined buildings or different things would make the game a lot more interesting and fun to play to see what I might come across next. \"Windlands\" does this BEAUTIFULLY with moving rock titans and interesting atmosphere.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the game is fun and challenging, but if there were more variety and more interesting... things, I guess... then I think Welkin Road could be a wonderful, and beautiful, game.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 177, "steamid": "76561198075952983", "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1480831143}, "recommendationid": "22821096", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.509585", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1462506709}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1479002899, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "I liked the concept of the game, I really did. Running around feeling like some parkour master above the clouds. One major selling point is the grappling hook however, which brings me to say no to the game, because of it infuriating me whilst playing the game. The grappling hook just feels weird using, it's way too hard to connect with your curser, the auto aim works a few times, but there's often times where the auto aimer tells you that it's going to connect, then it doesn't. A lot of times it feels as though it has a longer range then it has, making you having to repeat the same obstacle for ten minutes, just because of the grappling hook screwing you over. It's a good and pretty relaxing game, but over all, my experience with the grappling hook just made me not want to launch it again.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 30, "steamid": "76561198078863534", "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1479002515}, "recommendationid": "26571735", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500624", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1479002899}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1461945499, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Great game, if you love games like mirrors edge and overal are a fan of speedrunning games.

At first it takes a while to get used to the controls but you can pick up the controls quickly because of how well mapped out they are. The graphics are good and suit the game for what it is.

Even though it can be challenging, you aren't getting frustrated from being on the same part of the course because you are usually only stuck for a minute or two before you complete the part of the course or the game helps you.

Main concept is swinging through the levels, not running or climbing. So what you must learn and master is to use momentum when you chaining swings like Spiderman. There is also some wallrunning and wallbouncing quite regularly, but like I said, focus is on swinging. Controls are good, you get a good sense of your speed and momemtun when you play, which is necessary to calculate your jumps. Only \"negative\" thing to mention: You have to be pretty exact when you click on those midair anchor ball, and since your often moving at high speed, it can get difficult to hit those in the right moment. If you only click anywhere nearby, it is unforgiving and you fall to your death. Then again it is never unfair, only difficult, as you want to hit them exactly from the point farthest away if possible. As a help, checkpoints are numerous (basically on each platform you land on and sometimes even in the air) and there are help messages if you fail multiple times at one place.\nAlso, you can change your direction midair a little bit, that helps to be in control all of the time if you let go your swings at the correct moment.\n\nWhen I first tried this game, I wasn't to impressed, as I expected a Mirrors Edge clone and was disappointed. I needed one or two stages to understand that it's really different from ME and to adapt to the mechanics. Then after each stage, I loved the game even more and couldn't stop playing. Gameplay is simply fun and addictive!\nEach stage introduces a new gameplay element, so it doesn't get boring or too repetitive.\nI finished the last level after nearly 5 hours (I would consider myself good at that kind of games) and if I hadn't other games to play in my library I would definitely go back and get those collectibles or do some speedruns. Maybe I will do sometimes in the future.\n\nShort verdict: Nice physics-based platformer with polished and bugless gameplay, focusing on swinging. This game is really difficult at times (that's part of the fun!), but not unfair!\nI recommend this to fans of platformers without fighting or enemies. It's all about controlling movement and getting to the end. You can do some decent speedrunning, if you like.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 114, "steamid": "76561198097632017", "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1501577857}, "recommendationid": "33945342", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501579568}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 5, "total_positive": 13, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 18, "total_reviews": 18}}
