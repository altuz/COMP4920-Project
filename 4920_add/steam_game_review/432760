Graphics are top notch, music is nice, voice acting is well done, and the story is quite interesting. I was hoping for a scaryish plot, similar to the other Small Town Terrors games. This one isn't - it's more a \"solve the mystery of what's really going on\". It was very enjoyable and the ending came as a surprise.\n     For those of you who don't enjoy HO scenes (blasphemy :p), you can play solitaire games instead. I never chose to do that but from looking at the bonus contents, there are quite a few different types of solitaire. Which brings me to the Collector's Edition extras. There's a bonus chapter to play, lots of ingame achievements to work for, and you can play HOs and cards outside the main game. Which means I might go back and check out some of the varied solitaire games.\n     I've played a LOT of HOGs so when I say this is one of the better ones, you can trust me. If you play this, you won't be disappointed.", "comment_count": "4", "author": {"num_games_owned": 1174, "steamid": "76561198138437975", "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "last_played": 1482364655}, "recommendationid": "28518706", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.492228", "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_updated": 1482365960}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1456073021, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Assisting to the premier of Thurman's new trick on his request, he is victim of an accident. You know that he was sure that his rival was sabotaging his work. It's now up to you to find what Galdor's Bluff is hiding!\n\nSmall Town Terrors is a series of hidden objects games, focused on one town hiding a secret. After an evil entity and zombies, Galdor's Bluff is focusing on illusions and is less oriented in paranormal and horror themes. The story is well-written, as you don't expect the twist at the end.\n\nThe gameplay is the usual one: find items, use them in specific locations, solve puzzles, find objects thanks to a list of them or to replace the missing one to its place. The puzzles are quite easy to solve and the hidden objects scenes aren't hard at all. It's just a shame that the mechanisms of two characters you can switch are only explored in the bonus chapter.\n\nThe graphics are correct: while it's not an apocalyptic setting, it's still a town visited during the night. Though the majority of the locations are normal, some of them are situated in ruins, getting a little touch of mystery. The soundtrack is also correct.\n\nAs it's a collector's edition, you have concept arts, the bonus chapter, wallpaper and a solitaire game. Indeed, each hidden object scene can be passed thanks to a solitaire card game where you can remove cards when their sum is matching 13.\n\nThere are also achievements in-game but not on Steam, which is a little disappointement.\n\nAnyway, Galdor's Bluff is really enjoyable, way more than Livingstone but Pilgrim's Hook stays still my favorite game in the series.
