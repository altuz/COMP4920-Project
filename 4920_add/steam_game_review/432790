I'll leave the original review below for now, as I've not had a chance to go back to the game yet.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe idea is good, but I can't recommend this game at the moment.\n\nCurrently bugs galore (e.g. missing enemies, missing text, awkward menu, clouds suddenly disappear).\n\nPoor controller support (it tells me to press a button, I press it, nothing happens).\n\nBut the worst thing is it's really poorly optimised. I have a beefy system and I was getting 20fps at points with no enemies on screen. It's not that complicated a game (it's a top-down shooter), there's no need for such poor optimisation.\n\nI want to give it another shot, but I'll have to wait and see if the devs fix these issues. In it's current state it should be in early access.", "comment_count": "5", "author": {"num_games_owned": 77, "steamid": "76561197964354227", "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1500761841}, "recommendationid": "33731203", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504677", "votes_up": 4, "developer_response": "Hey Ghost45!
