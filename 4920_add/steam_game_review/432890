So, to give a tl;dr version: I do recommend this game, but it is ok to wait a bit. The game has an interesting sense of storytelling. Also, the art itself in the game is wonderfully weird. Reminds me a lot of the movie Mirrormask. The gameplay itself is good, with some interesting puzzle-elements, and some simple, but fun, combat. I know my hours isn't a lot, but I'll update the review down the line.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 373, "steamid": "76561198017118410", "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1505847170}, "recommendationid": "34636121", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503037", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504191718}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 7}}
