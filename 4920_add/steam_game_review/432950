I was expecting kind of an actiony run and gun affair, but that isn't really Orange Moon's thing... It is a thoughtful, atmospheric game with a bit of story to it, and lots of little secrets and curiosities to investigate. \n\nThe pace of gameplay is rather slow and deliberate, it generally doesn't work well to act like you are playing Contra... Every bit of fuel and ammo needs to be carefully managed, and you can expect to spend some time in each level scrounging for resources. The controls take some getting used to (I am using the X360 gamepad), and the frame rate is just a tiny bit sketchy on my system... but these are only minor flaws in what is otherwise quite a fun and immersive little game. \n\nThere is so much to love about the art and design of Orange Moon I hardly even know where to start! The pacing and difficulty curve are just right. I found the sound and music very subtle and effective. The interface is quite good\u2014particularly the complex equipment system where you can purchase precious ammo, unlock ever-more-gnarly weapons, and apply all kinds of sweet upgrades. My favorite part of Orange Moon is the art style and use of color! There are so many nice visual touches, from hulking abandoned alien machinery to tiny ambient particles of space dust everything looks balanced and consistent. Final analysis: it is definitely worth your time to check this game out! \n\nGameplay: (7 / 10)\nVisuals: (9 / 10)\nSound: (8.5 / 10)\nInterface: (8 / 10)\nControls: (8 / 10)\n\nOverall: (8.1 / 10) Recommended!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 29, "steamid": "76561198235068396", "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1496431600}, "recommendationid": "32137393", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.507080", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1496435384}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1495840635, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Solid game but they arent kidding about that partial control super glseiitchy with steam controller.

Anoying small range angle, you can't lift more the target cursor so for higher targets you must get far from them so you can target them. In my oppinion target angle limit should be non existent.
