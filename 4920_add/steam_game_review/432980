I bought it in the recent Steam sale without much expectation but it has surprised me with its combination of fast pace and strategic depth. Since you can only travel on tiles which are the opposite color, you are torn between clearing space on the map to navigate and targeting your opponents. The pacing of multiplayer is great and levels are unlocked quickly, giving you a lot of variety in terms of level designer. Overall a fantastic game.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 813, "steamid": "76561198017163400", "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 71, "last_played": 1499524679}, "recommendationid": "33332494", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1499401013}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 39, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 40}}
