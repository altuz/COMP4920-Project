Damn, I could just walk around for hours, or just stand there listening to the birds and the breeze.  It is weird to say, but this game's atmosphere... It makes me feel like home. It reminds me of my own little hide-out growing up.The warm setting sun, the playground, the abandoned buildings, the emptiness, the solitude...  I feel soothed, and at the same time heart-broken. \n\nIt's not a big game, and the \"horror \" (more like 'unsettling') elements really just come from your imaginations.
