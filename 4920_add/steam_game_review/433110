Also the items are larger than your character sprite which makes it all the more unwiedly. The sound effects for the attacks are high pitched bubbles. Game likes to spam a bunch of info bubbles that clutters your view.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 4956, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1973, "last_played": 1495755220}, "recommendationid": "31961805", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505094780}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 3, "total_positive": 9, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 12}}
