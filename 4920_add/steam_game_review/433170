Dogs are everywhere which forces you to do some sneaking. Theirs alot of platform jumping in this game, which at times can be anoying. However it add that thrill of almost not making it, but still pulling it off. gaphics and performance is pretty good, their is some bugs and loading lag. But in genral performs nice, ive played this on both a laptop gtx960m and a desktop gtx1080. The laptop gets a pretty smooth 30fps on median. while 60fps on a gtx1080 and both have loading lag. A real great quality of this game is the devloper is around to answer and help with support. I had found a bug, and the devloper answered and fixed it with in a day so.\n\nI really enjoy playing this game and would recommend it to anyone.", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 77, "steamid": "76561197979772579", "playtime_forever": 1427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506900814}, "recommendationid": "34826168", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.509454", "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1504918192}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505032238, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "(If you're interrested in more screenshots, there are quite a few under my profile.)\n\nI have to say, especially for the price, this is a heck of a game, IMO. It's fairly unique and offers some beautiful scenery, a good storyline, interresting gameplay mechanics and all for an extremely low price. I bought the game on sale and actually feel bad about not paying full price, as it's already so cheap, for what you get. LOL. Not even kidding. There are full release games on STEAM, that are quite a bit more, that are no where near as good as Die Young, IMO. Basically, you are getting a near AAA game, for $15.\n\nI read alot of reviews and read many of the negative reviews for this game and I have to say, people have a very difficuly time, in reflecting accurately, on what they are saying. Like the comparisons to the Island. IMO, this game is nothing like the Island and is far better. I have played the island for 3-4 hours. It just doesn't hold my interrest. It's too generic, not well thought out or implented. The gameplay is boring and offers nothing new. It is simply another survival clone, IMO. Where as, Die Young is pretty unique in many aspects, well thought out and very nicely implemented, into gameplay. Beautiful GFX/scenery, original local, original concept, some original aspects of gameplay, great tension, all wrapped together in a nice, neat, little package. IMO, this game does everything well.\n\nThe controls are tight. The play area is already pretty big and they are adding more. The crafting is easy and intuitive. The weapons feel like something you should have, in a game like this and the breaking mechanic helps add to the over all tension. The jumping/climbing aspects are not puzzles, IMO, as they offer clearly marked paths of accension. There is no guessing where you need to go, as there would be in a puzzle. You do have to pay attention to stamina, but that just adds realism. IRL, you can't just dangle some where forever. Combat is straight forward and functions well. Dogs are actually VERY easy to kill. Probably a little too easy, IMO. Just a matter of using your brain to figure it out.\n\n \n Some people put down the jumping/climbing aspect, of this game. When you consider the protagonists background, extreme sport/adrenaline junky, it fits in perfectly. The people complaining about it, have very little time in the game, which means they didn't take any time to learn the basic mechanics and must rage quit very easily. The jumping/climbing adds some nice challenge, as well as some nice tension. In all honesty, there are only a couple of jumps that I did not make the first time. However, the way that saving is implemented, you simply craft a fire, before a long jump and save, so if you miss, your right at the jump, to try again.\n\nThe developers are on top of it too. They add new content regularly, communicate with the community regularly, get patches and fixes out in a timely fashion and are very professional. If all devs were like these people, the gaming industry would be a totally different animal, than what it is today.\n\nThis is EASILY one of the absolute best bargains on STEAM and without a doubt, hands down, one of the best games on STEAM, not just in EA. I have decades of gaming experince and this game, this game is special, unique and will be played through many times, by myself. \n\nWould I buy the game again, if I had it to do over? ABSOLUTELY, only I would have paid full price, instead of getting it on sale. Why? Because these are the type of developers that you want to support and see grow. They still have plenty of ideas to implement, into the game and I already know that, when it is done, it will be as close to being a AAA title, as a game can be, without getting the rating. In my mind, I basically got a AAA title, for less than $15. Not a bad deal in my book.\n\nDo yourself a favor and give the game a chance. I think you will be surprised, by how good it really is. I know I will actually be buying several more copies, to give out as Xmas gifts. I hope you ignore some of these reviews, just on the grounds of inaccuracies and just go with your gut. If it looks like a game that you would like, punch that ticket and take it home.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 58, "steamid": "76561198370066119", "playtime_forever": 2450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 114, "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1506815545}, "recommendationid": "34856409", "votes_down": 4, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.494452", "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1505068021}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505803005, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "I've just bought this game and got out of the well. Apparently my secondary graphic card couldn't handle this game(primary one stopped working last month). I think this's gonna be a stunning game and I'll save it for my new rig comming end of this year. The biggest reason I bought the game was I read a news that the dev team provided DRM free version for those people have insufficient money to buy it, so they could experience the game meanwhile avoid the risk of malwares came with the pirated version. I was barely belive it until i found the store page. That moment I decided to buy this game no matter it fits my taste or not.
