I Still enjoy the game and still is fun. only problem is the price is a little high for an old game, and Controller layouts are only Xbox. So using PS4 Controller can get confusing. I still enjoyed the game though. It's an old game so of course their will be bugs. I still find this game fun. 8/10", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 24, "steamid": "76561198272245195", "playtime_forever": 754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1504541945}, "recommendationid": "35320176", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506739272}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505962130, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "pure ps2 nostalgia", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 76, "steamid": "76561198042112895", "playtime_forever": 1499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1484045165}, "recommendationid": "35096069", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.498235", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505962130}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 90, "total_positive": 103, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 193}}
