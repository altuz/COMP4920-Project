A pastel painted world accented and contrasted by neon here and there through particle effects and lights on objects. The developers clearly know something about color theory. Becuase this world is very colorful. But not in a jarring way. It's serenely beautiful.\n\nBeyond that it's a very interesting world. Heavily eroded from a retreating amoebic sea and populated with a combination of native anaerobic animal life forms (that drop the ever valuable and highly desirable substance, the plort) and mild mutations of imported flora and fauna. Very alien yet still a little familiar.\n\nMovement is smooth with a little bit of glide in the stop. Jumping is high and long arched. Jumping is also slower than one might have expected. There are fluffy, thin. fast moving clouds. Yet oddly no rain. Things fixed to the ground are wispy or wiggly. Things not fixed in place are bouncy or easily moved with some delay in acceleration. There are no snowy or icy areas. Locations tend to be arid or tropical. \n\nIt really nails down what one would intuitively expect of a world that is just within the margins of supporting life as we know it. A world clearly significantly less gravitational pull than on Earth and that is much closer to it's parent star. It really feels like somewhere far away that is slowly being colonized. While also still very much wild and strange to it's new inhabitants.\n\nThe music fits the world wonderfully, helping to set the tone for areas and the tempo of play perfectly. It's also very good music and very easy to get stuck in one's head. Though this may be down to repetativness to some extant. It might be nice to get a few additional tracks to pre-existing areas eventually.\n\nThere is so much to explore. Though somewhat corridor and progression gated. there are often multiple ways to get to a single spot on the map. Once the player obtains the jet pack. Back tracking through previously explored areas reveals all sorts of hidden nooks and treasures the player will have entirely missed previous to the upgrade (i.e. areas are worth revisiting later).\n\nDeath, violence, blood and gore are downplayed or cartooned. The player doesn't die themselves. They get knocked out.After which they must rest up at the ranch and loose a portion of whatever they were carrying. Even when villainous slimes consume the other slimes one gets the sense of a merger rather then true death. Taking these so called Tar out feels more like cleansing the world rather than killing. Even when firing slimes (of which the player may at times have too many of) conveniently into the sea. They go with an adorable expression and a cute plop.\n\nWhile the game can present some challenge in the way of progression, finding a good balance on one's ranch, and thinking one's way through a puzzle. There aren't any real unfair spikes in difficulty, lack of warning about potential dangers or obstacles that can't be overcome with a little persistence, effort, and sometimes just waiting until one has some better upgrades or more resources. These two aspects (the death and difficulty aspects) are why I say the game is family/kid friendly.\n\nEverything comes down to progressively more advanced and varied combinations of the same very basic mechanics, features and abilities. However, after about 30 hours of play. Whenever I feel like I've just about exhausted the unique content of the game. Something new pops up. So it has yet to actually get stale.\n\nWhat really surprised me is how bug and glitch free the game is. On a technical level the game is better put together than many AAA games I've played. The gaming industry as a whole could learn a thing or two from the level of competency, dedication, and skill the game's developers have displayed.\n\nPraises aside there are some features that fall flat for me. For instance the trading post. In the early game I could rarely seem to gather enough of requested materials by other ranchers to fullfill the trade requirments in time. In the later game I had so much resources that the trades on offer simply were not worth it. \n\nAnother example of a feature I found to not really get off the ground with me is the price flucuations on the plort market. In the early game it's hard to build enough storage in order to hold onto certain plorts long enough and in great enough quantity to justify waiting for a favorable price change. In the late game the player will have so many plorts that the price changes really don't matter. \n\nI've also noticed that I run into odd food shortage spikes from surplus of food going to waste because the auto feeders don't manage it very well. Have too many slimes in a corral and one gets too many plorts to manage. Not enough and food goes to waste. Even though the rate of feeding can be adjusted. At the lowest setting it is far too high.\n\nHowever these are all things that I imagine the developers can make value adjustments to and update at some point. They don't really stand in the way of play (much) or progression. They simply aren't as useful as they could be as features. Since they're easily ignored short commings (save for the food management thing which too stringently dictates how long the player can spend off-ranch exploring). Even making changes to how they work could be ignored and the game wouldn't really suffer for it. I consider these low priority to-do's.\n\nHigher priority to-do's are spots the player can get stuck in. I perhaps only got stuck 3 times in nearly 30 hours so far. 1 of those times was entirely my fault for pushing the envelope on where I could explore too far. Even so there are rocks here and there that could stand to be deleted. It's still shouldn't be extremely high priority considering how infrequent it is and that the developers provided a menu feature for returning to the ranch incase of becoming stuck. Sure you loose a few items you were holding. But in my experience it's never been anything you can't get back inside of a few minutes with how quickly one can traverse the entirety of the map.\n\nThe storyline...I could take it or leave it. It's well enough written. There are some salient points about life to be had from it. But at my age it's nothing I hadn't already figured out. The younger reader might get more out of it than I did. \n\nAll in all I think this is a great game. I think it will age well too considering the artstyle and that the developers appear to be constantly adjusting small things and putting out small to large updates. It's also a good value. One can pay 3x as much (I bought it on steam from their store page for about $20 USD) for games that aren't half as well made.\n\nI do think there is a little more appeal here for the younger or more casual gamer. But I wouldn't call it a bad buy for any kind of gamer really. It's fleshed out enough that I think just about any one could find enjoyment with it.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 21, "steamid": "76561198068307804", "playtime_forever": 2356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1505965236}, "recommendationid": "34849179", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.525896", "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1505003793}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505601141, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "ive never been this happy", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 138, "steamid": "76561198004524016", "playtime_forever": 991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505840651}, "recommendationid": "35008780", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.520796", "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1505601141}, {"votes_funny": 25, "timestamp_created": 1504999632, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOD I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT [b]I LOVE IT[/b] I LOVE IT I LOVE IT\n\nKIDS LOVE IT\nADULTS LOVE IT\nSLIMES LOVE IT\nTARRS DO NOT LOVE IT\n\nThis game has everything you can ask from the ranching genre.
