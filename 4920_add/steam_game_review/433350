My original review of this game was actually a positive review to begin with surprisingly. But with all the slow progress or inaction on the part of the developers after I attempted to point out massive flaws in their game and how easy it is for hackers to expliot it, I have come to the conclusion this developer studio is either horribly understaffed or they just flat out don't care what the fan base has to say as long as people are still pouring money into their pockets. Finally darn near a month later I get reply back from one of the devs about the situation with all the hackers running around. More or less the response stated we know there are hackers in our game. \nDon't worry we'll get to it. It felt like such a copy and paste response:\n\nDear So-and-So,\n     We're sorry the hacker problem inconvenienced you. It takes a lot of effort to process the multitude of hacking reports we receive daily. (I can imagine...) Our anti-cheat system (Which is still ineffective sadly) should now be up to par to better deal with cheating (Not really, I'm still seeing teleport kills and aimbots everywhere). \nThank you for voicing your concern. \n\nSincerly,\nSome Dude\n\nHackers are rarely stopped or banned in this game because of how awful of a reporting system they have in place. You can attempt to kick said hacker from in-game but that never works because what they will do to get around being booted is start a vote kick on another random player in the game which prevents anyone else from trying to boot them for \na good long while. And the hackers will just repeat that process over and over and over again until the match is finished, your team loses and your K/D ratio falls faster than a crashing plane.\n\nTo report a SINGLE hacker you need extentsive evidence. You need both in-game pictures and recorded in-game video of the person being caught in the act cheating. Supposedly they review your evidence and ban that particular account. (So what's to stop this clown from making a new account and starting this cycle all over again I'm wondering....) Heaven forbid you meet more than one hacker in a single game session because you'll be punching the heck out of that F12 key on your keyboard taking screenshot after screenshot trying to keep up with all the nonsense on screen. So essentially more or less you basically have to become a streamer just to report a hacker in this game which in my opinion is completely insane. It would make more sense for them to just to get a better anti-cheat/anti-hacker system in place. Yeah you can't stop every hacker program out there but for goodness sake you can at least make the attempt to slow them down a little better... \n\nOn top of that nightmare alone, is that the game is viciously aggressive with it's microtransactions. Nothing in this game can be purchased permanently.....NOTHING. You want a new gun, a new outfit or character? Well you have the choice of using in-game cash to get some of this stuff (Limited choices) or use real cash to hang on to stuff a bit longer. (Wider variety of items to choose from). The expiration date on items range between a couple of hours to the maximum of 90 days before you must repurchase said item. I will still give them credit for the fact that time on the item is only deducted from in-game use only.\n\nThe game has good traits as well but as I have continued to play this game, I've noticed all of the bad traits of the game greatly outweigh all of the good traits that really make this a really fun game to play. Playing this game with an inept anti-cheat system in place is basically one step forward and five steps back....", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 585, "steamid": "76561197999406618", "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1488320493}, "recommendationid": "29931258", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.531373", "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_updated": 1487117708}, {"votes_funny": 5, "timestamp_created": 1488040841, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Where to begin... \nI've played this game on and off throughout the years, well before it got to Steam and let me tell you this: There has never been a more pay to win (P2W) game than this here.
