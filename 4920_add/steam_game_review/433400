Unfortunately, I found all the game systems poorly balanced and can't see how to have much fun. Fighting doesn't work, thieving doesn't work, and there doesn't seem to be any way to keep Kim happy and healthy. It's like an Indian Oregon Trail that only ends in dyssentary.  I'm sure someone who playtested and understood what was supposed to happen had a different experience. I guess all I really learned was the the mysterious orient was probably pretty unhappy and unfun.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 170, "steamid": "76561198027103160", "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "last_played": 1505566837}, "recommendationid": "34996488", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502071", "votes_up": 1, "developer_response": "Hi Tidaldust, really sorry to hear you haven't enjoyed the game so far, especially if you are a fellow fan of Kipling's writing! It is a challenging game, particularly when you are learning the systems. I can give some helpful tips, which will ensure you can keep Kim healthy and happy.\n\n1. At the start, before you leave Lahore, buy some food and medicine for your travels and make sure to eat and sleep whenever Kim is hungry or tired\n2. Always check campfires, barrels, etc for items, you will find a lot of free food this way\n3. You can beg for food at every restaurant, grocer and chai wallah - this works a lot better when you are with the lama\n4. Plan your transport carefully, you should use the train for longer journeys if possible\n5. If you need money, you can get a job e.g. at the barracks in Ferozepore\n6. Going to school improves Kim's health and happiness (as well as opening up some quest lines)\n\nThieving and fighting are best left for later when you have better stats and equipment and often only as a last resort (depending on what sort of playthrough you are going for). I hope that inspires you to give it another try. If there is anything else we can help with, post in the forum and we'll get back to you.", "timestamp_updated": 1505567175, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1505763483}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 4, "total_positive": 9, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 13}}
