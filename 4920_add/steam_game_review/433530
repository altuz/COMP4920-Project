The Dev team was and is the best I've ever communicated with, they literally tried everything to help understand why this game would not work for me.

Again, I couldn't be more happy with the Dev team of this game, but as far as Steam goes.....they Suck.....can't review my circumstances and give me a refund....instead they keep my money and let me know I'm screwed even though I bought a game that should play but doesn't. I'll come back to let you all know, I told Steam that if I don't receive a refund I will leave for good. I'm not the biggest purchasing Steam customer, but I'm a customer that is loyal none the less....been buying steam games for a few years now.....but they are about to lose me for good.......I can't say much about the game other than if you have a MAC I wouldn't buy it until they can figure out why it doesn't work and take your money.
