The Xbox controller does not work, and, the Steam Link controller, nor keyboard work during the \"Challenges\" It says to press \"K\" and the \"X\" button, and I do, but nothing is happening. It does not shoot, or do anything but flash when I press it. Not sure if this means I have to come back to this level again to do the Challenge, but I find it odd to believe that this would be required to do nearly the moment you start the game. Very sad this is happening, because this does look like a fun game. I just wish that \"full controller support\" meant \"full controller support\"", "comment_count": "5", "author": {"num_games_owned": 242, "steamid": "76561197970917035", "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1457840468}, "recommendationid": "21234042", "votes_down": 7, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.493333", "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1455555590}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1455700203, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "For games where you play a chef I'll take burgertime over this any day.
