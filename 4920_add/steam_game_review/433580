It is very dated, and many of the puzzles are ridiculously hard; even as an adult I'm relying heavily on guides because some of them are inexplicable.  Nevertheless, the sense of time and place and atmosphere is fantastic, and the less obtuse puzzles are challenging and satisfying.  While this will surely be a niche purchase, for those who enjoy old-school point-and-click adventure games and have nostalgia for FMV games, I do recommend it, I'm having a blast revisiting it!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 336, "steamid": "76561198024963211", "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1492323433}, "recommendationid": "31030220", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506521", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1491702300}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4}}
