[/h1] The game is actually chapter one of a set, and after the ending, the groundwork is laid for chapter two. I\u2019m sure it will be as charming as this initial installment has proved to be. \n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] \nThe music puzzles are what really stands apart in Song of Seven. Gameplay consists of the typical for adventure games like Deponia, but with less pointing, less clicking, & less chores. This creates an easy moving adventure game that leaves room for more of the things we like in a good p&c adventure: music, cut scenes & dialog. The dialog options alternate between listening & choice-based answers. The choice based dialog is rather simplified, and can end the game suddenly if you make the obvious wrong choices within the framework of the allegory, because our character is supposed to be learning something from this narrative. Wrong answers would be the equivalent of failing the mission. I finished the whole game in 5 hours, even after having to restart it after a big delay, because I got a new computer. I\u2019d missed one of the achievies in that play through, so it only took 20 minutes to run back through the first chapter to catch that. \n\n[b]Narrative:[/b] \nHumor and nostalgia-filled moments lead you through a lovely mythological tale of a lost hunter goddess. The boy lives in a village that has been overtaken by fear to the point that they live locked in their own city walls. Then a girl shows up outside the gate to draw the boy away into the forest around his city. \n\n[b]Graphics/Art:[/b] \nCamera controls allow you to fully appreciate the art that illustrates the story. It is illustrated with deep hues of earth-tones, that bring out panoramas & sunsets in full color splendor. The graphics perform well with a good framerate. I experienced no drops or lags at all. Just a smooth, pleasant play-through without any difficulties. Certainly a game that is family friendly in every aspect. I saw no bugs or graphical errors either. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b] \n*Socially/ psychologically oriented narrative \n*Simple mechanics\n*Musical immersion\n*Good soundtrack\n\n[b]Cons:[/b] \n*Not as challenging as many p&c adventures. \n*Probably quick gameplay for faster gamers (maybe 3 hours for some) \n\n[h1]The Overture is the 1st of five planned episodes in The Song of Seven; a myth-based allegory of overcoming crippling fears. I highly recommend this musical adventure for gamers of all ages.[/h1]", "comment_count": "3", "author": {"num_games_owned": 1020, "steamid": "76561198154425859", "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "last_played": 1493353609}, "recommendationid": "31420731", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.557688", "votes_up": 28, "timestamp_updated": 1493399499}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 12, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 13}}
