I've been playing it for a bit now. The game is pretty nice and I really enjoy the dungeon crawling. Full scale and room scale are done very nice. That being said, I have one minor problem.\n\nThe one problem I have with this game that maybe I am missing on how to use it in game is, I want to use the Oculus touch stick to turn, but for some reason I have to actually position myself turned around or whatever way I wanna face. and warp to that position. While this is ok, I find myself often getting my foot tangled into the headset's cable when i am actually trying to move away from enemies quickly. Is there a way to turn with the sticks at all?\n\nAll in all, this game is a nice, cute dungeon crawler. It has really great and spot on game mechanics. It reminds me a little bit of the dungeon crawling in the first Zelda from the NES days, but in a VR setting.\n\nIf you're looking for a dungeon crawler within a VR experience then you probably would want to check this out. I'd recommend this game even though I haven't been able to turn with the stick on the touch controls. If this isn't implemented, hopefully it is one of these days.\n\nIn the end, I decided to refund my purchase until the dev adds in some way to use the stick on the Oculus Touch to turn at least, even if there is a setting to warp turn at 90 degrees or 45 degrees at a time. Having to turn around all the time when there is like 10-15 enemies in a room is pretty frustrating.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 186, "steamid": "76561198002097991", "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1502352410}, "recommendationid": "34141633", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503076", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1502385388}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1503769482, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This is a must buy if you have a VR headset and space for room scale.

The majority of the game\u2019s challenge is simply avoiding things by sliding, teleporting, or physically dodging out of the way, all the while returning fire. This ends up making it a bit of a bullet-hell experience. At the end of each level you will fight a boss and, upon winning, granted a new special weapon. There are various scrolls and tomes for temporary item and stat effects respectively that vary from useful to detrimental and are randomized with each playthrough as per the rogue style. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a title to introduce yourself or others to VR, Legend of Luca is a good pickup that will give you a fair return for your investment as it is procedurally generated to some degree, giving you a new experience with each playthrough.

The movement is awkward (either \"slide forward\" or \"teleport\"), the controls are just wonky (directions on the swivel sticks are \"use items\"?), I have no idea what items / scrolls actually do, but it doesn't matter, as the game is trivially easy regardless.  The melee weapons have no \"weight\" to them - just wave them around through monsters and the monsters flash a little then die.\n\nAs I said I haven't played many VR games yet, so perhaps some of these are just fundamental problems with these kind of games.  I really don't know how you can have \"good\" movement in a 3m x 3m room, but in a larger virtual world, without teleporting.  Or how teleporting can be done without removing all challenge (eg just teleport away from a monster when they get close). And how can you make a weapon \"feel heavy\"?\n\nBut unfortunately this game just isn't fun.\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 237, "steamid": "76561197970186000", "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1503582404}, "recommendationid": "34474625", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.496000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1503641395}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 18, "total_positive": 116, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 7, "total_reviews": 134}}
