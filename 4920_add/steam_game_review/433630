I also like Dimensional Intersection but that's a different experince being fractal based. But now with the reworking of the floor and the addition of a full spectrum of colors being added to the particles, it's better than ever. It also has some simple tools for drawing which react to your music as well, giving a chance for some interaction and to be creative. I like to put on my own music then do a mix of viualizers and games that work with my personal library of music and it would not be as good without VrAmp.
