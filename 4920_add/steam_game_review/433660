There are four game modes where you and other payers either work together to build ever higher in order to evade rising lava, work in teams to score baskets, fight as individuals to maintain control of cake or simply throw each other off platforms into pools of lava. \n\nOne thing that comes across is while all the game modes are simplistic and the graphics unassuming there is great enjoyments to have, as the skills are easy to learn but difficult to master. \n\nOn the whole it is an engaging game in which a rudimentary core game play is used with a surprising degree of variety without compromising its simplicity.   \n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1, "steamid": "76561198292267474", "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1475996475}, "recommendationid": "25941432", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499713", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1475996863}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1475883349, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Played local coop and had a blast with it.
