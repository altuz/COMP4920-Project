My remarks from less than 30 minutes of playing:\n\n- Camera behaves very strange. It is ok in vehicles, but very sluggish and laggy on foot.\n- Tractor behavior is very strange. Tractors accelerate too fast, and stop too slowly. Carrying heavy equipment makes no difference at all in behavior. I have never seen any farmer plow their field at 30+ km/h. \"Suspension\" on the rear axle makes steering in small places tricky.\n- A lot of often used UI elements are slow to get to. I.E. big map is only accessible through main menu.\n- Surprising lack of content. Only a few tractors, trailers and equipment available in the shop. As far as I can tell, only one map.\n- The map is split into several parts with a loading screen between. Is this necessary in 2017? Fields separate from \"main farm\".\n- Engine sounds are very bland.\n\nOn the positive side:\n- Large, diverse and well decorated maps.\n- Ground feels realistic, uneven in the fields and smooth roads.\n\nThere might be some enjoyment in this game for some people, but it is sadly asking too much money for too little.", "comment_count": "7", "author": {"num_games_owned": 175, "steamid": "76561197970126809", "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1458766531}, "recommendationid": "22011901", "votes_down": 46, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.642384", "votes_up": 141, "timestamp_updated": 1458767897}, {"votes_funny": 21, "timestamp_created": 1458796037, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I don't want to waste a lot of time reviewing this turd, but here goes.\n\nI'd call myself a veteran of Farming Sim Games.

Honestly, how can you make a farming game that is actually worse than Professional Farmer 2014??  I mean, come on?  I slightly enjoyed Pro Farmer 2014, but 2017 is an embarassment.\n\nI'm going to play a bit longer, but right now I can't see a light at the end of the tunnel which will make this game likable.\n\nIf you are expecting an experience equal to or better than Farming Simulator 2013 or Farming Simulator 15 but from a different company, THIS GAME IS NOT IT!\n\nAs a YouTuber and as your friend, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME IN ANY WAY AT THIS TIME!\n\nSpend your money on something better.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 171, "steamid": "76561197980901680", "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1458795597}, "recommendationid": "22017167", "votes_down": 49, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.618665", "votes_up": 133, "timestamp_updated": 1458796037}, {"votes_funny": 9, "timestamp_created": 1458769163, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This is copy and paste from a thread I started when the game came out.\n***update****Played an additional 35 minutes***\nJust posting my notes,\n5 crops wheat,rye,canola,barley,corn and grass for animals.\nHas farmhands but you can't see them work.\nAn astonishing lack of usable equipment.\nMirror \"reflection\" is not a reflection and is so bad you kinda wish it was just left blank.\nCertain ground textures are really really bad and repetative.

Not much in the game that makes you want to stay with it.\n***end update***\n\nIf any of you hang out in the farm simulator forums of the various farm games over the years you may recognize my name. If not, thats probably better for you but UIG knows me. Me and UIG have a past. The long and short of it is I dislike them. The type of dislike and mistrust you have in a 3rd cousin that always comes around and steals from your grandmother type of dislike.\nI created a steam group called Caveat Emptor with the sole purpose of warning people of games like UIG publishes. We lobbied players for several games warning them of the various problems they could face when buying from these German publishers. Ag Sim, Pro Farm ect . if it sucked we were on it. Thankfully steam ended up making a review system so we disbanded.\n\nToday is a different time though in the steam world. We now not only have a review system we also have a product return system.\n\nI see alot of people not wanting to take the plunge so in a few minutes I will purchase and play the game for 60 minutes , putting me well within the 2 hour time limit for returns and giving me enough time to at least check for a broken game. Stay tuned I will post my results to the end of this post.\n\nOk exactly 59 minutes of playing later......\nFirst my specs, Win10 I7 3.6 with 12 gb ram, nvidia 760ti with 2gb ram.\nSettings used: everything max even the stuff I hate. 1600X900 resolution. FPS was locked at 58 for the entire play through.\nWhat I did: I went through the tutorial. Explored settings, tried to make stuff break.\nWhat I found:\nWell the game start and runs. but so did the last pro farm 2014. So that really isn't saying much hehe. From a technical side it wouldn't break or get it to break ie crashes ect. So technically the game is not broken, it works and is completely playable and seems to be for the most part error free, although NOT glitch free.\nThat is as far as I will go from the buyer beware point of view. Reviewing the game is subjective and I personally think those two things should be seperate ( if a game works/not and if it fun).\n\nFrom a review perspective going through the tutorial introduced me to the basics of farming and animal upkeep in the game. It took about 35-40 minutes to go through with me stopping during various tasks to take notice of glitches ect. (the other 19 minutes of my play time was devoted to trying to technically crash the game).\n\nThe game plays simuliar to pro farm 14 and has touches of ag sim in it as well I believe. It incorporates the animals into the farming side for the production of slurry and the animals aparently mate and breed providing they are taken cared of. During the tutorial there were a few odds and ends like the tut telling you to press the d-pad up but you end up needing to press it down. Also you run across some agravating things like not being able to unhook your last piece of equipment for the next on in the tutorial unless you un-hook it right in front of the next item you need. So then you have to push the old equipment out of the way with your tractor.\n\nFrom a simulation perspective, the game simulates insects and weeds apparently (did not experience that personally) you also have to monitor water levels (humidity) so compared to its competitor ( FS by Giants) it is a bit more complex but easy to manage as the interface is pretty strait foward. The fields are pretty small in comparision though and the field itself looks like a bandaid on the earth as it is a raised patch above ground level. \n\nI would imagine this is to accomodate the deformable terrain and make lag managable which I think was the other games achilles because the whole map was deformable and this has got to cause an issue but i am no programmer. So although it looks like crap, it makes the deformable terrain possible and managable fps wise. Is it worth the trade off?? Well I found myself thinking it was worth the trade off anytime I was in the middle of a field but anytime driving next to the edge I was instantly annoyed (the tractor sometimes catches this edge) and driving up on a field , well it just like poo so was it worth the trade-off?? yes and no.\n\nSo the field and farm sim seems ok but what about equipment simulation? Now I for one could care less about equipment licenses and driving the \"official\" tatra or whatever. So I won't makr it down for that although some others may. But the vehicles are just like other farm games from them and other non -Giants companies. They lack simulation especially the most important vehicles in the game, the tractor and the combine. For starters once again the vehicles have this wierd suspension that seems to be based in the center of the vehicle. So your tractor tires do not move up and down but the tractor rocks back and forth. its kinda like being in a small boat. The suspension is also way overdone as far as bouncing around goes. I feel like I am in my teen age years lincoln continental which had really bad shocks and would rock for 30 secons after hitting a bump in the road.\n\nThe turn radius on the tractors is also lacking but maybe that just the \"feel\" and maybe the radii are correct for ech vehicle. The harvesters dont have visible grain tank (least not the one in tutorial). Trailer hitches are on a single horizontal plane and have no ability to move oon a verticle axis. So when you go over bumbs any trailer will lift up. For instance, go over the little rise from the pavement as you go from dirt to road at an angle and one side of your trailer tires will be off the ground at certain moments. Weight seems to have no effect. Terrain no effect. You can plow and max speed for instance. So simulation wise the equipment is the worst part of this game.\n\nWill I keep the game....well i have another 40 minutes of \"safe\" time to explore the game still so I might at least do that, keeping it....not so sure.\n\nWhile giants does need to worry about the \"other\" farm game coming out later this year I don't think they need to worry about this title all that much, other than the fact they ( giants ) better get thier poopies together or face extinction because real compitition is not far away and frankly this title, if they could fix the vehicles could be part of that compitition.\n\nI will post this all in the review section and I am going to, for the time being give it a thumbs up. Because 1) it aint broke, 2) at the price it does at least meet the value imho \nIf I were to grade it though it would be a 5 out of 10.\nI may revisit my thumbs up at a later date.", "comment_count": "7", "author": {"num_games_owned": 218, "steamid": "76561198010801253", "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1458771686}, "recommendationid": "22012224", "votes_down": 48, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.563120", "votes_up": 85, "timestamp_updated": 1458772134}, {"votes_funny": 11, "timestamp_created": 1458797809, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This game is a complete joke.
