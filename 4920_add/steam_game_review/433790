How do these thrown together horror games keep making it onto steam?\nIt's another case of someone building a fairly authentic, if cliche'd intro and then just throwing a few rooms together until they had enough to call it, albeit generously, a game.  And generous I am being as it took me less than an hour to finish.  Yes I know there are other endings but I was so underwhelmed the first time around there was no incentive to play again.\nThe game starts with the standard horror setting - a dark, wooden forest with standard eerie looking church with a crypt and nearby haunted mansion.  To be fair to the game there was a well done, fairly chilling moment in the crypt when I caught a glimpse of something horrific in the distant dark.  But that's it, for the remainder of the game, nothing even remotely scary happens.  Or anything much at all I'm afraid.  And for a horror game that's enough to not recommend it.  You will not get your kicks here.\n\nThere's a bit of the usual mind-melting moments where scenery is rearranged behind you that has come as standard in modern horror games, but beyond that moment in the crypt I did not feel remotely threatened at all.\n\nAnd for a game that doesn't give much it's inordinately fussy when it comes to player input.  I lost quite a few minutes at the start as I couldn't open a locked gate with my crowbar.  I didn't realise that I had to be precisely 2&1/2 to 3 feet away, offset at an angle of about 22degrees, to trigger the magical floating crowbar animation.  Then I immediately fell down a ditch in the garden beyond and get stuck, and I was close to packing it in when I was thankfully able to jump back out again.\n\nSound and graphics are a mixed bag as well.  Sound was pretty unremarkable in general, beyond a very weird breathing sound in the intro area that always came from behind you.  And it was so constant without any hint of a threat that it came off as just an odd design choice rather than an atmosphere builder.  Graphics wise it's all very standard, albeit a bit too overly dark.\n\nThe story building notes you find are just poorly written, grammatically incorrect nonsence.  And after a bit of wandering around the mansion, collecting key and other objects to unlock more doors, the game just shudders to an end.  With nothing more than another stupid document to read.\n\nAvoid at all costs.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1113, "steamid": "76561198035599199", "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1492278559}, "recommendationid": "31161879", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505317", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1492279787}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 4, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 5}}
