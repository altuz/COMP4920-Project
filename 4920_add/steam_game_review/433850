They let cheaters, teamers, team killers to wreak havoc, but not once they banned innocent players. It could have been their gold mine, but most of their decisions just harmed the game. They are lying daily in reddit, commenting mostly on the positive feedbacks, while the avg. player count drops every day. \n\nThe gunplay was never too great, but now they just introduced 'bloom' with the combat update, and even with the community outcry they won't touch anything. The skill gap worsens after every patch. They want it to be a competitive, e-sport game, while making the dumbest decisions ever. The game is going downhill and now nothing will stop it.\n\nThey change the texture every few months, give us a few new POI, so the end games are more likely to be decided by RNG. Optimization worsens by the time, some high end PC has micro stutters, but since it doesn't affect the majority of the playerbase the fix is not a priority for them.\nIn solo, if you kill somebody, they will probably curse you, scream and/or tell your positions to other players in the most squeaky voice even if it doesn't benefit them. \n\nThe only consistent thing is the new crates every month or two, although you can't sell the items in the steam market. They give too many free stuff out to have a consistent, normal market.\n\nThe game won't ever leave early access, and we didn't have a normal game season yet. They also just tell you half a day before the preseason ends so sometimes you won't have the chance to reach your goal.\n\nIt's still basically the only fast paced BR game as it is now, and i still recommend not to buy it. I didn't even have the time and mood to write down everything that is wrong with the game. You can refund it, if you played <2 hours, or try PUBG, if you are into a slower, boring BR. The BR community probably has to wait for an actual good game.\n\n/The review is not yet complete, but it has my main points/", "comment_count": "13", "author": {"num_games_owned": 453, "steamid": "76561198002290895", "playtime_forever": 38220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 302, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1507132347}, "recommendationid": "34814280", "votes_down": 34, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.607841", "votes_up": 136, "timestamp_updated": 1504877491}, {"votes_funny": 5, "timestamp_created": 1504957060, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "I loved this game.

AK fullspray at medium range is also far too effective. \n\n-They know they should have added recoil patterns to the guns similar to CSGO, but instead they added \"bloom\" similar to what destiny and other games did, this straight up ruined skilled gunplay as now shots are no longer predictable under recoil, as they randomly spread in a circle instead of an understandable pattern that may take skill to compensate for.\n\n-Cheaters are now more common than ever, and these are not the kind wether or not it is a question that they are cheating, more like they are straight advertising cheats for sale in their name such as \"FuZhuQQxxxxxxxxxx\" (FuZhuQun means auxiliary groups, which means cheating groups, and obvioulsy replace the X's with numbers) and for those who dont understand, QQ and YY are chinese social networks and instant messaging softwares, and they have their number in their name so you can contact them to buy their software, this is not speculation on my part, I know this because I have many many chinese friends that I play this game with and I have just asked them about these names etc without implying anything while asking.\n\n-Daybreak knows full well about this but they honestly do not care because if they have delayed bans they can make money off of the cheaters buying new accounts periodically.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 376,
