It's a good game. Basically, you have to build a little machine to help you get past certain obsticles. Sounds good, right? Well, not really, because the physics is this game are totally garbage. It's so hard to explain. You got wheels with way too much friction. If one of your parts scrapes anything, it will send you flying (maybe even off the map). \n\nAnother huge problem I have with this game is that fact that they never seem to give you enough parts to let your creativity run wild. I get the fact that they didn't want to make the game too easy for you, but what they should have done was make a system that gives you points based on how many parts you used. Some things are just locked, and it leaves you with the feeling that there is really only one way to solve a puzzle (two if there is a bonus achievement for that level.)\n\nThe best things about this game are the price (when it's on sale) and the concept. I would like to see the physics get a major overhaul. In this game, or at least in the sequel. I did enjoy the first couple hours in this game, but after that it became a nightmare of poor physics and limited parts. I would recommend that you get this game on sale, or hope that the sequel (if they make it) is better. But in it's current form, and at full price, I cannot recommend this game.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 277, "steamid": "76561198007749828", "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 78, "last_played": 1493196464}, "recommendationid": "31371268", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.517215", "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1493525185}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "total_positive": 7, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 9}}
