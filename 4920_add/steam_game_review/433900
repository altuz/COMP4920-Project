Somehow, all crew members are dead and you are alone trying to figure out wtf happened. Goal seems to be establishing the \"signal's nature\", whatever that means...\n\n[b]MY TAKE:[/b]\nIt is a pseudo walking simulator with some basic FPS shooting. \nYou wander around, exploring. Well, more like go where the dev wants you to go. You try to figure out why you're alone in an unknown planet. Then... as you explore, you find dead astronauts and some have notes. You try to survive against the enemies that world throws at you: squid-like jellyfish aliens, some tiny UFO that shoots electricity, black jumping goo, astronauts shadows and the \"last boss\", a floating black shadow astronaut. \n\nEventually, you do find a \"hover bike\" that increases the pace much more. \nSadly it doesn't last long! The controls are quite wonky too.\n\nThe landscape truly gives you \"50 shades of grey\" pun intended ;) , as that is the main color you see everywhere... beside some dark grey, white and black. Some green leaves from trees...\n\nThe music goes very well with the ambiance and I'd be interested to get the game soundtrack as a DLC (free would be very appreciated).\n\nThe \"last boss\" is very B I T C H Y. \n[h1]PROTIP: Hit the white orbs floating around him with your 'assault rifle' and hide behind the big rocks.[/h1]\n\nOnce you do \"beat\" the game, there seems to be a survival \"horde\" mode, where you try to survive against those squid-like jellyfish aliens but the thing is, you aren't armed but can only use fist. And with the slow [b]AF[/b] running speed, that mode is totally pointless. You don't even know what to do. \n\n[b]CONCLUSION:[/b] \nOverall, an 'okay\" kind of a game. Great ambiance and music without a doubt but the controls aren't intuitive. The checkpoint system is too spaced between eachs. Increasing their frequency would help \"skip long portions of walking back to where you died\".\n\nWORST is the movement. You cannot run longer than 3 seconds. Takes 10 seconds to cooldown too so makes it pointless. You cannot jump higher than a sidewalk border. Clearly, these needs to be addressed for another game because that truly kills the gameplay. I've skipped the jumping \"puzzles\" since I kept falling down from lack of running speed.\n\nThat is the kind of game that have some good and bad elements. I'd hate to not recommend for an indie developer but again, I just can't get myself to recommend this game to anyone. I'll leave it at \"YES\" because there is some good to experience and I do hope ROCKETSHIP improves upon this project and makes a better game later on.\n\n[i]At 5$, this ain't bad for this strange indie production.[/i]", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 1483, "steamid": "76561197969592572", "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 191, "num_reviews": 270, "last_played": 1506277225}, "recommendationid": "35188190", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506284010}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 5, "total_positive": 9, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 14}}
