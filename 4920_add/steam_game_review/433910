It keeps changing from being a decent rhythm game to being a [b]frustratingly bad designed[/b] reaction game in an instant. And even when it actually does play like a rhythm game there's no way to know if you are to follow the beat of the bass or the melody of the lead \u2013 except for [b]trial and error[/b]. And sometimes the button presses don't align with anything at all. It's a shame but the lousy game design just doesn't match the [b]incredible presentation[/b].\n\nActually, it perplexes me how many stupid design choices were made with this game. Who thought it was a good idea to slow down the whole game once you hit an obstacle when you're supposed to react quickly or to stay with the beat? Why would you put the camera at a super slanted angle when there's flat obstacles on the track making them just barely visible? Why is it that 'practice mode' makes you restart from the very beginning of a stage once you make one single mistake? Shouldn't you be cut some slack when practicing a stage? What's the point of making it even harder?\n\nI've been a gamer for more than 20 years now, I love 80s-style visuals and music and I even am a musician myself \u2013 yet I cannot recommend this game at all. Not unless it's being seriously overhauled. Or being re-released as a screensaver...", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 153, "steamid": "76561197985309758", "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1506477423}, "recommendationid": "35233845", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502607", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506479354}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 46, "total_positive": 240, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 286}}
