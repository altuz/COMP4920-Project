I think I own around 7 of them. The others are awesome. This one is torturous.\n\nPros: It's Aveyond. Cute characters. Nice story. Beautiful graphics. Characters in reserve earn xp. \n\nCons: Too confusing. As with all Aveyond games, you have to zig zag all over the place. Not a problem but without maps included it is hellacious trying to figure out how to get back to a previous location. Between the ferry, mist portal and ship....I don't know which way is up. With previous Aveyonds, you took your ship to a location and maybe had to navigate a woods or two. \nI've spent most of my time trying traveling and googling 'how do I get to (insert town name'. \n\nMore cons: Game is very skimpy as far as coins go. Drops from fights wouldn't be so bad if the weapons and armors weren't so expensive. With previous Aveyonds, I never ran out of money. \n\nIf you're looking for your typical fun Aveyond game, this isn't it.\n\nIf I wanted to be this frustrated and clueless with a game, I would have played Nancy Drew instead.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention 6/10 times I minimize the game to consult strategy guide or Google, the game glitches and my mouse cursor blinks and disappears. \nIf I am in a doorway or near stairs, my char will automatically walk up and down the stairs, or back and forth through the doorway and I can't stop him.\n\nIf I'm out in the open, the char will randomly walk in 1 direction until he can't any longer. I cannot move him with my mouse. Keyboard commands still work. I have no option but to save and restart the game.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 10, "steamid": "76561198113932136", "playtime_forever": 5713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1500860071}, "recommendationid": "33709146", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500684089}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 3, "total_positive": 26, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 29}}
