I just finished playing it and I felt quite sad when I saw that it's probably not going to full version. Please Devs, let us know if it's going to be otherwise.\nOkay, the game has some flaws (it's early access after all) but it has a soul, as the devs say. They gave as much as they could give since funding has been a problem of the whole project.\n\nThe Good\nVery nice graphic style. In my eyes they're exactly as old classics would look like had they been made in 2017. Not the cartoon-style recent remakes use but neither a very realistic style. They're very detailed and very, very well made. This also means that there are many items to click on the background which don't actually do anything to help you go on but they give you background information to get you more into the game.\nThe soundtrack fits the story and the place perfectly. It's a bit repetitive but that's all. Very nice depressive composition.\nThe story itself is not something unique in game history but any Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk fan will get hooked.\nThe riddles. Some are very easy, some are normal and some just require much searching.\n\nThe really bad\nLack of funding...\n\nThe \"not so bad\"/neutral\nSome typos here and there. The dialogues are too extensive for my taste. Also some phrases don't seem natural. I guess a native English speaker could help.\nIt would be better if the inventory was placed at any edge of the screen (top/bottom/left/right) so it would come out just by taking the mouse pointer to that place. Right now you need to right click to see the inventory which appears in the middle of the screen. In some places it's difficult to find a place which isn't a hot-spot to right-click so you can't easily open the inventory.\nThere's no voice acting. But then again neither the classics had one...\n\nIf I'd make a parallelism it would be this one. The devs knew they couldn't afford a Lamborghini so they went for a FIAT. And they maintain it, keep it clean an shiny while the Lambo would be spare parts already due to the lack of maintenance (see Syberia 3). But it seems they're out of petrol...\n\nThose 6 hours I played the game definitely deserve my 5\u20ac", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 48, "steamid": "76561198012031982", "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1494031641}, "recommendationid": "31576728", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1494062735}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4}}
