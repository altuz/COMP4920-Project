Sometimes the dialogue is a bit difficult to understand as a result. There isn't that much dialogue though. Mostly this is just a match 3 game with a hilarious premise.\n\nThere are no powerups or abilities, hints or shuffles. But, you are not required to make a match with every turn. Every level gains more and more orbs. I've only run out of turns once. But because of how the rows can be emptied, I have lost multiple times because the final matches were not in a perfect row. It isn't hard apart from that bit. You can gain multiple lives (I'm not sure how exactly? I just noticed I gained them) so it isn't an immediate game over.\n\nOverall, not bad for the price.

The round ends when the player:\n\n1) Matches all icons on the board, clearing it\n2) Runs out of turns\n3) Runs out of viable moves.\n\nMore often than not, you will find that #3 is the most usual outcome of each turn followed closely by #2.  Most Match-3's I have played have a tendency to have all the action going on on one side of the board or the other.  After a few turns, one of the middle columns will affect the other side of the board and the action moves to the previously unused side.  This tendancy is mirrored in \"Wishmaster\" as well; however, due to the fact that this game only has a finite number of tiles for each round this quickly becomes a detriment.   To be fair, the game does try to toss out a few tiles to 'help\" on occasion as you exhaust your columns, but more often than not this \"assistance\" only serves to make things worse.  So, get ready to have quite a few rounds end with two tiles on the bottom and the third tile you need to finish the puzzle on top of one of the other two (and unmovable).\n\nYou also only have 3 attempts: [b]PERIOD[/b].  Not 3 attempts at each puzzle - simply 3 attempts.  Now, I could undertand if this were just in a quick-play mode, but this is the [b]STORY MODE[/b] we're talking about; and there is nothing that makes me want to keep playing a game more than getting to Level 3 and then having to strat all over again from Level 1 because I wound up going \"3 and Out\".  When you do find yourself starting all over again, you'll find yourself having to view the opening \"story\" without an option to skip through it (yeah, you can spam the space bar to speed the dialogue up, but some of us just want to cut to the chase).\n\nAll-in-all, save yourself some money and the aggrivation induced headache and just pass on this game.  If you simply cannot live for one more second without an anime Match-3 game there are far better ones out there than this that you'd be better off playing instead of this one.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1736, "steamid": "76561198032072517", "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "last_played": 1482007691}, "recommendationid": "28433890", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1482010118}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 4, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "num_reviews": 6, "total_reviews": 6}}
