The first 5-10 hours, it was a fairly enjoyable Tower Defense game. As you are leveling, and buying new things, everything feels OK. Challenging levels, many different variants of levels including several \"arenas\" where you can try your luck on a single map where other variables will change. \n\nThe story is pretty decent as far as games go. They aren't going to win any pulitzer prizes, but it's serviceable and progresses the game. \n\nTowers, the heart & sole of Tower Defense, come in many varieties, but you'll find yourself using such a low number of these, because of the upgrade costs,  that all the spots they give you maps will go empty. \n\nPathing is a big problem in this game. You aren't told the paths that enemies will take, and you will constantly be starting over levels because of a new path that the zombies will take around your defenses. I hate games where I have to play several times just to memorize the paths. So many TD games give you the paths they will take with a simple key that I'm surprised they didn't include this. I guess they consider this a game mechanic. Oh, and levels will change on you from one try to the next. \n\nWhere the game falls apart is the end-game and the leveling mechanic for the heroes. It's quite obvious this game started out as a Free / low cost with a store to buy yourself credits for additional $$. The problem is when they ported this to Steam, while they removed the store, they didn't adjust any of the exponential cost / experience required for leveling heroes. \n\nSo I went through all levels on Normal, then again on Hard, and I've done about 15 levels on nightmare. I have 2 heroes leveled all the way to 25, and two more that are level 23. \n\nI just don't see the point of continuing. I'm close to getting to level 25, but the repetition is absolutely killing me. It's not fun. \n\nWith the upgrade paths for both towers and heros, you can just grind yourself through the game. You don't have to try any new strategy, you just need to level up your hero and towers. This is a flaw IMO because lack of repeatability means I'm not sure I'm doing good or not. Also, it's impossible to give any specific advice to people because of the variation of heroes and towers with the leveling mechanic means that you and someone else will not have the same things, so any advice on levels is just not going to work. \n\nAnother negative is the implementation of the endless levels - if I could pick a game with the absolute worst endless mode, Last Hope would be that game. Every 5 levels the game wipes half your towers. It's absolutely not recoverable from and the randomness of it really is super frustrating - I never did play any more levels after the first few forays. \n\nIf this game is on sale for $1.99 or cheaper during a steam sale, go for it, but don't get hung up on the hero leveling or upgrading towers. Just pick a few towers (poison, sniper, farmer & air defense) and that's all you really need.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 251, "steamid": "76561197985603115", "playtime_forever": 2513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1501562824}, "recommendationid": "33942212", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.522535", "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1501563766}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 19, "total_positive": 91, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 110}}
