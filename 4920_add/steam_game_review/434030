FS 2 has so much potential. Keep up the good work guys and keep improving! I would love to see better flight dynamics, more realistic models and more realistic aircraft operating procedures, real world weather, more content, etc. I really hope this evolves into an study level simulator.\n\nBy the way, I think the bad reviews are caused by people having wrong expectations of this game. Before buying you should do your research, watch some videos and know that you will not get (FOR NOW) a lot of stuff like: cold starts, complete operating aircraft models (not even mixture control), a huge ammount of airports and scenery, ATC, glitch or bug free simulator. But somehow, despite all that, this is honestly one of the most fun and mind blowing experiences I've had in flight simulation and in VR; I can't help but smile when I think about what FS 2 can become in a few months, if the developers do a good job.

It works fine on the HMD itself but the controls don't register in-game unless you use SteamVR mode (as opposed to the native OculusVR mode). And even then your \"hands\" are replaced with Vive controllers, where the button layout and general functionality is completely different, and it just overall makes for a stilted and annoying experience. Add onto this the controllers don't work realistically - there's no \"clench hand to drag throttle\", you can't grab onto the yoke - it's just very limited and not very fun.\n\nMy recommendation is getting X-Plane 11 with the FlyInside plugin instead. Much better VR control, full hand-controls for Oculus VR (where your controllers actually look like hands, by the way).", "comment_count": "7", "author": {"num_games_owned": 274, "steamid": "76561198003447454", "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1504969000}, "recommendationid": "34839194", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.495650", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1504968763}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 104, "total_positive": 318, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 6, "total_reviews": 422}}
