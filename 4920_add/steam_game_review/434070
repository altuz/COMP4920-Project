I Really like the look and feel of this game, and really the pathing is the biggest downfall of this game.\n\nImagine clicking and dragging a dotted line from your zombie to it's attack point, lining everything up nicely, you get halfway through the map and realise inorder to get the last guy you must zig zag inbetween 8 obsticals placed very close together. You only have one Gaint left and two little guys, there is only the Blonde female with the faster firing 6 shot pistel. You draw your line, it seems like the pathing will be good and then your giant gets stuck on the first corner and your little guys rush out and get killed. Well crap, now you have to restart over. You get to the same point but this time you make sure the big guy doesn't get stuck and now your little guys got stuck on corner 2 and 3, Big guy went down and now the little guys are dead too. Okay restart again. You get to the same point but this time you take 3 minutes slowly drawing the line to make sure that they won't get stuck. They get stuck.

Especially when you \nare repeating a level becuase the tablet optimized\ncontrols got you stuck. Again. And again.\n\nUntil this day path finding and crash issues\nhave not been addressed. Seing as these issues\npersist since February and there has been no reaction\nfrom the developer's side, neither on the steam forums\nnor on their official channel, the best bet is that this \ngame will unfortunately be offered 'as it is'. \n\nThe in-game opitions are limited to turning the \nsound on and off. There is no volume option. \n\nGraphics wise you have the option to turn\nfullscreen on or off. That's it. That are your options.\n\nThe lack of options might be overlooked if there\nwere other strengths in which regard the game\nwould shine. \n\nAs for the quality of the puzzles, if you have been\nplaying puzzle games some time between to original\ngameboy days and today, there's a high chance of a\nbeen-there-done-that feeling setting in, in the course\nof the first ten levels. \n\nThe tutorial still has the example finger that \nadvocates to slide your cursor for movements.\n\nFor a sale between 70% to 90% off this might\nhave the potential to be a little timewaster.\n\nBut honestly, with the host of indie games\nout there, I'm not sure if you want to invest \ntime in this, even just to have a look if it \nmight be up your alley.\n\nI won't stop you from trying it though.\nBut I won't recommend to do so either. \n\nAn irritating tidbit from the credits.\nThey seem to have been taken one\nto one from the tablet version.
