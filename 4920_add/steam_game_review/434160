They offered a free steam key if you managed to beat the \"final\" boss. So i challenged myself to do it. \n\nGrabbed the controller and went right into the game. Easy controls and off I went on this journey. As i progressed through the 5 stages it got hard really quickly (ramping up by a lot after every stage). The mechanics and gameplay reminded me of megaman which is one of my favorite oldschool game series. Especially the weapons you unlock after bossfights reminded me of this.\nThe artwork looks really great and I especially enjoy the dark vibe to it. \nThere is a lot to explore (so many secrets) and a lot of challenges when you beat the story for the first time.\nThe \"last\" boss was a big challenge at first but once I learned his patterns it quickly turned into my favorite fight of this game.\nOne of the devs watched me struggle on the last boss and when I got close to killing him, he actually cheered for me and when I landed the killing blow it felt like he was just as excited as me. \nHe offered me the steam key as promised but I declined because I wanted to support the devs by buying it. I felt like a great game like this really deserves it :)\n\nTo sum it up quickly: Really awesome game with awesome devs, they created something amazing here.\nCan't wait to beat boss rush (because I already got hooked when I tried the game at the booth), Story + and finding all of the secrets.\n\nEdit: I played Story + and I really liked what they did with it..  a really nice challenge again and it's cool that you can actually (spoilers) defeat the \"final\" boss at Stage 1 when you see him for the first time.\nI really enjoy completing the achievements and I plan on getting this game to 100%", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 240, "steamid": "76561198009434419", "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1495364442}, "recommendationid": "31871575", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.537903", "votes_up": 21, "timestamp_updated": 1495396598}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1495218975, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I love this game.

I generally liked the aesthetic, the upside-down-world aspect (which kind of reminded me of Battle of Olympus) and the gameplay that looked like an interesting take on Mega Man.\n\nOverall, I've been happy with the game. It controls quite well, even in the upside-down-segments (which I tend to have a lot of trouble with it games). The level design is interesting -- it is obviously planned out, but also has kind of a random-feeling quality to it. Some levels are fairly straightforward left-to-right affairs, while others require some backtracking. I've enjoyed the weapon system too -- you get new abilities by beating bosses and can switch on the fly, ala Mega Man. Unlike Mega Man, there's no weapon charge meter, so you can use them to your heart's content. I've actually found the 4 I've found to be different enough to be worth switching between fairly consistently, it's not just a matter of picking the right thing for a boss.\n\nOn that point, the bosses have all been pretty cool. They have patterns, but there is a lot of variety in those patterns. So I've found them to be challenging and largely fair. I am stuck on one boss now, but I know with some time I'll overcome it. This is made a lot less frustrating because while the game is difficult, it does have checkpoints -- I can keep retrying a boss easily, the main loss is that my score resets to zero (my impression is that this also affects the ending?).\n\nThere are some things I don't love about it. The early stages, in particular, have some fairly busy backgrounds that are of a similar tone to the foreground -- so I've had a hard time differentiating between things. This was especially hard for me in a forest area where I was dealing with spiders jumping in and out of the underground world because I could barely tell where they were. I was glad to find this to be less of an issue later in the game.\n\nThere are also situations where you just feel overwhelmed with enemies. It's certainly possible to overcome them, but having 10 clouds shooting icicles at you while dodging two other things is a bit much. That said, the fact that enemies don't instantly respawn offscreen makes this a LOT more managable than it would have been in the NES days. In fact, they don't respawn at all: there are a couple of achievements revolving around killing every monster in the stages.\n\nIn the end though, I've enjoyed what I've played of the game and think it's a good example of its genre. The main game looks to be about 90 to 120 minutes if you blast through it, but there are items to collect and other modes that round out the package. So I feel like it's worth the $10. Looking forward to finishing it and checking out the New Game+ option.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1550, "steamid": "76561197994334020", "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1495658658}, "recommendationid": "31935469", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505238", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1495656506}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1495408140, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "A great little retro platformer that feels like a cross between Megaman and Castlevania with a sprinkle of Zelda.\nIf you like Shovel knight, nice pixel art and tight controls then this game is definitely for you!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 54, "steamid": "76561198039836661", "playtime_forever": 739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1496697187}, "recommendationid": "31892460", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502372", "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1495408140}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1495992641, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Yay, this game is so exciting!
