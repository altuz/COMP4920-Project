{"success": 1, "reviews": [{"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506656891, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Since there are 5 party games in one game I'm going to be reviewing them all and thankfully for me, I have tried out all the games whether that be sacrificing my friends' time to play some of these games or playing it with my family members.\n\nLet's first start off with Quiplash 2: Whether it be family members, college mates or steam users this game is crowned as the best thing in existence.  This just like the first predecessor is really fun and enjoyable, there are lot of new things that haven't been introduced in the first game, such as the fact that you can create your own prompts, I have so far 2 episodes I made with a lot of crazy prompts such as \"help!  A gargoyle stole my cheese pizza\".  There's also new weird characters that you randomly play as such as a weird turqoise cat or a gray vampire coffin or a yellow (demonic voiced?) star.  They also changed The Last Lash level, instead of getting a prompt you're given either an acro prompt, a comic prompt or a word prompt and not only that players award the answers in medals so that is something new.\n\nUp next is Trivia Murder Party: This game is one of those trivia fact game host show things that would see on your television.  Only Trivia Murder Party takes place in a saw themed place where players play as plushies to try and escape, everyone gets a multiple choice trivia to answer, if one or more plushies doesn't the answer correct they would have to survive \"The Killing Floor (not the game Killing Floor) where in The Killing Floor, players/player have to play mini games of death whether it would be answering as much easy math problems as you can or spinning the loser wheel or remembering patterns.\n\nNext up is Tee KO: Tee KO is similiar to Quiplash but only instead of filling out prompts you are drawing t-shirts and filling out slogans for these shirts.  Once you've done that, other people are going to use your as well as some other players artworks and slogans to make their T-Shirt.  Once they've done that then it's voting time to see what T-Shirt is better than the other one.  This game is pretty complicated in my opinion, a lot of people I showed this one were pretty confused by it.\n\nNext it is Guesspionage: Guesspionage is a game that is all about percentages, how high or low it is.  One player is given a question and has to estimate what percentage he or she thinks is appropriate for that question.  Once they've done that, other players in the game are given two options of whether the percentage should be higher or lower.  When they finish doing that the real percentage is given out to players to see if the player given the estimation was higher, lower or spot on.  It has some pretty interesting gameplay, I must say.\n\nLast but not least is Fakin' it: Fakin' it has a very 60's cartoon look, in this game players have to work together on finding the faker.  Players are given tasks on their phones, tablets or laptops while one player (which that player is the faker) gets a different one, it is up to the faker's job to try and blend with the crowd.  Some of these tasks are: pointing to one or another, making weird faces, holding up a number of fingers or raising your hand.  Once players are told to stop doing these tasks, they have to vote on who the faker really is.  This game is definitely NOT recommended to anyone who wants to play this game over online because of these tasks given on your phone.\n\nAnd now the final conclusion on these games:\nQuiplash 2 is great especially that they added the option of creating prompts, Trivia Murder Party is fun, Tee KO is pretty confusing at first but eventually you'll get used to it, Guesspionage is pretty good, Fakin it is alright but not terrible.\n\nOverall: buy Jackbox Party Pack 3, buy some beer, buy some friends and have a wicked party.\n\nCheers", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 52, "steamid": "76561198055986334", "playtime_forever": 1471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1506201165}, "recommendationid": "35281366", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506505", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506656891}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506055033, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I bought the first game on a Steam Sale, but loved it so much that I bought the second one at full price and bought this third one almost as soon as it released. Definitely worth it. If I had a nickel for every time I've packed my laptop to a house party JUST FOR THIS GAME, I'd have enough money to buy the trilogy. You just need your laptop and an internet connection to start it up. Listen, the game uses your phone as the controller, which means literally every single person you ask to play with you immediately have a frame of reference for how it works. That's priceless. No teaching controls, no explaining mechanics, just \"look at the TV, go to that site, enter the code.\" I don't care if you have an Android, iPhone, or cheap knockoff iPad; if you have an internet browser, you can play this game. The games offer the prompt, then your phone's browser lets you submit your response. Super easy. I've seen socially reserved people suddenly become the funniest f***er at the party, not because they're social butterflies, but because they were witty with their lies on Fibbage. \n\nPLUS, the games are presented in such a way that it can behave like either Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity. It's good to play with kids, college students, or adults and still have a good time. The prompts are never inappropriate, but you're responses can definitely be. Players can adapt the game to suit your own friend bubble's sense of humor and it's brilliantly handled. There's also a secondary prize in most games (the best ones at least) based on who had the most liked responses, which people can pick after the answer has been revealed.\n\nThis one comes with 5 games and all of the best ones have an 8 player cap. Each game takes about 10-15 minutes to play, but they have TONS of questions and prompts, so you'll almost never hit one you've seen before and it's pretty easy to corral people to try it out because of the play time. Each game has an announcer that briefly explains the game and the rules, while also presenting the prompts. They're sorta funny; they get some laughs for being super cheesy. You won't want to turn it off for being annoying, at least. They're a little self aware, honestly. Quiplash 2 and Trivia Murder Party are THE games you need, though. \n\nQuiplash X is the first game you're buying this for. At the start of the game, everyone gets two prompts that they have to make up a response for. Prompts could be like \"A sitcom where two pairs of twins marry each other\" or \"Titanic 2: _______\". The catch is that one other player has your same prompt, and everyone is going to vote on the best response of the two. You get points based on the number of votes you get. Sounds simple, but that's why it's so good. It's probably the most approachable Jackbox game. \n\nTrivia Murder Party is basically a trivia game, only you're trapped in a basement and the bad guy from SAW is going to take you out one on one based on who gets the answers wrong. It's pretty fun, has a lot of diversions, and promotes just the right level of competition. You really have to play it to get how it works, but I like it and I don't even usually like trivia games.\n\nGuesspionage is pretty funny. You basically guess at statistics and get points for how close you were. Prompts can be anything from \"Percentage of people who make their beds in a hotel room\" or \"Percentage of people who enjoy pickles.\" It's pretty funny and a good conversation starter.\n\nTee K.O. is like Pictionary, except you're prompts are for T-Shirt designs, every prompt is given to two random people, and everyone else votes on the best one. You make the drawing using your touchscreen and get points based on the number of votes you got. It's basically like a blend of Drawful and Quiplash. Pretty fun and rounds off the pack nicely.\n\nFakin' It is basically a \"Who is the spy\" game. It's alright.You get a prompt and have to raise your hand if it's true. People can call you out if they think you're lying, so there's a good balance between telling the truth and lying just to avoid being called out.\n\nSeriously, though. Get this. It's a great game to break out at a party or just with a small group of friends and super easy to set up.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 276, "steamid": "76561198025027244", "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1483253495}, "recommendationid": "35120173", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504337", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506055033}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506282654, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "If you stream like me, then this game is amazing.
