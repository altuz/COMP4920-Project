A smiley landscape adorned with equally smiley trees and clouds and weird creatures representing the seasons, will act out the passage of time to show the order and effect of spring, summer, autumn and winter in a thoroughly charming manner.\n\nInteraction is fairly minimal and kept to clicks on the changing elements of the scene, or the occasional dragging of an obscuring cloud, while the whole process is narrated in a warm, endearing fashion. Though if this is a little advanced for some children, there's also an autoplay option, essentially turning it into a short animation instead.\n\nThe whole thing can be experienced in about ten minutes, and while I'm sure an argument can be made about the merits of it needing to be a game or even having a price tag on it rather than merely being a YouTube video or something, I can't help but be enamoured by how cute and adorable the whole thing is and forgive it any such issues.\n\nFor its intended \"2 and up\" audience, I think this is joyous enough to earn its recommendation... maybe even for a few people stretching the \"and up\" part of that suggestion, like myself. Though, all that said, if you're from the southern hemisphere then all of this is just a massive middle finger to you and nothing but horrible northern propagandist lies and should be boycotted vehemently... So there's that, too, I guess.", "comment_count": "4", "author": {"num_games_owned": 1284, "steamid": "76561198093220384", "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "num_reviews": 114, "last_played": 1506238428}, "recommendationid": "35173292", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.525289", "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1506237682}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 6, "total_positive": 73, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 79}}
