Except where in Gems of War you're matching colors to use special abilities, in this game you're matching them to summon your 'fairies' to push back the baddie moving from right to left across the top of the screen.\n\nIt adds a great deal of urgency, as the baddies are constantly marching and once they reach the left side it's game over. You get to see the battles animated as they happen, which is a nice touch. The music and sound is great and the graphics are cute. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/7gHZx4VZvoU\n\nA little more could have been done to make the UI more computer-friendly, but it's still fine. This is obviously a tablet game, but if you're really into Match-3s, this is totally worth the cheap cost of admission.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 403, "steamid": "76561198027483587", "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 102, "last_played": 1505864194}, "recommendationid": "21552367", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.524654", "votes_up": 21, "timestamp_updated": 1456783205}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1456790271, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Cute fast-paced match-3 with a lot of content at a very small price.
