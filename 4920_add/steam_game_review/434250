Precision. Gorgeous. These are all of the words that came to mind upon loading up this masterpiece for the very first time. I got into a match right away, eager to try one of the hottest FPS titles of 2017, my hands trembling with excitement. As the screen faded in the first thing I saw was a fellow competitor spamming racial slurs in the chat box. \"Now, I don't agree with such language but it is commendable of the developers to allow free speech in such a censorship heavy world.\", I said to myself. Now, I'm primarely a controller user, and when I plugged in my Xbox 1 gamepad, I was greeted with one of the most groundbreaking control schemes I have ever had the pleasure of using. While \"A\" would typically make your avatar jump in traditional shooters, in this game it swaps weapons.\"What's so special about that?\", you may ask. Well, dear reader, the genius of this shines only when you discover that the \"Y\" button also switches weapons! No longer are we oppressed by companies like Activision and Dice, telling use we can only have one weapon swapping button! If i want to press \"Y\", I do! If I want to press \"A\", I do! I must stress, my friends, that it only gets better. Most FPS games use the left trigger to aim, and the right trigger to fire your weapon. That is the pinacle of inconvenience. Why must I exaust myself pressing a trigger all the way down over and over? Well, thanks to Masked Shooters 2, this is a problem of the past. You see, you actually use the left bumper to aim, and the right bumper to shoot! Perfect for rapid firing the amazing 1 hit KO AR's and SMG's available to you from the very beggining. \"So then, what do the triggers do then?\", you ask once again, ignorant to this game's unrivaled layout. The answer is simple, the left trigger makes your soldier look down, and the right trigger makes you look up! Who needs joysticks? Not this gamer, I can assure you of that. Enough of the button layout, if you aren't sold yet then just you wait. This is hands down, the single most graphically impressive title I have ever played. 4K? Child's play. This game is real life. When I first booted it up, it felt like I was ripped from my plane of existance and placed into the world of the game. No longer was I a gamer in a wheelchair; I was a soldier. Ripping around the battlefield, quickscoping, no-scoping, 360 trickshots, I was doing it all. Never once did I realize I was in a game. The textures were so real, the audio so crisp. It may have been, in fact, too real. I lay awake most nights now. Flashbacks to the atrocities of war waking me up in terrified, cold sweats. Surley you must be thinking a game that looks that good would require a beastly PC, unafordable for most. I can, with upmost joy, deny this. How? It is the best optimized title in not only my steam library, but possibly on all of steam itself. My average FPS, on a foliage filled, expertly designed map with explosions and gunshots galore? Not 60. Not 144. 800. You read that right. 800FPS, sometimes peaking at over 1,000FPS. No other game will ever compare for the rest of my time on earth. I gathered up all of my favorite shooting games, MW3, BO2, battlefield 3, CSGO, games that were at one point my entire life; And I threw them into a fire. I do not need them any longer, for I am a proud owner of Masked Shooters 2.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 16, "steamid": "76561198357938880", "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505950256}, "recommendationid": "35094284", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504389", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1505952572}, {"votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505350855, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Where to begin... In the simplest way to say it; this game is an absolute masterpiece. I was suffering with diagnosed chronic depression, going through hell every day at school with nothing to look forward to in my life but going to bed just so i could end it for a little bit. All of this was so, until i came across Masked Shooters 2. Immediately after seeing this game and some amazing gameplay, i bought it for me and three of my friends. I booted up the game and was absolutely baffled at the beautiful graphics melodizing perfectly with an amazing ping. At this moment I knew that my life would never be the same. I live and breath this game. This is the place I come to, to live the life i always wish i was blessed with. The community is absolutely amazing; a truly thriving group of amazing friendly people.\n\nThank you truly, to the developers of this game, you saved me.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 49, "steamid": "76561198095215454", "playtime_forever": 1316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505349972}, "recommendationid": "34939903", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502769", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505350855}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506749446, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Love this game more than my family.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 25, "steamid": "76561198195700593", "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1506348998}, "recommendationid": "35323985", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.497022", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506749446}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506356453, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Tbh it's actually not that bad.
