The menu cannot be navigated with a joypad. Once in the game, there is no way to adjust settings or exit the game through the pause menu. When the game is paused, pushing buttons reveals the menu is an overlay and the game is still active underneath allowing you to waste skills or get injured while the menu is up. Not a well made game. \nThis simple pixel platformer (my favorite genre) feels like a free android without much modification. The moving and jumping feel floaty and wrong.\nIts impressive how a game that blasts the screen with huge block letter instructions can still leave me baffled on how to progress. \n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 207, "steamid": "76561198004615469", "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1498452878}, "recommendationid": "32801058", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502633", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498453879}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4}}
