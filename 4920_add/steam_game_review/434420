{"success": 1, "reviews": [{"votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_created": 1503857790, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "[i]The Chosen RPG[/i] is a generic old-school role-playing game made with RPG Maker. Gameplay-wise, it ticks all the boxes but there's nothing to this game that'll blow you away. Add to that a very clich\u00e9d story and a strange choice of avatars (the scantily-clad girls), and we're left with nothing but a slightly above-average RPG Maker game. \n\n[h1]'Nudity' tag[/h1]\n\nYou've noticed the 'nudity' tag and maybe also the screenshots showing scantily-clad girls, so let's talk about the nudity for a moment: there is none. There's just the portraits of the three girls you'll recruit as party members, which shows them in underwear. But beyond that, there's no nudity or even any innuendo in this game. Not one bit.\n\nThe decision to portray the three girls in their underwear [b]and[/b] to show those portraits as three of the six screenshots on the Steam Store page is most likely the worst decision I've ever seen in game development. It's a very, very bad call because people add the 'nudity' label to the game, even though that's inaccurate, with the following consequences:\n- people who're looking for nudity won't find it in this game so they won't be happy;\n- people who're not looking for nudity may stay away from the game after glancing at it and seeing the screenshots and/or the 'nudity' label;\n- because of the 'nudity' label, Steam always displays a warning [b]every time[/b] you open [b]any[/b] page related to the game (store page, guides, discussions, achievements page, \u2026), which gets very annoying.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThe story is one big clich\u00e9: an adolescent has a dream about his missing father and is dubbed the 'chosen one' to fulfil a prophecy that tells him to gather some sacred artifacts in order to defeat an evil warrior who's at the service of an even more evil warrior. The game tries to shake things up by adding a twist to the story at the end, but the player most likely saw it coming a mile away[spoiler], especially people who've seen Star Wars[/spoiler].\n\nTo make matters worse, the paper-thin story ends with 'To be continued\u2026' after defeating the final boss. So if you want to see the conclusion to the story, you'll need to buy [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/569970/Chosen_2/]Chosen 2[/url]. Lame.\n\nThe writing is okay in that we usually get to read a lot worse English in these RPG Maker games, but nevertheless the wording is sometimes strange e.g. 'Potion was found' and 'Wanna beer?'.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay is typical RPG Maker. You walk around towns, enter houses and stores, leave the town and explore the surroundings where random combat may be initiated at any time. You control a party, in this case a group of four, and equip them with increasingly better gear. By defeating opponents in tactical turn-based combat, the party members gain levels, increasing their stats (hit points, magic points, attack and defense) and allowing them to learn new skills and spells.\n\nThe level design is decent. You'll find yourself in towns, forests, deserts, castles and dungeons - classic stuff, really. The game world seems open at first, but you'll soon learn that you always need to complete the next part of the main quest at location A to be able to enter location B, where the next part of the main quest will take place. So the game is actually very linear.\n\nThe combat is made interesting by adding a mix of skills and spells. Skills use TP that are gained during combat. Spells use classic MP. It takes a few levels before the party gains access to interesting skills and spells, making the first part of the game very repetitive combat-wise. Also, you'll soon find out which are the most useful skills and spells, and likewise discover that most of the other skills and spells are actually completely useless.\n\nOverall, [i]The Chosen RPG[/i] is a bit too easy, so I'm sure a lot of people would have preferred to see an option to set the game to a higher difficulty mode. The good thing about the low difficulty is that [i]The Chosen RPG[/i] requires little or no level grinding, unlike a lot of other RPG Maker games.\n\nDuring combat you sometimes get status effects that persist after the combat has ended, but there's no way to check what these status effects are exactly.\n\nYour party gains levels but the game doesn't mention how much stats they gain. You do get a notice if they gain a skill or spell, though, which is the most useful information.\n\n[h1]Graphics and sound[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are classic RPG Maker graphics. But the problem with [i]The Chosen RPG[/i] is that Windowed Mode is too small, whereas Full Screen Mode has wide black bars to the left and right of the screen, and it renders the graphics way too blurry, as graphics get blown up too much to fill the screen. So an option for an in-between size would have been very welcome.\n\nOne further gripe is that your party members are tiny. During combat, they're literally five times smaller than any human opponent, even though your party does not consist of toddlers or dwarves. It just looks ridiculous.\n\n[i]The Chosen RPG[/i]'s music is fine except for the annoying 1990s dance music in the starting town. To make matters worse, a bit later on, when that town is under attack, the music changes to a groovy jazz tune. Both are completely out of place. But okay, the rest of the music is fine and combat music is even reminiscent of classic old-school JRPGs, so it's just unfortunate that the problem with the music lies in the very first area of the game.\n\n[h1]On Steam's extra features[/h1]\n\n[i]The Chosen RPG[/i] has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.\n\nFive of the 8 Steam Achievements are story-related and unmissable. The remaining 3 are granted for optional goals and therefore missable.", "comment_count": "3", "author": {"num_games_owned": 700, "steamid": "76561198042646749", "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "last_played": 1503690412}, "recommendationid": "34535815", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.570061", "votes_up": 33, "timestamp_updated": 1503857790}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504458590, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "The Chosen RPG is a short RPG maker game, that honestly has had bits and pieces of every RPG maker game I have ever played and reviewed. The question is if the bits and pieces are the right ones and if it is put together in a nice game.\n\nThe story starts off with a lot of backstory and lore to get you into the story. The stereotypical, there is a legend that needs to be fulfilled, they tried to diffrentiate with making the characters as if they are straight from an anime. What also makes it a complete stereotype is that the character does not acknowlegde him being part of the legend until almost the very end. The story would be less linear if there was multiple enemies trying to stop you in your 'quest'. Well quest is not the right way to say this, since the game is another find along as you go RPG. I remember playing this game for a little and coming back after a few days and completely forgetting what the objective was without any way to figure out, without spoiling the game by checking a playthrough, how to continue it. The story turned out to be pretty decent but right as I was getting into it, it ended. After this they gave the classic, \"to be continued...\", hinting towards a sequel.\n\nThe battle sequences have the classic background, enemies and fighting style. Added along to this is pretty nice music and battle animatuons from both sides which is a pretty nice but small feature that you don't see much from RPG maker games. The things they kept from the RPG maker package is that the enemies have no healthbar, which is a nice feature but not mandatory, also the effects like balance, poison, blind, paralyse, sleep and many more. The combat would be way better if they payed more attention to the balancing in general. For story purposes you start off with the 3rd best sword in the game, which in the end 'evolves' into the best sword in the game, which makes you start off with a giant advantage. The difficulty is on point in the beginning, the back to back challenges made it very intense to play, afterwards once you got better items it turned out to be way too easy. For the people who enjoy grinding, you will get satisfied. Aside from one boss which you can battle over and over, seems like a bug honestly, you have a training hall where you can battle different tiers of monsters to your liking. The training hall also has an unique boss that gives you second best sword in the game once you beat it. Honestly that boss was harder than the final battle which is pretty sad.\n\nConcluding a verdict for this game with a yes or no rating is a challenging thing to do. It keeps showing itself in a good spotlight but gets pulled down again by the things missing in this game. They hinted pretty hard at a potential sequel but I see a lot of space for improvement. The story could have been in one game but they have many opportunities to go into with the sequel. If you are a fan of RPG's, take a quick look at this before you instantly buy this. If you don't like the anime theme or need a challenge you should look towards other games.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 76, "steamid": "76561198141279281", "playtime_forever": 417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "last_played": 1504452316}, "recommendationid": "34716915", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.523935", "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1504523157}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500240942, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Okay for one, I'm glad I only paid .49 cents for this game, the story was okay....

The Chosen remedies this by including separate skill bar that keep filling as the combat goes on, especially when the player takes a massive damage. You can use skills that cost next to nothing on the skill bar to produce basic but sufficiently powerful combat abilities, or you can wait for the higher tier skills that cost more for battle changers.\n+ Playful with skills: basic ones are satisfying to use and powerful. Our main hero has a useful power attack that deals a double damage, while one of his companions has the Tackle that has a chance to prevent the enemies\u2019 next attack, and is one of the most useful skills in the game.\n- Very short: you can finish this game in 4-6 hours easily, and the replayability is next to zero due to serious lack of content.\n- Unambitious, way too much generic: The Chosen is a painfully \u201cby the numbers\u201d JRPG game, there are literary no interesting quests except \u201cfetch me this\u201d and \u201cget that bloke!\u201d generic quests. Level design is poor and simplistic, battles are boring and grindy, there are no interesting characters, whether they are main heroes, few and rare NPCs that you meet, not to mention the main villain.\n- A bit too much asset-flipping: too much of generic assets, not enough of original artwork. RPG Maker is a powerful JRPG maker that comes with a sizeable library of audio and visual assets, but that does not mean you should use them in the product you\u2019re selling, because this feels cheap, lazy and effortless. Except the skimpy design of the main heroes and a handful of NPCs, along with one or two enemies, everything else is an asset flip. Putting as much effort in your product as you can with your artwork always pays off since people who play notice this, and respect the developers who\u2019ve put a proper effort in making as best game they can. So after designing story and screenplay, this should be you next priority.\n- Narratively poor: Since the game mechanics in RPG Maker games are inherently simplistic and anarchic by the nature of the game engine they\u2019re based on, story should be your number one priority. An interesting and involving story can and will remedy the many flaws a game can have with most of the players. Sadly, the story in The Chosen is childish, full of plot holes and unsatisfying. Characters that populate this world have even worse treatment since they are walking and spewing trope generators, utterly boring and one-dimensional, without proper inner goals that lead them, and every sentence they say sounds something a child would say. And this is the biggest flaw of The Chosen one, since the game already offers so little.\n\nI cannot recommend The Chosen even by the extremely cheap price it\u2019s selling almost every week, since it feels like content-poor, incomplete and a lazily made product that barely got the care it needed. With absolute power comes absolute responsibility, and just because you have a powerful game engine you can use, doesn\u2019t mean you should create a sub-par game you wouldn\u2019t want to play and charge people money for it.

Within the first ten minutes, there were already things that irritated me: \n\n[list]  \n[*]Edges of screens that appear to lead to other areas but have invisible walls (instead of closing them off with trees, rocks, or otherwise providing a visible aid to the player to let him or her know the route is impassable).\n\n[*]Multiple exits in a multi-screen 'maze' where the wrong move boots the player out to the overworld, forcing them to navigate the entire thing again, hoping that the next choice will be the correct path. On the other hand, there is at least one indoor (tent) area where you can walk right through all the walls, so I guess that's some type of balance.\n\n[*]There are items on the ground that clearly look like they can be picked up (such as a shovel) but can't.\n\n[*]The game likes to remove decisions away from the player (for example, at the end of a moving little cut scene, the player character (PC) decided \"I'd better get back to town!\" and promptly left an area I wasn't done exloring. Even more strange, the game let me return to the area immediately after, making me wonder why I had to leave in the first place. \n\n[*]Characters have skills when enough TP (gained in battle) is available; PCs can use Skills, but even this is unreliable. For example: one of the skills, Chakra, is described as \"User cures all status ailments.\" Yet, in practice, Chakra only cures the caster, and no one else, making it nearly useless. In addition, TP strangely disappears between battles, and reappears when entering the next battle, which means should you find yourself posioned and out of antidote (for example) you are forced to walk around looking for a random encounter, hoping your PC doesn't die from cumulative damage before you can use the needed skill. \n\n[/list]\n\nIt's a shame, because there is the seed of an emotional storyline here that causes me to want to keep playing.
