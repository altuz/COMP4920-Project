I really do.  And for a student project, it is excellent.  The team should be proud of their work.\n\nTL;DR: only focuses on addition skills, a bit boring for an adult, not entirely polished\n\nThe good:\n-It's great practice for addition.\n-The difficulty scales with spell power or quest.\n-There's plenty of rewards to keep someone playing.\n-It's linear, so it's difficult to get lost for too long.\n\nThe bad:\n- It is painfully obvious that English is not the native language of the developers.  \"In\" and \"on\" were misused a couple of times.  In/on/at can be tricky for ESL'ers (some languages combine these words).  This is a relatively easy, though tedious, fix.  I doubt it would hurt the developing language skills of children, but it may be a bit confusing.\n- I'm forced to play a male character.  I could input my name, but not choose my gender.  This may have been something that was planned but never implemented.  It may have been too much work to include.\n\nThe ugly:\n-I don't expect it to get as much play time as other games.  The linear story line doesn't seem to branch, so it would be the same story every single time.  I don't think choices really matter much.\n-I find it boring.  Neat, but boring.  I'm not sure I'd be really engaged in the game if a child was playing it nearby.\n\nIf I get the opportunity I'll try to a kid to play with me.  That way I could get more accurate feedback -- it *was* designed for kids afterall.  But as it is, I wouldn't recommend it to parents for kids.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 89, "steamid": "76561198039624157", "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1487464890}, "recommendationid": "29955566", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501440", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1487465527}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487199722, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "The game would've been pretty fun..
