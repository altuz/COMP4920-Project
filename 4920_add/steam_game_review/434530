The controls feel in the first moment quite uncommon but you'll get used to it quickly (you control each side of the bar over twinsticks or A or D keys). \n[list]\n    [*]Collect with the powerbar the floating blobs of your color like in a fishing net. \n    [*]Deny the contagious green ones and the unexplodeable missiles\n    [*]Try to startle all bombs but dodge their explosion circle\n[/list]\nLateron you'll see it's totally challenging and merciless. Do not ever let drop a blob at the bottom of the screen. You'll be double punished. \n1.your bar becomes longer and less controlable\n2.your multiplier drops to zero.\n\nAround a score of 2k and a multiplier of 15x your bar gets twincolored. Means left blue, right purple. Ofc you still can just collect the blobs with the right matching color. Hopefully the devs can somehow speedup the movements and control ability during EA. Not gonna go above 15x multiplier yet ...\n\nUpdate: The ability to change colorsides is much better than to flipover and gives the game some depth. Forget to mention the soundtrack is quite enjoyable. Ambient music of the 70's like ska or jazz", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 3497, "steamid": "76561198035285721", "playtime_forever": 852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 397, "last_played": 1465922445}, "recommendationid": "21478109", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.541049", "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_updated": 1456578455}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1464751819, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Just finished a playthrough of FLOBE for a new youtube channel -- we had a blast, will probably reveal more info than a text based review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zGWgs6bnw0", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 142, "steamid": "76561197991779340", "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1465580840}, "recommendationid": "23320464", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505297", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1464751819}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1464489784, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "This game is amazing. \n\nSeriously. I completed a badge and saw I got a coupon for 50% off some game called Flobe. I clicked on it to see if it interested me. At first I was disappointed because I saw what looked like a kind of cheap, dime-a-dozen arcade game. I looked farther into the game though, and it interested me. Being that with the coupon, the game was only 50 cents, I decided to buy it. \n\nWhat I got was the best 99 cent game on steam to be known in a unique and addicting arcade game. The controls are a bit wonky, but they make sense and are very responsive, and anyway, the weirdness of the controls keeps the game challenging. The graphics are fine, and actually better than I expected. Don't use the trailer as reference, because it looks a lot different than the game now, which looks much nicer. On top of all that, the music is amazing! It's something you don't see a lot in arcade games like this, and it really makes it much more enjoyable in comparison to some 9 second loop  you'd hear in some other arcade game.\n\nIf there was anything I would complain about it would be that there are a few annoying bugs, but being that the game is in EA, those will get sorted out in due time.\n\n9/10", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 184, "steamid": "76561198075108160", "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1496202708}, "recommendationid": "23264607", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505832", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1464490014}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1469301632, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "i got a coupon for it and had some money in my steam wallet. tbh i didnt expect it to be pretty good but its amazing for a 1 dollar game. the controls are od but you will get used to it", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 16, "steamid": "76561198151384122", "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1468971216}, "recommendationid": "24485037", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500076", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1469301632}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1468608064, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "wtf... 10/10 would be scared by the sax and orgasm again.\nI honestly cant believe how good this game is, and the sound track is just... spot on.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 318, "steamid": "76561198232524716", "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1476398585}, "recommendationid": "24339095", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500076", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1468608064}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1468993463, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Lovely game, indeed. To be honest, this is something different, a game concept that I haven't seen before (most likely because I'm not very aquainted with other game concepts other than First Person Shooters...). \n\nOne of the only reasons I decided to purchase the game was because I received a coupon for it, chopping its price into a mere $0.49. I mean, the price was irresistable! So, working with the fact that 1). the game would only cost me half a buck, and 2). the videos providing gameplay seemed to do a dear job with presenting their product, I bought the game.\n\nAnd what were the results?\nWorth every digital penny.\n\nWielding my Xbox remote, and beginning the game for the very first time, it was one helluva' game experience. Discovery kicked in, as I began to ease myself into how the game was to be played. As I made the bar dance I gained the experience as to properly maneuver my little protagonist(?). In short I knew that new, yet easy to pick up, control methods were going to be accounted for in this game.\n\nTo finish off my vague review, I'd like to say that the best part of the game might possibly be the music. Heck, it's something alright! Kept me going, despite the fact that I played with the caliber of a blind person. Jazz, probably?
