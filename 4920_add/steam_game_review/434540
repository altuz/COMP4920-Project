But that's a drop in the bucket, I'm sad to say...\n\nA number of the puzzles are broken, and at times I either had to wait until the 'skip' bar filled up (took about two minutes) or reboot the game if the puzzle becomes unresponsive. \n\n[spoiler]There was a puzzle in the subway where I had to line up the circuit lines in the power core and it just disappeared altogether. Secondly, I was trying to organize a set of colored USB sticks to get a security passcode - saved my game and exited for a break, and came back to see that the puzzle not only restarted but it was also stuck in the intro phase of the puzzle and I couldn't even get the sticks to light up and get the code - I had to reboot again to get past it. Also, the fuse puzzle on the safe was frustrating because I had to use a combination of four symbols without them touching - in the same columns or diagonally - and it's near impossible to solve. It's incredibly frustrating to experience.[/spoiler]\n\nThe puzzles and HOG scenes are the meat of the game, and since they're pretty much broken the game is rendered pointless and frustrating - you'd really have to go out of your way to get it working.\n\nAlso, the story itself is another issue I have.\n\nIt's rushed, and there was a lot of potential to have it go in another direction but I guess the devs were strapped.\nAnd there were some interesting additional characters (like a sooth-saying homeless man and a detective with a mysterious past); they only appear once in the story and it's such a waste to cast their roles aside.\n\n[spoiler]The homeless man acted like he knew about the secrets of the pendulum Lily and Madison had, and it seemed as if he could've been part of a secret society, but he's never seen again after that initial meeting. Also, the detective would've added some more depth - and length - to the story, but again, he was dropped after the first encounter. There just wasn't, ironically, enough time to flesh them out in the game.[/spoiler]\n\nThe story was short, choppy, and the ending - while ending on a happy note - it's unsatifying...\n\nI had really hoped that this would be an enjoyable experience, but I just wasted $8 and five hours of my time trying to get past tiresome glitches. There's no excuse for such a poor performance.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 347, "steamid": "76561198067758778", "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "last_played": 1464640806}, "recommendationid": "23298163", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.511993", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1464643066}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1}}
