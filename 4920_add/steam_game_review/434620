As a Math lover, I couldn't resist.\nYet, something so simple and easy to manipulate as numbers is horribly used in here.\nIn the first tests you have to guess what is the lenght, width or area of a rectangle/square. Pretty simple, right? For the area you multiply lenght and width and for any of the sides you do the oposite (divide the area with the lenght or width). That is very basic.\nThe formula itself it correct in this game. The Math, however, nope.\n9 x 9 = 81. That is basic multiplication table, we all know it.\nThen how come the game says 9 x 9 = 80?\nHow come that an even simplier multiplication as 3 x 1 = 3 ends up in the game as 3 x 1 = 1?\n\nAs I said, I love Math. To see a game specifically made to teach math to fail in such a way hursts.

I'm stuck between giving this one a thumbs up and a thumbs down. I've got a list of pros and cons of the game, but it was still tough to decide whether its thumbs up or down.\n\nPros: \n\n-Even without the game being on sale the game is still a low price. If it's on sale even better, you can pretty much make your money back within the trading cards.\n\n-MS Paint type tool to keep track of where you are with the solving of the level.\n\n-The controls within the game are incredibly easy to understand. You think the answer is 4? Click 4. Done.\n\n-Easy achievements as they don't require anything other than just playing through the game.\n\nCons:\n\n-There is no replay value to the game. When you make it through a level that's pretty much it unless your memory is absolutely horrible.\n\n-Even if your first answer is wrong you can pretty much click any other answer quickly... which pretty much nullifies the main goal to the game which is to solve the different puzzles.\n\n-If you're half decent at math or have a general education you don't spend too much time on the game which makes it a quick quick solve.\n\nSo in conclusion, the idea for the game is fantastic and makes you think (at least it tries to), but the way the developer has done the game you don't really need any thinking to get through a level. You only need a little bit of luck or just quick clicking to get the right answer to move onto the next level. If you can get it on sale it is worth it, if it's not on sale it's still borderline worth it if you want to train your brain for a little bit. Overall, I give it about a 5.5/10 which is good enough for me to give it a thumbs up. If there was an indifferent thumb (or no thumb) I'd rate it as that instead.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 134, "steamid": "76561198141287530", "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "last_played": 1498698809}, "recommendationid": "33392478", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1499569605}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 24, "total_positive": 68, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 92}}
