The setup of trapped rooms that the player nativates by numerical clues, or thrown boots, strongly resembles the movie The Cube. However, the developers have done very well translating this idea into a simple, very playable and replayable format; similarly to minesweeper one can tell how many of the rooms adjacent to the current room are trapped. There are several game formats and difficulty adjustments (such as a map which records trap discovery, or doesn't) so the game offers a fair bit of replay value. Like Minesweeper, however, all the logic in the world is useless against bad luck, which can get frustrating after a while. But in itself a very amusing puzzle game.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 38, "steamid": "76561198327901000", "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1497044879}, "recommendationid": "35049092", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506550032}, {"votes_funny": 5, "timestamp_created": 1505785612, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "They call it half dead because the community already is.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 46, "steamid": "76561198400486602", "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "last_played": 1505780786}, "recommendationid": "35056159", "votes_down": 4, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.497597", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1505785612}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506313477, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This game was good until it started being well translated.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 47, "steamid": "76561198041273385", "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1498527618}, "recommendationid": "35196160", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.495258", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506313477}, {"votes_funny": 6, "timestamp_created": 1505331786, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This game giv me pedophillia and it not gud", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 88, "steamid": "76561198107907190", "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1480623465}, "recommendationid": "34926045", "votes_down": 13, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.482030", "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1505331786}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505224793, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Do yourself a favour.
