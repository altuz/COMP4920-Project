And they are surprisingly well-made.\nRare enough, these days.\n\nGeneral game-depth is okay. Perfecting shots and playthrough speed will take some time. There's not a whole of loadouts, however.\nYou should definitely like the genre or the idea of chasing the perfect shot, over and over.\n\nGraphics are fine, music is passable, if unremarkable.\n\nThe difficulty is medium high, so you will die but it's rather fair.\n\nOne aspect stinks mightily, however. The last two levels feature obstacles that obstruct your view needlessly. It's hard to determine what's actually going on. A few times this is unintended, like when a disco lightshow tries to give you epilepsy with an Umlaut- bad enough. Later, this is even part of the design - very questionable for a game that relies on perfect angles and split seconds. Strike one, Lichtspeer!\n\nThe game passes nontheless, \nIt's simply uncomplicated fun for the most part without much ballast.\n\nVerdict:\nStraight as a Lichtarrow, easy to play..\nThree out of five Strudel have been tossed into the air.\nNice.\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 274, "steamid": "76561197988091166", "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "last_played": 1500830639}, "recommendationid": "34804389", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504826079}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 9, "total_positive": 29, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 38}}
