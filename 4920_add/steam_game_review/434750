The game makes no effort to impede your creativity, as you can choose so many different options in many different ways. Level-wise, there's a good variety to choose from, and the map you start out with can be imposing. Expect some repetition as the levels start out easy, and then get much harder. By the end of this game, you'll be feeling like you're on the hardest difficulty setting of Touhou. Overall, the journey through the game was something I'd consider unique and worth the time I put in. \n\nWith that said, there are issues. To level up your ship and weapons, you need currency called zogs, which you can find in levels. However, they're limited in number and you can't grind for them. Once you beat a level, you gotta hope you had a good haul going through it. Eventually you will have to choose some weapons and stick with them when you upgrade them. With that said, there's also a bug that sometimes prevents players from seeing the ending of the game despite conquering the galaxy. I just wanna bring that up for those unaware. Why do I still recommend the game despite such issues? Because it hit the mark for this genre of shooter so close. And the dev is friendly enough, so i give it a pass. But if he fixes it in the future, that would be even better, and I'll alter my review to reflect that should he do that.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 165, "steamid": "76561198022107690", "playtime_forever": 1080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 100, "last_played": 1500624106}, "recommendationid": "32695120", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500623824}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 8, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 8}}
