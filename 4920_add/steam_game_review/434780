I'll even ignore the oversized characters and hitboxes, the slow movement of the player character, and the unintuitive controls.\n\nEven then, the game is horrible.\n\nFirst up is the player's attacks. All of your attacks home in on the nearest enemy, and nearly all of your attacks are just a stream of mutlicolored lights (you can add triangles to it using a powerup- these do a ton of damage and are practically needed for most bosses). But, the \"homing on nearest enemy\" bit means that your attacks will ignore the boss if any of its endless stream of minions come between you and it. This serves only to frustrate you and prolong the boss battle.\n\nNext is the enemy design. Scroll through the screenshots for the game and see if you can find an orangish-red guy that looks like Satan. Remember what he looks like, because touching him transports you bakc to the previous screen (that means that you have to beat the previous boss before you can attempt the current boss again- repeat for every time he touches you.) and he isn't just fast-moving, but also invincible- you can only wait for him to go off screen. He's just the tip too- there's also a boss that instantaneously teleports around the screen (no warning, no chance to get out of his way, only a ton of damage if you touch him), a boss that will randomly start moving extremely quickly, bosses that are only vulnerable to specific attacks, and bosses that seem to move in and out of the background. Oh, and every enemy projectile homes in on you. All of them.\n\nFinally there is the general clutter. It's normal for a bullet hell to fill the screen with bullets, but this one likes to go a step further and fill the screen with fast moving enemies that occasionally blend in with the background (4th level is filled with enemies that just fly around the area extremely quickly and are hard to distinguish from one another. I got an achivement for killing a boss in this area that I don't even remember seeing), and you'll sometimes find that enemies attacks blend in with the background (5th or 6th boss-I lost count- has two attacks. One is a blue orb, the other is a stream of blood-red teardrops. The background of the level is blood red with some black on the sides. Anyone else see a problem here?).\n\nThe icing for this, though, is the developer. The base game is very low on content (based on the achievements, I had two or three bosses/ levels left after 30 minutes of playtime) so the dev releases two DLCs that are the same price as the main game- which is acceptable if they have the same amount of content as the base game (I couldn't get through them, but based on the steam achievements, they do not). Then however, the dev releases the Redux DLC, also for the same price as the base game, and it is basically an update. That's all it is, an update for the projectile behaviour and enemy AI, as well as a new UI. I think you can understand why that shouldn't be a DLC.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 373, "steamid": "76561198061692455", "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "last_played": 1495402150}, "recommendationid": "31891226", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1495402064}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1498245292, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Game is really weird and has the ability to induce vomiting. First off, the game doesn't have any backstory and is just a person mind blowing balls out of their head against demons (I guess). Secondly, the game has multiple quirks and bugs.
