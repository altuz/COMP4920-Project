It's not inherently bad, yet it's not all that great. Allow me to explain, dear reader.\n\nPlanet 1138 is an Action/RTS game where you control a \"Command Buggy\" that has rockets, a machine gun, a shield and nitrous that captures bases which then produce units and pushes them down the lane towards the enemy base. As the game goes on and you complete levels, you will unlock new upgrades which passively upgrade your buggy to deal more damage or to upgrade the turrets on support bases. Honestly, the game is more of a MOBA like Warshift than it is an Action/RTS like Battlezone or Uprising: Join or Die. There are a ton of levels to play through with super challenging AI and even multiplayer. Overall, the gameplay is solid enough, it works and it is competent.\n\nThis all sounds great right? Well, it's more meh than it is good. The core concept is amazing, I'm a huge fan of Uprising: Join or Die and I'd kill to have another one or at the very least an Action/RTS that operates in the same style but that is aside the point. Planet 1138 is meh because of presentation and the cheating nature of the AI opponent. \n\nPresentation you say? Well yes, unfortunately all the menus in the game look as though they were made in paint.NET and the game has the barest of aesthetic qualities. While this isn't bad in itself, it makes the game look more like a first time flash game than an actual 9.99 Steam game. While this isn't meant to be a knock on the dev but I'd highly recommend they hire on someone who can redesign the menus or the interface in general. I truly believe that presentation is one of the most important qualities when designing anything and I'd love to see some more work put into the game's aesthetics. \n\nMy second problem? The AI is utter bullshit. Somehow he can lock on to you and shoot at you from every angle while you can only autoaim at opponent's directly in front of you. The AI isn't foolish enough to sit still and let you shoot at him, he will drive circles around you and pummel you into the dirt. It causes the AI to be super aggressive while the player has to fight defensively by standing next to bases and such. This may just be me being a noob but it seems like the AI has a naturally unfair advantage in the game.\n\nIn conclusion, not a bad game, not a great game. With some work, I can see this being an amazing first attempt by the studio. For now, I can't recommend it at 9.99. I would at 5.99 though. Seems more reasonable of a price.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVlrBH958pQ", "comment_count": "3", "author": {"num_games_owned": 1109, "steamid": "76561197992175965", "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 158, "last_played": 1455987395}, "recommendationid": "21350579", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.515715", "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1456006423}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1455827117, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This game has a good ideea.
