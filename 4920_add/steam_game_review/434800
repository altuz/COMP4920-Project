The instructions told me to use the wasd keys to steer and 1235 keys on the keypad to accelerate slow down and avoid things. When you start the game none of those keys help prevent your ship from crashing. \n\nThis was frustrating, so I went to the discussion boards and saw a post there about this problem. The answer was that this part of the game is an interactive cutscene where you need to click on a button on screen with your mouse to charge a gun and then shoot out the ball you keep crashing into.\n\nSo I attempted this. The hit boxes on the buttons on the screen are smaller than the drawn buttons.  this makes it difficult to get through.

But I just can't give a thumbs up to this particular game for now. You need to take more effort especially by making your games understandable and playable. Look how other people play your games and ask them for improvement suggestions. Then use the information you have collected to make your games better.\n\n(+): The game trailer, music, graphics (considering that it's just an indie game), the main idea of the gameplay (but not the resulting gameplay by itself).\n\n(-): The \"how to play\" description contains information that is wrong. The controls are counterintuitive. I spend half an hour just to understand how to play the game at all. There is no information about how to get through the first interactive cutscene in \"how to play\" and that such a cutscene exists at all. (My improvement suggestion here: Explain it or make it non-iteractive or just remove it completely.) I did not even know that I was in it and that I was supposed to click the pictures on the bottom of the screen to pass it. I thought I was already in the game, so I pressed WASD5123 like crazy, but they just did nothing. (Also later I found out that for me the default keys were actually shift, control, space, alt instead of 5123 despite what \"how to play\" said.) It's very hard to get through the small openings and the slower speed makes it even harder. That makes the game more frustrating than fun. Maybe you should let the player rotate to any possible angle and then stay flying at that angle, instead of locking it at 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees. Also maybe you should attach the camara to the ship and rotate it together with the ship when the ship rotates. What are all those pickups here for and why do they have different colors? (Another improvement suggestion: Introduce powerups.)", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 341, "steamid": "76561198022395043", "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "last_played": 1471186381}, "recommendationid": "24912823", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500489", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1471186183}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1467987885, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Sad Top Say This Game Is Shit!!!\n\nThe Cutscene At The Start You Charge The Emp By Clicking The Red Buttons That Is Stupid!?\nWhy Can't You Just Start In The Tunnel And Have It As Just A Cutscene You Watch!!!\n\nThe Way Collisions Work Is Stupid The Ship Is Way To Big Your Wing Clips The Smallest Thing And You Die!?\nThe Wing Spand Of The Ship Should Be Way Smaller And Able To Do A 360 Degrees Lock Of The Ships Angle!!!\n\nI Found I Was Not Having Fun Playing This It's Like You Have To Be Pixel Perfect With Your Movemets Or Die.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 413, "steamid": "76561198035096906", "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1467986937}, "recommendationid": "24183040", "votes_down": 4, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.494532", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1467987885}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1456699038, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Niakan was here", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 18, "steamid": "76561198268775691", "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1459468506}, "recommendationid": "21535339", "votes_down": 17, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.461217", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1456699038}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 5, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "num_reviews": 6, "total_reviews": 6}}
