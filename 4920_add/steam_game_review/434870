Also to clarify: I meant genuine political games that aren't meme tastic.\n\nPolitical games are hard to come by on Steam. This one, I was very disappointed by.\n\nFirst of all, I understand that it's in Early Access. No brainer whatsoever. But the dire selection of characters from the get go is disappointing. We're even given the option to play Obama? This is over Bernie Sanders or Ted Cruz, or whoever. I'm not expecting Political Machine levels of depth but it's silly. Especially when I run against Trump, Obama and another weird version of Hillary? It feels like a lack of care has gone into it.\n\nThe lock feature is broken as hell, I can't secure my city at all. The character models look ugly. Trump has cargo pants? Hillary doesn't look like Hillary? They have a really annoying squeaky effect on voices, I'd rather have the unaltered voice. Animations for the UI aren't good. Game mechanics aren't properly explained.\n\nAlso the AI is so dumb.

This review is also in an early state.\n\nThe American Election is a great topic .And it also have an interesting core mechanic in this game.\nBut at current state.it isn't a good game.\n\nYou can go to 50 states of America(as 50 or less stage and developers says they will make more special rules at each state)With your three AI Opponent. You must convert more citizen than them to win the battle,At last you can win the election.\n\nThe way to convert the citizens into your team is:stand still to make a speech...\nActually,that's not a bad idea. But when your control is awkward, the mechanic seems too weak to play.\nThe mouse control will make wrong route 50% of all time. \nthe speed is too slow sometimes.\nThe competitive part of this mechanic seems frustrated. And there doesn't have many ways to directly attack the AI.\nThe AI still have some bug,which will ruin the experience.\nIf you can make their own personal style into the gameplay more, and make them can fight each other as a way to win the battle,this game will better than now.\n\nThe Graphic is good, the cartoon style will increase the effect.and the color is soft and bright,that's alright.\nBut the sound of the candidate....maybe too fast i think,that's not enough hilarious but a bit of repetitive,if you play a whole game(50 states). You will be mad at Barack's voice.\n\n(I'm not an american, so there may have some problem in my review.Please forgive them.)", "comment_count": "8", "author": {"num_games_owned": 2109, "steamid": "76561198057436025", "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 121, "last_played": 1456560064}, "recommendationid": "21493063", "votes_down": 22, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.507143", "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_updated": 1456624820}, {"votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_created": 1465602732, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "The concept of the game is fantastic and gets you hooked right off the bat, however, the it can become a bit repititive as the game progresses. The cartoonish gameplay keeps the player entertained, great move by the developers incorporating tacky campaign speech by the candidates, very funny. The game in its current state is great but I expect more to come once the game is fully polished and released. The time zones in each state add a sense of urgency when campaigning and certainly applies the pressure; I enjoy the tackiness, the cartoony enviroment, and the overall concept of the game. All I ask from the game devs is to alleviate some of the repititiveness of the game by providing the player with  more features than just going disctrict by district and hoping the voters rally around you, even though that's kinda what the candidates are doing IRL. \n\nI appreciate the random scenarios the game provides the player with when campainging, such as accepting the support of a star or making promises to the voters. I would enjoy the game even more if they were possibly debate platforms, or media angle to work to expand the players options in tackling states, maybe we can launch ads in a state or start a twitter fight with another candidate? I know it is a lot to ask/suggest for but I see alot of potential for this game and I'm very grateful for its kind. Not much political games nowadays other than the Political Machine, Megalo Polis certainly deviates from the genre on its own path.\n\nOverall I can't say I regret spending the $10 on this game, I highly recommend it. The game mechanics, the features, the creativity all coincide with each other for a very enjoyable and funny experience. \n\n\nP.S.
