I paid 9$ for this, and it's just not good. The idea is funny, and I get that it's a SUPER indie game, but man... Don't put yourself through this. Game crashed several times, couldn't even run it on windowed, PLUS I couldn't climb the pipe you're supposed to climb to enter the house and go on the ant bridge. I kept sprinting, but it just wouldn't make it. \n\nCan I do better? Hell no, but would I try to do anything like this and SELL IT? HELL NO. I would give it out for free, since there are WAY better games to spend 9$ on. Really disappointed with my purchase. In the future, try to make a game that's actually worth the money you're asking.\n\nCheers.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 252, "steamid": "76561197999491469", "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1464189249}, "recommendationid": "23203045", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.522538", "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_updated": 1464189629}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1484834652, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This game... is not good, to say the least.\nLet's see my first expirience:\nI enter the first stage, where I start off in a hallway (Not a human one). On the sides there are some controls, because those couldn't be put with the other controls. While I read them, a spider has already seen me, because the enemies can see super far. Luckily, I have already read, how to pull out my sword (A burning match that transforms into a sword on death, because the devs didn't bother to make a model.) and start hitting the spider. I died, because the match does basically no damage. So don't even bother to try. On my next try, I ran away. Of course ten enemies saw that and started to chase me, as well. I ran and ran, until I was able to save myself by jumping once. Because, for some reason, spiders and fireflies can't get up small ledges. But I was stuck, because as soon as I got down, the enemies were right behind me. So, I decided \"Why not buy the DLC? I may be able to fight back, if I pay 99ct!\".\nNope. Well, yes, but there are so many enemies in the DLC, you don't even get to reload before three new enemies spawn.\n\n\nSo my suggestion: If you want a game were you're small, go on the internet. There are a ton of FREE exploration games where you're small (Or everyone is giant). Don't bother to play the game, UNLESS you need games to make fun of on youtube.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 153, "steamid": "76561198162125573", "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1484833849}, "recommendationid": "29356333", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502664", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1484834652}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1470232079, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "The game's premise is great.\nYou get to be an ANT. a GiAnt.\nThe sound effects are cool and each insect in the game has a different audio cue.\nAND...that's where the positive things end.\n\nThe frame rate is terrible even on low settings.\nThe combat is unbalanced and unfun.\nThe AI is terrible and running away from guys just creates a line of enemies behind you.\nI played for 15 minutes but there is so much that this game needs to be good that I just cant reccomend it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqv6iu7o-CM", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 538, "steamid": "76561198019816374", "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 395, "last_played": 1470227242}, "recommendationid": "24690004", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.487678", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1470232079}, {"votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_created": 1466844280, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Played this with my friend and had an absolute blast playing it. now with the update and the DLC its even better.
