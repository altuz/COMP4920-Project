Oh, I was supposed to say something about it redeeming itself.  Nope.  It's just that.  I guess you get upgrades, but how does that change anytehing if you still die in the seaweed every time?  Well, anyways.  I can beat the dam level in TMNT every time, with only sacrificing Raph (cause his weapons suck) but this I don't even care that much about.  I'll beat it here in a few minutes when I'm ready and I'll update this if anything cool happens.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 1055, "steamid": "76561198062978954", "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1499994190}, "recommendationid": "24095264", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.547553", "votes_up": 27, "timestamp_updated": 1467672540}, {"votes_funny": 8, "timestamp_created": 1459723901, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "In all the time I wanted this game, I hadn't seen any reviews here...at least 'not in my language', so allow me to chime in even without too much playing time: I'm already enjoying this game enough to recommend it. I thought it looked really cool, and like the visuals, and find no disappointment there. There's some good challenge to the gameplay, it's set up to be difficult. Think 'Super Meat Boy' type gameplay but more colorful...and even with some hair-pulling moments thus far, there's really nothing unfair or overly-frustrating, plus you have PLENTY of choice for difficulty. I think the trailer gives a good idea of what to expect from the game. I'm pretty sure I got the gyst of 'That Dam Level Redux', and at very least can already recommend it!", "comment_count": "11", "author": {"num_games_owned": 1144, "steamid": "76561198030163339", "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "last_played": 1459819771}, "recommendationid": "22227585", "votes_down": 68, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.437568", "votes_up": 36, "timestamp_updated": 1459820599}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2}}
