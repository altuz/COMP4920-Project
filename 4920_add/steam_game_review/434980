Great lvling up system, great selection of classes, and some nice item drops. I find the game suprisingly difficult, trying to race around to grab coin to lvl up your towers while avoiding death.

Super fun cross between a tower defense game and a beat-em-up. The harder levels are super challenging and extends the game time, with a load a replayability. Using the different 'heroes' makes you think about the play-style you use and adds to the fun. Definitely a good casual game that you get what you pay for. 8/10 would play again\n\n- Big Fams Gaming", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 76, "steamid": "76561198114837164", "playtime_forever": 2581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1498824621}, "recommendationid": "21809071", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500067", "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1458039710}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1457014114, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "It took me a few minutes to get used to the controls but once I did I found it very addicting!

You have the choice of using 1 of 3 heroes - a warrior (tank), bowman (ranged damage), or a wizard (ranged AoE damage).  You can start with any of the 3 at the beginning of a map, and can swap in another if you happen to die before you finish it.  You're also given stars for completing maps, which can be used unlock and upgrade different types of towers to place.  Clearing maps also gives experience, so you can level up any of your 3 heroes.\n\nI played this game when it very first hit Steam, and it had a few issues.  Controls were wonky, I lost my save data.. I gave it a chance, but it didn't work out.  I lost the willpower.\n\nHowever, I recently came back to give it another shot, and learned that the developers had improved the control scheme to allow WASD controls.  This dramatically improved the gameplay.  Interestingly, I also found my old save data on my computer; apparently the save folder changed during one of the earlier updates.\n\nAs I write this, I've just finished the game on hard mode, and overall the whole experience left me with a positive vibe.  It's not without flaws, though.  Below, I'll share some of what I liked and didn't like.\n\nPROS\n------\n1) The stat progression feels rewarding.  In this game, as you reach higher levels, you start to gain more stats (attack, defense, and health) per level.  This makes it so each level is exciting to gain - I wish more games recognized this and followed the example.\n\n2) It plays well in general.  Bashing into enemies as the warrior, my favorite class, often feels like a pinball machine of pain (THEIR pain), as I bounce from mob to mob.  You can do this as the other classes as well, but they don't have as much defense and health.\n\n3) The 3 separate difficulty modes are somewhat tiered, such that you're not expected to beat hard mode from the start.  This allows you to go back and replay levels for more experience.  Granted, you don't have to beat level 30 on easy to start level 1 on medium.  Each difficulty setting is a good nudge up in both challenge and reward, though.\n\n4) My kids find the talkative fairy creepy, but I think she adds a nice touch to the game.  She never did tell me something about the last boss, though!\n\n5) If there's a level cap, it's high.  I finished the game at level 40, and still have an experience bar filling up.  I like it when a game allows me to decide when I'll stop leveling up, not the other way around.\n\n6) Stable - zero crashes.\n\nCONS\n------\n1) The stamina system isn't fun.  This is one of the reasons I picked warrior as my primary.  He just bashes into things, and stamina loss doesn't seem to impact him much.  The bowman and wizard, however, are massively dependent on stamina.  Once you run out, you can no longer perform a ranged attack, and have to either use a heart or go to a healing tent to replenish.  This felt tedious, and I wasn't a fan.  The wizard can only perform 9 casts before having to refill.  Gaining more stamina on each level up would have been an easy fix for this.\n\n2) Items with magical suffixes need tooltips.  I never really know what they do until I play with them.  If one replenishes stamina, that would be a fix for the wizard, but I didn't toy around enough to find out.  \"Of the gods\" gives health regen though, so that was a sweet deal for the warrior.\n\n3) Class balance doesn't seem right.  The wizard in particular feels very underpowered, mostly due to the stamina system, and not being able to continuously cast.  The overall damage from her spells feels low as well, or maybe it's the fire rate that suffers more?\n\n4) Very limited settings.  It's apparent that this game wasn't originally developed for the PC.\n\n\nAll in all, this game delivers what it promises - it's a satisfying tower defense / action rpg.  There are annoyances, but I don't believe they're numerous enough to warrant not buying the game.  5 bucks is a steal; I paid that much for my coffee this morning.  I would recommend this title to other fans of the genre.\n\nThanks for fun experience, devs.  I hope to see more of your stuff in the future, or possibly more updates to this game.

It's definitely really fun and it's deeper than it might seem. I am digging the unqiue graphics and the music a ton! I wish there was more characters to choose from, just because I'd love to see what else they could come up with it's just a cool style that you don't see often in games. As far as game-play goes, I played around with both WASD and controller and personally preferred it on controller, but that's usually my preference anyways. I definitely recommend this game to anyone that loves Tower Defense, ARPG and strategy. This game is pretty crazy and chaotic, and keeps you on your toes, so definitely not for anyone that enjoys a slow paced game.
