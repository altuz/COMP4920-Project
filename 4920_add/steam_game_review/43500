Okay, next I have\u2026M.U.D. TV?  Sorry, I had to look up the name of the game.  It won\u2019t be any surprise I did not like this game.  The premise is that you run a TV Channel and your goal is to get people to watch your programs and earn money through advertisers but you\u2019re secretly\u2026EVIL! Plot twist!  Meh\u2026\n\nEvil Story:  So you\u2019re evil\u2026for reasons and you want to take over the world after your professors through you out of college?  Huh, I\u2019m all for whacky stories but this is a bit much and after reviewing Impire you\u2019d think I\u2019d be closer to goal but nope.  The story is not even forgettable, it\u2019s so bad that it sticks in my mind and I\u2019m annoyed that I even played the game.  Really, would it have been so bad to change the story into your just a manager who wants to put good content on the TV.  The story also seems to have a hint of politics involved, making corporations out to be super evil entities that don\u2019t really even want your money they just want to destroy your lives for\u2026reasons?\n\nConvulsions within Convulsions:  The premise of the gameplay is that you will buy or produce TV content, agree to advertisement contracts and then air your content when it is best to get the most eyeballs on it.  You build rooms and research stuff.  You\u2019ve seen this all before but the way they implement it all is through menus with drag and drop mechanics with poor labeling and even poorer direction.  This game is the definition of a spreadsheet simulator hidden behind silly toon style graphics.  The tutorial doesn\u2019t help either, walls of text and explain the game in a way that expects you to already know how to play it and even when you do learn how to play it\u2026it\u2019s just boring.\n\nI always stick to three points:  So, I don\u2019t really have much to say about this game, but I always make three points with an intro and a conclusion.  I will say that I had an odd graphical bug where everything vanished but unlike the majority of reviews on steam I didn\u2019t haven\u2019t any technical issues with this game other than that.  This is a game, implementation isn\u2019t terrible, graphics are okay for what they are trying but I don\u2019t think anyone sat down tried to enjoy themselves. \n\nUltimately, I got this game for free when I bought Dungeons (another boring game) and to be honest, I\u2019d rather play Dungeons.  I think the main issue is a lack of direction, transparency and no one asking:  \u201cWhere is the fun\u201d.  Maybe if I sat down and spent a few hours figuring out everything and talking to the other players (do they even still exist this game is 7 years old) I might find the game.  But games in today\u2019s world need to grab you immediately.  I\u2019d pass if I were you unless you are heavily into simulation / tycoon style games.\n"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1497705096, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498403", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "32504203", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011204091", "num_reviews": 151, "last_played": 1339138800, "num_games_owned": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 296}, "timestamp_updated": 1497705096, "received_for_free": false, "review": "i remember when i was a little fucking idiot and bought this shitty game"}]}
