Unless...which brings me to the next point. It's a pay-to-win game so it's engineered to get you to go to the cash shop. I'd with these FTP developers would try to strike a balance between a  the cash grind and a fun game. Maybe charge a small fee up front then have the gash shop less annoying.\n\nOverall, it's an OK game.
