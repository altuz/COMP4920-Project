This game in places requires some well thought out strategy even in relaxed casual (not timed) mode.  The biographies/profiles of the characters are worth the read.\n\nStoryline: Count Dracula decides to get modern and look for mate using an online dating system.  Having found \"the perfect one\" he goes to meet her only to discover she is nothing like her online profile. (That should be of no surprise! LOL) However, the Princess has matrimony on her mind and chases after Dracula, who runs away from her.    \n\n45 levels in the main game, 15 levels in the bonus chapter, and 3 modes, normal timed, relaxed (not timed), and timed multi-click (This is where the player can click on as many items as are available forming an item pick up cue).  What makes this game different for others is 1) interactive tabs for potions. crafting, and magic (3 each by game end), 2) clothing with a bonus ability attached (awarded during gameplay), and 3) powerups used for increasing supplies which upgrade during gameplay.  Late in the game there is a powerup upgrade that allows for upgrading all supply buildings at once (That is so nice and such a resource saver).  There are also \"finds\" that occur over the course of gameplay (main and bonus): princess statues (60, one per level), gift boxes (30, gives in-game 'stickers'), princess posters (6), and black cats (13).  Plus there are 3 extra 'secret' finds - death's scythe, alien, and sheep-king - found somewhere in the game. (Yes, I know where they are, and no, I am not telling, that would be a spoiler.)\n \nMost, if not all, achievements can be earned during gameplay. (Note: Once a level is open the player can go back without having to play the entire game over).  \n\nPlays well and fast, the upgrades keep the gameplay fresh, the \"finds\" are a fun extra, and the storyline is amusing enough to keep the player interested.  Excellent game.  I highly recommend it.", "comment_count": "3", "author": {"num_games_owned": 596, "steamid": "76561198141404871", "playtime_forever": 1526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 119, "last_played": 1463016040}, "recommendationid": "21379048", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.530570", "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_updated": 1460880030}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1453994869, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Kann dieses Spiel nur jedem empfehlen.
