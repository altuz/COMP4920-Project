It said a \"small myst like \"point and click\" adventure game. I wasn't disappointed. It is indeed a short game, good for playing on a lunch break, and it is indeed myst like, though with the addition of an inventory and some comments from the protagonist when you try to do things. All in all, don't expect a massive, endlessly polished AAA title, because that's not what this game is.  If however you expect a small myst like poit and click adventure, you won't be disappointed. I would recommend this game only for adventure game lovers though.

Elansar is pretty good game. The puzzles and plot both make sense and tie together well. The game had an engaging story, and it's definitely worth at least the $1 it's being sold for.\n\nIt's true that it's short and has little replay value, but there are no bugs and it does come across as a finished product. I felt a sense of accomplishment when I beat it. One minor issue is that once you beat the game you can't play anymore unless you manually delete your save data or reinstall the game, but if you solved this game's puzzles then this is no problem.\n\nBottom line: If being stuck on a mysterious island appeals to you, give this a shot to cut your teeth on before moving up to some of the longer, more difficult games.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 30, "steamid": "76561198047845894", "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1477653143}, "recommendationid": "26261117", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500716", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1477689491}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1453446868, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Wholly crap.
