It does seem to be a few degrees harder than Elansar, so if you're looking for more of a challenge than the first game, be prepared. I do recommend that both games be purchased together and played in chronological order.\n\nThe music and graphics were nice and the camera and controls feature several upgrades since the previous game. This makes for a smoother experience and enjoyable gameplay.\n\nI haven't beaten it yet but I am excited to know what will happen next, which is the mark of a good game.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 30, "steamid": "76561198047845894", "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1477689081}, "recommendationid": "26276061", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505862", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1477689276}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1}}
