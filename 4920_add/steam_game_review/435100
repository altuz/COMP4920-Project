I like it a lot.\n\n[edit] For details. It has FLAWS. But like many of the GEMS in the 90's/early 00's, the flaws are overwhelmed by the core experience being so unique and amazing. (Try Fallout 1/2 again. The AI is as dumb as a brick. But the game still rules.)\n\n - User interface is frustrating.\n\n - Controls can be frustrating.\n\n - Game mechanics get very frustrating at the harder / later levels. You will reload in the beginning as you \"get used to it\". But at the end you will reload because the game controls DIDN'T do what you knew you wanted to do.\n\n - There are occasional bugs.\n\n - There are occasions where (the QA team should have caught!) you don't know what you actually are supposed to do to continue.\n\n  - (Nitpicking) The artwork is inconsistant in quality at times. Some of the artwork stills look really good, others, the people's faces look like a college student made them. Which CAN take you out of the experience if you notice it.\n\n++++ ++++++ The game is amazing, and unique.\n\n +++ The music is pretty dang cool. Note it's a LIVE ORCHESTRA. That's pretty rare for an indie-scale game.\n\n +++ COOL AS HELL Voxel graphics and when you get hit, little pieces of your body fall off. As a gamer and programmer, I miss and applaud the use of the lost-art of voxels. (Minecraft doesn't count.)\n\n + Fun/interesting traps to kill bad guys.\n\n + Fun plot devices/twists/etc.\n\nIt's Monaco + Detective/Noir + Saw (film) or Binding of Issac. It's more than the sum of those parts. It's a game offering an experience no other game out there has.\n\nTL;DR Basically, the game engine feels like it was 90% finished (in terms of polish). But it's an amazing game. If it had came out in the 90's/00's it'd be known as a classic.\n\nIf you get it for <$10, you won't feel cheated. If you paid ~$30 or whatever, you'd feel like those flaws should have been resolved before release.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 615, "steamid": "76561198030622641", "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "last_played": 1502004702}, "recommendationid": "34030869", "votes_down": 4, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503177", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1502049014}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1501880623, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "game is challenging and interesting but like wtf i cant play offline! fucking gay", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 109, "steamid": "76561198125349875", "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1502902638}, "recommendationid": "34024038", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.498357", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1501880623}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 10, "total_positive": 14, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 24}}
