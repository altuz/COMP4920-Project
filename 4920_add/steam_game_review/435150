I never did play the first game though heard good things about it, so figured give the second a run. So far...even in early access I can't say I was disappointed. The game it's self reminds me of classic computer RPGs and pen 'n paper RPGs I played when I was much younger just a bit more fair and easier to understand yet still maintaining a lot of what made them challenging. Character customization starts a bit limited but as you get higher in levels its more about what you want to play and what your party members be. You are not locked into your starting class at all and I love that, hoping they have a lot more choices in the full release. \n\nGameplay wise is point and click, though I found there is a lot to interact with in the world in different ways, one of the more different ways I found was that playing an Elf or having an Elf in your group, the elf can eat a corpse and gain the memories of that person, and it actually does play a part in the game. Combat is much of the same, point and click with a lot of tactical choices to make, the enemy AI is well refined and act in actually very smart ways even on the easier difficulties. I also found it pretty neat how your spells, items and attacks can change the battle ground and make hazards for yourself and your enemies, with the enemies able to do the same. Such as freezing a wet spot on the ground to give a chance of someone slipping on the spot or shocking the water with lighting to stun everyone standing in the wet spot. Though at times at least for me I found it hard to move to avoide these hazards at times like the area they were affecting were slightly larger than they really were.\n\nI even tried a bit of co-op with friends and a bit hidden in a sense once we figured it out, connecting with one another was clean and easy to do. \n\nStorywise I found interesting enough, a dark world with many dark themes with demons, torture and corruption. The premade characters have backgrounds and behave well according to their backgrounds. Another different system in this game is the tag system. Basicly pick tags for your character and you will have in game choices that you can make based just on those tags you pick. The pre mades having different choices as well they can make based on their stand alone backgrounds. Though it does feel you can get same results no matter your background still, it does help with immersion and at in making your created character feel seprate from the rest. \n\nGraphics, are not that important to me, but they are decent enough in this game. Though playing completely zoomed out (pretty much the only way to play an RPG like this) I found it a bit difficult to notice things I could pick up or interact with since they are so small. A few rare times I misclicked on something because of how small it is. I have an older system, so I wasn't able to play on the highest settings, I was able to however able to play on high even though the game suggested I play on low. So I can see pretty much everyone able to play this game with no issues. Even when I tried the highest settings I just had a slight drop in Frame rate.\n\nOverall Divinity 2 I recommend highly, especially if you are a fan of old school RPGs and Pen 'n Paper RPGs, you will feel right at home playing this with a high level of immersion and ability to costumize your character however you desire. Story had been done before but it's presented well in the world, and should be interesting enough to keep you playing. Combat is deep, and will challenge the thinking sides of your brain to approach each encounter in most effective way possible, plus have you thinking best way to build your characters to deal with threats in your prefered way. You might find a little frustration in interacting with the world due to how small things are and will even miss a few things if you aren't careful, but it shouldn't be a big enough issue to remove any enjoyment in the game. \n\nHope you found this helpful if you took the time to read it.", "comment_count": "10", "author": {"num_games_owned": 61, "steamid": "76561198029632709", "playtime_forever": 7925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2872, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506832310}, "recommendationid": "34944121", "votes_down": 19, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.688226", "votes_up": 223, "timestamp_updated": 1505375401}, {"votes_funny": 18, "timestamp_created": 1505893967, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This is the sort of game you once dreamed about existing.

It really makes you save scumming A LOT, but other hand it forces you to learn some dirty tricks to defeat enemies as they really do some dirty hoccus poccus to you.

Some situations feels so unfair until you really think it through. For me it is just pure joy, wanted so long something that is not just blatant rush in and slice everything or that stupid RNG kills your smart moves, it's you and your stupid moves and strategies what gets you killed.. and ofc i can blame a bit other games that has made your brain so dry for new ideas ;)\n\nSame style goes with conversations. Listen what they have to say, it might help you later.. No it will help you later. Books, notes etc is rewarding to read as they can have life saving info or ways to unlock some puzzles later on.

This game WILL kick your ass if you don\u2019t play your cards right\n+ The world is massive and rewards players for exploring and roaming\n+ Multiple solutions to quests.  There isn\u2019t one way to do everything.  Find one solution you like?  Quest on!  Find another way that suits your fancy better?  Game on.\n+ Graphically very pleasing to look at!\n+ Music is what you\u2019d expect from a fantasy game and it\u2019s pleasing to chill out and relax to\n+ Party members are interesting and have their own backstories/quests\n+ Multiplayer/Co-op!\n+ Option for fast travel when you discover waypoints\n+ VO's are nice but I've played the game for so long without them that I find the experience more enjoyable with it off completely\n+ loot in certain vendors has changed or does change so there's always plenty of variety\n+ crafting is so optional that you almost don't really have to bother with it unless you want to\n+ The Gamemaster mode is probably the best thing since tabletop simulator\n+ The freedom to do what you want in-game\n+ Loot once you hit just before leaving Fort Joy and after is beyond plentiful\n+ Variety of characters, both recruitable and NPCs alike are astounding; everyone has a story worth listening to\n\nCons:\n- Gold can be hard to come by.  Or... you know, cheat\n- A lack of direction can often be confusing; especially for gamers just getting into the game/series\n+/- Multiple quest solutions can be missed or completely over-looked.  Although exploration/deep digging can help you find them\n\nFinal verdict: 9/10: would play love letter RPG again.

( i play multiple characters but right now i am about 6 hours in on my undead witch and i haven't even come close to finish act 1 and from what i've heard of others act 1 can easily become 15 hours of playtime)\n\n-OPTIMIZATION! this game's beautifull combat effects can clutter your whole screen and your computer (or laptop) can still run it smoothly\n\nNow some small cons:\n\n-*total freedom on how you play.\nsure is nice to play it however you want but... you must also discover each mechanic yourself (this is also how Grumps started a fight because i accidentally stole a book infront of the magister and also may have hit her with a knife before) also you can miss allot of story contents if you randomly kill people.\n\n-tutorial is a bit vague sometimes and forgettable when you get too much on your plate because at same time you are fighting and trying to predict what your enemy is going to do.\n\nafter this there aren't many cons about this game that i can mention until i have actually experienced the full game and not just act 1. call me biased but just of the sheer size of the game you should try it. i can already sense this has allot of replay value.", "comment_count": "22", "author": {"num_games_owned": 110, "steamid": "76561198048711859", "playtime_forever": 4311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2734, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506810702}, "recommendationid": "34951238", "votes_down": 95, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.685926", "votes_up": 382, "timestamp_updated": 1505511707}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 362, "total_positive": 5863, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 20, "total_reviews": 6225}}
