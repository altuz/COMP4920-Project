Right now, however, it borders on dead. I know it hasn't been updated in almost a year which says to me that nobody is working on it. I just went to play it again and it was so broken. I landed at a place that the map said had water but the terrain said otherwise. That is, until I went down to the \"water\" area. There was still grass, but with the addition of flying fish and a slightly darker shadow effect when I was immersed. Everything functioned the same (walking, fighting, etc.) I attempted to build a house for shelter and was successful except for the whole 'the walls are invisible and I can't enter or exit this establishment' problem. If you want to play around these problems and make it work for you, go ahead.
