Multiple female and male romances for both Diana and Alex, and the \"canon\" romance for Diana is Charlotte. Multiple endings abound, with a pretty clear path to each one so you're not surprised by sudden violence. The anime-style dlc is cute but I prefer the original, though it's still definitely worth getting. \n\nThe card game is amazing. Usually I get tired of such mechanics and switch to story mode(which is an excellent thing winter wolves offers), but the balancing and style of the cards made each battle a lot of fun. \n\nScore: 10/10 I play this game regularly and hold it as a standard for design and execution.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 31, "steamid": "76561198068554556", "playtime_forever": 1913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1504219628}, "recommendationid": "34645726", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.508829", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504218661}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1503650123, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This is a Winter Wolves game. Which means it is a game built around a concept and created by a team that seems to have a love for making great games. While some of their efforts haven't gone as well as planned, they always do come up with intersting concepts, and even their few lesser games have been decent.\n\nThis is a good game. That said, I should also mention it is a prequel to another of their games, Planet Stronghold. And while it took a while to understand how to use the card-playing part of the game (and get past a small issue of not being able to construct decks well), the rest of the game is great. Most of the achievements can be done in visual novel mode (and one actually requires you finish one playthrough that way), but one achievement is tied to a bunch of side quests that require the card game aspect.\n\nThe characters are interesting, the combat... well, thrilling enough once you get the card thing down, and the romance options are expansive. And by that I mean you have eight options per gender. You can play as Alex or Diana Nelson. Alexander has four male, four female love interests, Diana has three male, four female, and a robot love interest. Note that four of the love interests are shared. And there is a default romance for the character you do not choose (interestingly, Diana's is Charlotte, a mother of a ten-year-old, which maybe the first time I've seen a default non-standard romance). \n\nThe art of the characters can be set as either realistic or manga-style. Note: if you choose manga-style, and choose to... not censor certain scenes, you will see some suggestive content.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 445, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "playtime_forever": 2168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 362, "last_played": 1503649472}, "recommendationid": "34476592", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.507793", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1503650123}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 8}}
