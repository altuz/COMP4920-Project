I understand this work is particularly pointed towards those who are among LGBT+ (and I appreciate that there are works like this willing to tackle the subject matter\", so I suppose that hopefully someone who does go through WKTD can get something from it.\n-While they aren't around for long, I did enjoy the interactions between the main three characters throughout and they create an interesting dynamic for the story. \n\nCons:\n-It doesn't really feel like the paths to the endings had a consistent rhyme or reason. Yes, you \"leave behind\" a character, but the tasks are at times menial, to the point where getting locked out of the true end didn't really fit the theme of \"leaving someone out\".\n-It feels too short to get its point across. Even in doing all the endings, it spends so little time developing the characters, that I didn't really get to really know who they were. There isn't much backstory or really much of anything to really get someone invested beyond their personalities and their actions, and the short length such little room for individual character development or actualization. The antagonizing forces of the story had such little presence in the plot until I got my first ending, where it just left me confused. I'm all for some ambiguity, but the game felt like it rushed towards its eventual goal, and is paced in a way that's bound to lead to some confusion.\n-The actual game script really could use some work. At times it feels like it was written via stream of consciousness, and while this worked on occasion, other times it just creates confusingly written sentences with poor syntax and grammar. \n-The music at times was just... loud noise, and while at times that fit, at others it felt as if it just was trying to make a scene more dramatic than need be.\n\nOverall...it's just okay. There are positives to be taken from this, and I think that there's potential to expand on the good ideas here. It took me about 2 hours to go through, which is honestly a harmless amount of time. But at a price of 8$, there are better things most of you can do with your money.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 165, "steamid": "76561198023175868", "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 121, "num_reviews": 29, "last_played": 1506584810}, "recommendationid": "35256962", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502686", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506648333}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 19, "total_positive": 188, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 207}}
