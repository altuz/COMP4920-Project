It's very much 'Where's Waldo?' with a twist. Some folks might not like the color scheme but it's not as bad as you might think and it really in fact makes it much harder to find stuff sometimes because it forces you to look for certain clues instead of color recognition.\n\nConcept is pretty simple. Each level has a starting area which is pretty small. These areas are to help you acclimate yourself to the mechanics of each upcoming level. So basically it shows you what you can interact with and what you can expect to have to do to find all the items or people. One place you might need to ruffle some trees to knock a banana out while in another you have to perform a slight puzzle with levers to get a conveyer belt to move something to activate something else to open an area to find a guy who was otherwise unreachable. Very interesting.\n\nAlong with fun mechanics and gameplay the sound design is just a wonder to listen to. Clicking on anything leads to a humorous interpretation of what the dev thinks it should sound like. From squishes to bleeps to boops they had some guy just record himself making the noises. I don't think anything was done with props. Just a guy making noises man. Brilliant.\n\nThe developers are actively updating this with new levels which is awesome and I'd even go as far as to pay for new DLC with tons of new levels or a way to procedurally generate levels or something. So, would I recommend?
