And some of those games are totally free.  I would say all those games are better except maybe Nvidia because although the visuals in Nvidia are much better, the gameplay/replayability there is quite limited.\n\nIf there was a more active online community, I would definitely highly recommend this game.  But basically, you'll need to have a friend who also has VR or you'll be playing solo every time.  So it's only a tepid recommendation.  \n\nOn the plus side, all the mini-games play well, nice nostalgia factor going for this game.  I didn't notice any bugs or errors.  The visuals are cartoonish, but work well enough for its intended purpose. \n\nRate 5.5/10, definitely wait for sale recommendation if you enjoy these type of games.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 846, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 210, "last_played": 1501128818}, "recommendationid": "33645818", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505670", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500446990}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 6, "total_positive": 139, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 145}}
