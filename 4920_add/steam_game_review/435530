This game is a story driven 2d scrolling explorer with little challenge. The levels are linear and the people you save really don't matter. Honestly, any progression you make is relatively unimportent. There is literally no punishment for death and only one ememy (the exploding fire enemy) actually requires you to use ammo. You can meele attack your way through everything else. That being said, the story is just a J.J. Abrams mystery box. I'm not going to spoil anything for anyone, but the story really comes to nothing. I'm not trying to be rude, but there isn't really any progression. You never feel the weight of your actions. The window dressing (art, random notes, etc.) is good. There are points where it seems like the game will get somewhere, but it never really does. On the bright side the game is incredibly short. But if that's the best thing I can say about a game, I can't recommend it.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 57, "steamid": "76561198072246551", "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 453, "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1506823813}, "recommendationid": "35361274", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501625", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506825428}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506459184, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Too repititive.
