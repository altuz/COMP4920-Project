I wanted to point this out because, sadly, it's not something to take for granted.\nSo, these guys did a fantastic job developing the game they wanted to develop, what I really don't get is why someone should want to develop this useless game in the first place! The world didn't need this! I'm sure I didn't! And i have to say i [b]love[/b] tower defense games, so I knew what i was looking for.\nI mean, this game could be the \"Pong\" of the tower defense genre, just... [b]even more boring![/b]\n\nYou have a tower, literally, and you have to defend it, full stop.\nYou have a character and you use it in order to place turrets and shoot enemies, so it blends tower defense with shooter gameplay, but every single aspect of the gameplay is [b]astonishingly basic![/b]\nThis game has no charisma, there's no setup, no plot, nothing, you start the game and BAM, you are in your useless tower and you have to defend it! Why? [b]I don't know![/b]\nBut that's not a problem, right? A game like this doesn't necessarily need a plot, a setting, or even a flavour... but maybe some different game scenarios would be fun... [b]Nope![/b] You've been a bad boy and you got [b]nothing![/b] Just a silly tower and bunches of enemies which come to destroy your ugly tower and kill you. WHY? [b]Because they're bad![/b] - i mean there are scorpionlike bots, they cannot be good! - So you kill'em, you clear the wave, you open the shop interface where you can buy turrets, upgrade your hero, unlock skills, then the next wave attacks you, you clear it, upgrade, shop, next wave, and so on! There are just a few types of different enemies, so surviving means just to face bigger waves in the same situation and scenario. Again and again. [b]This is insanely boring![/b]\n\nIt's even a roguelite game, so when you die you have to restart the game with nothing unlocked, no progession, [b]nothing[/b], and i [b]love[/b] roguelites but here it's just silly because the game is always the same boring thing with no variation!\n\n[h1]Conclusions:[/h1]\nIf this game had been an arcade game back in the eighties, they would have need to actually pay people in order to have them play this.\nThis is ultimately a bad tower defense with a basic and boring shooter gameplay where you can play a single dull scenario.\nI wouldn't reccomend it even if it was free, there's no reason to waste time playing this instead of something else, or... just keep staring at this review it will be more entertaining!", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 290, "steamid": "76561198071723451", "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "last_played": 1458158953}, "recommendationid": "21876277", "votes_down": 12, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.508536", "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1458162331}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1477147809, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Uhm for some reason AVG is telling me this is a virus.
