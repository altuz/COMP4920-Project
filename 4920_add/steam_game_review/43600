My younger brother and I would play these games over and over again when we were kids. I received two of them for my ninth birthday, and from then on, we were hooked on mystery solving! Our teamwork always made the gameplay shorter, but we always had so much fun together! When I told my brother that I had purchased another one, he was very excited and agreed to help me with this one. I'm currently a student at an all-women's college, and he's getting ready to go to college in September, so I figured it would be good to compare my school to the school in the game while teaching him some of the basics of college life. (Okay, this particular academy isn't really college, it's a boarding school, but still...)\n\nSpeaking of all female schools...there are some similarities between my college and the school in this game that are frightening. The most notable? \"The Black Cat\". At Agnes Scott College, there's a tradition called \"Black Cat Week\" in which the classes compete to show off school spirit. The junior class writes and performs a play; there's big dance; we decorate the campus grounds...in this game, however, the Black Cat is the alias the culprit goes by.\n\nAnyway, how IS this game? Like most Nancy Drew games...it's great! There's an engaging story, lots of challenging puzzles...my brother and I were constantly guessing and second-guessing who the culprit was, and even when we thought we had it figured out, we were wrong!\n\nThere are a few notes that I took during gameplay: one of the NPCs, Rachel, seems to be unique in that when Nancy talks to her, she moves as Nancy speaks. The other NPCs remain motionless when Nancy delivers her lines during a conversation. I wonder why this is? Maybe the developers were testing out new animations for future games?\n\nOverall, I'd have to give this game a solid A. It's got replay value (especially because of Steam Achievements!), a good story, challenging puzzles, and so much nostalgia if you grew up with the Nancy Drew games, like I did. Give it a go!"}]}
