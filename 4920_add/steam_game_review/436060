The game's difficulty was tuned to the developer's skill level after all of his playtesting rather than to that of a player starting a fresh game, and major issues were overlooked because he no longer could see them. Skip it.\n\nThis is one of the worst 3D platformers I've ever played. Throughout the entire game, you are navigating between tiny platforms hovering over a void, so there's a consistent difficulty in gauging distance. It only gets worse as the game progresses, when you come across glowing platforms and black platforms which you can't see your shadow on. Even the hub world is obnoxious with narrow platforms that coil upwards. The game also has ridiculous speed challenges with crushing walls or spurting lava(?) that I'm convinced have some kind of rubber banding, because the timing is just that tight. A constant problem in the game is that you need to adjust the camera, but you don't have the time to, and so you end up making blind jumps instead. I can't even imagine playing this game without a controller.\n\nWhat's worse is that the game is often unintuitive, with no tutorials or visual cues. Like the critical mechanic where you have to walk off a ledge before jumping to get barely enough distance for a few gaps late in the game. In one level, the ceiling is a death field, even though it has no spikes or anything. There's also a minigame at the goal of every level where you have to jump through three rings in a time limit, but it would consistently fail the minigame instantly when I jumped through the first ring. I have no clue why. I only ever completed the minigame once in all of my attempts. I won't bother going into the platforms that act randomly different from visually identical ones.\n\nThe rewards the game offers up are almost pointless. After you defeat the first boss, you earn the ability to double jump, but every subsequent level demands vastly longer jumps, so it's a distinction without a difference. After the second boss, you earn a health upgrade... and immediately afterward encounter instant-death enemies and traps. You earn the ability to fly, but it can only be used during the final boss fight and in the hub world.\n\nThe game is riddled with bugs. You can die when selecting a costume in the hub world. A few times when I started the game up, it wouldn't allow me to choose the \"Start\" option, despite it visually reacting to button presses. If you collect more than one life at once, you will only get one of them, and the rest are erased. You can earn an infinite amount of lives from gumball machines and get your coins back if you kill yourself before a checkpoint. Some enemies just froze in place. I consistently got pushed through walls by crushers and had to restart the entire level because I was stuck. The final boss battle is a complete joke, a unending stream of bugs that ate upwards of 40 lives, forcing me to grind lives on past levels. It would even spawn you in already falling to your death.\n\nThe only positive things I can say are that the music is okay (it's Kevin MacLeod), and it's interesting that levels have a randomized assortment of obstacles for each playthrough, if you for some reason even wanted to replay them. On the whole though, I'd skip this game.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 754, "steamid": "76561197978423466", "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1501990073}, "recommendationid": "33164318", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502735", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1499050002}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4}}
