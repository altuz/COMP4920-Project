Who was I kidding, same old, same old. Once life points are gone one must wait for life points to build up again. I guess one could ask friends who play the game to send you some but that is a waiting game in its self, or one can buy items from the  store to carry on playing. This is your typical pay to win game, [and ask friends to help you  progress] if anyone wants to get anywhere good with it. To be honest I dont know how this game managed to get on steam because it sure was milking facebook and still is. Upon checking  facebook I found,very much to my surprise  that there it was, it seems it is still a ongoing playable facebook game with over 50,000 players", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 35, "steamid": "76561198078764591", "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1485728108}, "recommendationid": "29575271", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1486007521}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1486527622, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This game was fun, but once you got late game it took so long to do ANYTHING.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 28, "steamid": "76561198148299822", "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "last_played": 1477107344}, "recommendationid": "29774749", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504058", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1486527622}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485244534, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "game is smooth , must be better with friends.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 10, "steamid": "76561198092096731", "playtime_forever": 1463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1487901142}, "recommendationid": "29457465", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501116", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1485244534}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487696932, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "boring and repeatitive", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 12, "steamid": "76561198281205710", "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1487696891}, "recommendationid": "30082804", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.493274", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487696932}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 4}}
