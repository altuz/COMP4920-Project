{"success": 1, "reviews": [{"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506309588, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Short Version: \nGive the Free Prolouge a try, you'll either like it or you wont. A mixed mechanics from multiple 3rd person shooters with added new/unique aspects. A breath of fresh air in my honest opinion when all shooters now are fps and or \"mobas\". Simple but effective character kits that get the job done, if you know how to play em but at the same time says this is this character and what they can do, but more then just run and gun.\n\nLong Version:\nthey're are several things to point out about this game-\n1) The free part of the game is the prolouge (as stated on the store page), not a demo, all items currency and other objects are retained and accesable after purchase of at least one campaign\n\n2) This is is raiders of a broken planet not (insert game name here), so dont tell people to go play said game instead, you could compare this game to others of course, but fanboy/girling about a diffrent game is not helpful to reviewing and aiding in others possibly joining the game.\n\n3) Both the prolouge and the first campaign are just part of the game are just part of the game there is more to come\n\n4) Need to pay attention to mechanics on missions not everything is just kill with a gun, several missions have parts where you need to execute a certain mechanic such as collecting aleph via melee kills one certain enemies to activate an obeject, failing to do so could not only prolonge the match but cause an antagonist and or npc's the chance to overwhelm the party. also every character uses stamina a lil didfently so learn your character. another item to know is the ability to respawn is recharged after hitting 0 if you hold out for the npc to get more aleph so dont leave the match thinking you'll loose in mid game.\n\n5) Melee is a rock paper scissors system: all players, antagonists, npcs bassically have it, if you learn it and practice it, like anything else you'll get good at it like anything else, it's not op just mechanics\n\nPros:\n-Unique characters: all characters are a lil diffrent from each other tho take from basic pen a paper mechanics. all have assests and defects to add to a team.\n\n-Multiple mission goals/mechanics: Not every match is just mow down the enemy. there are capture points, boss fights, escorts, overload the core/bomb, protect an object/person, and mechanics to work with em in each mission.\n\n-Customization: Tho limited as of right now you can customize a characters kit or load out to slightly change their play style to better suit your's via in game currency. (side  note there are skins unlockable via real currancy as of the moment)\n\n-Antagonist mode: Allows you to play against a party as the villian/enemy via the characters you have unlocked, gives a diffrent perspective on each mission, but is double edged. it both feels good to take down an enemy player amongts the npc hoards and boss battles, but can also be a challange if they are not only good but smart adding an extra level of difficulty to a level both new or old.\n\n-Interesting story: Tho limited at the moment if you read, watch and pay attention to not only the ciniematics but the logs in the universe tab, it gives alot of insight to the lore of the game that is quit capatavating in my opinion.\n\n-Style: Both serious and humorius. the art syle remind my a lil of a gorillaz like design for some of the characters which is nice. these are not your typicall front page models  with guns you find is most games and movies now a days, theyre rough n tough tryin to survive on a broken planet. the mix of scifi, mystic (tho only show breifly), and ancient tech is a nice blend upon the man made structures to the decaying lands and and abandoned ruins of this.\n\n-In an out: can basically can just jump in play a few matches (depeding on que and completion time) and jump out\n\nCons\n-Low pop (currently)/que times: dispite several other reviews matchmaking is \"working\" as of writing this review. in my experience it takes 3-17 min to get a match/team depending on the time of day, if solo, in a party, and the map, and antagonist que in too. but people do leave ques, lobby, mid match due to either being afk thinking they'll lose (both on antagonist and raiders side), disconnects and such. at the moment the fastest is the prolouge as its free and where most of the current pop will be, but latley ppl have been expanding to the the campain.\n\n-Antagonist mode: tho i truly do enjoy this aspect of the game as it not only adds an extra level of difficulty for the raiders side depending on the player, if said player leaves it's an automatic win which is double edged, as with current pop ques may be long so if you dont \"complete\" the mission you dont progress even tho you won the mission due to the antagonist leaving. you'll also need to level up your antagonist rank to build certain if not all weapons as of writing this review.\n\n-No co-op que. it'd be nice to just que up with your party wether its 2,3, or full with out having to match for the missing slots, or just to play with out the woory of an antagonist sometimes.\n\n-short: tho the content is repeatable (an antagonists make each match a lil different), for me it as deffinetly left me wanting more, not only in story but in missions, to raid more.\n\n-communication: no real ingame chat or speak currently implemented to communicate more detailed items, or just to chat. only a sytem of calls/shouts/signals and emotes.\n\n\nmixed/misc items\ncontrols: it takes a lil geting used to and seem a lil odd at first, but it does flow nicley once you get used to em, especially on a gamepad/controller in my opinion.\n\nrewards: at the end of the mission u get 3-4 items every time win or lose. x amount of factions, x amount of character points, x amount of gold, and a blue print depending on how the party did. the thing is you have to choose 1, and if 1 or more players choose the the same item it's either split equally or if its the blue print it spins the bottle and who ever it lands on gets it. i both like an dislike this as it make it a lil realistic as its sayin this is what you all go split it amongs your selves, but can also cause the grind to lengthen.\n\nCampaigns released seperetly: though the over all current purchase of all pipline season 2017 campains amount to 40$ or less if u only buy parts at 10$ per, the inital release of just the proluge and 1st campaign has left me wanting more, not later but now. but at the same time depending on reviews and feed back via this first campaign it could provide the developers a chance to tweek the upcomping portions in part instead of the entire game as a whole. \n\n\n\noverall in my opinion it's a good game that has alot of potential, mixing alot of aspects of several other 3rd person shooters of the same genre while adding it's own mix, and i'd like to see where it goes.", "comment_count": "1", "author":

But it blends elements from all those.\n\nLooking at the system requirements and the year, I gotta say this game looks good and gets the job done. Cutscenes are orchestrated tastefully with expressive characters, shakey hand-cam, and jump-cuts to show players the characters' personalities. It makes me think of Borderlands mixed up with some Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo. The game does a good job with the show-not-tell philosophy as well.\n\nBut if you don't want the story or fluff, sometimes it can feel like an inconvenience to watch the cutscenes because one person in the party doesn't want to skip it. You can't just jump into a game real quick. The plot also requires watching the cutscenes multiple times to understand the character dynamics. I like to think of it as Pulp Fiction-esque. Lots of little details packed into tiny scenes. However you also have to purchase lore rank up and to get a fuller picture of the story.\n\nYou have 3 main resources. GOLD, FACTION points, and CHARACTER points. Gold is used to buy weapons, lore, and lock in skill cards (more on this in a sec). Faction points are a pool spread amonst characters of the same faction. Character points are specific to each character. Both Faction and Character points are used to unlock skill-cards. You have 2 decks: a Faction and a Character deck. You can only equip one card into your loadout from each of these decks (so 2 cards basically). After you unlock all skill-card slots, you can pay a flat-rate to reshuffle all your cards back into the deck and try to redraw for rare or more useful cards. This is where locking in your cards comes into play. As of now, it costs 25,000 gold (about 5 games) to lock in a card. That card won't be reshuffled into the deck so you won't destroy a loadout doing so.\n\nEach character also has a weapon blueprint which is a random drop after a specific mission (as in each mission only drops certain weapons, and you might not get the chance to win a weapon). The thing is, there is only 1 pool of each reward and you can only choose a single pool. So 5000 FP, 5000 CP, and 5000 G between 4 characters. Two people are going to get shafted. If a gun shows up, then one person can pick the gun and it evens out. But if more than one person wants the gun, a roulette wheel spins and awards a random player. If you try to win the gun and fail, you earn nothing from the mission.\n\nCards have 2 major parts. Normal and Overcharged. Overcharged happens during a mission when a player collects 5 Aleph. One card might give you 90 Health after a melee kill normally but 220 extra if you have 5 Aleph. More on Aleph in the next section.\n\nCharacters have differing weapons, health, and abilities. Each character's ability is unique to them (hurp durp) but don't feel like rehashes of old ideas. You got a Jetpack guy, a guy who repels everyone away from him (and off cliffs), a chick who double-jump floats while raining shotgun shells down, another chick who doesn't need to aim but rather keep line-of-sight, etc. And the different guns and cards you combine can change up that playstyle. No one gun is better or worse than any other INHERANTLY. They have easier or more difficult playstyles to give players more options to make each character their own.\n\nA mission breaks down like this. INTRO CUTSCENE, ESTABLISHING SHOT, MISSION STARTS ==> You now have an arena to complete a certain object in. During this time, you will see 3 distinct kinds of enemies. Normal Gun Grunt, Special Grunt, and Aleph Whore Grunt. Each of these enemies are also distinct because of the different factions they represent. Wardogs have shotgunners for Normal Grunt, Aleph Sponges for Special Grunt, and \"Now I'm Invincible for 10 seconds and have murdered you\" for their Aleph Whore. Stage hazards are activated or manipulated by Special Grunts. Engineers will turn on defense systems or stop Cortez from hacking ship functions, Aleph Sponges will go up to a resource and absorb all the aleph before escaping, etc.\n\nAfter completing an arena, there's usually a Left 4 Dead-esque \"EVERYONE GET OVER HERE NOW\" moment where you gotta hold out while a timer ticks down. You might be crammed into an elevator with shotgunning wardogs charging you, or running up a spiral platform while Aleph Whores one-shot you. Simple and dull when said, but fun if you enjoy objective based games.\n\nThere are also boss fights that can be experienced (1 map is litterally 2 boss fights in a row). Finally there are Aleph based objectives. Okay, here's some meat and potatoes $#!t for you. 5 Aleph makes you Overcharged. However the only way to get Aleph is to Melee beat an Aleph Whore. You also need to spend aleph to complete objectives. So your group needs to maintain a dynamic on what is most important, trying to live while farming Aleph or trying to complete the objective as quickly as possible to max out end of mission returns. If you die via melee and have aleph, it goes to whatever melee'd you to death, possibly overcharging them (because it adds to their own pool of aleph). If you die via projectile, you do a crazy-ass explosion that will totally screw over all your teammates at the \"EVERYONE GET OVER HERE NOW\" zone.\n\nAs your character completes actions, they have an Aleph gauge that fills. When it crosses the little character paperdoll, everyone can see your character through walls. So you want to try to keep this bar down to get the jump on the bad guys. Bad guys have 4 stages of awareness:\n\n * Yellow Outline -- just farting around, oblivious to the world\n * Yellow Solid -- investigating something MGS style\n * Red Outline -- aware of you but currently doing something else\n * Red Solid -- currently trying to murder you\n\nThis all plays into Melee as well.\n\nMelee is broken into 3 moves: The Dodge, The Bash, and The Grapple. It's rock paper scissors with some nuances.\n\nGrapple is a delayed 1 hit kill. It makes a distinct noise, a red burst of energy shoots out, and if the target doesn't Bash, they get de-spined. You cannot dodge a Grapple. If two people Grapple, it is whoever pivots to the other first (usually whoever pushed Grapple first or have a more direct path to the opponite).\n\nBash is a near instant smack to the face that deals damage. It takes between \"some\" to \"a lot\" of hits to kill someone using Bash. You can Bash someone before they Grapple you. You can Dodge someone trying to Bash you.\n\nDodge is just some flip or roll your guy does to put distance between you and the enemy. If you Dodge near an opponite who can Grapple, yer gone. If you go in a solid direction for a bit, you begin to sprint. Dodging while sprinting makes you slide.\n\nSo if your opponite doesn't know you are there, you can grapple them pretty easily. But if they are paying attention, they can start bashing you.\n\nWhen getting your face bashed in, you got 3 options. Mash your own Bash button and hope they try to Grapple. Initiate a Grapple and hope they Dodge (for some stupid reason), or Dodge and hope to god they didn't predict that and initiate a Grapple.\n\nSo the game kinda turns into figuring out each player's playstyle and tactics, then adapting to them. One guy will be all about getting close and grappling, another guy will Bash once and then immediately grapple (cuz yer gonna dodge, right?). People whine about the 1 hit kills but that's because they don't play with Stealth or their character's powers.\n\nOverall, gameplay is diverse and follows a tried and true formula. It gave me the same feelings I had when playing Left 4 Dead 1 when it first released. Playing with a few friends and few random folks, no real voicechat, teamwork was essential. When things clicked, it felt so satisfying. And when things fell apart, you grew frusturated and raged. Dude... this game feels like Left 4 Dead in terms of teamwork.\n\nOh, and sometimes another player can jump in to wreck yer shi-", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 319, "steamid": "76561197988780878", "playtime_forever": 1599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1599, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1507193558}, "recommendationid": "35415682", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502672", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1506952019}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506207097, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This game is rather addictive,lets hope some updates patch out some issues.\nBut man is this game fun\n\nIt takes a very long time to find a match at the moment ,shame because this game could be something special .", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 175, "steamid": "76561198087967240", "playtime_forever": 1359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1359, "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1506852219}, "recommendationid": "35165732", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502786", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506598002}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506771180, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Awesome game, but it definitely needs more people playing it.

Things should be hard to unlock, otherwise people burn through the game too fast.\n\nGreat art style too, its what brought me into this game.\n\nBut oml please fix the matchmaking.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 354, "steamid": "76561198024721799", "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 246, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1506818329}, "recommendationid": "35166477", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506292459}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506924416, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "If you're looking for a game like Tom's Clansy The Division or Ghost Reacon Wild Lands that you have to have and need and will have to play with 4 other players in order to achieve or unlock what you like, then yes this is your dream game for me worth the price, you'll get 4 adventure plus the Raiders. But, pay attention here. If you do not have a huge network of gamers friends (like me) don't even try it really. You have 4 dificulties, easy, medium, hard, and very hard. For you to costumize your weapon, skins ect you need to earn in game money which you earn depends of the dificulty you play just once, if you play the same mission again you wont earn anything unless you escalate the dificulty. In easy and medium is a cake, you'll get that little money easy, hard and very hard you're very screwed because it is impossible without a team so this is my review. I can't recommend this game because it is not playable as a single player. My message to the developer is please stop forcing the gamers to play in teams in order to achieve, unlock and collect everything in the games, team playing should be optional.
