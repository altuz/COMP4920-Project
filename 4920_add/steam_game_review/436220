Like that game and the VIVE, this was kind of a first party game for the OSVR headset, which I find interesting. Likely to go on sale alot and be a steal for $2.49. Compared to SPT, everything is a bit more alien though. It's got almost the same level of graphical fidelity and visual quality, but the effects and overall presentation is just very flaccid in comparison. No offense! The sounds are weird, especially with the guns. They very much make a 'pew-pew' sound. The enemies are more like silly space invaders rather then the scary death robots of SPT.
