The game is a proper weightlessness space suit simulator. The storyline is very good. The graphics like for VR game are fantastic! The sounds and music are really good, too. \n\nI cannot compare the game to anything I have played before, this is just great.\n\nThe singleplayer is quite hard in the Astronaut mode, I have had to look for walkthrough once but managed to generally go ahead without any help.\n\nDo not drink or eat too much before playing this game, you have been warned! ;)\n\nThis is a must-have have for any VR owner of the supported headset which likes cosmos.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 118, "steamid": "76561197981120668", "playtime_forever": 631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1505072587}, "recommendationid": "34848866", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503194", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1504998897}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505230421, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Fantastic experience.  The first three or four times I played I really felt like I was gonna chuck, with a headache too. To combat this I started playing sitting down which helped quite a lot, restricted rotation (right-hand) to smaller increments and occasionally closed my eyes during the transition, particularly if the rotation was forwards and down. Finally, when I staretd feeling bad I stopped straight away, instead of trying to push through it (as was my initial response) and left it alone for at least an hour before trying again.\n\nBy the time I had played six or seven times the effects began to diminish and now (I still haven't quite finished the campaign) I get no ill effects whatsoever.\n\nI have read a few reviews where people said the sold-off Detached as soon as they started feeling rough. This is a shame as it's a beautifully crafted game with stunning scenery and atmosphere. Also unnecessary since, as I can testify, your body/brain will acclimatize over a relatively brief period.  Even (some) fully trained astronauts do the big space-spit when they first arrive in orbit, so give yourself  a chance.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 17, "steamid": "76561197996212738", "playtime_forever": 2954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 108, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506433117}, "recommendationid": "34903414", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505230421}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 11, "total_positive": 58, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 69}}
