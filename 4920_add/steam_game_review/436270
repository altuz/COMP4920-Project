There is nothing about the game that can justify to charge even 10 Euro for it. Sound, AI, graphics, game mechanics...all has been done better by games developed almost 20 years ago. The only saving grace the game has is the historical correctness, which I can't judge since I don't really care about that level of detail of the American civil war. Now, if your biggest interest is the battles of the American civil war, then you might find this very interesting.\n\nA pet pevee of mine is also when people can't tell the difference between strategy (which this claims to be) and tactics (which this is all about). Strategy in a game is stuff like recruiting units, carrying over units between missions, developing your army or lands in some direction.
