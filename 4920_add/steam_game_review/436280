You've got to be careful on adventure mode, as your tenth incorrect guess means you loe and have to restart.

Not much more to say other than that to be honest. \n\nBiggest issue is how you select a number. Instead of clicking on a box and a wheel coming up to let you pick which number to choose you have to push the number at the bottom then move to the squares you wish to place the number in. Doesn't sound to bad to some people, but when you are in adventure mode and you only get ten mistakes, it really messes you up when you are going fast. \n\nAlso, I'd probably wait for this to go on sale. $3- $4 maybe.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 256, "steamid": "76561198208078171", "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 185, "last_played": 1504929236}, "recommendationid": "33724466", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500740506}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 4, "total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 10}}
