As far as buying it to have fun with no hassles I wouldnt.  Sorry guys I really do appreciate the work thus far but the casual gamer would not forgive the glitches as of now.

Pressing Q doesn't do anything.. A map would certainly help.. I travelled to some other place and couldn't get back to continue my quest.. the pilot just disappeared and now I'm stuck in some other stupid place with nothing to do. I don't have a weapon so can't venture out from the base. As the game stands now I just can't recommend it until these issues are fixed.. especially the quest guidance feature which shows you some idea where to go. Another must have feature is to have key customization which is not implemented in the game yet. These are vital features which should already be included in a game even before an early access release. I'm glad I only paid a few dollars for this as it certainly isn't worth anything more in it's present state.

People you need to talk to have no indicator. Once I finally did find where to go I went and got a gun. That alone seems like it could be cool the weapon customization but then I got into combat and it was awful haha. I blame a lot of the issues I had on the idea that they went to steam to fast.
