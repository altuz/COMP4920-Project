If you at all remember that game, this is an updated version which as of review will get more updates in the future.\n\nThis is a very fun shootemup/twin stick shooter, The game has a very nice sound track with great sound effects that match the games simple pixel feel. The game play is a bit like robotron, use WASD to move and arrowkeys to shoot. The game has lots of different types of enemies, bosses, asteroid fields. All a lot of fun.\n\nThe cool thing about this game though is the actual Gamma Bros, the two main pilots you play as throughout the game. You can switch between them every now and then when one of them flies across the screen, which gives the game a sort of tactical feel making sure you use a different ship when one Gamma Bro gets low on health. Each ship has their own health, but powerups and new weapons are transfered over between the bros. If one of the Bros ship blows up, they will fly in a jetpack, you move a bit faster but have much less health. And if they die as far as I know they are dead forever.\n\nYou can also buy upgrades everynow and then when a little ship flies by, thats why I love this game everything is seemless with no menus as soon as you start the game your right in the action.\n\nThe game has a lot of potential to be better, I'm happy to see it being worked on and will get more content. And for the $5 price, if you love these kinds of games you'll get your money's worth. Great game.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 375, "steamid": "76561198039642906", "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1501903641}, "recommendationid": "25702445", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504104", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1474848127}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1464435471, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "I've played this game since my childhood, revisiting it every year or so to play it again, so seeing it in early access is wonderful.

I actually found this game when I was 9 or 10, when it was still a flash game on many small websites. I was amazed by it's shooter addiction and gameplay it had towards me, and immediately loved this game from the start. I was actually surprised when I found it on Steam, but not surprised because it's such a fun game. The graphics and music are really good and match the game up well. The plot's very simple, but intriguing with the Bros trying to get back to Earth. There's also a password system where you can go back to a previous point or get ships, which comes in handy when you have to leave your game or get a game over. Only thing I recommend is to make the game longer because it takes about a hour to beat without game overs in one run, but still has lots of replay value when it comes to playing different difficulties. A total recommendation to gamers looking for a good shooter to try, and especially because Pixeljam made Dino Run, another game I love. I hope Pixeljam continues to work on update 1.5 to make the game bigger, keep up the good work.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 20, "steamid": "76561198209318897", "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1486684307}, "recommendationid": "29805538", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1486702744}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1475935269, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "I played this game a very long time ago, and I can't wait for the full 1.5 to be released 100/10!!!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 9, "steamid": "76561198336501937", "playtime_forever": 4359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506274877}, "recommendationid": "25925869", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.496316", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1475935269}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1464623522, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Great little shooter game fun while it lasts and quite fair.
