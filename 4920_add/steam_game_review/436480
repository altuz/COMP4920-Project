Quite common in the gaming industry by the way. Moreover when I played this game, I really had no idea what was I doing or what was going on. In spite of this, I managed to win my first game! Achievement fanatics would love this by the way. Other than that, I can't recommend this game at its present state of development because content and dept is lacking.\n\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 5303, "steamid": "76561198002608541", "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 170, "last_played": 1498412272}, "recommendationid": "32781527", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.528131", "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_updated": 1498412612}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 6, "total_positive": 10, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 16}}
