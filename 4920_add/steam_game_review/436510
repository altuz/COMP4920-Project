There are no dialogs, quest givers or even much of a story at this point (something about destroying some corruption.)\n\nYour job is to explore with your party of five and kill camps full of evildoers. Along the way you'll find caves and buildings that when entered, will give you a quest that you complete within it.\n\nCharacter building and combat is defintely the focus. The leveling system has a ton of options, skills and spells. There are no set classes; any character can have any skill and wear any armor, but there are penalties such as heavier armor makes energy regen slower.\n\nThe comabt is real-time with no ability to pause. There is a \"tactical\" mode that is too slow for my tastes, and an arcade mode that is faster. I played in arcade mode with the combat speed set to 140%.\n\nThe loot at this point is limited to weapons and suits of armor, along with hp/energy potions and a resurrection item. \n\nI completed the game in about 7 hours. Again, this is the initial early access release in February, 2016. It will certainly get more content, but I felt it was worth the $10 price already if you like to explore and kill stuff. If you are looking for an engaging story and colorful character dialogs, this may not be for you (right now.)\n\n\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 932, "steamid": "76561198042628923", "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "last_played": 1483107246}, "recommendationid": "21256497", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.534748", "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_updated": 1455643180}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1469928710, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "review last edited 7/30/16\nAll in all an enjoyable game, it offers a 6-8 hours at the moment. There really isn't any story at this point in the game, there are quests, but they aren't quite fleshed out, as you only get these quests by walking to a certain point, you don't talk to any NPCs or anything. The only NPCs are in the starting village at the moment, where you can buy weapons, armor, and potions, rings, ressurection orbs, etc.\n\nThe only objective is to go around the world fighting anything you see with your team of five. Your characters you can make whatever you want, there are no set classes, so there is some replayability in that.\n\nCharacter customization is pretty weak at this point, you're going to have some trouble making each person in your team look different, and there are no female models, although the dev says that there are plans to add them in the future.\n\nWhether you want to buy this game now is up to you, I bought it at $10, (game is currently $12 now) which is reasonable for what it offers now and promises for the future. Hopefully this game turns out to be something amazing, and also hopefully gains some more popularity.\n\n-=Game Suggestions=-\n1) bigger map, also expand it more with the width so we can grind our team up on easier enemies (or just make enemies respawn after a time) to make battles easier near end-game.\n\n2) Better quests, I'd like to have some context, as simple as it may be, on the quests. Not just waltzing into a dungeon and being prompted \"kill the Spider Queen\". Maybe you could have an NPC outside tell you something like \"the spiders are taking over the countryside! If you could go into that cave and kill the spider queen, we would feel a lot safer. Of course you will be paid, 2000 coins precisely.\"\n\n3) More customization and better controls, there should be a Q,E to rotate your camera, sadly, there isn't at the moment so dungeons can be very obstructive. There is a great variety of items, skills and spells, no problems with that, but there needs to be more character customization. Just to give characters some more depth other than just being the players'  pawns to control.\n\nAlso for some sort of a P.S. The EA \"what the developer says\" may not be very accurate atm.  I doubt the game will be done by early 2017 considering what progress has been made in the last 5 months for the game, the review written in february basically describes what the game is now aside from some graphical tweaks. I also have not seen any polls, could be wrong, but I haven't seen any.

I like the idea of the open world fighting, But the combat system is a little to slow even in the fast game mode. It seams like they dont attack when you click on them takes anywhere from 10 seconds to 15 after you chose witch guy to go fight what monster. Other than that its been pretty fun. Not worth the price they ask should be a $5-$10 game MAX.
