Honestly, this doesnt compare to any of the other two games in any way.\n\nMechanics are exactly the same except for a new chain art which is completely unecessary and more novelty than anything. The main story is very sparce and you literally get miniscule crumbs until about 3/4 of the way through where the MCs actually start talking about their past. The logic of the \"new world\" that is the whole game makes absolutely no sense and is completely different to the logic in their \"real world\". The main path is completely linear, with the side stuff just simply flashbacks regarding certain characters. That concept is nice and all, but it's unecessary, all novelty, add tiny pinches of extra character, and literally doubles the play time. \n\nThe stakes of the final boss and ultimate quest seem very small compared to the other two games, mostly because you never really see the effects of what will happen to the real world should your party fail.\n\nThe maps and locations are mostly taken from the other two games with minor tweaks to their layout, mostly with no change whatsoever. Music is also mostly the same, with i think only 2 new tracks (which are still really good like the rest of the soundtrack). The main path is actually so straightforward that you know, and the characters in the game know, exactly of what's gonna happen at which specific point, even up until the very end. \n\nIn the end, this game does what it's originally intended to do, to provide slight closure to the characters in the other two games while expanding the story of Kevin Graham. However, as a Trails in the Sky game, this entire game is completely unecessary since the second game ended pretty cleanly. In the end, I cannot recommend this game mainly because at least half of it is really just a gimmick telling tiny bits of story that happened right after the second game.", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 170, "steamid": "76561198039917023", "playtime_forever": 2014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1505117618}, "recommendationid": "34913906", "votes_down": 19, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.478134", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1505281795}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 8, "total_positive": 222, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 230}}
