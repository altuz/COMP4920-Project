Once she escapes she must survive and also find out what is going on inside and outside of the arctic base. That's about all I'm going to say without spoiling anything else about this game.\n\nYou will have to survive and live as long as you can while figuring out the mystery of the arctic by investigating and reading left behind journal articles. You also have to take care of her by showering, eating, drinking, using the bathroom, etc. \n\nAll in all this game is pretty unique and a really nice change from playing AAA games. The only cons I have for this game is the english translation can be better and there's a game crashing bug where if you try to change into the jacket outfit, the whole game goes on but the screen is all black. Do I recommend this game? Definitely worth a try and it's price is really low (even better if you buy it when it goes on sale).", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 913, "steamid": "76561198121927012", "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 129, "last_played": 1496022074}, "recommendationid": "32068864", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502862", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1496169905}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 4, "total_negative": 13, "total_positive": 7, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 20}}
