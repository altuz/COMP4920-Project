C'Mon, the green and red tanks?\nIt is not the same. It employs some of the same mechanics but what it's really missing is that huge map where you and the other player are trying to find each other and then destroy each other. Here the maps aren't really large enough to allow for that. Here the mechanic has to do with tanks as disposable baddies, which works well to its own advantage. The game does have a solid amount of content and seems fair at $4.\n\nThat said, it is a nice, well-made game.

I really enjoyed it a lot! So far I've beaten the campaign and I must say it's quite a challenge! I find some of the bosses pretty tricky to beat but I like their design! The graphics are pretty decent! It's like you guys took the original Battle City and ramp up the graphics, music, and gameplay up to 11!  I also love the upgrades and those pick ups! There's a lot of variety with each new level and the customization is really cool! I recommend this game to those who love those classic games like Battle City and Tank Force! I'm currently doing survival and see how far I can get! I'm also looking forward to the customizeable level editor! That would be so cool! It would be like the classic Battle City!
