Because you cannot save in the middle of a battle, you cannot undo, and because battles can last a very long time, you can see where the occasional frustration comes from. But, I have to add, it is a rare bug: maybe once every 6 hours of play.\nThere are a few \"quick wins\" that the developer hasn't added yet to the game, and I hope will be added soon: multiplayer, and a choice of difficulty levels: as it stands, each level is fairly easy to pass at the first attempt.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 54, "steamid": "76561198034733683", "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "last_played": 1465163562}, "recommendationid": "22635527", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503681", "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1462908442}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1462465503, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Turn based strategy game that looks great in VR.
