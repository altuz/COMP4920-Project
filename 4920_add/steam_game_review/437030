I wasn't sure what to expect going in, but upon finishing I was left with a feeling of amazement. The developer has really worked some magic; weaving a deep, emotional story, utilizing simple mechanics in challenging ways, and creating a lush and vibrant environnment from simple means.  \n\nThis is the most difficult game I've played this year. Death is around every corner, plenty of \"bad ends\" to encounter. Near the beginning, I wanted to give up in sheer frustration several times (so happy I didn't)--but I always found myself coming back and trying again. There are no healing items, and you have only a few hitpoints to last you throughout the game itself. Seems harsh, but it feels right. As I played on, I wouldn't have it any other way. This game encourages you to learn from your mistakes and put thought into every move you make. There are no unimportant decisions, everything has an impact. Sometimes...you choose wrong, and you are helpless (or dead). Lends a sense of weight and realism to the survival aspect of the game. Making it through to the end feels like a real accomplishment. \n\nOne of my absolute favorite things about the game is in its design. MEMENTO probably has some of the most original enemy designs I have ever seen. I love the juxtaposition of the organic and the military. The cutscenes, although brief, are breathtaking in their simplicity. With several endings and secrets to discover, there's replayability. MEMENTO has a style entirely its own. I am already looking for more from the developer, and I can't wait to see what comes next!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 300, "steamid": "76561198173569365", "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "last_played": 1502550377}, "recommendationid": "34257361", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.515169", "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1502808468}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "total_positive": 5, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 7}}
