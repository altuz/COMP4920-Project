I find the shooting from the ship FUN and the flying fun, but a little to easy.  Ship doesn't float, and you can't move one way and rotate and shoot behind you while traveling in the same bearing.  Then to \"DRILL\" you click a button and the ship  \"AUTO MOVES\" in to drill. I'd rather have a cross hair appear and have to maneuver the ship into place to drill.  So it's lacking some of the game finesse I'd like to have seen included.   One other things like other games - (why does it FLASH out to VR background?) I find that really irritating.  SURELY they can make it fade to title screen or black...  I keep thinking I've crashed out of the game. \nI've completed a couple missions - it was fun, but  VERY easy...  \"what I mean by a walk through\".  I'd really love to see a bit more complexity.  Still one of the most polished games so far. I'm tired of buying all the crap. I now have restraint... and will wait for the quality titles.\n\nGET IT - but don't expect a lot of excitement, challenge or acrade action.

I had high hopes for this game. However a game breaking glitch prevented us from continuing after the 5th mission or so. That was not what made me change my mind though, the fact is the devs responded and fixed it in a timely manner - which was great! \n\nHowever, upon continuing to play once the glitch was fixed, I would realise the shocking fact that that mission was in fact the FINAL mission of the game which abruptly ends on a cliff hanger with a \"To be continued\" message.\n\nI don't know if it was intentionally glitched to hide that fact or not. But what I do know is that this game that costs $20 only lasts less than 2 hours. Note that my time is just above 2 hours, but I spent a good portion of that replaying the last mission trying to get past the glitch before it was fixed.\n\nEverything I posted in my previous review is still true, but I was under the impression that I had only seen a small portion of the game. It turns out I had seen about 95% of it.\n\nI am extremely dissapointed ... but recommend that you wait until this goes on sale to pick it up for around $5, because what there is is pretty good.\n\nsigh...\n\n\nMy Previous review.\n\nSolid gameplay backed up by a strong narrative component.\n\nTHIS is exactly the kind of game VR needs.\n\nThe voice acting is decent, the character models are passable.. but it actually puts YOU into the pilot seat AND in the briefing room. You get to follow the characters story while also flying around a space ship and blowing stuff up, mining asteroids and exploring deep space wreckage.\n\nThis game is the first step into taking VR from \"experience gameplay\" to \"story driven gameplay\" and it works beautifully.
