It's all the homages to 70's and 80's horror. From evil Dead to Little shop Of Horrors, to something that looks like Terminators on acid. There is a ton going on the the background to see as well.

There are a variety of weapons in the game, all with different pros and cons. Some do great damage and hit multiple enemies, but have a low durability, and things like that. The game is not quite that simple though. While trying to rescue 100 people(for an idea of how long that takes, in about 17 minutes I saved 23 people), you also have to watchout for rooms that have too many monsters in them. If too many monsters get into a single room, they will start destroying the room. You can only let 3 rooms be destroyed, because you lose if 4 get destroyed. The house itself is kind of a maze to try to get around, which adds to the challenge of the game. There are also some power-ups that you can get by rescuing VIPs. For example, I rescued an old lady in a wheel chair, and she gave me a power-up that instantly killed all of the enemies on my screen. Besides the house getting destroyed, you can also lose by dying, but that was probably obvious. After you fail, or win if you happen to be good at the game, you get your score placed on the leaderboards, so it can be a fun game for trying to beat a friend's highscore or something like that. There is no real story to the game outside of what is shown in the opening cutscene when the game is opened. Overall, the game is a lot of fun. Keep in mind, this was sort of a first impressions for me, and this is what I gathered when I first played the game. There may be more that I have missed.
