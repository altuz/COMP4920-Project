It's not the worst game out there but I can't recommend it either. It is supposed to be a puzzle game, however it fails to deliver good puzzles as most of them are just running around and interacting with everything. The most you are going to get is finding passwords which is easy because you do not need to figure them out yourself, they are simply given to you. There is a lot of looking around as sometimes the items aren't obvious at all. I had to look at the screenshots to actually figure out that I can get a candle. Most of the time you are clueless about what you need to do because the game does not point it out to you. It's like giving a pear to a baby and expecting him to turn it into a key and use it on a door. You get what I mean :P\nThere is barely any character development. We don't know much about even Ashley's personality. We know very little about Emily and his dad too, it's like they are just there to fill in the plot and nothing else. They don't feel real. But there are also some things that never get explained. For example, who is the lady with the blue hair? A friend of Emily? Another person the dad sacrificed? \nThere are also quite a few things in the game that never get explained. Why are there spirits in the house? Did some one die there before? Why are there weird places like a playground and a maze in the house? What about the ''He Watches'' message?\nThe mapping in the game was not too bad. Larger rooms were a bit empty and some tiles were used incorrectly, but overall it was pretty good. The art was pretty weird and looked like something in MS Paint(in cases like these I actually prefer games without custom art). The battles are way too easy. I was able to get past them just by mashing the attack button. Even though there were only 3(I'm sure there is more but maybe I noticed to avoid them)I still thought they could present a bigger challenge.\nThe game is poorly made in cases too. You can interact with things even when you aren't facing them and that seems to be a common bug in newbie devs' games. It's really really easy to fix. There are also unwanted options in the menu which the developer didn't get rid of, such as equipment. I feel like for a game that is planning to go commercial, the developers would at least bother to google how to do it. In fact there is a forum post with a tutorial on how to remove them and it's literally the first thing that shows up when you google ''rpg maker vx ace removing menu options''. There are even scripts to do it! \nThe story is not really anything too amazing or new. I won't spoil anything for you but just know that there are games with similar plots(ex: Dear Sister). And as I mentioned earlier in my review it does have quite a few plot holes too. \nThere was graphics clash since the developer tried to use realistic sprites and RTP together. One of the resource packs used is meant to be for taller characters so there were objects like beds 3 times the size of the player.\nThere were things I did enjoy in it too. The length was just about perfect(BE WARNED, the game takes 1.5 hours or so to beat. I know some people consider that short. I don't, but I thought I'd point it out)and the price was reasonable. I liked exploring different parts of the house and I liked the little secrets hidden around the place, like the teddy bears. \nOverall, I cannot recommend this game. While it could be a good first game it shouldn't be commercial. For the developers, try uploading some free games and getting feedback on them before going commercial. I heavily recommend Rpg Maker Net or Rpg Maker Web as there are a lot of rpg maker experts that would be willing to give feedback to help the game improve. This developer clearly has potential but needs to improve. I'm sure Episode 2 could be better since the dev will be getting feedback for this game.\nFor the dev: I'd be willing to help out too whether it's giving feedback or helping with eventing. I'm sure you will improve so please don't take my review harshly :)", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 273, "steamid": "76561198203340085", "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "last_played": 1455295663}, "recommendationid": "21162796", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504649", "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1455315456}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1456282321, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I have always loved puzzle games. This game makes you think and be methodical in solving the interconnected puzzles throughout the game. The graphics are carefully thoughtout to add to the atmosphere. It's tricky in some places and maybe a little too simple in others, but in a way, that makes you have to pay more attention to decide if you're missing something or not. \nThis is a pretty simple game, but I am enjoying solving the problems. It is well worth the little bit of money spent and I have a feeling it will keep me busy for a while. To me, that means money well spent!

The game is a horror-style one if you will, and is mostly puzzle-based but has a few RPG elements to it, such as the casual RPG fighting. The game stars a girl named Ashlee who gets invited to a party, but later needs to escape the house which the party took place, with everyone vanished and unable to help her. Only to discover the shocking truth behind who owns the house, and why souls are present within the house.\n\nI have just beaten the game as I'm writing this review. If you know about the other RPG Maker games \"Witch's House\" and \"Five Nights at F***Boy's\", you would say gameplay is like a mix between the two (Without the sexual themes of FNaFB, obviously). Most of the game is about solving puzzles within the house, and sometimes you'll come across a monster which you must fight and defeat RPG-style. So this game involves leveling up and gaining new abilities. But it's a bit cheezy how the minor combat feature mixes in with the major aspects.\n\nThis game MIGHT also be a \"Choices Matter\" type as I have been given feedback from the game after doing a specific set of actions. Such as taking an item only to realize I was accused of stealing it later in the game. But I'm pretty sure these choices don't matter as much as other games like Undertale.\n\nPeople were complaining that the game was poor for its puzzle solving, how it wasn't as difficult and convolluted as other puzzle games, which kind of make you think logically. But overall, this game is a pass for me. It's the kind of game you would expect from paying $2 for it, like something out of a dollar store.\n\nSTORY 6/10\nPRESENTATION 8/10\nGAMEPLAY 6/10\nVALUE 8/10\nOVERALL 7/10", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 76, "steamid": "76561198025184234", "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "last_played": 1474401258}, "recommendationid": "24185412", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1467994817}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1453758819, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "The game was def made on a old engine, but saying that this game is def a keeper.
