Melee doesn't feel clumsy anymore and you can see how much damage you make in numbers. The graphics got better and there are many new GUI elements.

(All of this was later nerfed and the game became way less meta based and a lot more boring and dependant on luck). \n- They later added another map which also was good for gameplay and worked quite well, it's unfortunate that they had to ruin the weapons and gameplay.\n\nCons:\n- There was a good base game, but once the devs had taken the core out of the game and reduced the game to about 4 weapons, the whole player base died, as did the game. \n- The Devs are really not the best, they reply on twitter ect, but I don't get why the rolled out an 'Update' which removed everything before the game was 'Revamped'. They have a test server, so you thought they would use it. This could've easily been a very fun competitive game if they had just used their resources better, and not ruined the gameplay to the point where nobody even is going to play since there isn't anything to do.\n\nConclusion:\nThis 'USED' to be a good game, but to be honest nothing will bring it back to what it was, the game is dead and I don't think anybody trusts the developers anymore since they already messed it up big time in the past.
