More focused, more \"quest helping\" stuff, like the map noting if there is some quest you already accepted and marking that point\n2. More game elements like finding stuff in the wild, doing various city-related missions, tasks, some are quite huge and have multiple endings\n3. Game is better paced with upgrades, xp and money, you feel like you are progressing constantly, but not too fast\n4. I BUILT A DARK BLOODY MUSEUM THAT WALKED AWAY AND I LAUGHED LIKE A DEMON\n5. I found the stories of the crew great\n6. THE PRINCESS WAS GUILTY AFTER ALL\n7. overall feels like SSea 1.5, it is like Ssea wih just a liiittle less quality on polish (train moves interestingly, 1-2 crashes), but more accessible content and gameplay wise I feel it is better\n\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 454, "steamid": "76561198016707912", "playtime_forever": 1219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1505939799}, "recommendationid": "35080529", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505899471}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505438614, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "If you don't like this game, you could quite possibly be a jerk.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 993, "steamid": "76561198005879531", "playtime_forever": 1741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "last_played": 1488771825}, "recommendationid": "34961395", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501614", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505438614}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 18, "total_positive": 91, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 109}}
