Its still a hard game though, I died a million times before I made it to the first Boss. \nThe Artwork, especially the Enemie design is realy good! Havent played far past the first boss (which looks awsome)(and again took me quite a while to get there) but I hope there are more cool enemies ahead. \n\nSo I can recommend this game to everybody looking for a not-too-easy Jump 'n' Run with a realy nice look and feel to it!\nBtw: I had some troubles with my controls via Keyboard when I first played, but it got fixed quickly! So thank You for that :)\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 30, "steamid": "76561197976554986", "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1466851978}, "recommendationid": "23750727", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505877", "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1466762135}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1466852359, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Fast gameplay, the dash move is cool and made some trick shots in certain levels.
