However, it also has lots of potential to be frustrating. The necessity to time and aim correctly with the constant pressure of time can get extremely annoying when you can nail the first 4 levels of a run yet the 5th and final one defeats you because you hesitated or you didn't flick the stick correctly and now you have to do the first 4 again with the same precision.\n\nNail-biting moments under pressure are great, but when the game thrives off throwing them at you constantly, you get overwhelmed - I found even with near perfect execution of the shortest path I was cutting it close on time, combining that with the oddity of the controls, you have a frustrating experience - you have to send the stick fully in one direction and then release it to neutral to fire, rather than aiming with stick and firing with a button, and if you think you've flicked and your character doesn't move it can be confusing.\n\nThere's also a small contradiction in that the game has moving platforms and other elements on cycles, like any other game, but much too often your timing is off by a fraction of a second and the twitchy action grinds to a halt while you wait for your opening to go. This is mostly a problem when you go as fast as you can through a level only to find that timing leaves you launching yourself into enemies rhythmically, forcing you to learn to add a quarter or half of a second to your time when necessary. That in itself can be kind of fun, but I personally find it jarring - especially when combined with the other elements of the game's design.\n\nThe game's visuals are colourful, vibrant, and fit the game to near-perfection. The use of a single dominating colour per world and the way the world gets progressively darker as you reach the later levels is classic good design and I love it.\n\nThe soundtrack is wonderful, too. It is top quality chiptune goodness, mostly pounding right in your ears helping you focus on your perfect timing and aiming. Possibly my favourite part of the game, if I'm honest.\n\nSo really, it might be mostly for the action junkies who want that constant twitch pressure, the VERY rapid iteration on your own skills and overall the intense challenge it provides. I enjoy the game, but not significantly. Given the price tag, I am happy to recommend it to people who think they're the sort who would enjoy it.\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 566, "steamid": "76561197992079037", "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1491069759}, "recommendationid": "30884133", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506483", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1491074350}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1483763307, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I really liked the mobile game.
