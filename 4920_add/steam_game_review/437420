It\u2019s definitely worth getting it if it\u2019s on a sale or a bundle. It\u2019s a direct sequel to the second game, so if you want to understand things better you should play Masked Intent first. \n\nI also found this sequel slightly better than Masked Intent. It also shares the same \u201cproblem\u201d too: the \u201cin game\u201d art is amazing, but the cutscenes are in a terrible quality.\n\n5/10.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 791, "steamid": "76561198120348301", "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 385, "last_played": 1505588457}, "recommendationid": "35137873", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.564802", "votes_up": 31, "timestamp_updated": 1506115071}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 3, "total_positive": 32, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 35}}
