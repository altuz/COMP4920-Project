I [i]tried[/i] to like this game (I like almost all puzzle games) and it says I played for two hours, but oh, it sure felt like longer: I found this game to be crazy boring! I did not find it challenging, as I spent most of my time pulling the screen around, trying to see which line on the grid my ball was in, and the rest of my time was spent going: \"okay... I tried up-up-down-right, so this time I'll try up-up-down-left.\" The only thing I liked on this game was the music. \n\nIt is not a [i]bad[/i] game, It's just one I did not enjoy.
