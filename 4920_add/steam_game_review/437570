Gameplay is very fluid, the pacing is fast. I wish there were more unlockable items though (spoiled by Binding of Isaac) and there was some sort of UI element for descriptions - some items I had to rely on research since trial and error didn\u2019t help.\n\nI also wished that the game had more of a length to it. I think it\u2019s short because the difficulty makes up for the game time. It was advertised as a very tough game, which it can be - sometimes I die repeatedly having not gone as far as I\u2019d like - but I felt it was so difficult that the challenge itself wasn\u2019t fun anymore. The repetitiveness of it got repetitive.\n\nThat said, once I got the hang of things and practiced a little patience, it was quite fun trying to beat my personal high score and advance through the levels. Enjoyed the bubbly art and animation, which were complimented well with the beats and sound effects. It\u2019s a fun game in short bursts.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 376, "steamid": "76561198041513425", "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1506227815}, "recommendationid": "35235344", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506486521}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 27, "total_positive": 189, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 216}}
