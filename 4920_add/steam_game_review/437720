After being sent into space with no viable option to return to Earth, the trio decide to work together to overcome their differences over 14 days in which Erica can develop a relationship with Kotoha or Sara and have a good or bad ending with.\n\nEach route will take approximately 30-60 minutes. Soundtracks, CGs and overall game presentation are good after factoring in appropriate background music for the futuristic space and romance themes in the story and animated sprites for each of the main characters. It would be nice to have an extras section featuring CGs and music gallery in the game. Recommended as a free to play visual novel for those who like a short yuri visual novel with light-hearted moments in-between or for those who like a short game to finish and get all achievements in less than 10 hours. Would be interested to see Galaxy Angels and further sequels with nice artwork and easy/reasonable achievements being released in future.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 2216, "steamid": "76561198006413390", "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 91, "last_played": 1505573327}, "recommendationid": "31420560", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.550644", "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_updated": 1493398991}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1}}
