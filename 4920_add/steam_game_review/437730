If you liked (or even heard of!?) Super Cars and Super Cars 2 this will be right up your street (see what I did there?).  The game takes the basic fun of old style arcade racing games and adds a whole bunch of modern elements such as analogue steering and throttle control giving the game more nuance than one would at first presume.\n\nThe game play is solid, the presentation is great and the developer is both active and communicative.\n\nHighly recommended and well worth the full asking price. :)", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 258, "steamid": "76561197970709231", "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1503404035}, "recommendationid": "34414610", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1503404472}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 10, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 11}}
