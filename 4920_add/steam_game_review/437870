With no direction other than \"place some turrets\" I spread them evenly around the map. Then enemy drop ships landed, and my turrets shot at them. The turrets completely missed their target, but they had no problem mowing down my entire colony with friendly fire (which I was given no warning to watch out for). It took hours to build, and only seconds to destroy. By the time I realized what was happening and thought to take control of my turrets, it was too late - I had too many turrets, and the whole colony is made of tissue paper.\n\nIt was a real grind to build everything up to the point I'd gotten to. Even if I reloaded my last save, I'd have to figure out how to place turrets to avoid crossfire and also manually control them for every attack. It's just too tedious. I'm honestly not sure how anyone could get through this poor design without saintly patience.\n\nDo I recommend this game?
