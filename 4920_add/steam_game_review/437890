Keep in mind, it's not for everybody. It really captures that \" old, sh*ty game\" vibe. Which I totally appreciate but can be rather daunting and drive you insane. Pretty casual. Lots of content. Lots of reading. I don't think it was originally written in English so the English is rather crappy, even game changingly so. I accidentally shot some dude which maybe was an unavoidable event but never the less it could not have been more confusing and vague. The interactions with aliens aren't very realistic social interactions and you can really tell that the developers... don't get out much.
