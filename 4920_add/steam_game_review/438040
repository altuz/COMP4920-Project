It is an international web browser and mobile game, so it will be populated with many other players. This game is translated into many languages, so there will be many Non-English reading players.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok, was understandable.  It is light on resources used, so it will be runnable on any computer.\n\nHas funny quest text and gear descriptions.  The artwork is cartoony and funny. Has varied weapon sounds. Has some animation.  Has a manual and official wiki in english.  Pretty Easy to play.  \n\nThe level cap is 550, but it will take you long time to reach it, very TIME consuming game.  (At my current hours, i have a 149 scout and 135 warrior)  Quests and other things take an amount of real time to complete or cooldown reset.  More time you put into it, the higher you climb on the leaderboard.\n\nMushrooms are the store currency, but you can earn some from quests rewards and gambling.   Some gear cost mushrooms, but you might find the same and better later for gold only or quest reward.   You can spend mushrooms to skip waiting on timers or add time to questing endurance and the best mount.   There is hourglasses that you can buy with gold for skipping the travel time on questing.\n\nIt has PVP and PVE.  It is RNG combat where better stats and gear will give you some edge, but RNG is a fickle goddess, you still can lose to bad rolls. Difference in Level between you and target is a factor of success. You can make 2? characters per server, picking one of 3 classes ( warrior, mage, scout).  Has an PVP Arena where you have a choice of 3 players to attack for gold, honor and xp.\n\nYou can raise your all your stats with gold and use potions to temporary improve a stat.   Gear you can buy or get from quests can now be modded in the blacksmith shop and in the tavern watercloset. At level 75, you can collect Pets that improve your stats and you can fight other players pets. There are many other things that you can do to improve your stats.  \n\nIt has 31 dungeons you can unlock and raid.    Finishing Frost Blood Temple Dungeon, you unlock The Tower which gives you three companions (Mage, Scout, Warrior) to raid with through 15 harder dungeons that unlock with the Tower.  You have to outfit your three companions with gear to improve their stats.  But ends up having to wait for your level to catch up to the dungeon level.\n\nYou can make your own fortress, with some buildings that improve your character and other building for protecting your fort or raiding others forts.  You can raid other players forts for resources and pour your gold in to defending your fort.   It has Guilds and guild wars, where guild members all attack other guilds or defend from other guild's attacks.  Guilds have stuff they can build that increases gold and xp gain for guild members.  But above level 25 guild upgrades require someone that Buys mushrooms.  You can increase your guild level also by completing guild house raids. \n\nThe 17 plus servers are located in Europe somewhere (Central Europe time zone).  Devs keep adding more servers, which pulls active players from the established servers.  Leading a guild is easy but hard to get enough active dedicated players to reach the very top of the guild leaderboard.  Make several accounts with 2 characters on same server then make your own guild and put all your own alts in it, then don't bother with recruiting other people to guild.  \n\nTry it, maybe you might like it.  You can play this game for free, and it keeps you busy serveral hours a day.\n\nFor more info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxB3akHTwk\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09uN1BUHlN8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CySxFXxiPk\n\nhttps://mmos.com/review/shakes-and-fidget\n\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/forums/pc-mac-linux-society-1000004/shakes-and-fidget-27249202/\n\nhttp://www.mmosquare.com/games/reviews/shakes-and-fidget\n\nhttp://www.gamingobserver.com/shakes-and-fidget-pc-review/", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 100, "steamid": "76561197982295752", "playtime_forever": 66025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 558, "last_played": 1505072261}, "recommendationid": "29763502", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.518237", "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_updated": 1492272073}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1487723509, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "[h1]Intro[/h1]\nPlayed this for about 7 years now.\n\nThis is like a diablo game without having to do the grinding manually.\n\nInstead, you send out your character on a quest using your limited energy per day, have the game running in the background and when it's done, you collect your xp/gold/whatever else dropped. Even the battles (there's one at the end of each quest for example) are automated and you can choose to skip them (they are decided by stats and some randomness - blocking, dodging, critical attacks, damage ranges etc.).\n\n[h1]Warning[/h1]\nThis game is pay to win. But at the same time, I'm actually not bothered by this. Let me explain. In this game, there is a currency called mushrooms. You can actually get these randomly for free, but not enough to buy all the extra energy you can each day. More energy means you can do more quests and if you can do more quests per day, you will level up and increase your attributes faster. But you also have to put more time into it. The energy you are given is enough to take a couple hours each day (of course, again, mostly having the game running in the background while doing something else), so even if I could, I definitely wouldn't spend more time than that every day. That would just burn me out.\n\nAlso, the progression of others might as well be irrelevant to you if you're not too bothered about leaderboards. There are plenty of other things to do in this game other than straight up pvp.\n\nThe other uses of mushrooms aren't all that important and don't really give much of an edge in pvp.\n\nAs a last note, there is a special \"donatable\" version of mushrooms, which are needed to donate to a guild. There didn't use to be, but now there is a way to get these for free as well (though the regular drops don't count). I would assume (seeing as I have over 360 of these myself), that if everyone in a guild chips in with these, this isn't an issue at all.\n\n[h1]Notable pros[/h1]\n+ Over the years, the game received and continues to receive big updates. I'm talking entirely new features that add more and more layers of what you can actually do in this game, like the fortress (building a base, attacking other people's bases = new leaderboard entirely), pets (which you have to find first, you level them up and use to fight other people's pets), etc. Usually I'm just content doing my grinding and progressing dungeons and other stuff, but whenever one of these is announced, I'm legitimately excited.\n\n+ You can play it on your phone (using your PC account), so that you don't miss your day's grinding if you're away or something. Or there's also the browser version, which came originally, for when you don't want your friends to know you play this and stop talking to you (jk).\n\n+ No limits. Technically, there is a level cap (500), but I don't think anyone in the world hit that yet and it could get increased like it did once (I play on one of the oldest servers). You can increase your stats for gold to infinity, get better equipment, gems, etc. Basically, there really isn't an endgame to this. The dungeons and bosses in these are static, not randomly generated btw. and I think nobody has beaten them all yet. There's always some next challange you're looking to beat.\n\n[h1]Notable cons[/h1]\n- P2W (see Warning section for more explanation) - you're gonna hit that top 10 pvp leaderboard only if you have more money and time than god. Even if you don't care about that, you're going to progress dungeons slower.\n\n- This game is repetitive. Duh. Like every game about grinding. You're gonna do your set of daily chores (and by now there's a lot, but you can do them simultaneously - while questing, spin that wheel of fortune, get those arena and pet battles done etc.) and then usually be glad that's done.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 229, "steamid": "76561198027939772", "playtime_forever": 70793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1490134285}, "recommendationid": "30090044", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.518637", "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1487780120}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485216700, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Seeing the game has rather positive ratings I decided to look into.

I hope it doesn't notice this review as I rather not take advantage of that ?feature?. I find the game to be rather good. It has its glaring issues. The fact they think rewarding someone for leaving a good review is a good idea is just one of them. \n\nIt has the sense of being a mp game. Though there is little actual player interaction possible. I enjoy the small level that is possible and find I interact with other players much more then I do in other games. Taking part in the pvp, guilds, etc. Which I skip in most the other online games I've played.\n\nThe pay model seems to be pay for convenience. As all I have seen that they accept realy world money for is to buy a currency in game called mushrooms. Mushrooms are given in game as well. There are even weekend events where every other quest rewards randomly adds a mushroom. The mushroom can be used various ways in game. Though the game has other currencies that it uses for things. Mushrooms don't replace those currencies. They might be added to them though, from time to time. There are a few things that can only be purchased with mushrooms. From what I have seen though those can all be gotten just by not playing the game for a extended period of time. As timers will take into account when the game is not running that is a valid option that I find myself using often.\n\nIt is best to play it while doing something else. As much of the game  involves waiting to be able to commit another action. I tend to play it while watching videos or playing other games that take waiting on.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with \"Shakes and Fidget\" is the stamina system. It seemes like I could do a ton of quest per day before I was worn out for that day when I was a low level. Now I am only level fourteen and can barely do a handful of quests before my stamina bar depletes. The only way I have found to refill the bar is to use mushrooms to regain a little stamina. That has a hard limit too. I can only use ten mushrooms a day for regaining stamina. Which means for the longest section of day I can't do quests.\n\nOverall I find it to be worth playing. I strongly recomend it to people that have very little \"free\" time. Especially if they are able to play this while they are doing other things they need to do.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 342, "steamid": "76561198026852985", "playtime_forever": 3718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1486231990}, "recommendationid": "29417491", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485213028}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485216258, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "how have i spent over 2 days on this. send help", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 2, "steamid": "76561198225810644", "playtime_forever": 9677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1491818827}, "recommendationid": "29452296", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485216258}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485306620, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Absolutely addicted to this game!
