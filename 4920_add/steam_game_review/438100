And also a bunch of social VR apps, incl. Altxxxxx, HiFi and some others. This one I have to say blows ALL these experiences out of the water - by miles!\n\nLet me see. Today, this Friday night...I have been in a giant show which was excellently done with anime dancers. I climbed about a mile up in the sky with some people and then we dropped down. I have been in some sort of anime/game forest. I have been in a bowling alley which appeared very real, complete with 50s music and disco light :) I have been in a bar with about 20 people and a bar tender busy running around and serving drinks. I have been in an abandoned prison with scary ghosts, traps and all kinds of stuff. We have played games like CTF and we've been in an old Western town where we were the Sherrifs and shot some bad Bandit dudes :)\n\nA lot of fun also with people showing off their insanely creative avatars. I took my headset off later on and realized that I \"experienced\" more things in one single night than a normal person could ever experience in \"real life\" in a night, uh..a week or a month even. This is just frickin' awesome beyond words.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, the avatars are excellent and VRchat even allows making and importing your own from Unity. Lip sync, eye tracking and all. Some of the best avatars I have ever seen. The entire system seems polished and runs smooth.\n\nVRChat must have hundreds of \"worlds\" including games etc. to choose from since you can browse them for an half an hour and still didn't see them all. This is crazy. Uh, that being said people can also design their own worlds and games and put them in there. Possibilites: Endless. MIND. BLOWN.\n\nAnd the people are ALL extremely friendly and supportive etc.\n\nThis is VR as good as it can get with TONS of fun and infinite things to do.

For the most part, the game has been a good experience, with some very nice people who don't mind helping you with uploading avatars and making rooms, etc. There are games and different worlds to visit but this is mostly a social game.\n\nVR headsets are not required, but one of the games will need the VR headset. There's a tenpin bowling game, this is a casual game where you can just walk in and play at anytime. Another game has you bouncing a ball off walls in a small arena so that you can hit the other player to knock them out. You are also equipped with shields. This one seems the most interesting out of the bunch, but it requires a VR headset.\n\nThere is also a basketball court where you can try to get the ball into the hoop, not easy. There is a baseball game but i've not seen anyone play it yet.\n\nThere is a wild west type First Person Shooter and a few other similar ones, they are fun but it's better with a VR headset i would imagine. Right now the mouse controls are too sensitive to play, but you can still play.\n\nThere are a few rooms that have pencils, which you can use to draw in mid air, neat.\n\nMost rooms have youtube video interaction, you can search for videos to play or just listen to the default playlist. There's a bug where it sometimes automatically changes the video back to the default ones. It would be good if you could select playlists to play while searching. As of now the music automatically plays it's own playlist set by the room creator.\n\nIt's begging for a chat box, it doesn't have any kind of chat function at the moment. That is my main problem with it, since i don't really like to use a mic.\n\nIt's in Early Access but is 100% free, you wont be charged for avatars, rooms, or anything else. To create a room or avatar you need Unity, it takes a while to learn, i recommend watching VRPills tutorial video. Some kind of avatar sharing would be nice to have in future, but for now there is a selection of default ones and the ones you can create with Unity.\n\nInstalling is easy, the game downloads each room seperately so no lengthy download times. When the creator of a room updates the room it has to be downloaded again, but that is only a mild issue, and mainly effects those with poor download speeds.\n\nAs a whole, i think this social game is pretty good, i've played games like Second Life, Google Lively, and a few others, none of them impressed me as much as this one has.

I send nights just chilling with devs 1 on 1 or with others, There the best I have only meet VRPILL,Mechlaid,Kirito,Gunther, Somewhat Violet. There the best I got to say I'm telling you once you play this you won't ever need to play another game. Honestly I'm not plainning on playing anymore games or buying anyothers.

I do have to say I'm only on desktop as of now, But even if I am I'm having loads of fun talking etc. A few things to note there updating the game constintly adding new things, Avatar Creation and World Creation very tricky and complcated I don't recommend you try to make one right away if you never dealt with, Unity,Belnder,Maya,Cinmea4D cause you will be very confused. Though there are videos online that can put your mind set in the right direction taking you someone step by step. But you could always ask staff,devs etc for help even people with avatars already, But keep in mind even if they have avatars they may or may not know hwo to help you. Its still pretty difficult to make one. But what really put this game on the top is its open source anything within the games rules is allowed I say ask the devs what your planning before doing so. The hub consintly being checked on , Also this is a E for everyone game so keep in mind its for kids also. So in the hub you got watch what your saying my first day in the game someone got banned for loads of not okay words to say if you get my drift.
