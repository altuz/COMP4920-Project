It's made in a way that it can generate most of your CV through your Linkedin, which you can afterwards change, add or remove stuff manually. However, the program lacks one fundamental feature that is a must for a CV to be good, and that is the ability to add a picture of yourself. I was a bit dissapointed discovering this feature, hence I couldn't really use the CV I made for anything really, as I want a good CV, not just a decent CV.\n\nTo be fair due to the lack of that fundamental feature, you could've found CV coversheets where you can easily fill in your information, add picture etc. online, instead of spending money on this program which does give you a lot of simplified features etc, dont get me wrong, but a photo is almost a certain most for a CV, really.", "comment_count": "19", "author": {"num_games_owned": 232, "steamid": "76561198009369351", "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1490126949}, "recommendationid": "23419785", "votes_down": 29, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.516199", "votes_up": 38, "timestamp_updated": 1465227204}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1}}
