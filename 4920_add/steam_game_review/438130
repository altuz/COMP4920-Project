[i]At least if you are interested in story.[/i] Relatively setting, I think, I shouldn't repeat description entirely, but try to remark the merits instead.\nThe plot is narrated through several (mostly the featured two) protagonists, revealing it from multiple angles, that are good at supplementing each other if you read the roots at alphabetic sequence. Not all of them are equally good, moreover some are written supplemental intentionally. Story isn't complicated enough to dumbfound reader completely, but it manages to keep tension and intrigue well. Lots of details come in engrossing rate together as parts of exciting aggregation.\n\nWithout spoilers I could say, that SF part is rather hard and thorough. Especially the first chapter is laden with plethora of such details, for multiple facts even an ingame encyclopedia is given. Also in game's setting [spoiler]telepathy[/spoiler] somehow resembles Rifters trilogy without marine attributes. \nSomeones might disagree, but I'd like to say that featured SSSystem, which around gameplay is built, is good at making choise input more subtle, than ordinary line picking (but also can complicate branching).\n\nVisual style is typical for mikeou and is rather unexpected to be found in non moe vn. Contribution of lip animations is substantial. In addition to them, sound is just perfect, voice acting of each character grasps after half a dozen phrases and represents it's owner individually. Accordingly, all characters are written to have personal speech habits and even with sound-off many lines are good at representing situation and mood. Moreover, disclosure of characters' individuality and their past, which define the story, provides reader with at least half of overall experience.\n\nAs a bad trait I could touch multiple narrative approach toward the same situations, that protracts seriously (esp. the extra episode, half of which can be easily put down), although, it also helps to memorize the story (or at least current chapter) wholly and, since the skip option is present, it's not significant in repeated reading.\nConsidering the plot, majority of bad endings aren't important, but they end up with narrative impasse quickly after wrong choises, hereby this flaw could be considered as just a method to create atmosphere of danger. Besides, some plotholes are represented [spoiler](Like Kazami not using corpses in one of normal D endings)[/spoiler], but in compare to overall volume of text and routes their number is small.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 53, "steamid": "76561198150183370", "playtime_forever": 5198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 674, "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1506795485}, "recommendationid": "34868220", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506963977}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "total_negative": 3, "total_positive": 62, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 65}}
