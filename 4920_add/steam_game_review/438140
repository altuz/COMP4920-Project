If you're looking for a quick way to get familiar with cards and strategies, there's none better than jumping into the deep end with this game. By the time you've played through a few campaigns, you'll have gotten an excellent feeling for the \"flow\" of the game and you'll bust through your RL games with no problems. \n\nBut avoid the hard campaign mode, for god's sake. What turned out to be difficult missions in the normal difficulty setting mutate into unwinnable nightmares. Just about the only way you can win some of them requires the hand of god to descend from heaven and bless your chances of turning up the precise cards you need, whilst sabotaging the AI opponent at the same time.\n\nWhy, let's start a match off. Terrific, I start with two vipers and one scout and can't buy jack while the AI strolls into the trade row with pocketloads of money. Oh, you really needed that card there? Well guess what, the AI is forcing you to discard one of your scouts and now you can't afford it. Oh great, the AI just bought that card to MOCK you. Now it's discarding its own cards and buying EVERYTHING you wanted. Phew, the cards just got freshly reshuffled, perfect and clean.... God damnit, all the ones you need to use NOW are at the bottom! Oh no, now the computer is synergizing... sweet mother of god, the synergizing... and by the time you're even remotely close to a hair's breadth of winning, the AI grabs you by your skull and piles on thirteen thousand damage points and you're throwing your computer against the wall.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 116, "steamid": "76561198005486812", "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1486208776}, "recommendationid": "29849606", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1486825565}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1488298367, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I learned of this game on Tabletop Simulator, and ever since, I have been in love with it.
