Definitely would be a good time sink with some sort of map creator and some refinements.  I think there should be some sort of visual indicator when the GLS can attach to an object on the cursor and maybe the cursor itself should be a bit larger.  Also some music would keep levels more interesting.  More visual variety in levels would be cool too (Maybe a small city to swing around as a throwback to the old Spiderman games or some supersized jungle).  And a level to dick around in would really be great so players could get good without resetting over and over.\n\nBy the way, thanks for sharing your game awhile ago anon.  I didn't even realize it came out until I checked your YT channel recently.\n\nEDIT: GLS is actually really fun to dick around with, but I feel that the push ability is slightly useless.  It helps when I'm swinging around like crazy, but other than that I feel like the maps are designed to favor the pull function.\n\nThe thrust is REALLY fun and useful for dodging enemies and for moving around more open levels like Location 3 and 4 and for making tight maneuvers with the GLS.  I didn't realize you could use it with the GLS until I accidentally misclicked (Add this bit of info to the tutorial maybe?  I didn't notice it) and the thing turns the GLS into some psuedo catapult.  Really cool stuff.\n\nI haven't played Deathmatch yet (no servers), but the map is pretty fun to swing around.  I think it would be a little better if it were more open though and the pillars were spaced a little farther apart.\n\nSecond EDIT: The shield ability is a lot more useful than I thought.  If you're about to overshoot your targeted area, pop a shield in the direction you're launched in and boom.  No more flying.  Missed a grapple and don't want to reset?  Look down, pop a shield.  You won't fall for about 2-3 seconds.
