I got stuck on the second one because the only way forward was for me to use the wall climb mechanic and the game wouldnt let me. Even if I got past that and beat the whole game I suspect it would had just left me with a hollow feeling, this is a very forgettable title all around, with its most distinguishing features being the mustache - and some vague kill the sci fi baddie plot.

I bought it 2 days ago, so I'll judge it from my experience as of now.\nAlright so, starting off, I would like to mention the fact that this game was made with the Unity engine. It's really good for any kind of games, especially 2D.\nNow, the story of this game in a nutshell: A robot has been sent from Earth into a random planet. Then that robot causes problems against Earth, by enslaving the creatures of that planet and you, Mr. Mustache, have to stop this whole situation. The first level of the game seems very good. The textures and the level design are very good and the same counts for the Mustache guy (he has quite a nice style). The music of the game is pretty good, the same counts for most of the sound effects, except from one of them: the 1-up sound from Mario that's being used in this game. I don't really have a problem with it, since it's just a stupid sound, but it was a bit unexpected from a pay to play game. I usually see this sound effect in Mario online games. And now, let me go to (maybe) the most important aspect of the game that dragged me in even more into playing it: the difficulty. The difficulty in this game is actually really good. It's not too easy, but it's also not too hard. The game doesn't have cheap deaths (which are being used in video games sometimes) and the controls are quite smooth (well not the smoothest of all for me, since I mostly play 8-bit games on consoles, but it's pretty smooth). \n Overall, it's a game that I totally recommend as of now (I haven't played a lot as I said before). If I finish the game anytime soon, I'll probably change a few aspects of my review. Anyway though, I don't believe that you'll regret it if you buy it, especially right now that the price has dropped (only for 8 more days though). For 50 cents, you get a nice, difficult and fun 8-bit game with a weird guy with a mustache and the 1-up sound effect from Mario!", "comment_count": "3", "author": {"num_games_owned": 16, "steamid": "76561198316324161", "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1493464212}, "recommendationid": "31489992", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.485577", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1493654876}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 38, "total_positive": 85, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 123}}
