This game really got me thinking about timing and positioning for the future you to progress to the next level/area. Not only are you striving to complete the simple and challenging puzzles, but you're also helping/hindering yourself around each new corner.  \"Did I move to soon?\" As I thought to myself. \"Is this where I needed to stand?\".\n\nI game handles smoothly, a few graphical/texture bugs but not bad. Animations for the character could use a bit more work, in my opinion. Level design was unique and fluid, although I purposely tried to leave areas and got stuck (my own fault not the games).\n\nDefinitely a grab if you would like a fun game that makes you think ahead, albeit a little short for my taste.

It's finally done, and it's very good. It's a pure puzzler about rewinding time and cooperating with recorded versions of your past self, which is a mechanic that's been explored before but never in quite this much detail. It's shorter than I'd like, but it's not too short (4 hours for me, which I think is probably pretty fast because I already knew how to do a lot of stuff.) It's pretty hard. I haven't done the time trials yet, but I might. They look interesting.\n\nA word of warning, however: the puzzle solutions in this game require precise execution.

The puzzles are easy to medium difficulty and the entire game can be finished in 4 hours or less. But they were a lot of fun. There are other puzzle games involving creating your own clone but this also involves a time travel aspect, kinda, that makes it a lot more enjoyable. \n\nThe game has a portal-ish feel to it. Just like Portal, your goal in each level is to reach the exit. You need to figure out how to reach the exit level. For that you clone yourself and use the clone to help you get there. But you can't interact with the clone. The clone repeats exactly what you did the first time. The puzzle solving happens in 3 stages. First, you figure out what needs to be done to go through the exit. Then you need to figure out which version of you will do what. Finally, you execute your plan. I love the endorphin rush when my plan works out like it should, sometimes it might need a couple of tries to get things perfect, and I finally reach the exit. \n\nIf you like puzzle games I highly recommend it, especially if it's on sale.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 394, "steamid": "76561198244563482", "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "last_played": 1482216810}, "recommendationid": "28493571", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502653", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1482268158}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1459875397, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Mind bending puzzle game using clones to solve stages.
