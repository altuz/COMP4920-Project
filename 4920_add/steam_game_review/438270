This would be fine, if it were not for the very poor choices in fonts which don't even remain consistent in the game, switching between caligraphy styles and more web-safe fonts.\n\nOther than that, having to 'kill' each character repeatedly over the course of the game is a solid way of giving the player the chance to memorize each character's associated sound. The game also provides minor side lessons on actual words which help show how the characters would sound when pronounced together.\n\n[b]As a game[/b]\nThis is where everything falls apart. You have to REALLY enjoy retro JRPGs to wade through this incredible mess.\nThe game is blatantly a very poor RPG maker product, including all the out of the box issues with no added quality of life enhancements.\nMoving around is a pain, everything looks bad visually, battles are incredibly tedious and frustrating, the game demands you grind for levels, and worst of all: Featureless maze based dungeons.\n\n[b]Together[/b]\nThe issues [i]Learn Japanes to Survive! Hiragana Battle[/i] presents as a game, seriously hinder the quality as a learning tool. The point of a learning game is to make learning interesting and fun, and this game did not do it. Battles were the main flaw, though wandering through empty mazes  while being battered with random encounters helped bring everything down.\n\nThe idea of the battles was fine. Fight hiragana characters by attacking them with the matching sounds. This was a good idea. The issue a culmination of having a long list of sounds to search through everytime you want to hit something, not being able to click directly on the character once you have the selected sound, then having to do this for each member of your party even if there's not enough characters to go around, possibly multiple times during the battle if you're not strong enough to kill the characters in one hit,  and then waiting for the battle to play out.\n\nIt would have worked much better if each fight was always 4 characters lined up, one for each party member, selecting the sounds for each, and then having it all go down at once with one-hit kills. Incorrect selections would of course result in party members taking damage, and any surviving characters would need to be attacked again, [i]but only by the party member they were lind up with[/i].\n\nHell, even a fast forward button for combat might have made it a less mind-numbing experience.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 595, "steamid": "76561198055089474", "playtime_forever": 1473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "last_played": 1504608735}, "recommendationid": "34754269", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503989", "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1504610179}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506297261, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "As a Chinese student who speaks English and Chinese and is trying to learn Japanese this game is very useful to me.\n\nP.S.: Where is my sword keychain???

You have more battles than steps you take! (obvious exaggeration)\n\nCan't wait to finish up and get to the katakana game and i hope you bring out a kanji game as well!
