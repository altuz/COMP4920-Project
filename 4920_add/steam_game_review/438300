Shepherds of the Abyss on the other hand has delivered everything I have been looking for in a TD and more. While many games have abilities of some sort, they never really feel genuine, it feels like they were tossed in last minute before release, whereas in SotA you make up your own \"army\" consisting of some default creeps and your own Shepherds, these Shepherds all have special abilities much like DOTA/LoL and truly feel like they have their place. Items is also something SotA has done very well, you can buy items for your Sheps, some are active and some are passive bonuses, and they all feel very in-touch with the game.\n\nBut the part where SotA really shines as a bright star above all other Tower Defense games is in its mazing. The martial art of making your enemies walk the longest, most tedious path, through tight corridors of flame spitting towers and axe slinging statues. No competitor even comes close in this aspect of the game, some lets you block one route so the creeps will take maybe 10% longer to finish their run, in SotA you can make them walk five, if not ten times longer. And yet it never gets into a repetitive pattern.\n\nSotA is tower defense taken back to its roots.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 287, "steamid": "76561198033200742", "playtime_forever": 2449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1467556648}, "recommendationid": "23999067", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.525864", "votes_up": 21, "timestamp_updated": 1467413688}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1483861616, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Very disappointing game.

This could have been a good one. But..it just failed.\n\nIt has some aspects which *could* have worked well, such as the minigame where you can manipulate the upcoming wave's buffs. That's something new rather than just warning the player what sort of minions are approaching next. I'm not sure if it's very well implemented though, as most of the time all you are doing is reducing one buff that has an extremely high number and would cause you to lose instantly if you didn't do it, such as a 12x hit point buff. Hardly fun or interactive.\n\nThe towers are quite limited in choice, there are only 5 types that do any noteable amount of damage, with no further upgrades. Most of them feel incredibly weak, which makes mazing highly necessary.\n\nThere is no variety of minions, it is nothing but 'chompers', a generic rodent with sharp teeth, occasionally given a different colour according to it's buffs. Occasionally there is also a mini boss in the form of a tree, dog, or golem, so perhaps small versions of these could have been used for non-boss levels.\n\nThere is no campaign (!), just 1 single 'map' which is generated randomly, with a square also randomly placed somewhere on the map that minions must touch before they then go for the exit. This means there can be some points on the map that they walk past 3 times if you do it right. Unfortunately the map gets generated with randomly placed statues and small annoying walls which all get in the way of an ideal maze most of the time. \nWhen I find myself quitting and restarting the map just to get an 'optimal' layout where I won't wipe on the 3nd wave, something is very wrong with the design. \nOne downside I noticed is after you spend all your gold, you only gain 1-2 towers worth of gold per round, which means if you are even slightly behind, you can't do much at all and it quickly snowballs into a sudden loss from there.\nBack on the topic of levels/maps- the existence of this single 'RNG' created map means there are no actual levels, which furthers my thoughts that this is an incomplete beta version that I've just paid money for. Perhaps a series of maps with fixed walls or other fixed obstacles/paths would be worth adding as soon as possible as it really makes it feel like the game was just thrown out to get money before it was finished - I actively avoid 'Early Access' games due to being burned by this exact issue so I feel mega duped here and will be requesting a refund as soon as I submit this review.\n\nAlso, even as a veteran of these types of games, the difficulty is extreme, so I can see new players giving up in disgust or boredom within a few hours.\n\nOverall verdict: this game has some potential if big changes are made, but should still be marked as a beta or early access, as it is hard to argue that there is enough content to call it a full release. Do not buy it, there are much better uses for your tower defence money such as the Kingdom Rush series which are highly polished, cheap, and available on multiple platforms.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 224, "steamid": "76561197971354899", "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1489049498}, "recommendationid": "27924602", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.513159", "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1480318489}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1467583699, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "TL:DR Buy it if you are a fan of TD games, or if you are eager to try one. And also help support/fund the game.\n\nI have played tons of TD games before, and If you played those old Warcraft III custom TD maps, get ready for a big nostalgia trip.\n\nFirst of all, I've been searching a long time for TD games on steam with the maze aspect in it. Found this game and have been waiting the release for some time now. It really adds some depth to the gameplay, It's not just \"place towers wherever the game feels like\", and as the maps are \"randomly\" generated, there won't always be the exact best and only way to place towers.\n\nFor a game in Early Access, this game is fairly good already. It's playable, haven't encountered many bugs, and totally worth the money even while in development (not to mention it's realtively cheap, just buy it and try it). Devs are talkative and you can freely talk to them in their discord channel (+1 kudos to them).\n\nThe shepherds's mechanic is a good throwback to those WCIII heroes, only 3 have been implemented so far but they have a good variety by themselfs. For now there are 4 basic towers and 2 variation for each one via upgrades.\n\nMy only complaint for now is problably the sound/music, which can sometimes get repetitive. But don't take my word for it, I normally play games on muted.\n\nI'll edit this review after I play some more. But so far it's definitely a buy if you are a fan of Tower Defense games.

And while I give this a recommendation, it is mainly for the potential.\n\nThe current gameplay is a bit lacking.\nI played against AI several times to try out stuff and it all came down to one thing: I did build more towers early and was able to kill the first batches of small creatures. Later on, when bigger creatues spawn, nothing seems able to kill them. So whoever had lost more life at that point, kinda won.\n\nAnd that brings me to my major issue with the game: Either I am to stupid to figure out how to kill the big mobs, or they are to tough. For me, they pretty much ended the game quite early. As neither me nor the AI could kill them effectively, they walked through the maze (which at this point only had like 20 towers of 50 possible, mostly not upgraded), dealt damage to the AI and me and soon the AI lost. But even against human players - as I don't know how to kill them and the monsters getting stronger every round, this means 1 or 2 rounds more at best, before the game would end.\nThis meant the playtime was rather short and both mazing and building towers felt less rwarding, as I could not use the whole maze and also towers+upgrades became almost useless against half the attacking forces.\n\nThough I do like the premise. Beeing able to build a maze and having quite some tower variety is really cool. The Shepherds also add some interesting level to the game and allow to somewhat influence the marching forces.
