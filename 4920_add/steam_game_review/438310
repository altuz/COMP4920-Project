It's really cool how you can create and customize your char.  I like how you can play a male or female char.  There were alot of cool clothes and crazy hair styles to choose from.  I especially enjoyed the monkey mask :)  The music was really enjoyable in all the different parts of the game.  I found the art work to be really unique and good.  There is alot of missing parts in the city still.  I really hope the team can update this because it's massive and really nice to explore....just needs more content.  It would also be great if you could interact with the people walking around the city.

If you were wondering if this game is truly as bad as some of the reviews and YT videos made it out to be, rest assured it absolutely is.\n\nFrom the ridiculously awkward and cumbersome registration process, to the comedic dated character creation, to the painful game-play no one in good conscious could recommend this game for anything other than a few laughs.  Very few.\n\nIgnoring for a moment that its an MMO  you will absolutely be playing alone, the game-play and graphics are so unbearably dated (think 2000 if your being really generous) as to be all but unplayable.  \n\nThe truth is this game is abandoned and the 'developers' have clearly moved on.   This isn't speculation a quick visit to their website shows a new title in the works, Last Global War.  Contrary to the developers protestations that they're a very small group who will absolutely be finishing this game.  I suppose we'll see but without any updates so far this year, you'd have to be pretty naive to believe that.\n\nReally at its core this title and these 'developers' are spectacular only at being the poster-children for Steam desperately needing to revamp the Q/A for their 'Early Access' program.
