Make sure there is nothing interesting on the line between the two points. Now take a different coloured pen/pencil and slowly draw over the line from point A toward point B, as you do this recite various proverbs in a voice akin to reading a script at a school play. \nThis is what playing Drizzlepath: Genie is like. \nI thought the previous Drizzlepath was pretty bad, but this one's just as dull and is three times longer! I like the idea of walking simulators, but they have to have something in them to keep you interested, whether it be landmarks, buildings, animals, fauna, whatever. The extent of \"features\" in this game are a few empty houses dotted around, a handful of broken statues and an out-of-place dragon flapping through the skies: All of which you can't interact with.  \nIt's a shame the Soundtrack isn't available separately, it is literally the best thing about the game, the rest of it is as bland as you can imagine a game being.
