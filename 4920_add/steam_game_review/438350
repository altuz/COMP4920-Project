It\u2019s not the most exciting of games and I found that I could only do a few levels at a time but I liked that it was a little different. There are 25 levels, which doesn\u2019t sound like a lot but if you play it like I did, in short bursts, it surprisingly lasts a while.\n\nThe levels increase in difficulty as you go along and for someone who isn\u2019t the best at visualising it does get more challenging. The easier ones are essentially just counting to 7, but in the later levels the net is broken up and placed elsewhere, even sometimes rotated, so you really have to visualise the rotation and orientation of the net. \n\nFor 80p it\u2019s worth the money, It decent in quality and it\u2019s a good casual puzzle game to throw on between games. If you like short little puzzle games I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth throwing in with the rest.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1082, "steamid": "76561198035655574", "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 145, "last_played": 1495478847}, "recommendationid": "31906094", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.509543", "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1495479508}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 2, "total_positive": 19, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 21}}
