Infinitesimal Point is a borefest of a Twinstick Shooter/RPG hybrid, with monotonous gameplay that lasts 5 hours.\n\nWhere do I start...\n\nInfinitesimal Point plays as a Twinstick Shooter and RPG hybrid, that feebly attempts to combine top-down shooting action with Leveling Mechanics. After the cutscenes that reveal the games premises (your arm is chopped off and you are sent to another world where some mystery entity replaces your arm with a bionic one), you will feel this game's slow pace. This will allow you to notice some admittedly good traits about the game such as:\n\n1. Graphics - Well... it's not THAT good. But it is pleasant to me at least. You'll notice that the protagonist's \"shooting arm\" points to where you are aiming relative to his body's position (it looks funny at times). The visual effects of your shots and spells do look believable. \n\n2. The Leveling System - this game does uniquely blend stat management with the acquisition of abilities. On the games \"ability chart\", you will see a four cornered shape that will eventually expand as you increase your stats. Ability icons that have been \"covered\" by the expanding shape are considered to be obtained and thus usable. The slow pace of the game allows you some time to plan ahead as to what stats you want to level and which skills you want to obtain.\n\n... however...\n\nPast the first hour, you will immediately start to feel as sluggish as the game's pace yourself. You will find yourself utterly bored and willing to quit the game for something else because of the following.\n\n\n1. Swarming - the game does NOT introduce monsters that are fought in unique ways. Monsters are typically ranged or melee, and will mostly vary in speed and the projectile they shoot. Instead, the game will habitually swarm you with bunches and bunches of enemies that would almost run towards you SINGLE FILE if it weren't for the fact that they spawn in different points. Really, if you use the fire skill (which shoots in a straight line) you will find that the AI will easily be made to behave this way if you slightly adjust the angle you are backpedaling with. This is the same type of gameplay you will encounter from Hour 1 to Hour 5.\n\n2. Monster Spawns - Alright, so they swarm you. Okay. That means we have to move carefully and slowly. You move to an area, alright it's clear. You continue to move forward and you begin to see monsters spawn in front of you. But what's this, you suddenly see monsters spawning from areas that YOU ARE VERY SURE YOU HAVE ALREADY EXPLORED. This immediately throws strategic maneuvering right out of the fucking window and making it clear that the only available option is to face the bunches of beasts head on. Oh, did I mention that for as long as monsters are around the objectives that you can normally interact with using the E button are FREAKING DISABLED UNTIL ALL THE MONSTERS ARE DEAD?\n\n3. Missing Skill/Weapon Information - Alright, okay. So, this game wants you to fight head on. Fine, let's build our character for that purpose and optimize our weapon selection (as in setting them on the hotkeys) for this scenario. Since we're facing them head on, let's use the game's \"shotgun\" equivalent. It says \"1\" beside the \"stopwatch\" icon indicated on the weapon description. That must mean it takes one second in between shots, and it does! But what's this? After firing four shots, my weapon just ceases to function for som- *death*.\n\nThe game leaves out critical information for the weapons and skills you obtain. For instance, the game doesn't tell you that your \"shotgun\" has four shots, and afterwards you won't be able to fire until the icon for said weapon reverts to normal color (it turns reddish when on \"reload\"). Another example is that enemies burned by the \"fire blast\" ability can burn others by being in physical contact with them. This omission of information makes your weapons unreliable, and when the weapon's disadvantages kick in, it usually ends in death by monster swarm. While you can switch to other weapons and skills using the hotkeys, they won't always be fit for the situation or something you're not accustomed to- *death*\n\n4. Horrendous Hitboxes - But, hey! It should be your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the weapons you have, right? Right, so let's practice by finding these monsters. Let's place our \"crosshair\" over these monsters and fire. We'll see what these weapons do to our ene- wait. The bullets just pass through. My crosshair is DIRECTLY over the stationary target and it just passes through. Oh wait, maybe we have to place the crosshair behind the targe- that didn't work either. Oh wait, I -*death*\n\nYou can find a stationary target, place your \"crosshair\" over/behind it (along the trajectory), and you'll hit maybe 50% of the time. Geez, what is up with the hitboxes in this game? You can shoot the shotgun point blank and have the \"pellets\" appear to pass through the target dealing ZERO damage. Urrrggggh. This will sometimes force you to use your \"skills\" sub-optimally, because they're marginally more reliable than the weapons. I hope you have lots of mana, before the buzzer kicks in signifying that you can't use the skills anymore. Speaking of which...\n\n5. Lack of Feedback - There are sfx that represent levelling up. You'll barely hear them through the rest of the sfx, and there's no visual feedback to complement it. By the time you realize, you'd have about 10 stat points (5 levels worth) unspent. There are sfx for when you can't use a weapon/skill, but yet again no visual feedback. Good luck figuring out why. Am I clicking too fast? Or is the weapon \"reloading\" (see above)? Am I out of mana? Is the skill on cooldown? Let's check. Aha! I kno- *death*\n\n*Ahem* There are sfx for when you get hit and thankfully, it does come with visual feedback (blood spatters). But you will barely see this because of the camera. Which reminds me...\n\n6. Clunky Camera Controls - The camera starts so impractically zoomed into you, but thankfully you can zoom out with the mousewheel. But what's this, a roof? A lamppost? A bridge? Quick, game! Zoom into the player so he can focus on the character instead of the bunches of monst- *death*\n\n7. Boring Boss Battles - Finally, a Boss! It's been a slog so far, but this is finally a new enemy to fight. I can hardly wait. This is exciting! I wonder what monstrosities we have to- huh? It's small, just like the enemies we've fought up until now. Looks the same too. Behaves the same too. Is that it? Seriously!? What the FUUUUUUUUU- *suicide*\n\nBut hey, at least they have more hp, which means it'll take longer to ki- oh... *death*\n\n8. The Story - Well... I suppose we can enjoy the story. What's that? What is this for a place? You can't answer question? Well, then. I don't know what is happen. Smoke and guns. The whole world is explo- *translation error*\n\n9. Nimrod's Navigation - Fuck it. I'm getting tired of this. Let's just make sure to finish the game. Good thing I can press \"F\" to let me know where to go nex- wait. This is a dead end. Wtf is this? Where am I supposed to go from here? Do I have to explore? Fine. Wait, not fine, i'm stuck in another swarm of- *death*\n\nAlright. Maybe that was an exaggeration. Pressing F does point you in the right direction most of the time. But everynow and then it'll funnily point to a dead end, or that stupid elevator that you know you've already been into, or anything BUT where you really need to go.\n\nAfter suffering these 9 things for 5.2 hours, I finally finished the game on Normal Difficulty. This allows you to unlock the \"massacre\" difficulty, but at this point you won't be invested in a new game +, let alone one more minute of the sodding game. The conclusion is simple. I can't recommend it. If you've bought it prior to this review, it's at least a functioning game. However, you can easily do better with other games.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 320, "steamid": "76561198124191400", "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1470138806}, "recommendationid": "24668543", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506240", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1470138571}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1464446612, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Lots of good things to say about this game, but they've already been covered.  I'm giving this game a thumbs-up, but I'm focusing on the negatives in hope that some of these things can be improved.\n\n1) The targeting cursor is difficult to see - especially in brightly-lit areas, and while the cursor is moving.  This is probably the most important issue.  If the targeting cursor was outlined in black - or customizable in the settings - it would be an improvement.\n\n2) The zoom is problematic.  I like being able to use the mouse-wheel to zoom - but I do NOT like the game automatically adjusting the zoom when I'm close to certain objects. If I'm running from several enemies, I don't want them to suddenly be out of my vision range just because I walked too close to a tree, or behind an obstacle.  Other games manage this by keeping the zoom constant, and making players / enemies visible through the obstruction as an outline or shadow.\n\nAlso, the maximum zoom-out needs to be increased.  The player should never have to \"blink\" to an off-screen location, and hope for the best.\n\n3)  I haven't been playing the game for long, but many of the early upgades border on useless.  The only one of value seems to be the shotgun.  This may change as I play longer, of course.\n\n4) There's no noticable notification when my character reaches a new level.  Even once in a while I'll check, and discover that I've gone up two or three levels without realizing it.\n\n5) The \"enemy locator\" at the bottom-left of the screen borders on useless.  The red dots indicating enemies are barely noticable.  I've been playing the game for an hour or so, and I just noticed the dots.  Given the limited vision range in the game, a system like this is useful - but it needs to be improved.\n\n==============\n\nAgain - this is a good game, and it has a LOT going for it.  I'm just pointing out a few of the negatives in hopes that some of them are addressed in future patches.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 386, "steamid": "76561197971220290", "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1465329925}, "recommendationid": "23253911", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.497562", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1464449552}, {"votes_funny": 19, "timestamp_created": 1454574474, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Violent blow job Simulator 2016\n\n10/10 Would blow again.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 287, "steamid": "76561198027487003", "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1454574473}, "recommendationid": "20946170", "votes_down": 76, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.370647", "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1454575449}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1492255823, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "No atmosphere, dry and shallow dialogues, game breaking bugs, a camera that's uncomfortable at best - nope.
