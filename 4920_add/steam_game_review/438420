It isn't the best of quality, but it is fun. Graphically, the game delivers just enough to make the environment believeable. Framerate isn't smooth, but to be fair I think I may be having problems with my system. The major selling point is the dialog. The main character is a snarky jerk and gets punished a lot for it. The humor is funny and fitting for the genre. Think of a more up to date The Bard's Tale. (Unfortunately, there's no voice acting). I think my main complaints with the game are that it could have been a little longer and the character could have had a more complex level up system. Also there are some UI glitches and some issues with magic abilities on stairs and slopes. Other than that, I recommend this game. It looks like just another blah game in Steam's vast library, and I've played plenty of those, but it is a decent game that made me laugh.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 334, "steamid": "76561197970515343", "playtime_forever": 850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1499646771}, "recommendationid": "33424282", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.512181", "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1499670644}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1500304938, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "A little gem <3\n\nAs you can see in the other opinions, the battle is missing some points, but the narrative...
