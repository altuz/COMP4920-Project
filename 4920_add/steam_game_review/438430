If you get the deluxe edition you have seasons and a RC track (like VRC Pro) but only 1 small track, seems like a experiment.  It seems a bit slower paced than MotoGP15, but has improvements to graphics and good physics. \n\nI got it on a steam sale for $12 for deluxe ($8 base game), so that is a good value. If you already have MotoGP15, MotoGP17 or Ride, most of the racing is very similar with a few fun ideas thrown in just to let you know. Will update after playing more.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 543, "steamid": "76561198106729629", "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 235, "last_played": 1504031735}, "recommendationid": "34584887", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501913", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504032066}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 15, "total_positive": 39, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 54}}
