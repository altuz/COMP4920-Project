Maybe it's best compared to Risk of Rain, though it's also quite different in some way :)\n\nThe gameplay is fun and challenging, though it can be frustrating from time to time dying the same time over and over again. Some enemies are funny, some other are really annoying to play against. I hope there will be more different rooms in the final version! I'm excited to see what's coming next for the game!\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 16, "steamid": "76561198094202663", "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1495380879}, "recommendationid": "31885252", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1495380920}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2}}
