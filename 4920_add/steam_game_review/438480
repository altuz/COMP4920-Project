With a few things changed it could have been far more enjoyable and that's kind of a shame, because I like that type of music and I like tower defense games.\n \nFirst of all, the soundtrack has 2 or 3 songs. In 40 levels, you can imagine how often I had to listen to each song. I personally know at least a dozen of small local Rock/Metal/Hardcore Bands that would have died for being featured in a videogame. For free, just to advertise! With a bit of effort each stage could have had a different song, which would have been awesome! The way it turned out to be in this game is the same damn songs just playing and playing, even in the menues. That totally destroys the immersion that you're \"defending\" a Metal Concert. Very annoying.\n\nAnother problem is that there are only 8 different speakers (aka towers) and they are not balanced in any way. I have just been building one (!!!) sort of speakers in the last stage (which is just a giant, uninspired clusterf*ck anyway) and had to watch the 7328472389478239 enemys getting destroyed by it afterwards.\n\nAfter you've finished the game there is not even some kind of \"Congratulations - Victory\" title screen or anything. Seems like even the developer doesn't care if you'll finish this game.\n\nThat all being said, the price, especially on sale, is fair. But I was hoping to find a game build with love and effort, no matter how small or unoptimized it would turn out to be, which isn't the case. This is kind of a missed opportunity as it just feels the dev didn't bother to put enough effort in it and finish this game properly.\n\nIf there'll ever be a Rock'N'Roll Defense 2 and these mistakes get ironed out, book me in.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 196, "steamid": "76561198217499484", "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "last_played": 1501637928}, "recommendationid": "33960455", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.508278", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1501633617}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1500126289, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I would give this game a thumbs up if the same song didn't play over and over.. it was good at first because I thought there was going to be a good sound track, then I found out only one song plays.\n\nTheme of the game is great, but the game isn't very deep.
