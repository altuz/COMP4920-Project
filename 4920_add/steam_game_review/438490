For those who love it.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nGrinding! For those who hate it.\nTrial-and-error gameplay in later levels.\nOnly ten areas, so the vistas may get repetitive after a short while.\nThe hitboxes and monster tells aren't perfect, but are reliable enough.\nThe U.I isn't the best, and don't even try to play with a keyboard.\nThe game doesn't explain some of it's mechanics (elemental damage) at all.\nSome of the dialogue is sorta' cheesy, but the game doesn't take itself seriously.\n\nAll in all, [i][b]Get. It.\n\nThe game also comes with a remaster of the first game - God Eater: Resurrection - so you won't miss out on the story if you're worried about that sort of thing.

Even the character.\nEasy find the Materials for enchant or anything else.\n(-) you can easly so bored cause the opponent attack to easy.

If you can get through the waves of rehashed timekiller quests with no actual relation to the story, there's some interesting and amusing moments in the storyline that make it worth the trip.\n\nGameplay is pretty fluid and the assortment of weaponry is interesting, and the ability to customize bullets (if you have the patience for it) is really cool. Love the artwork, though it could've used a bit more polish on many enemy designs. Out of battle music is pretty dull and repetitive. In battle tracks, especially for bosses, are good when you can hear them over all the voice chatter.\n\nMy recommendation would be to get this game on sale if you want an interesting co-op game to play with a friend (you'll need two copies/computers). Neither my girlfriend nor I have ever seen another online room/team to join besides our own on the server, so don't rely on jumping into a random internet game to play with others (unless I'm just dense and looking in the wrong place). I don't think I would bother finishing the game if I was playing it alone.\n\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 35, "steamid": "76561198010124127", "playtime_forever": 2548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1517, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506897241}, "recommendationid": "35129165", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506090656}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505877445, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I almost didn't buy this game, but decided to give it a try since the entire franchise was on sale. I'm so glad I did! This game is amazing!! I generally play RPGs, and wasn't sure what to expect out of this game outside of your standard jrpg experience, but it delivered so much more than I ever thought it would've.\n\nGameplay is pretty fun, but can easily get repetitive if you don't switch up your combat style here and there to keep it interesting. The crafting/skills/bullets can be a little overwhelming at first, but it's pretty easy to get used to as you go on. \nIt very much is like monster hunter meets persona in my opinion.\n\nI'll start with my negatives and get them out of the way because I love this game more than I don't and want to just give an honest review.\n\nMy main problems with this game are mostly personal wishes for it. I wish you could have actually had some sort of bond with the characters you interact with outside of the main story stuff. (thats a long winded way of saying i wanted to date gil but shhshshhh). The combat can get really boring and the maps get repetitive. It takes too long to run from one end of the map to another at times. I wish the skill system for your teammates was a little less messy and felt less like a chore. There were also some story elements that were never explored or explained and were sort of just... there. [spoiler](for instance a weird implied sexual relationship between the director and Leah that is never acknowledged ever again past the one single weird cutscene but could have been a really cool way to show how she's manipulative or maybe she actually had feelings for someone idk but THEY NEVER DID ANYTHING WITH IT SO WE'LL NEVER KNOW)[/spoiler] And the music cuts out when you're not in combat which kinda sucks when you're getting all hyped and then you have to chase down an aragami and it goes silent and then 30 seconds later the song starts over again from the start (but thats a small complaint really).\n\nThere's character creation, which is always a favorite gaming staple of mine personally. Several sets of weapons and ways to wield them so you can pretty much play however you want to (wanna shoot junk?? awesome, you have a sword gun. Wanna be the fucking grim reaper?? Cool, here's a scythe). There's SO MUCH character customization. It's really misleading from the actual character creation screen, but there's a plethora of really great outfits to craft in the game to style yourself. (again, this is a huge bonus for me since I love the character customization.)\n\nThe characters you interact with are pretty interesting and don't often fall flat. You can interact with them through character stories as well (sort of like persona's link feature minus the romance). The lore is intense and well thought out, as well as just plain interesting. I often spent time just reading through the entries on things in the game. I'll admit that the story didn't hit all the emotional beats as intensely as I expected, but in all fairness it was still a gripping story. Which by the way, that doesn't end when the main plot is over which is ANOTHER AWESOME feature. Once you finish the \"main story line\", they continue to give you main story quests, which I really appreciated since I felt like the ending wasn't... enough? It was a GREAT ending, don't get me wrong, but I felt like something was missing. I guess the creators felt that, as well, because they added in even more content.\n\nI was pretty quick to look this game over and not give it a chance, and I am glad I did end up buying it because it is easily one of my new top favorite games.\n\nIn short, this game has great customization, great characters, an interesting story that kept me glued to the screen for 33 hours straight, and also did I mention a great soundtrack?\n\nI have WAY more positive feelings about this game than negatives, but figured I'd give a long winded and honest review. TRY THIS GAME. I also have a lot more stuff to say about little things I loved about this game but this is already pretty long winded. I PROMISE IF YOU LIKE RPGS OR JRPGS OR JUST WANNA TRY SOMETHING NEW it's worth it.
