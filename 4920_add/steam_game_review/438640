However, I never got past the opening bit due to a fatal flaw they've apparently been building into the Lego games recently - Lego Batman 3 suffers this same flaw.  It is not possible to play this game properly single-player, at least in some cases.\n\nThe game starts you out with a normal screen, and you can begin fighting, breaking things, and collecting studs right away.  However, your second character does not follow you any more, and as soon as you move too far from them, the game switches to split-screen, leaving your second character behind.  Actively adding a second player, and then dropping out, temporarily corrects this problem, for a handful of seconds, before the game split-screens again because your second character does not follow you.\n\nI have only seen this issue on newer Lego games, but it happens on several of them.  I don't understand why it's an issue when games even as recent as Lego Hobbit work just fine, but without them fixing the problem, this game is next to unplayable.  Refunded, and would love for the developers to fix every single game that suffers this issue.

The only thing an older player can really appreciate is the visual style and graphics, which make the game quite beautiful. This is unfortunate because Lego Starwars TCS is one of my favorite games and is always fun to just play with a friend and chill.\n\nBut the gameplay here is too repetitive, annoying and boring to really enjoy. For example, the new action sequences where all you do is take cover (you are usually just stuck behind layers of barriers), then annoyingly steer your curser into new enemies (assuming you are using a controller, which you need to). It's fun at first, but it happens so often in the game that it just feels like a grind. An action sequence should never feel like a grind. And instead of figuring out through some kind of subtle visual indicator what to shoot, there are characters that literally tell you exactly what to do. It gets old fast.\n\nI also should mention that sometimes it can be difficult to aim and control your character. You may see a secret and try to trigger some way to activate it, and it will take 4-5 identical attempts to do so. It isn't common, but just annoying. All lego games sometimes have this kind of problem, it just amazes me that it's just as bad, if not worse, in this game.\n\nI wanted to enjoy Lego StarWars The Force Awakens, but it really is just for little children, which is fine if you are about 14 or younger. If you are older, then TCS is probably better. Although I can't say I recommend TCS over this game for children. \n\nThis game is newer and prettier, just less coherent and smooth.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 210, "steamid": "76561198031799936", "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 98, "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1506918139}, "recommendationid": "35405201", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.497910", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506956039}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505646824, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Donth buy this shit at pc soo hard controls\n", "comment_count": "7", "author": {"num_games_owned": 29, "steamid": "76561198238221686", "playtime_forever": 708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505646783}, "recommendationid": "35020748", "votes_down": 17, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.465123", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505646824}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 107, "total_positive": 344, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 10, "total_reviews": 451}}
