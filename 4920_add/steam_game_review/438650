It's not especially soothing or good for meditation.  It's actually pretty boring.  There's nothing to do in this game except float through a cave, stare at some galaxy-type things that are also in the cave, and listen to the music. \n\nIt moves pitifully slow, and you can stare at an option to speed up, but that only lasts for a second or two.  If this was early access and they were going to add in more things to do, more songs, maybe a series of cave tunnels to explore with different themes to the music, maybe this might be worth it.\n\nIf gravity compass is supposed to be a mental massage, it rubs me the wrong way.  It's more like a sedative, not that it's relaxing but that it's boring and dark and you could probably float into a corner of the cave and have the music stop completely and so it'd be dark and quiet enough to actually sleep.  That's not a compliment... \n\nThey claim a \"30 minute flight could go by in a moment\" but seriously, there's not even enough to see to take up 30 minutes and the only way you could spend that long is if you DID fall asleep. \n\nI know it's only $3 and hey, what do you expect for $3?

Anybody who ever watched the media player visualisations to music will be familiar with the  premise. If you've watched the sequence in 2001 a Space Odyssey with the space ship approach to the majestically spinning space station (and if not why not?) this is probably for you. Its pretty and relaxing - but it goes nowhere and does nothing - while I can see the appeal of walking through a galaxy of stars, this is a sit down simulation, so not sure what the point would be in VR. I think you need to go somewhere, be taken on a journey through those spiral arm galaxies and feel like there might be a destination, like watching the galaxies birth.  I confess to not being keen on the music provided. Vangelis music for Cosmos from the Heaven & Hell album or something classical feels like it might be a better fit.  The ability to switch the music for something trance like of your choice would be a future improvement I'd make.  On the plus side, it ran wall without stutter and the mouse can guide your path but you can't speed up or slow down the gliding motition. Cons: it needs to be higher res. (I ran it using my monitors native resolution and it made the white blobs a bit intrusive.) Well worth it for the money as a relaxing way to chill out at the end of a stressful day light some fragrant diffuser candles and go and lay on the bed and watch it would be my advice.  will be interesting to see if Nova makes more levels and what they do with them.
