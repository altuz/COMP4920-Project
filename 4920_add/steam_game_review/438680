So you send your workers to do various tasks to upgrade the village in preperation for upcomming waves.  Some workers repair, some collect loot, others are spent gathering, and the rest building stuff, youll be prioritizing tasks as the timer is counting down and enemies are gathering outside your village.\n\nYou reach a point where the village is happy and then you move on to another village in a gree field and start over.\n\nThe giant troll (you) is a wonky controlled beast, you run around pulverizing groups of enemies attacking the town while your towers help.  Need to kill everything before the town walls go down...if you fail dont worry, timer resets and you get another build/farm session and it continues on.\n\nTook me 1.3hrs before id seen it all and lost interest.  Its free so whatever, interesting concept but it gets annoying dealing with the wonky controls for the troll as well as the continual pace of \"gotta get as much done as i can before next wave\" which is timed to never have enough time to do what you wanted...which i guess is part of the fun.\n\nits free and i didnt see anything regarding paying them money at all....so ill recommend it... though id give it a 5.5/10 where anything 5 and under is a thumbs down.

If the game was actually fun to play and interesting to watch someone play, this would be a good thing, except its just the opposite.\n\n-The problem is the UI. The UI has sliders hidden behind button menus whose sole purpose for being in the game is to make you micro-manage those sliders. This creates an artificial difficulty level, unless you constantly pause the game and waste unecessary real time. This seems to be done purely to distract, annoy, and frustrate the twitch streamer throughout the game. Its as if it was designed for a phone using a touch screen and not a twitch streamer. Rather than making the game actually challenging- you will find yourself struggling mainly against the UI as the the sliders I mentioned earlier are pureposly designed to waste your time. On top of that you must click spam constantly to be effective and there are no hotkeys to activate your skills in the game. So you must click constantly, then stop clicking and click a skill. \nBy the way, when you stop to click a skill you stand still and you can be repeatedly knocked down by enemies and this interrupts your skills, putting you in an unaviodable death loop if you are knocked down a single time near a decent group of enemies.\n\n-Strange coincidence? The troll \"gallops\" and steers and breaths just like a horse. Also, what troll lives in a castle? Pretty sure this orignally was a game about a knight on a horse defending from orcs rather than a troll.  Its so obvious that its painful. Its almost as if there was some last minute changes due to lack of funding, a artist willing to complete the unfinished assets, or a copyright claim, or some other barrier. Its hard to believe this was done intentionally, but either way to me its a red flag signaling bad decisions.\n\n-The game runs at 24 fps no matter what graphics setting you run it at.\n\n-The whole stream to decide wether the game would be free or not is laughable. Its should be fairly obvious that this was the only option they had to get anyone to not refund the game within the time limit and to attempt to get a larger audiance to pay for the DLC. A good strategy.\n\n-The real troll is the game developer for implimenting these poorly crafted systems and actually expecting someone to freely promote this painful experience by streaming it. I mean it would be a great marketing strategy, if it was actually a good game. Instead, its a dull experience that doesn't end. Due to all of the repition of the core game loop the game becomes a grind that only becomes less appealing.\n\n+If the UI is ever completly redone, hotkeys are added, and the core game loop becomes less repetitive, with zero need to pause, it might actually work out. Check back for version 2.0 or 3.0 etc if they are still working on it, but with so many problems I wouldn't get your hopes up. What seems more likely is that another developer will try a similar idea and do it properly.", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 47, "steamid": "76561198047694291", "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1485528689}, "recommendationid": "29522398", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503663", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1485532699}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1463896128, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Great game, regardless of if it's free or not... it's just a perfect mix of tower defense, strategy, and RPG elements in an easy to pick-up and play package.\n\nIf you ever played a TD, you will generally know how to play this game with the basic un-intrusive tutorial.\n\nIf you ever played a Diablo-esque hack-and-slash, you will know how to control the giant troll and activate skills.\n\nThe game is simple, yet fun.\n\nGet the game for free, buy the costume pack to support the devs who stuck by their word and desided to give this game away for free to the publics, and enjoy a great game that looks perfectly fine even on the lowest settings (like in my case, as I was playing this on a non-gaming laptop as opposed to my built gaming desktop, not really expecting much).\n\nSo no, this is NOT a great FREE game... it's just a great game that I got because it was free, and then enjoyed a lot more than what I thought I possibly could.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 834, "steamid": "76561198030666237", "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1463959460}, "recommendationid": "23131091", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.498528", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1463896128}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1487598854, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Un joc froarte misto , chiar merita jucat!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 474, "steamid": "76561198287495417", "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 80, "last_played": 1502957911}, "recommendationid": "30057741", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.495899", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1487598854}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485317477, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 398, "steamid": "76561198025543872", "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 450, "last_played": 1485317473}, "recommendationid": "29475698", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.493583", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485317477}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1488006459, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "not fun", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 67, "steamid": "76561197964165629", "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 137, "last_played": 1488006424}, "recommendationid": "30159765", "votes_down": 9, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.479763", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1488006459}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487804750, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "at least it was free", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 38, "steamid": "76561198079579193", "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1469572378}, "recommendationid": "30108804", "votes_down": 14, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.471817", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1487804750}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487691352, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "A really fun game!
