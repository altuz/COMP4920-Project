I restarted after a bit of confused faffing about.\n\n- The buttons and controls are quite clunky. The buttons seem to divide up the functions in ways that aren't very helpful and you can spend quite a lot of time clicking things (with the wrong button pressed) without realising why nothing is happening.\n\n- Sometimes phantom green ghost structures appear on your map or on locks sections of it for no reason. Sometimes you can't set workers to do any work. Sometimes things are just a bit broken.\n\nI'm going to keep playing, but so far there doesn't seem to be much challenge in the gameplay to balance out the challenge in getting the controls working. It doesn't seem to make any difference whether your people are happy or not, and I don't find myself really caring whether or not they are.

With a cute, minimalistic art style you are only given a few resources to worry about. You have to strategize what you place, when, and where to divert your workers at any given point if you find you're falling behind on something. At most you'll be managing your town's food more than anything. It could use some more levels of complexity but as a basic five dollar simulator, it's hardly the worst choice if you want to kill a few hours.\n\nThe problems I do have are superficial and will probably be tweaked in time. It pauses itself if you tab away from anything, which is NOT a good thing considering that, if you're balancing resource gains, you'll basically be staring at the screen for several minutes doing VERY little else while you watch your stone and wood very slowly crawl upwards before you can upgrade something and get those numbers moving up. I found myself just stockpiling one resource in the several thousand so I can move on to actually get things done.\nThis auto pause basically turns this game into a stealth idle - Except one you have to focus and stare at. Now, I don't mind idle games but the strength of idle games is you can focus on other things while you're doing it. No-go here.\n\nIt's tutorial barely explains anything other than a \"You should build a few houses, a farm, a wood cutter, and a mine\" with no indication that if you follow those exact instructions, you'll be starving your people within a few minutes. I failed the game twice before I figured out how to balance things.\n\nThat's a lot of negative for a positive review.
