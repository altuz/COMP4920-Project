Also the mute button doesn't work from time to time, which especially s#cks when you get a radio-player with a super loud mic and constant annoying music.\n\n- not worth 40$\nAlmost half a year passed and the only content which is not skins for characters they added during that time are only two additional maps. I am not counting the smaller maps because in-game they feel pretty much the same. You can also go on a scavenging hunt for Pamela Tapes now since the last update, but in order to get them you just have to play the game as you usually do and hope that you're lucky enough to find one. So far I've only found one that lasted around 15 seconds. If the so much promised singleplayer campaign will not be added by Haloween then I assume it never will be and the game was a total waste of money.\n\n- no players\nThere is usually around 1-3k active players at any time of the day which doesn't sound too bad at first. But it comes as a massive problem when you stumble upon the biggest con of this multiplayer-only game, which is...\n\n- sh#tty community\nWhen I bought this game, I expected it to be something that would get people to work together as a team, communicate with each other in order to let most of the people survive. At first it actually was this way and it didn't even feel bad to sacrifice yourself for the most players to survive. In current reality 30% of players are people who don't speak english, play only with each other and ignore or even purposefully ruin the game play for others; 20% of silent players (the least annoying part of players), which don't mess up others game expierience, yet do not communicate and never play in team, thus making the game pointless; 40% of people that randomly harrass everyone they want, swear and yell during the entire match, the majority of which are underaged kids (with F13 being an 18+ game), which also love to use any given opportunity to ruin your game and mood. And only the rest 10% are people who actually came there to play the game and enjoy it with everyone.\n\nPros of the game:\n- It is well optimized\nUntil the game got abandoned by the vast majority of players, the connection was always great even on my weak computer that wasn't meant to be a gaming computer in the first place. However, due to the lack of players, you might encounter lag from time to time when you get a host with a shitty internet and from hell knows where. Usually it's not crucial for the game though, just annoying.\n\n- Very fun to play with friends\nThe more friends - the merrier. If you have the 6 of you minimum in a match you will have a ton of fun in a private lobby. If there's less of you, it will be easier to avoid or just ignore the annoying part of the community. Warning: It loses sense if as Jason you let your friends constantly escape. The game gets boring in less than three matches. At least just keep them as dessert.\n\n- Graphics\nI personally love how the game looks and the fact that it looks great and is also well optimized at the same time is one of the reasons that actually made me buy a game with a price I usually find too expensive for myself.\n\nAt this state the game seems pretty much dead. I personally think this game has a chance for a come-back if they add more various playable content (maps/characters/other gameplay features) and, most importantly, do some work affecting the player base (banning system, blacklists, decent moderating system, normally working mute and volume control). The so much promised singleplayer campaign will also make this playable for a few hours and might at least make it worth it's price.\nLet's see how soon at least some of the changes will happen and how long it will be until I change my review.", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 170, "steamid": "76561198155721875", "playtime_forever": 5571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 597, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1507140272}, "recommendationid": "35451328", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505870", "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1507143360}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505058071, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This game new update create many bug , I think fist play is good game,bug now this game is too bad", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 7, "steamid": "76561198362585300", "playtime_forever": 8274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506850475}, "recommendationid": "34864871", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501087", "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1505058071}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505570743, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Apart from what the other negative reviews said the game has massive FPS drops for many people since the 28th August update.
