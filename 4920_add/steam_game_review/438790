Could use a little bit less cluttering.\n\nNext up, the gameplay. As soon as I joined a game, I had no idea what I was doing. I shot other people, ran around, and did everything the trailer told me to do. It got repetitive. And I had no idea what the RAM meter at the bottom of my screen did. \n\nThe controls are very slippery and it is very easy to fall off the ledge and die.\n\nThe in-game \"popups\" unlock your mouse and effectively hinder gameplay by throwing your mouse out of the game window (assuming you're playing on Windowed mode like I was) and in turn makes you click other applications outside of the game, which can be bothersome especially if you're in the middle of a firefight. The glitch effects that happen when you're getting attacked become an epileptic eyesore after a while.\n\nI'm not going to complain about the price as $2.54 was all I paid for this game, so I guess I got what I deserved without expecting an AAA experience.", "comment_count": "3", "author": {"num_games_owned": 123, "steamid": "76561198042949607", "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1470465070}, "recommendationid": "24737313", "votes_down": 7, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.515339", "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_updated": 1470581117}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1473996354, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "[h1]This game was the fifth game I've reviewed for my \"Steam Redlight\" series, where I review games when they're 'in the red' in reviews to see if it's as garbage as everyone says it is.[/h1]\n\nYou can see the review / reaction video [u][i][b][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5BxTnEAkVA]here[/url][/b][/i][/u].\n\n[b]In summary, this game isn't worth money, and definitely won't be worth anything come the end of September since there will be [u]NOBODY[/u] on the server.[/b] In this game, you're some sort of terminator robot hellbent on destroying other terminator robots. Or maybe you're a computer virus. Or perhaps you're the temp file in someone's porn directory, who knows. You're thrown into the game without much context of anything, and unless you read the About This Game section on Steam, you won't even know that the secondary weapons don't do damage until you're left staring the enemy you just launched a missile into straight in the face.\n\nFor the most part, the game was a straight learning experience. I was drawn to this game because of its pseudo-80s banner art and the bright colors in the trailer. Also, because Steam recommended me it. Since I've been playing all these garbage games, Steam must think they should be able to sell me all the bad games at this point, but I digress. The game plays [i]okay[/i]; if okay is a seizure inducing buggy shoot-em-up. You're able to clip through walls by applying your back to any wall, and shooting whatever weapon you have. The recoil puts you into a wall. You're able to walk about freely and shoot through these walls. That kind of blows for the people who totally just blew their life savings all over this game.\n\nThe game mentioned five arenas of some sort, but I only ever got to play in one. Maybe because there were never more than five people online. There's also no bots, so if you sign on and there's nobody online, that's exactly who you're fighting against, [b]your dark and lonely thoughts[/b]. Other than that, you can't do damage to yourself, but you can throw yourselves off of buildings and try to test your sensitivity to epilepsy. I actually believe this game may actually begin to be used to diagnose epilepsy by all the top hosptitals in the country.\n\nAnyways, the secondary weapons do some cool stuff like cause pop-ups to appear for your enemy, or even minimize their game to some fake Windows 95 desktop, or they alter your vision in some way. However, none of them do any damage; you can only do damage with your primary weapon. The game is very thematic, with the primary weapon being a weapon that causes memory leaks for your opponents, and once you strike them up to 32 MB of RAM like your old Playstation, you suffer a BSOD. Whereafter you'll likely respawn right where you died.\n\nHowever, game has no depth. With no community, there isn't even a game. It's unfortunate the developers haven't said anything on Steam because the game will become something much less than a paperweight. Cool weapon concepts, pretty lights, but that's about it unfortunately.\n\n[h1]Score & Breakdown[/h1]\n\n[b]Score: 2/10[/b]\n\n[list][*]+5 for Existing\n[*]-2 for allowing me to clip through walls\n[*]-2 for not explaining anything within the game itself\n[*]-1 for looping the same soundtrack the whole time. cool song, but not for 30 minutes.\n[*]+1 for cool weapon concepts -- the popups are kind of funny for all of ten seconds\n[*]+1 visually appealing, aside from the epilepsy inducing weaponry. the game doesn't look terrible.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]If you've ever wanted to tumble around in a trash can while listening to the sweet succulent sounds of my voice, check out the fully URL'd video review below:[/h1]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5BxTnEAkVA", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 238, "steamid": "76561198041592505", "playtime_forever": 6031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1489685755}, "recommendationid": "25521101", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.522480", "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1473996354}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1470800826, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "fun but needs more work", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 354, "steamid": "76561198202484892", "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1470800766}, "recommendationid": "24804185", "votes_down": 9, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.489132", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1470800826}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3}}
