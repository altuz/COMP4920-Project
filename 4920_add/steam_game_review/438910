Recommend playing with friends than alone, just to add to chaos and laughs. Music and sounds are fine. Graphics are pretty good for what it is.\nDefinitely worth the price tag is you want a casual game to mess around in with friends. Very gauntlet feel.\n\nOnly issue I had might have been due to my controller. As I use a PS4 controller, whenever I click join it brings in two characters and I have to move one off the platform to drop one of them. Not sure if an intentional feature or not. Not really a big issue either way.\n\nI would like to see more modes added to it aside from the only co-op+VS mode.", "comment_count": "7", "author": {"num_games_owned": 71, "steamid": "76561198084594816", "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1472797339}, "recommendationid": "25272807", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.516127", "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_updated": 1472667105}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1472756955, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Start game.\nSelect a class (out of 4).\nStart session (solo or coop).\nFight enemies and a boss.\nFind the portal to end session.\nWhoever entered the portal won that game session.\n\nVery basic gameplay.\nNo looting of better equipment.\nNo leveling.\nNo skill point system or talent tree.\nNo character customization.\nNo reward for 'Winning'.\nNo nothing.

Liked all of the classes; you have to experiment and find one to suit your playstyle. I thought I'd like the Knight the most, but so far the Archer is my favorite. It's not as good close up, but if you can get some distance and find an area to bottleneck the enemies, it's good for crowd control. Generally, I go room to room, then try and find either a boss, treasure, or an area to keep them at bay so I can rack up health drops. Overall it's definitely fun, but I think it's more suited towards playing with your friends. It's very difficult to play by yourself, but still fun. The music really puts a punctuation on everything and is really great. I'd love to see a few more modes and levels eventually, maybe even a campaign like a Spyro-esque mode where you teleport to different worlds and fight their bosses, but I understand that's a lot more work for the future.

I'm also always looking for good local-coop games to play together with my two boys.\n\nTechnically, the game is flawless.  Smooth fast graphics, highly responsive, no lag, great sound and pretty pictures.   Also, I've always enjoyed rogue-like games and this was a nice twist.\n\nUnfortunately, that's about it in terms of gameplay.  Not to be crass, but it feels like a school group project - a roguelike game made by committee that's a mile wide and an inch deep.  Like any game, once the pretty pictures wear off, there needs to be something of substance behind it.  Even the original nethack games had a leveling system - and with good reason!  You need some reason to keep playing and go for just one more dungeon.   More than 4 monsters and a few bosses would be a good start. \n\nI guess it's easier to give a school grade for solid graphics and technical savvy then it is to judge depth or playability.  And having the goal of publishing to Steam is a good carrot to motivate students to meet a deadline I suppose. \n\nMy boys (8 & 10 yo) had fun with the novelty of the game for about 15 minutes.
