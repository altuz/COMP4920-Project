This game is just great fun to play! I kind of enjoyed the free version, and figured it was worth the punt at what's a pretty reasonable price. I have quite a few digital board games in my library so I was just expecting this to be another to come back to from time to time, but I was pleasantly surprised that it immediately became my new favourite game.\n\nAs has been mentioned, it's basically a beefed-up version of Risk, and the short review is, if you like Risk, you're going to like this. The only major differences are:\n\n[olist]\n[*]you [b]improve[/b] territories you own, either with a town or a tower (or the odd portal from time to time) for most territories, or several upgrades for the main cities;\n\n[*][b]heroes[/b] - armies only move around the map attached to a hero. You'll generally have 2 to 4 heroes wandering round the map at a time. Each hero has specific stat buffs - some are defenders, some have missile bonuses etc.\n\n[*]each map is a [b]scenario[/b] with specific objectives, and various factions that you either fight or ally with. You don't have to take over the whole map and conquer everyone (although you can if that's your thing!)\n\n[*] there are [b]cards[/b] that you can play for certain specific effects, some combat-related, some economic, and so on, and using the right card at the right time can have a huge impact.\n[/olist]\n\nTo address some of the specific criticisms that have been made against the game:\n[olist]\n[*][b]Graphics[/b] - I think this is pretty misguided, to be honest. It's a digital board game, not some cutting edge 3D/VR title! The graphical style is charming, quite cartoony, and in any event, it looks a damn sight better than my old Risk board!\n\n[*][b]Multiplayer[/b] - don't know, haven't tried, don't care. For some people, multiplayer is the only thing they care about, but this is a perfectly good single player game. You might be able to rush through it if you really want to, but I see I've already clocked up 30hrs and I'm only at the start of the second of 4 campaigns. That's pretty good value for money! (I admit I do like to take my time with games I enjoy, so I don't just rush to complete the scenario objectives in as short a time as possible, I like to take over the entire map and improve every single territory, just because).\n\n[*][b]Complexity[/b].... Some people have said it's too simple. Listen, I love strategy games, but if complexity was the be-all and end-all of every strategy game, we'd all be sat playing Gary Grigsby's War In The East 24/7 and poring over 1,000 page instruction manuals trying to sort out problems with diesel distribution in the eastern Urals. Complexity [i]can[/i] be good, but sometimes you just want a nice straightforward game that's [b]fun[/b] to play without needing a degree in tactical theory. Someone pointed out that it's \"only\" got 6 unit types per race (which funnily enough is how many pieces there are in chess, and no one ever criticises chess for being too simple!) and \"only\" 4 races (so that's one more than Starcraft, the greatest strategy game of all time - yes it is, don't deny it).\n\nHa, I've just noticed that War In The East is one of the \"More Like This\" games for LoC, that's a stretch!\n\n[b][u]In Summary[/u][/b]\n\nReminds us that, in an age where we're in danger of obsessing about graphical engines, fps, always-online multiplayer ranking and impenetrable manuals, there's one thing that trumps [b]everything[/b] in a game - is it fun? This game is fun.\n\nOh, and if you like Risk [b]at all[/b], this a no-brainer.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 328, "steamid": "76561198011864330", "playtime_forever": 3650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 110, "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1506874185}, "recommendationid": "33739573", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.498487", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1501683436}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 23, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 24}}
