It was time to choose. The Rebellion was in--[/i] [b]OH PUT A SOCK IN IT, ALREADY[/b]\n\nThere are parts of this I like, and I'll start with those. Foremost, the characters and art direction. The impressive spread of outcomes from the branching narrative, always strung along by the lone narrator. Combat reminiscent of the Arkham games. There is a general competency and enjoyability to the game, and I can't bring myself to completely hate it.\n\nThat being said, it has problems. Mostly falling into two categories.\n\nRepetition: How many times have I been forced to sit through that opening paragraph? Why am I crafting new swords to unlock doors that only lead me to loot to craft more swords when I'm only ever going to use the starter sword in combat? Why have I completely exhausted the loot pool by my fourth trip through the story when there are something like 26 paths to explore? Why are there 26 paths to explore when you only get to go through the same 7 or so stages over and over and over? Why does the narrative take a completely asinine and illogical detour in the true path, [b]just to make sure I'm funneled through those exact same stages one last time?[/b]\n\nPoor QA: Isn't very well optimized. Next to no graphics settings. Bloated loading times. And the one that ultimately pushed me from a thumbs up to a thumbs down, [b]buggy as an anthill.[/b] Not because a common bug in combat prevents you from attacking until you spam dash. Not because I fell through the world a few times. Not because there's a section of one stage where nine times out of ten [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/techbane/screenshot/885378750243296507]the terrain won't load[/url] and you have to navigate some invisible walls to progress. It was because, in the final level, there is a particularly well hidden secret area that is apparently [i]so[/i] well hidden that the devs forgot it existed. It obviously hasn't been properly tested, as not only is it hilariously buggy but it will [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/techbane/screenshot/885378750243349903]softlock the game simply by entering it[/url] and force you to quit out and restart. These are the sorts of things that should be in a day 1 patch, not still in the game years after the fact.\n\nIn brief, I liked the story until everything started repeating, I liked the combat until everything started repeating, and I liked the game until it became literally unplayable. It's an interesting experiment that isn't a disaster, but certainly also could've done better for itself.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1044, "steamid": "76561197979724838", "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 305, "num_reviews": 208, "last_played": 1506944281}, "recommendationid": "35413526", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506946518}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506724491, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "[quote]A fun, simple action RPG with great and innovative storytelling.[/quote]\n\nGameplay-wise this is a simple action RPG. You have a basic attack, dash, hookshot, four spells and a combo meter. You must time your attacks right in order to get the combo meter high and unleash more powerful skills. There is a simple upgrade system which gives you one skill point on each level-up.\n\nThere are a few usability shortcomings:\n\n [list]\n    [*]You can only move with the mouse, not with a keyboard\n    [*]The keys cannot be remapped\n    [*]Some dialogue cannot be skipped\n[/list] \n\nWhere the game shines, however, is its storytelling. It tells the story in a way that no other medium can, only computer games. Without wanting to spoil much, the game offers a combination of choose-your-own-adventure, where you make a few key choices, and an unreliable narrator, whose lies/mistakes you slowly uncover.\n\nIt's hard to tell more without spoiling it but once I understood what the game did, I smiled from ear to ear. \n\nThe writing seemed a bit too ironic and self-aware at first, but it quickly grew on me and later it even showed interesting nuance.\n\nThe gameplay is fun despite the above mentioned shortcomings and it was a pleasure to go through the story to the very end. \n\nStories: Path of Destinies is in my opinion a hidden gem of a game.
