Even the room design, number of staff, inspector and the rats are from TH. However, it has not got the same amazing sense of humour (at least not at the time of writing). Also, there are still a lot of unfinished detail (including a pause button). I really hope that when finished, it will live up to its predecessors excellence.

While I enjoy a game introducing me to its mechanics in an immersive manner, this one fails to introduce them at all. When I feel like I have created an optimal layout, attempted to manipulate pricing optimally, and hire a cost efficient staff the game expects more than the tools it gives provides. It is of minor note that I am playing on the 2nd highest difficulty, but it should not be impossible. I have restarted many times and even started on a higher difficulty for the first mission until I found it was numerically staggering to complete with the slow and infrequent progression my tavern experienced. Overall, the game is untuned and not that interesting visually. For a management game there are few decisions to make, and bugs also seem to be a large problem that I didn't elaborate on (Sometimes your staff freeze, the game allows you to make some pathfdining errors, and other things that will make you fail if you're not alert for them).\n\nI hope to update this in the future when the game is in a state where its problems have been addressed.

Game is a neat idea with a decent setting of old times tavern management.Graphics are fine and decent and to be slightly fair the price is reasonable certainly .But first off WHAT IS WITH THE AWFUL mouse pointer? wonky , unresponsive , slow and no option to change its sensitivity (and no its not my mouse or pc) just give us a normal sensible speed mouse pointer not a whacking great stupid hand that moves at a snails pace one second then a speed up the next. No option (clearly) to speed or slow time down , a must for any tycoon game and ive literally played hundreds , so the boring times you can spin through and slow down accordingly.\n\nNext the mails , jesus christ the mails , officialy the worst most annoying part of the game , every 5 seconds another mail , customers asking for reservations , monthly reports , your bosses reports , thats all fine no issue with receiving these but you HAVE TO keep clicking the mail box at bottom of the page (annoying mouse pointer alert) to click and open them then you read them if you can get the pointer to the mail to open it and then exit BOOOOM another mail ...back in we go , was suggested to developer 4 months ago and around about 6 to 7 patches ago to have a nice simple clean mail appear on left of screen so u can read /delete without keep going in to this annoying mailbox......er still waiting\n\nso i dont bother reading them anymore .\n\nLeft the game for about 6 to 8 weeks a few patches later , nope excatly the same , really doesnt listen to ALOT of the advice of different ideas, its messy and a pain in the backside to play this game .slow ,boring and repetitive , i reallly wanted to enjoy it but clearly he/she/them are not listening to pretty much anyone .dont waste your money , plus only 5 levels to play(i understand that , building more etc) but95 percent of tycoon early access have sandbox available , i.e players able to experience the game with a small tutorial at start , nope and he has even said in posts \"yeah MAY do a sandbox , tycoon games have sandbox modes , ALL of them , \n\noverall 5/10 idea fab, graphics meh yea not bad , price for the idea yep reasonable \n\nexecution AWFUL , mail/mouse pointer AWFUL , no sandbox AWFUL , annoying gameplay YEP ,slow and boring VERY\n\navoid", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 426, "steamid": "76561198003364703", "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "last_played": 1505948428}, "recommendationid": "35093621", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504505", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505949348}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505171857, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Interesting game, but for now far too little content to be worth paying for.

Seems that the developer has more ideas than actual intent to finish their products.
