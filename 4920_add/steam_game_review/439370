{"success": 1, "reviews": [{"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504671240, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Although I do not recommend Midair in Early Access at this time (early Sept '17) I hope this can be seen as a constructive commentary on the game thus far. There are some strong positives and some concerning but fixable negatives. For the time being I have got a refund on the Early Access, but I'll be checking back to see if things have improved.\n\nIt's clear a lot of work has gone into Midair, formerly Project Z, and that there is also a lot left to do. At this stage it feels like a proof of concept of a Tribeslike game. It certainly has issues but there is also a lot to like.\n\nHaving played Starsiege Tribes, Tribes 2, Tribes Vengeance, Tribes Ascend (and Legions) I know that what is and what isn't Tribes has always been divisive and there opinions aplenty. I managed to enjoy all those games even if T1 & T2 still feel superior, Ascend's Weapon unlocks were the obvious low point of the saga.\n\nThe problems I see with Midair right now are not ones that cannot be solved. Heres a list of the issues as I see them.\n\n- Movement does not feel right. Skiing and jetpacks are present but feel off. Perhaps because the Jump isn't integrated into Jetting perhaps? A separate unjetted jump should exist, but I think had jump also scripted into jet in T1 & T2 (almost 20 years, my memory is hazy). Lateral movement in the air feels slightly superior though, so that's a small plus. Ground movement when not jetting or skiing feels a little slow. As such the player controls felt a little awkward.\n\n- The UI is firmly in placeholder territory. It's just nasty. I do not believe the current elements can be tuned to improve them. For example, modding your loadouts does not need to fill the screen. Instead players should have an onscreen display that allows them to keep situational awareness of the game world.\n\n- The HUD isn't great either, but is more functional than the rest of the UI.\n\n- Player avatars profoundly disappointing. I was pleasantly surprised by the art style of the game buildings and vehicles, which I liked even though I wasn't sure at first, but I really do not like the player models. This may be a question of taste. It's possible to match the colourful style without making the players look a doofus generic cartoon character. Helmets at a bare minimum would improve matters, as would the traditional 5: Light female, Light Male, Medium Female, Medium Male and Generic Heavy (which both genders use).\n\n- Armour weights tied to a gender and race is jarring. I think this might also be a problem tied into the current player avatar design. I honestly don't care what gender or race I play as, but swapping between Light, Medium and Heavy armours I would like to have the same voice and gender. And yeah, I know all cappers will be female Lights because size. 1998: pick your voice, gender & appearance, 2017: get what you're given.\n\n-- [b]Biggest negative, however, is the intended business model[/b]. Free to play with Weapon unlocks. Just leave that ranking up nonsense to Callofdudebro and its numerous dreadful clones. [b]Have everything unlocked and limit free players to the number of games they can play in an hour and day[/b]. Weapon unlocks have no place is a Tribeslike game.\n\nWell that's a lot of grumbling. So what did I like about the game...\n\n++ Despite my issues with the avatars, I like the look of the game world a lot. It's a simplistic art style that works well. With the speed necessary for a Tribeslike game, being able to resolve opponents and teammates in a fraction of a second is key. I think this is the Midair team's best decision (aside from making a Tribeslike game, of course!).\n\n+ Similarly the vehicles and base assets are also great. You should have no difficulty recognising what vehicle you're up against, even at long distance.\n\n++ From what I saw, most (probably all) of the weapons I remember are present. What I tested felt like they needed tuning. Not a huge issue and one that will evolve over time. Mostly damage values, area of effect sizes, rate of fire... all that sort of thing.\n\n+ So too are at least some of the equipment modifiers.\n\n+ The map design, while occasionally and unapologetically designed around skiing, looked pretty good. I will be interested to see how the Midair team reinterpret some of the classic maps but also what new designs they come up with.\n\n++ It's the most Tribeslike game I've seen since T1 & T2.\n\nSo in the end. Is it Tribes? No, not yet but it's so very, very close. I do want it to suceed, but I reserve recommending it unless you personally have the time to dedicate testing an unfinished but promising game.", "comment_count": "5", "author": {"num_games_owned": 133, "steamid": "76561197997810842", "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "last_played": 1504063062}, "recommendationid": "34769299", "votes_down": 11, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.519620", "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_updated": 1504671802}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505268878, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Great take of the spirit of Tribes games alike.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 62, "steamid": "76561197961986796", "playtime_forever": 1825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506296982}, "recommendationid": "34911857", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.509377", "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1505268878}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505569503, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "What tribes should have been", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 93, "steamid": "76561198008828890", "playtime_forever": 3841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1814, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1507198546}, "recommendationid": "34997394", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504274", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1505569503}, {"votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504654740, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "where are all the players, there are like 6 peple playing ever time i log on. i love T2 and this could be epic but with no player base its dead feeling.. and I feel like there are bugs in the wepon firing and accuracy", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 9, "steamid": "76561198175857449", "playtime_forever": 785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506912698}, "recommendationid": "34766446", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504654740}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505170737, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "an hour in and I like what I've played, very much like tribes 2 but less fluid movement, ground movement is slow, flying and skiing is a little off, with practice ill get it, but biggest problem so far is empty servers", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 344, "steamid": "76561197962685833", "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505431023}, "recommendationid": "34891663", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501183", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505170737}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505015144, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Fun now.

The jetpack mechanics still need a little work and the gunfire reload feels a little slow but other than that fun game for being in closed beta. We do need some type of health pack or regen added but I'm sure thats probably on the way. Part of the fun capping back in the T1 and T2 days was disc launching yourself to get instant speed and then heal up before you get to the flag. The loadout screen is kinda a hot mess also but self explanitory. Guys look at T2 and follow that model. Keep it simple but sexy.
