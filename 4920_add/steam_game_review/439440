It should be Very Positve 211 reviews tbqh. This game is a shooter; you shoot bad guys to keep them away from a sentient carrort. Doesn't sound that exciting? It is. Not only are there plenty of power ups but you get single player AND co op mode story. ( To be fair, I haven't tried the co-op yet ) You can unlock more characters and this is just the tip of the iceberg. I can see myself putting a lot of time into this one. Highly recommended. :) :) :)", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 314, "steamid": "76561198165442724", "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "last_played": 1503192696}, "recommendationid": "34222623", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.492027", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1502657836}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 3, "total_positive": 10, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 13}}
