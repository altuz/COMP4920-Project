You'll know the story and you'll get to love the characters, and you'll see the huge growth from this indie company. There are of course some kinks but that'll be fixed in the first couple of weeks after release, once the devs finish whipping their QA's unmercilessly. This game is so much like the original Boo Bunny Plague because it has the same heart, the characters you love, the music, and the humor...BUT they made it ten times more playable! They listened to the complaints they got from Boo Bunny Plague and made this glorious gem!  I like that you can play the different characters! That was my big complaint from the first one. I especially like Faye's special little demon she summons to help her out . The music is awesome, of course.

The diablo-ish style is just a lot more fun for me. I play with a steam controller and the controls are intuitive and easy to get a handle on.\n\nThis is a fun and fast smash and loot style game with a rockin sound track but it still has a story. I am looking forward to seeing this iteration of the Boo Bunny title grow and hope that it gets DLC or follow up versions in the years to come.\n\nThis is a good offering by an indy label that is growing and learning and in my opinion has some good material ahead of them.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I have been friends with (the art director) MotoDestructos wife for like 15 years.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 236, "steamid": "76561197970967949", "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1486827876}, "recommendationid": "29850389", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500870", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1486827268}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1484859780, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Update:\nThe falling off does indeed kill you ratherr than leave you in a void, that did however show another thing that's got me very torn...you get sent back to the start and there are no enemies around, you just run back to where you were....

If you looked at gameplay alone, it probably wouldn't gain too much of your interest. \n\nBUT, the game was genuinely funny and really charming, with a lot of self-aware humor. On top of that, a really amusing soundtrack to boot. Like I said, it wasn't going to win awards but it was certainly entertaining. And this new installment much like that too. \nSave for this time, they've taken a more traditional top-down dungeon crawler approach. If you go in expecting Diablo level quality, you'll be disappointed. But for a small indie developer? It's a really nice evolution from the last game and you know they want to improve. And their unique sense of humor is still present and amusingly goofy. \nAnd if you did play the last game, you'll be happy to see other characters be playable and see more from them. \n\nIt does have its problems. In my short time with it so far, it has been a little buggy and sometimes things don't trigger like they should ( ihad a cutscene audio start up but I was still stuck in ganeplay.) So I won't say it doesn't have flaws.\n\nBut there's far worse out there that's made by people who care way less. There's a lot of heart put into these two games and I highly reccomend giving them a little support. \n\nalso, MC Chris makes an appearance as a boss character.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 149, "steamid": "76561198048752110", "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "last_played": 1484969429}, "recommendationid": "29362630", "votes_down": 8, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.495603", "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1484856990}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506450056, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Amazing soundtrack.
