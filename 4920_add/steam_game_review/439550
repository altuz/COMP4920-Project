The game involves jumps, mazes, switches, and light puzzle elements.  You play different scenarios and end up at a tree where you then go to the next \"dream\" scenario.\n\nUnfortunately, the game just isn't fun to play.  It's more annoying than anything else.  The visuals are not that great.  It's VR done poorly. I can't recommend this game.  Lacks story, lacks polish, lacks fun gameplay.\n\nRating 3/10", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 846, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 210, "last_played": 1505268685}, "recommendationid": "34911876", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.508308", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505269028}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 10, "total_positive": 8, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 18}}
