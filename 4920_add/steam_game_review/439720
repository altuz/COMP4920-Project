It's significantly complicated enough with managing your ships, trade etc.\n\nI definitely recommend it. It gives you a more direct experience for a 4x game. There's a learning curve but stick with it and you'll enjoy building up your empire, managing your supply lines etc.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 379, "steamid": "76561197981736706", "playtime_forever": 1753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1504190414}, "recommendationid": "33537625", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.510953", "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1500044583}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 16, "total_positive": 38, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 54}}
