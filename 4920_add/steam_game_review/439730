Though its design tenants are conventional (double jumps, simple controls, focus on accurate movement), the application is anything but.\n\nEnemies are difficult and unforgiving at close range, which would be a great incentive to use the gun, except properly landing shots is itself a challenge. Without a tutorial to explain a few of its nuances, be prepared to stumble through the first few lives working out the timing required to take out lesser enemies before progressing to the boss. This game has the appeal of trial and error, as well as a high difficulty curve who those that want a challenge.\n\nUltimately, this game is oozing with creativity from the mind of a talented developer. Despite this, it has unfortunately fallen by the wayside, ignored largely for no reason. \n\nPlastered in visuals that range from stunning to vision-ruining, and unfettered by the laws of conventional sound design with sounds both satisfying and irritating, its certainly one of the more interesting games I've played aesthetically speaking. Its worth mentioning here that you should take the epilepsy warning very seriously. If you have any history of reactions to flashing lights, avoid this game at all costs. \n\nIt's a strange game, and I recommend it not because its perfect, or even great, but because playing it is a trippy, awkward experience. It's like stumbling through the first kiss; its like dealing with parental disappointment; its like a trip down a road you haven't seen in twenty years. Refreshing, but something's changed. Something important. \n\nIts an experience. \n\nHell, that's more than I can say for most of the triple-A industry. Good on ya, dev.

Feels a lot like risk of rain.  Bubble + anything a lil too op, but on some chars u can't upgrade so not an issue.  Doesn't quite have the item selection risk of rain does but then again its early access.  Also not sure if items even stack/don't think they do.  Anyways a solid game that with more improvements could be really great.  Crisp controls.  Played well with an xbox controller.
