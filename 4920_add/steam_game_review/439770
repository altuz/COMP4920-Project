In the game there are challenges, and certain stats need to be a specific level in order to get through it without losing health. For example your strength stat might need to be at 20 in order to push an annoying troll into a fire. Only one problem, your stats need to be extremely high for every one of these challenges.\n\nSo unless you devote every single choice you make to advancing a couple of certain skills, you'll fail. It's not an autmatic failure, which is good, but eventually you'll run out of health. And even if you do keep improving certain skills, sometimes it won't even give you an option to use them, and thus, you'll lose even more health.

I can't think of a single choice I made in the game that actually felt meaningful to me. \n\nAnother bad thing about this game is that it seems to have 3 chapters.

The story is well-written with a large degree of customization from the onset. The game attempts to get you invested in both your character's upbringing and the relationship they have with their guardian. The villains remain largely an enigma in this chapter and it is implied that they are simply being human; most of the conspirators appear to be opportunists rather than any sort of dedicated evil mastermind.\n\nIf the game has a flaw, its that there is too much customization. As there are a plethora of stats, and thus stat checks, no one character can pass a majority of them. Just like in old pencil and paper tabletop RPGs, your character belongs to a Class and should behave accordingly. Although in theory the game is skill based, due to the fact that large stat gains are generally found in adopting class levels, it is in effect a Class system. Thieves generally do not do well at stand up fights and magicians should not try to pick locks. Splitting your focus will render many of the harder stat checks impossible. So approach this game with this in mind.\n\nAs the first chapter, it does well enough to set up the premise and gives you the freedom to guide your character's training for the upcoming challenges. It also features a colourful cast although without the right interactions, most of their characterization is only hinted at rather than stated outright. Overall its strengths lie in the story rather than system although the latter still services its role. Think of it as akin to one of the more mechanically driven gamebooks like Lone Wolf or Blood Sword and if that appeals to you, then this game should be your cup of tea.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 398, "steamid": "76561198006616886", "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1454523426}, "recommendationid": "20915969", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.507153", "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1454436599}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1454178892, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "The writing is very well done, but the game expects you to make decisions based on stats and depending on whether or not you have stayed on one path and only one path you will fail checks that could lead to your death.
