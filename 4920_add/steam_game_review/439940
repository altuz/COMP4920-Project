The pacing and building of suspense is top notch; there are several times where I thought the game was nearing its end only to draw me in and push me on some more. This goes on for hours, it's that big; which is very unusual in a free VN.\n\nThe game focuses on a group of eight protagonists: we get to know them, their backstory and character, and while the game is not afraid of re-using VN and anime tropes, it is aware of that and manages to not come off as clich\u00e9d throughout. It is here that the novel really shines: I was very interested to get to know these characters, and often seemed to know more about them than the narrator does. The crime mystery plot is also executed well. At the same time, this could never be the plot of a Disney movie: while there is a lot of (well-excuted) lightness, the game gets very dark at times, too.\n\nIt is not hard to choose those gameplay options that will result in uncovering most of the story elements, except for getting past the bad climax: remember to save when you get a phone call in the subway (you can right-click to access the menu from any screen) -- and you do need to get past it, the ending that follows is not a quick one. Apart from this episode, and a small section where the narrator perspective shifts to Riu (why was that even necessary?), story progression was smooth and kept me on edge.\n\nTechnically, this renPy game is well crafted and has all the features you'd expect: it runs windowed and works well on older systems.\n\nIf you like to read a good story, I can only imagine you discarding this game if you either have no tolerance for the high school dating sim tropes that this game employs in parts, or if it is too dark for you: you will find out about the latter in the first few minutes.

It's unfathomable. I drown myself in VNs to try to filter out the good, and this is on par with VNs like Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Shikkoku no Sharnoth, and both of their respective series. When I wasn't playing this, I was thinking about it, and when I was playing it, it kept my full attention. This review is honestly more of a thank you to the creators. You did a great job. I really hope you know that. I will be waiting for the rest to be revealed, piece by piece. \n\nIf I had any criticism, it would be that the \"antagonist\" (because as we learn, it isn't so simply straightforward) was easy to guess, especially as it's a common trope lately. Even so, the mystery pulled me in and made me want to understand the town this school was centered in. Another side note would be that the nods to actual stuff in reality by shifting the names were hilarious and amazing in places. Loved it, and everything else about this.\n\nI truly hope this is continued. Fantastic visual novel.

I want a sequel quick!)\n* Dedection sections are very fun; the player gets to be the detective, unlike in Higurashi\n* Free to play! This is totally a steal! Very much worth the time to go through!\n* The humor is AWESOME! Written very much for a Western audience, with great puns and hilarious situational humor.\n* When it's scary, it's SCARY, but no jump-scares, more like tiny little flashes of images that put you on edge. It's all the subtle things that make this game so thrilling.\n* I very much appreciate that, while there is violence, it doesn't go over the top, like \"999\" levels of description.\n* I'm probably one of the few to consider this a pro, but the lack of gratutious sexuality as is done so often in visual novels is very refreshing. I'm so glad the creators understand that we don't need sexual innuendos or panty shots to create humor and cut some tension (I'm looking at you, Corpse Party).\n* My personal preference: I like stories that are more linear among the bad endings, like Ace Attorney or Danganronpa. \n\nConsiderations:\n* In the style of Higurashi, where the first half is filled with a lot of \"everyday\" interactions and \"shenanigans\", as I like to call them. I understand why: to bond with the characters. But there were times when I was thinking, \"C'mon! Hurry up with the mystery portions!\" That being said, the \"shenanigans\" are very fun, and the character development is very well placed and spaced out in between. To the creators: my suggestion is to have more deduction sections, gameplay, or plot elements during these fun times. I know this is supposed to be a visual novel, but I feel that you have something going with the deduction sections that deserves more screen time.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 12, "steamid": "76561198300377088", "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1487277841}, "recommendationid": "29969885", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499550", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1487275402}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1485611056, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "doge approves", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 159, "steamid": "76561198090994670", "playtime_forever": 907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1491745224}, "recommendationid": "29541618", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499700", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485611056}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485665288, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Very captavating story and artwork.
