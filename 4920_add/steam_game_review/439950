Click = nothing happens\nAlso, menu options only being outside of the game itself is not a good way to construct your interface. I have no real experience creating video games so I don't know how easy/difficult it would be to fix these things but these are just simple aspects that could end up making or breaking your game.\n\nI have found even in the small amount of gameplay I've engaged with that there are many animals that will not attack or even run away when you shoot them. I eventually found my way into a valley after having spent some time gathering animal parts/rocks/trees etc. and ran into two wolves attacking a deer that was running in place. I killed one wolf and punched about 12 rounds into the other one, to no effect. The deer did not die either and there seemed to be a rather large hit barrier around all three of them, preventing me from getting too close to them.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I am aware this game is one day out of release.

They really nailed the landscape and scenery.

Misty mountain sides, vison obscured, the whole time its raining, its an amazing, and extremly realistic feel. \n\n\nMoonlight and nighttime is beautiful\nThe distance to see a campfire is super realistic, i've been out in the desert where you can see any type of light from super far away, which is the case here. (because its dark at night, with only the moon and the stars)\nWall mount mechanics are wonderful, the wall mounts snap to the walls quite well. \nIntuitive reloading system and using the same key for object rotation. Speaks to the three coders. A lot of coding goes in to that small flawless switch of needed controls. \n\n\nAgain, there are plenty of bugs in building mechanics, and they have plenty to do, but the potential and options for this game are endless.
