Why? There's no logical or gameplay reason for this. I end up with carriers being stranded all over the map, because it's not worth the effort to send another carrier to go get them. \n\nMinor Issues:\n\nThis far after launch, there's still some annoying bugs, like the fact that you can't research some technologies, even with the prerequesites for them, or you can, but they show up as grayed out, as if you could. Also, carriers still are listed as having \"movement: 1\" even after I researched the movement upgrade.\n\nThe game makes you watch battles that don't affect you, and you can't even tell who's who until after the battle is over. They're kind of boring to watch too. Battles in general could be more interesting.\n\nThe game falls a little flat on aesthetics: The whole look for the fleets is a little off, some species have \"fighters\" that look like cap ships on the map, the ground units for some look like they're carrying musical instruments instead of weapons.\n\nIt's not all bad, and I like the concept of a \"Twilight Imperium\" like computer game, but the dealbreaker for me is the carrier issue. I may change my review if they patch this.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 34, "steamid": "76561197987812289", "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1497920449}, "recommendationid": "31426588", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.523200", "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1493419786}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 4, "total_positive": 4, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 8}}
