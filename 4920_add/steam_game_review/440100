In many scenes - particularly action scenes - you often can't tell who's saying what, or what is happening to whom.  Some of the speech bubbles pop up in the wrong order.  If you're looking for the kind of VN that offers choices, you won't find any here.

I must say that it was a cool idea to release this comic book as i really enjoyed it. It is a nice appetiser to the After Reset game.  I understand that people got used to big titles to be released in a year's time after announcement but still do not understand the difference between multimillion budgets and hundreds of employees behind AAA games and small indie, self-funded teams trying to making something worth checking.
