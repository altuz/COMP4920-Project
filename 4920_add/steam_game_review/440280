Skill Based Combat : Aiming/Timing is key in this game especially when playing a ranged base character. There is plenty of room for players to outplay one another and I love that and im sure plenty of other pvp junkies do too. Nothing like going in a fight with low hp and out playing a full hp player.\n\n2. Variety: There are 4 different classes to choose from, with plans to add more in the future. Each class has a choice of a few weapons each with a variety of effects from slowing people with auto attacks to burning them over time etc... On top of each class having different weapons they each have the ability to choose two skills out of a list of a couple of skills adding a huge variety of gameplay styles mixing and matching skills and weapons.\n\n3. Gameplay Modes/Map Variety: There are several modes to choose from, ranging from a control point to last man standing and others. There also is a handfull of unique maps to play on with a nice unique medieval twist.\n\nCon's:    *Note this is a Early Access game so I understand bugs and whatnot are to be expected, just some thoughts on what i feel needs some love*\n\n1. Bot AI can use a little bit of work, occasionally i've seen them get stuck or fall off maps. Also they can sometimes take a while to find each other when it comes down to only bots left. For the most part though they aren't too bad and do occasional suprise me with some nasty combos\n\n2. Balancing: I know its early access and I would love to see a few tweaks to certain skills etc... Not to worried about this the devs seem very active and open to feedback and im sure in due time well get some balance changes. But for the most part I seem to be able to kill any of the other classes with any class.\n\nSo overall I think this game has HUGE potential and look forward to seeing how it develops over the course of its early access cycle. I can not wait to play ranked games against other players and climb the leaderboards or level my class to earn class based rewards, features i've heard that will eventually be coming our way. I'd give the game a solid 8/10 with potential to be a 10/10 as it progresses. This game truly does have the potential to be a pvp junkies paradise!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 77, "steamid": "76561198006525053", "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1463604446}, "recommendationid": "22554848", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503690", "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1461266834}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1462044839, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "I like this game for 3 reasons.\n\n1.

This was my first (and hopefully last) Early Access game. I bought this game on the first day it came out, I think, and this game is just as dead as it was the week it was released. There have been changes to the game, including an added leader board, but a lot of things essentially look the same. And the servers are either just as non-existent or inaccessible as they were months ago, which was the last time I played this game. So my only option is \"quick play\" with CPU (which isn't the reason why I bought this in the first place), and after many attempts, that hasn't even worked. It says, \"Could not find suitable server to connect to.\" Despite this game and Battlerite having a very similar graphic style and look, what distinguishes the two games isn't only that the latter is a MOBA game while this one a combat one, but also that the latter (Battlerite) is actually successful. $12 down the drain.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 54, "steamid": "76561198095270695", "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1477138749}, "recommendationid": "26162321", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.492791", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1477139136}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1461619142, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "love this game cant wait to see more people playing\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 17, "steamid": "76561198007673229", "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506303071}, "recommendationid": "22636752", "votes_down": 4, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.496863", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1461619142}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1461842371, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "This game looks promising!\n\nLike the other reviews, I'm impressed by what's been acomplished here by a two man team.

Is this game worth 15 bucks to me personally no. 10 bucks Seems like a fair deal simply because i feel like i have played this game for free. The game was called bierzerkers and the game is completley dead now. But it was still a fun game you get a sheep and had to throw it to score. But the rounds would end so quick before you even get to fight at times. So back to this game.\n\nEarly Access:\nMost games come out and fail, This game was released later than it's origonal date to release. I understand why, and i respect that. They did a good job. I did not find a whole lot wrong with the game but i did not spend hours on it either. Simply Because i feel like i've played it before with a different title on the game.\n\nSo while playing this game i was the dagger guy. I was hacking and slashing everyone. I was killing people in like 1 or 2 seconds and sometimes they kill me in one hit or 1 or 2 seconds. Fast pvp action, if that is your style of game. \n\nGood:\nYou can choose the colors you wear, \nWhat spell abilities you have, What moves you can do. \nFor each of these there are 4 to pick from or at least for the dagger guy there was. \nUnlike bierzerker which was a free game and gave you only the 2 handed weapon guy,\nWhen you buy this game, You have all of them. \nThere is a timer on the matches so you know how long you have to get stuff done.\nThe maps are different, not all the same like bierzerkers game. \nGraphics are very good and i love them.\nI know it sounds like i am comparing Bierzerker and Overpower a'lot but those of you \nwho have played Bierzerkers loved that game and can understand why when you play this\ngame ( Overpower ).\n\nBad:\nWhile playing the game, i felt as if i played this game before and pretty much did as i keep\nrepeating myself. \nSo here we go, while i was playing the game the matches started so fast. I did not have \ntime to really look at my loadout before others started fighting.\nI think there needs to be rounds for the death match not ( Respawn ) over an over. If that\nwas a game mode i did not see it, I only played quick match so if i am wrong please comment.\nSo other people do not get scared away from this. \nI think there needs to be meaning to playing the game, Moves to pick from, skins and all that is \ngreat but it means nothing when there is no leveling or money such as gold to be earned or a\nleader board to brag to your friends about. I did not see any of those things in this game. \nSo i did hop off of it pretty quick. \n\nShould you buy this game?\nYes...\nWhy?\nIf you like Pvp this is streight PvP and fast action. \nIf you want to beat your friends up.\n\nWhy should i not buy this game?\nIf you do not have 15 bucks, or simply do not like PvP games. \n\nTo end my Review, There is not a'lot of bugs i found wrong with this game. \nThe Market place is basically for new skins not to boost your stats because\nthere is no stats. So do not let the Market prices on the add stuff scare you\nfrom this game. Is this a game i will be playing day and night. Probably not.\nBut if i am Tired of playing Arma 3, Yes i will be on this game slashing away \nwith my Daggers. \n\nFor the Devs..... I really wanted to buy like a 2-4 pack to give copies to my friends. \nI think by you guys not allowing that to happen it may hurt the population of this\ngame. So id think of something to allow that to happen. Those 2-4 friends of mine\nmay end up doing the same to get their friends to play and we all win in the end. \nRemember to respect Post good or bad, no matter how much someone has played \nthe game. They still tried the game and are giving their own opinion. This is mine,\nI hope it was helpfull and i hope to kill you one day inside the game of OVERPOWER! :)", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 30, "steamid": "76561198194197047", "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1464723034}, "recommendationid": "22541218", "votes_down": 8, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.489808", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1461195652}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1463920757, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Right now, nope.\nCombat seems like a mess...\nThere can be some fun to be had in the battles.. but thats about it..\n\nWouldn't recommend it before something is added or adjusted.\nsome decent looking levels and visuals.\n\nWait before buying.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 405, "steamid": "76561198052469457", "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "last_played": 1465242942}, "recommendationid": "23136844", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.467126", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1463920757}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1486399415, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "bleep bloop", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 230, "steamid": "76561197993423353", "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1470351459}, "recommendationid": "29744595", "votes_down": 7, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.480192", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486399415}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487363486, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "[strike]Dead, but playable, has bots.\n\nR.I.P.[/strike]\n\nEdit: Game out of nowhere woke up from coma and got updated, there is still hope.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 374, "steamid": "76561198039865658", "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1495890795}, "recommendationid": "29992754", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502730", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495458772}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1492797919, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "GAME IS FUN AS HELL! only down side is its dead! 1 server and ther person is not even playing haha.. wish there were other games like this one but very active.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 117, "steamid": "76561198034018946", "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1492797743}, "recommendationid": "31280352", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492797919}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 3, "total_positive": 12, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 15, "total_reviews": 15}}
