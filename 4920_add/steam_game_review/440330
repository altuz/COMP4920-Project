Not only is the game really difficult to control, it would take only few simple changes and the game would suddenly be much more user-friendly. But even if you overcome the difficult control another huge problem are bugs. I have huge trouble finishing one level, because every time I play it, some bug occurs, and every time it is some different problem. That is incredibly annoying. It is a pitty, the game itself is fun and it could have been really good game, but those bugs and bad controls totally destroy the experience.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 31, "steamid": "76561198049865679", "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505160769}, "recommendationid": "34889654", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505161215}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 18, "total_positive": 17, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 35}}
