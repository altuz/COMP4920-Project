I really do. I wish the puzzles were hard, I wish it was scary, I wish the story gripped me and I wish the animation wasn't so god awful. \n\nBut the puzzles are not hard, the game wasn't scary (and loud jumpscares where it's suddenly quiet right before the grudge girl jumps out at me with full volume does NOT class as scary. That's lazy and cheap), the story didn't grip me and the animation was probably the scariest thing about it. \n\nThe heroine will break a window with a crowbar, throw it away and then go, \"Drat! I need a crowbar to pry off these nails!\" literally 10 seconds later. [i] Pick up the crowbar you just had, maybe? [/i] She also complains about touching a fridge full of cobwebs to the point I need to find a feather duster for her, but will later pick up the severed, bloody hand of some [i] random guy [/i] and won't bat and eyelid, or even ask for gloves. She'll see some leaves on a step and go \"You know what? I [i] need [/i] a tool to get rid of these leaves.\" even if she could use her hands. The game creates tasks for the sake of it. And it isn't very hard to realise what goes where. \n\nMost importantly, the developers of this game are possibly the worst developers I have ever seen/encountered. This game, originally was on Big Fish Games, and I played that 3 years ago, roughly. The sequel, of a three part series, was meant to be out in 2015. \n\nThe developers keep delaying it's release and give terrible reasons, claiming that it's super rare and unexpected ANOTHER delay has happened. This is possibly one of their most popular games and now only three people in the company are even working on it. Their Facebook is dead, everything is dead. They go off the radar for MONTHS and leave fans confused and expectant, only to tell them 5 months later that something else weird and improbable has happened that has delayed it further. \n\nIt's getting to the point I'm impressed this game even exists, since a second is clearly too difficult for them to fabricate. This game ends on a cliffhanger. A big one that had me invested years ago. It is not a game you want or will bother to wait 3 years for.\n \nThe achievements are also a big issue with this game. The main achievements ask that you finish it in expert mode, which has no hints and unskippable puzzles and hidden object screens which you must complete in less than 2 minutes. There are 34 of them. You must complete all of them in less than 2 minutes. That itself isn't exactly easy. You also cannot skip cut scenes, credits or ignore pieces of the stories in the form of notes scattered around the place. And the worst one? \n\nYou must complete the game in one sitting. You cannot exit the game once you begin it. That INCLUDES the DLC with it. \n\nThis, if you're lucky and good at these games, will take you 6 hours. This took me 6 hours and I've played this game in the past numerous times, so I'd like to think I'm an old friend to it. \n\nSome people, who don't have lives like me, may be thinking, \"Well that's fine, that's doable. I like playing these games in one sitting. I'm sure I can play expert and get all these parameters.\" \n\n[i] Well, that's where you're wrong, kid. [/i] \n\nI got two hours in, and the game decided to crash on me when I paused it to go get a drink. \nMy PC is worth \u00a31.5k. It can handle a lousy point and click game easily. And because this useless game decided to add impossible achievement standards, I had to restart it from the beginning, because otherwise I wouldn't get the achievements. And that's arguably a huge part of even playing point and click games.\n\nThe worst achievement ties all of these achievements into one. It requires you \"max out\" the game in one sitting, or you don't get it. I missed this achievement by 1 collectable figurine out of 12, with every other 37 achievements being popped and achieved. \n\nI have to restart the entire thing because collectables do not carry on from other games and it will not accept an incomplete or not-perfect run.\n\nI have never been angrier at a game, and I'm sat here at 2am telling the internet because I'm so angry.\n\nI don't even care that it's \u00a31.79 right now, don't waste your money.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 382, "steamid": "76561198162235689", "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1505867835}, "recommendationid": "35075253", "votes_down": 9, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.511734", "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1505870399}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506017467, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Can understand some of the issues raised by different people however I thought the game was good. \n\nPros:\n\u2022\tStory\n\u2022\tGeneral feel\n\u2022\tAtmosphere\n\u2022\tClever (in parts)\nCons:\n\u2022\tIssues Screen res\n\u2022\tBit repetitive\n\u2022\tNot finished 2nd game\n\n Would I say this was the best point and click game that I\u2019ve ever played?

I kept waiting for the scary, but they never delivered, but they had a good setup for it!\n\nWas it worth the 70% off price of $2 and some change that I paid for it? Heck yes! Would I pay full price for this? Heck no! And I was like ok let me check out the CONTINUATION game...oh wait, you mean, years later it's still not out? So, I guess I just never get to figure out what this whole entire first installment was leading up to? Cool, thanks guys. Tip: don't release a game in parts unless you're QUITE SURE you'll have those other parts out in a reasonable amount of time, otherwise, just wait until it's all ready to release at once, OR end the first part with a somewhat satisfying ending so in case the other parts don't happen, at least the players won't be TOO annoyed.

A good game in the horror genre! Problem is, with psychological horror games, you rarely buy the story: often unbelievable, with too many beasts or monsters everywhere and other incredible things .. Playing True Fear: Forsaken Souls Part 1 made me come around as the experience was breathtaking for someone usually disliking the genre. I would never have imagined myself saying this of such a game but the fact is that the very positive rating is well-deserved! \nAt first glance I thought it would be a little casual Hidden Objects Scenes game. I bought it while I was sick, my brain was out of order and I wasn\u2019t in a mood for big challenges such as those you might deal with in other adventure games. I was therefore expecting a boring story driving me from HOS to HOS and nothing else.  Unexpectedly I got quickly hooked to the plot and I found myself deeply immersed in the complex story of an intriguing game! \nMy guess is, people who were disappointed and wrote negative reviews are supposedly:\n1/confirmed adventure gamers.. to whom this game might have seem pretty easy. And that\u2019s true, it\u2019s fairly casual and thus not extremely challenging.  \nOR \n2/people looking for real horror, jumpscares and such.. which this game does not deliver. There is only psychological horror as the story beyond is staggering and making you feel uneasy, but the playthrough itself is somewhat peaceful. There are no \u201crun for your life\u201d or whatsoever. \nOR \n3/ classic HOS fans.. for this game isn\u2019t a classic HOS. Be aware that there are not classic HOS at all in this game. \nNow let me state this about the so-called HOS scenes in True Fear/Forsaken Souls. Those are more interactive objects scenes involving actions such as \u201cnotice a key, grab it to open a box\u201d, \u201cfind another item in that box that will operate something\u201d else etc.. until you obtain something useful in the game. So, yes, it\u2019s quite different from classic HOS and actually not bad at all. It\u2019s way more dynamic then just looking for and clicking on objects written on a list. For starter there is no list or whatsoever. At the beginning of each \u201cobjects scenes\u201d you\u2019re clueless.\nSo it\u2019s definitely an adventure game, of the casual sort but a fair one. That means no hard puzzles and no long hours scratching your head, wondering what to do next. But a real plot and an interesting story.\n\nI wanted to write a review to give True Fear its fully deserved credit but I don\u2019t want to say too much so I don\u2019t spoil your playtime. All I will say about the plot you\u2019ll learn it in the first 10 or 15 minutes of play. \nWhen I started this game, first things I noticed were beautiful graphics and shortly after, for once in a lifetime, no boring cutscenes! There are cutscenes but those are short, thrilling and totally in the plot. They\u2019re not only here to make the game seem longer. \nMusic is fine by me. Not pervasive. Discreet enough and sticking to the atmosphere: some piano and violin tunes. As well as voice acting and other game sounds: crows shrieking, soft whispers, doors slamming etc.. \nIn the 1st act of that 1st part, the atmosphere is somehow unpleasant, but I wouldn\u2019t say frightening (no jumpscares). It\u2019s very creepy. \nTo say the least, at the very beginning you\u2019re awaken by the mailman who brings you a letter in which you hear from your sister for the 1st time in ten years. She needs you so you directly come to her place. But instead of meeting with her you find yourself alone in an abandoned and lifeless house where the only living creatures are spiders, bugs, cockroaches and mice. The place is more or less dark.  Dust and cobwebs are everywhere. Broken things, empty frames and blood stains furnish the scenery and you can hear whispers amongst other unreassuring sounds. Everything points to a spooky atmosphere.\nNow you\u2019re looking for answers to questions like why isn\u2019t your sister here although she\u2019s been asking you to come to that peculiar address. And all the questions rose by the bewildering things surrounding the house. \n\nAmongst things contributing to the very good feeling I have towards True Fear is the storyline: it is very solid. The progression of the thrill goes along with the pace of the game. \nExpect a thrilling suspense slowly growing as you find all sort of messages giving you clues and discover evidence of what might have happened. That thrill is well developed throughout the whole game.\nYou\u2019ll do many back and forth inside both main locations (in fact you\u2019ll visit 2 houses) but these houses aren\u2019t that big so it doesn\u2019t affect the game. \nSecond and third acts of this 1st episode take place in your grandparents\u2019 house, where you used to live with your sister when being children. In that location there is light, less cobwebs or creepy stuffs. All in all it\u2019s more alive but I found these acts far more scary than the 1st, from a psychological angle, due to the things you learn. There again, no jumpscares.\nThere are few moments in the whole game when you could be unsettled, at most, but those moments are perceptible and the \u201csurprises\u201d easy to guess. \n\nI concede that not everything is brilliant in this game and there are still some downsides in the gameplay [spoiler] like finding a light bulb in the fridge.. [/spoiler]. The house is a mess, I admit, but please! \nAnother thing I dislike is that it\u2019s very linear but I think that goes with the development of the story and it\u2019s a necessary evil not to ruin the plot. \nFor the price, especially if on sale, you have to give it a try. I hope I made you want to see it by yourself and experience a great and awesome thrill. \nAs far as I\u2019m concerned I see it\u2019s a sequel and I\u2019m really looking forward to playing the next episodes!  After this first chapter my expectancies are high!! \n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 465, "steamid": "76561198015324296", "playtime_forever": 1216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1130, "num_reviews": 23, "last_played": 1506136118}, "recommendationid": "35111833", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506021358}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506145654, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Where's Part 2?", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 475, "steamid": "76561198013982821", "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 75, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506864901}, "recommendationid": "35144974", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.498642", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506145654}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505832861, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Pretty standard point and click game but with nice mood an interesting enough developing backstory that you want to find out what happens in Part II.\n\nWith that said this has got to be the most contrived game I have ever played. Its just a bunch of closed containers and you search either for a key or a way to break into the container. Once you find some ultra ancient mystical key that unlocks this magical box inside you find...... a can opener? And that can opener lets you open a container that contains a key to another container that has inside of it.... a screwdriver? If that weren't bad enough you leave the can opener and screw driver behind after using them and then several times later in the game you find new can openers and screw drivers just lying around. Was that first can opener that special that you put it in a mystical box?\n\nSome of the actions you must take are also just plain silly.  There's a toy airplane on the desk. I must turn on the fan to make it fly away to reveal a key behind it. Why couldn't I just move the toy with my hand? Lots of other secrets are revealed in a fake chance kind of way. I replace the missing piece on some object and that causes another object in the room to randomly fall down revealing a key.  The game just makes solving things seem random and pointless.\n\nWhat this game is lacking is ingenuity. Most games like this let you combine objects in interesting and non-obvious ways.
