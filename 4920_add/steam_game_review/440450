Given the game is out since early Dec 2016 would think that in 6 months time it would be further along. Still it is rather empty and boring. Set to easy I only encountered on AI with a shotgun easily took him out. Then it was a lonely world. Found another island and still falling asleep. \nOn Normal difficulty AI with handgun is easy to take down unarmed. If you can pick up his gun is a crap shoot as you can not find it in the thick bushes. Guy with the assault rifle seems to be able to see through the brush to kill you before you can get to a point where you see out the bushes. \n\nI will not recommend this game at this time. I understand very well its EA and a WIP but the Progress does not seem to be far along. Substinence is another EA of the same type and that game is moving along well. More to do more danger to avoid. So even try to say this is a one man Dev.....that does not fly as Substience is also one man. \n\nI gave my opinion here its up to the reader to choose what to do with my opinion.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 93, "steamid": "76561198067207576", "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "last_played": 1493044077}, "recommendationid": "31340268", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.497418", "votes_up": 3, "developer_response": "First off, I'll say thanks for the well-written review. Positive or negative, constructive feedback is always welcome. However, the two games are quite different. I have not played subsistence, although it has been on my wishlist for some time. The main difference I perceive between the two is unlike most games, mine pushes the player into moving. Staying and setting up camp for a couple of days in game is usually the maximum you'd want to hang out at one safehouse. In a later patch, this will be enhanced even more by attacks being mounted on safehouses you're camping out at for too long. But for now, there is the fact that your supplies will dwindle and you cannot simply craft a gun or grow crops in a matter of days, so you must keep moving. After all, the only goal is escape, not to set up a fortress. But at the end of the day, the game is really designed around constant movement, and a \"turtle\" approach won't make for much fun. It's really a matter of taste whether you like this style or not, I can appreciate base building games as well, but a big focus in this game is to get to the main island and get a vehicle to move around it rapidly.\n\nAs for updates, I've been doing them almost weekly for the past 5 months, I would like to do more but I'll admit they haven't been as comprehensive as I'd like them to be. I've been busy looking for a second job to help fund the project further for things such as voice actors, etc.\n\nP.S. Have you tried Operation Freetown? It's pretty early right now, but next patch it'll be a lot more playable. Instead of jungle combat it's urban and the AI don't have many places to hide. Also there are no NPC's that have handguns, so looking for a handgun on a dead body will be a fruitless task.", "timestamp_updated": 1493044834, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1493060298}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1496529664, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Well I played the game for a short period of time and I am requesting a refund.
