I figure, for $10, it's gotta be something semi-good, I'll give it a shot. Nope, wrong again.\n\nStock unity assets. Loading screens after walking 20 feet. Poor design choices. Generic environments. Uninspired gameplay.\n\nThis is what I get for trusting steam and this developer. Not even entertaining enough for a Markiplier Let's Play.\n\nThere's nothing horror or scary about this. I want a refund. **UPDATE: I got a refund. This is the second time ever out of my 800 something games I've requested a refund on. The other was War Z. **\n\nDev: I'm sorry to be so harsh, but you should seriously be ashamed charging $10 for this.

I feel like I need to give it a shot after a few months(and hopefully patches). Though this may simply fall into the 'Not for me' category personally.\n\nAs you can see I don't even have an entire hour logged. This is not so much due to bugs as it is the frustration that I've dealt with in this game.\n\n[b]I really wanted to like this game.[/b] It has a lot of potential, but I feel like it sort of missed the mark for me. I'm not bothered by the length or aesthetic at all. Just the actual game itself.\n\nIt wasn't fun that running kills is lethal. I feel like you already walk painfully slow but to be forever bound to moving so slowly everywhere was making me batty. I like to explore a lot so moving slowly can be very problematic when I'm trying to get back to what I was doing before I wandered off. \n\nSecond, I kept dying to some strange beast creature that would spawn on top of me, knock me over, and appeared to be humping my unconscious face. This isn't a git gud situation. Sometimes pursuit music would play when it was following me, but more often than not it wouldn't. This left me feeling not scared but very confused about how this thing keeps spawning on top of me and one-shotting me. \n\nI am a huge fan of horror games and honestly it doesn't take much to scare me at all. But this game only came off as mildly spooky because I couldn't get past the frustration. \n\nIt looks like there were a few who were able to complete the game without having the same problems as me which is cool. :) \n\nI didn't have the same experience though so it's gonna be a no from me until some changes are made(if at all).", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 911, "steamid": "76561197997678124", "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "last_played": 1455983463}, "recommendationid": "21343108", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.508705", "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1455984274}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1457550363, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "We, at GotGAMING7, have made a full let's play series on this game.
