The story is engaging and the characters are colorful and witty.  Personally, I was very impressed with the balance of challenge without feeling like I had to grind for hours to advance the story.

Definitely recommended.  Nice job, guys, will be keeping an eye out for your future stuff.  :)", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 34, "steamid": "76561198046876576", "playtime_forever": 1138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1505593906}, "recommendationid": "35006779", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500150", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505594560}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504646631, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I loved it <3 the game was fun, albeit short, it had interesting characters, the story was good, and the dev actually responds to twitter dms really fast for questions, im pretty bad at saying what i like about things, but i liked this game a lot.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 43, "steamid": "76561198012658238", "playtime_forever": 1865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1504592859}, "recommendationid": "34764872", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500150", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504646631}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505300459, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "It is a good game with good storyline, environment, battle machanism and the one i like the most +>> the MUSIC!\nQuite enjoying when I was playing this game.
