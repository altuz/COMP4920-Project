I have been following the game for a while and was waiting on it exiting EA to get the full experience. After the long wait, I was pretty disappointed. The tutorial was abyssmal, you learn nothing but the absolute basics, it doesn't teach you what any icons mean or do, it doesn't teach you how to manipulate the genes besides \"Mate these two\". \n\nYou have an entire dna helix representing the presumably predisposed genes the animal has but with no background on what they mean or how to manipulate them, short of seeing that you are likely to have offspring with bad or slightly less bad eyesight/hearing/smell/strength/etc and if its +0, +1, or +2 to an attribute.\n\nUltimately the gene choices mean nothing, they make VERY little impact on the actual game. It is incredibly slow paced and boring. You can decide to fight, forrage etc. but, they are all literally the same. Wanna be warriors? Try to manipulate genes to give you attack power, click on an enemy and that's it. Forrage? Exact same thing, find a nut/berry bush/clam/etc. click on the icon and that's it. \n\nTake the term strategy VERY lightly, as there is very little. You just blindly wander through a map looking for other npcs to mate or kill and that's about it. There is no strategy to speak of, find someone that you will get killed by, run away. Find something you can kill but, can't offer to join your tribe, kill it. The game lacks depth.\n\nOne of the very interesting ideas the game put forth was senses, you can choose to perceive your surroundings using sight, hearing, and smell. They allow you too \"see\" different things. Sight will let you see things like acorns on the ground, smell and hearing let you see other animals in the bushes, and so on. The downside however, the is virtually no reason to use sight, tall grass renders it pretty useless and it's way easier to just use sound or hearing as not only does it let you \"see\" through things like grass, it by default gives you a larger range to \"see\". Which is unfortunate as the game is actually quite nice to look at when you can see the vibrant colors and details, all of which you miss in the superior hearing/smelling modes.\n\nThere are not a lot of genetic mutations to unlock, and a vast majority of them are strictly cosmetic and add nothing to the game.\n\nThis could have been a much better and deeper game and might very well be with updates but, as it stands now fully released with very little depth, an atrocious tutorial for a game with very unobvious mechanics, and generally boring gameplay I cannot recommend buying this game.\n\nTake the vast amount of positive reviews with a grain of salt, as the majority of them are staunch Niche supporters and have been playing well into EA and are pretty biased.

This game is amazing. If your into survival games, if you like turn based games, if you love animals and like a challenge (especially when it comes to breeding a creature you like) this is the game for you.\n\nI've only ot 12 hours on this account but I originally logged about 40 hours on my sisters before buying it myself. I think I started playing back on 0.3.0 and the game has come on leaps and bounds since then. I originally saw this game and knew I would love it just because of the art. Its such a cute game with amazing artwork that has inspired allot of beautiful fan art in return. I've also always loved games that involve breeding animals, it fascinates me and this game takes it that one step further by making genes that your survival depends on.\n\nCons: \n-If you don't like micro mangment your not going to like this game. You have to micro manage every move and action your creature makes. You have to choose specific genes you want to try and breed into your tribe for EVERY creature.\n\nPros (AKA why I love the game)\n-If you like micro managment see above, I like micro managment, at the very least it dosnt bother me!\n-With a diverse gene pool of colours, patterns, claws, eyes, horns and special ancient genes (plus many more) you end up with a diverse and intresting tribe of creatures. Its can be a fun challenge to try and breed a creature that can not only survive and thrive, but look exactly how you want.\n-Challenging terrain makes for intresting game play as your forced to adapt to your enviroment. From growing gills to deal with water and posion fangs to help you harvest poisnous berries your forced to hunt for the perfect mate to join your tribe.\n-The danger doesn't just lie in what is under your feet but what lurks around you. Rouge males with negative genes stalk you through the grass waiting for a lone female to stray from the tribe, leeches lurk at the water's edge waiting to grab onto a passing baby (or even worse a bird swooping down and grabbing your baby!) and the big bearyenas roam around. These threats force you to keep on your toes and depending on what genes you have in your tribe you can try to fight or run. A fun update before launch added the possibility of bearyena hybrids that can introduce important genes into your tribe and I hope to see more hybrids introduced in the future!\n\nTo sum it up it's a cute entertaining game. If your unsure watch some of the many youtube videos that are already out about previous releases.

When I was a little girl, I was fascinated with genetics and heredity.  I used to make up games where you could see the genes of imaginary creatures, then breed them and see how those genes were passed on to their children.  I fervently wished that someone would make that game for real.  20 years later, I got my wish. :) \n\nNiche is full of adorable creatures whose genes have a real impact on not only their appearance, but the ways they can interact with the world around them.  Your job is to take control of a tribe, helping them to explore and ensuring their survival as they move from island to island.  Each island has different challenges for the Nichelings to overcome, and the abilities they get from their genotypes will determine how well they can gather food and deal with predators in each environment.  \n\nThere are many, many different ways to survive, so you're not locked into keeping a specific set of genes.  Nichelings use real genetics (including mutations!) and you can use this to guide the direction of your tribe.  Will you breed a tribe of mighty hunters?  Efficient gatherers?  Or maybe you just want your Nichelings to have adorable tiger stripes?  It's up to you!  You can even ignore the mutation system entirely and see what nature gives you.  An individual Nicheling's lifespan is relatively short, so making sure there are children who can carry on the tribe's legacy is an important part of the game.  My favorite part is just watching how the tribe evolves over time and seeing all the changes and mutations that my choices have introduced.\n\nIf you have even a passing interest in genetics, cute creatures, and survival games, I highly recommend Niche.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 283, "steamid": "76561198078827819", "playtime_forever": 2445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 134, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506093099}, "recommendationid": "34971905", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1505482317}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506493931, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I originally purchased this game for my four year old son, who is amazed with genetics and animals .

The creatures are completely shrouded in grass! Can't see them or anything in the grass for that matter. Different view modes don't help and seem unecessery. It really takes away from the point of the game, which is to breed little critters for different traits, if you can't see the results without wasting turns to clear brush.\n\n2) Camera views - see above. I'm constantly trying to manuever the camera to see where / how many little beasties I even have. You can tab over to your next critter, which you will need to do b/c you'll never find it by just looking. In the end though, the control of the cameras is wasted b/c I have to keep the camera in a very small window above the map just to see stuff. Zooming in to see the critters up close only shows you how much more annoying the grass is. Zoom out enough and you'll see a tree. Cool. Except that the clipping plane on the camera cuts out the top of the tree when you're in the \"sweet spot\" so you can actually tell what you're doing.\n\n3) You'll end up playing the game by solely looking at icons (move, collect, etc) because you'll have no idea what is on an adjacent tile just by looking - due to the bad grass component of this game.  Seriously, the grass is making this nearly unplayable. If you must keep it, give the user an option to reduce opacity or something. The game doesn't need grass to obscure the map. Ever heard of Fog of War? Look at ANY other turn-based strategy. Just cloud the areas out of the creature's \"sight\". Right now, the damn beast could have sight +100 and it wouldn't matter b/c YOU THE USER can't tell grass from a critter. Bushes once they are found - can't actually see them. or know they are there. I need to use icons to tell what is on a tile that is not in the fog and is right next to my creature. \n\n4) What is with the bird constantly blocking the camera? Bad. The bis shows up and now I have to move the camera to see the board. \n\nI wish I could post a screen shot so you can see the grass covering everythng. So bad.\n\nOther than that, I like the game. I hope you fix this grass issue or I won;t be able to play this too much longer I fear. I can;t be the only one who has mentioned this.

Most people probably will find this game boring or repetitive, and at times, it is. It's a game I like to play when my friends are telling stories or I'm listening to a podcast. It doesn't take much concentration, but still just enough overall to keep me playing.\n\nI have still yet to beat story mode, as the game can be surprisingly difficult at times. Mostly it's slowly moving your way through an area and just collecting food or trying to survive, but every now and then there is that panic and rush for more food or a suffient mate to carry on your tribe's legacy. This game is right about making it hard to survive very long, because it's a genetics game. Lots of things don't work. I LIKE that about the game. It makes it feel very important to pay attention to little things in your tribe's gene pool, and you have to consider what needs to change to improve survival. But usually, things aren't that easy. You'll come across a lot of weird future mates in the wild, and have no choice but to try your luck with them. Usually, it ends up in more oddities that need to be fixed in future generations. And don't even get me started on Rogue Males. Please, guys. Leave my females alone. We don't have enough food for more babies that will end up being made Omegas.\n\nWhen I first saw this game my instant thought was \"huh, so this is a furry game, right?\" and yeah. I kinda is. If that is something you refuse to deal with, then I guess this game isn't for you. The way the animals look all together is just very, uh, furry-ish? But I've come to think it very charming, and start to understand why some people who play the game like to add their own lore / story to their tribes.\n\nOn the topic of adding your own lore, sometimes I wonder if that's how the game is meant to be played. The gameplay is repetitive and kind of dull after a few hours, which makes sense being a genetics game where your goal is to simply survive, but it gets a little stale. I think people add stuff to their playthroughs to spice it up, and that's cool! I'm not so good at assigning random lore to my tribes, personally. Because that one Rogue Male will come up and breed with all of my females, and I'll be at kind of a loss for how I can make that a cool part of my story.\n\nThis game is, hmm, it's hard to say if I actually recommend it. Since it gets stale and the entire game is VERY much for a niche market (which consists of furries, people who played spore as kids, or a combination of both). For people who are PART of that market, go buck-wild, my friends. It leaves some stuff to be desired, but it's a solid enough game in itself for me to not regret getting it. But I know A LOT of my friends would really not find any fun in the game, and that's important to keep in mind before making the purchase.\n\nAll in all, it's good enough to keep my attention. I'm looking forward to possble future updates that will spice up the gameplay a bit more. The art and music is fine the way it is, so gameplay is all I'm looking forward to being improved, even if just a little. I think the game would benefit from random events, even if its extreme stuff like \"oh hey look at that, a meteor. Have fun trying to survive that!\". I think the game would be a lot more appealing with that kind of thing added! I personally enjoy the game, so I recommend it, but maybe look into it before you make the purchase.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 120, "steamid": "76561198080179215", "playtime_forever": 963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 963, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1507087656}, "recommendationid": "35403715", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506915284}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506484546, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I was quite receptive to the idea of a new genetics based game with cute critters, and for the price I would say got my money's worth.\n\nHowever, while cute, this game is has quite a number of glaring flaws that keep me from enjoying it for very long.\n\nFirst and foremost, the grind for food gets old very fast. Farming the same berry bushes and acorn trees is the only way to really consistently get food. Everything else is just a lucky supplement. Get used to doing this for hours on end while making very little progress on advancing.\n\nI am also not a fan of the so-called resource management. From the very first island, I was scratching my head on why my baby nichling had a lifetime's worth of food on his person. On the flipside, you need to mow down a small island's worth of grass to just to build a single nest that will break after a couple of days. Thankfully, permanent randomly generated nests are not uncommon, but then what even is the point of building one? \n\nThe whole appeal of the game for me was exploring and finding new genetic traits to work with. But, as it turns out, that's not how the game works. You actually have to grind \"quests\" to unlock genes you want, such as repeatedly drowning a bunch of baby nichlings in the ocean until you unlock some swimming mutations (because water tiles have a chance to damage you). Even if you get lucky and find an outside source for a gene you want, its a waste of time trying to breed it into your stock because ALL GOOD GENES ARE RECESSIVE. So you will either end up with the same derp-faced herbivores until the gene you wanted dies out, or you isolate and inbreed and risk destroying your fertility and immunity. And once you unlock mutations, you can apply them to whatever child you want. So presumably, eventually genetics become a non-factor!\n\nLastly, there are no meaningful interactions with AI controlled units. Neutrals wander about and do not compete for food (they do not eat as far as I can tell) until you invite them into your tribe. Aggressive units make beelines to your tribe to damage or kill them. Rogue males will make a beeline for all your females to impregnate them, which wouldn't necessarily be an issue if it weren't for the fact that every rogue spawn has the worst genes possible. Like, so bad that these creatures wouldn't even survive in their environment if it wasn't for the fact that AI units don't need food. You are also the only tribe in existence, which is a shame, because having multiple tribes to compete with and mix genes with would give this game some much needed depth. Imagine struggling to survive in a swampy wasteland and encountering an aggressive tribe with poison immunity for instance.\n\nIt's still cute, and there is potential there. Shame it was released in this stage though. It feels more of a proof-of-concept than a complete game.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 91, "steamid": "76561198047109574", "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 711, "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1507190682}, "recommendationid": "35234993", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504263", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1506485484}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506701777, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This game still needs a ton of work.
