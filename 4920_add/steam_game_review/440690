Now exploring an abandoned hospital isn't exactly new when it comes to horror games but its done well here. With just about everything you do in the game, the novel gets written and you can see what you have so far by pressing R. This is actually pretty cool but it gets old fairly fast as it updates so frequently that if you try to check it every time you get an update then you'll never get through the game and if you put it off too long then you end up with a crap ton to read, I don't know about you guys but I don't play games to read.\n\nIf you ignore the actual novel and just play the game then there's a lot to recommend. The graphics, while not world-beating, are very good and do a lot to create the atmosphere. The hospital is dark but not too dark. There are some technical problems (as with nearly every indie game) but none of them were enough to ruin the game. The story is very good. I won't spoil any of it here, but it really pushed me further into the game to find out what is going on.\n\nOne of the selling points of the game is that there is no combat. Don't take this to mean that you can't die. I have. Multiple times.\n\nAll in all, its a very spooky game. The story is very intriguing and told in a new way (the novel) and its definitely worth $5 (at time of writing) if you're into indie horror.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 262, "steamid": "76561198121351603", "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1457466445}, "recommendationid": "21412449", "votes_down": 4, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.550687", "votes_up": 50, "timestamp_updated": 1456258785}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1456260831, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Just finised the game and I really enjoyed it.\n\nFlashbacks are fun to watch.

Kudos to the developer for making this game all by himself on Unreal Engine. \n\nThe graphics and the sound effects of the game are really well, and help create a compelling atmosphere. You, the player, writing an ingame novel is a pretty unique concept. It adds to the overall feeling of the game making you bring up the story and read it. And if you are somehow stuck it will guide you through the game.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are fun to solve and not too hard to ruin the game experience and comsume too much of your time.

As the player, you are constantly getting stuck in walls, walls in which you didn't walk into in the first place but for some reason, you now find yourself stuck. Similarily, I found it increasingly difficult to be able to walk up stairs! My character just did not seem to want to move, as if the first stair was blocking his way... \n\nAlong with the clunkyness of it all, if you fail a puzzle attempt, the whole screen goes black, almost as if the game has crashed but then it lights back up with obscured camera angles and eventually takes you back to where you failed before.\n\n\nThe game is quite short, even with reading everything you can find, you're looking at an average time of 3 hours. Mesel does manage to tell its story in that timeslot and it is worthwhile with its flashbacks and an overall focus on storytelling which was translated efficiently into English, unlike a lot of other indie horrors here on Steam. \n\nI would recommend this game for the indie horror lovers only (especially those that like to read) and on a sale.
