The bullets are hard to process all at once, and it feels almost certain you are going to get hit, and attacking feels off as well. This is normally the point at which I would say to myself, \"That's not the game's fault, I'm just not very good at it yet.\" The problem is, it has a TERRIBLE respawn system. You have 10 lives, and it uses one to respawn you at the last checkpoint every time you die. This doesn't reset any of the enemies, it is literally just walking slowly through an empty box back to where you were. In boss battles, the checkpoint is not right outside the boss room, but instead inside, so you are thrown right back in every time you die. And when your 10 lives run out, you have to restart the level. This may not sound so bad, but combined with the unorigional plot of \"We were happy until the circles came, circles are evil, you can save people from the circles, etc.\" and the inability to skip dialogue, I hope you have some good reading material on hand if you plan on dying a lot.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 54, "steamid": "76561198140533770", "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "last_played": 1457914723}, "recommendationid": "21842448", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504265", "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1457992655}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1457224764, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Im not very far into the game, but I can say I have already been captured by the amazing soundtrack, incredible story, and twist on what graphics have to be. Firstly, the 8-bit feel of the music is incredible, and fits so well with the game. The story seems to be pretty great (even though I've bearly played any of it yet). I love how you could have had a violent shooter with gruesome graphics but instead decided to simlify a difficult story with basic geometry. I haven't played much, but the game seems very difficult so far and I love that! It's not something everyone can do quickly. I just love everything abput this game and can't wait to play it more! Also, I noted that this was made with unity3d and I think Unity is a great software for game dev, so you can coun't on flawless framerates and uninterrupted music as well as the quality of the game itself.
