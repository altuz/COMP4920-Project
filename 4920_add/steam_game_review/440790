Apparently this was supposed to be an old-school point-n-click adventure game, and being a fan of this genre (been playing since the '80s) I couldn't wait to try this one out.\n\nSadly, the horrible - and I mean [b][i]horrible[/i][/b] - English put me off so much that I just couldn't bring myself to continue playing. Whole sentences need revision, and the vocabulary is so, [i]so[/i] bad that it's face-contortingly jarring. And it doesn't help that there's a relatively large amount of reading and text involved.\n\nAdd to that a very amateurish feel to the whole thing ([b]this game plays like something that should be free[/b]), and unoriginal, uninspired puzzles that have extremely poorly written instructions (not that they're needed - you can figure things out on your own, but why write instructions when they're incomprehensible and would be of no help to anyone?), a tired, badly put-together, barely there, [i]somewhat-of-a[/i]-storyline, and I seriously wonder how this game got greenlighted.\n\nAnd the movement makes absolutely no sense - screens roll up and down, when you're supposed to be walking forwards or backwards respectively. Why?!\n\nOh, and objects aren't labelled, and there's no way of telling if they're \"active\" or not.\n\nAll in all, this game feels like some 9-year-old kid made it in his spare time. \n\nThis game should be free.
