My attention span for games seems to be around 15-20 hours but this kept me interested the whole time, up through about level 103 out of 130. And I'd still be playing it if it weren't for the dark holes.\n\nThey are not fun. At all. They are like gravity holes that suck you in and spin you around them. They are highly annoying and hard to escape without falling to your death. It was a ton of fun for the first 100 levels but I lost interest after fighting dark holes for 30 minutes.\n\nHonestly, I almost think the game is *too* long. 100 levels and a bit faster upgrades would be better, imo. The upgrades are nice and for the most part keep you motivated, but I fell behind in the \"passive\" upgrades. I then came to a level that you apparently need one of the passives to get all the gems. I will have to complete 10+ levels and not upgrade anything else before I can go back and finish that one. So...don't do that.\n\nThe levels also get progressively more elaborate and a few of them in the 90's got a bit tedious, but the level design overall is very good.\n\nMovement is defintely not perfect, but it's workable once you get the hang of it. It can be a bit frustrating at times, like when you need to jump through a one-character high hole. \n\nThe boss fights are mostly on the easy side. A couple of them took 4-5 tries but most were 1 or 2 tries. \n\nOverall, it is a very fun game that is worth the price even if you end up wimping out at the dark holes as I have. I will probably go back and finish it at some point but even if I don't it was money well spent.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 932, "steamid": "76561198042628923", "playtime_forever": 1500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "last_played": 1460601683}, "recommendationid": "22387591", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505654", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1460550527}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1462732077, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "My first look and review of Trial by Viking:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dgbVs6Jy964", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 48, "steamid": "76561198264268158", "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1463351418}, "recommendationid": "22868002", "votes_down": 4, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.490872", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1462732077}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1467991957, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "The fact that this game is level based already disqualifies it from being a \"metroidvania\" game as the developers like to claim. the controls are smooth, the momentum makes sense, but if an enemy hits you, you can get sent back into a crevice with no way of getting out.\n\nAs a whole, I do feel this game is fun, but they suckered me in by saying it was a metroidvania style game which is such a blatant lie that I will no longer trust the devs of this game.", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 18, "steamid": "76561198119773440", "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1468723632}, "recommendationid": "24184348", "votes_down": 15, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.472916", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1467991957}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1459357364, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Metroidvania steps up!
