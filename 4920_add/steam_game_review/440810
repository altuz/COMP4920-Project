Characters are nicely drawn, with their appearance ranging from cute to sexy to both. As for dating sim elements, however, sadly only a few of the game\u2019s large cast are date-able, though those that are have over a dozen scenes for each of them, with a large number of scenes offering you dialogue choices.\n\nBullet Hell aspect is top-notch: while early levels are easy enough, the later levels and bosses are quite challenging even with top-tier cards, especially since character\u2019s level doesn\u2019t prevent her from dying in one hit. But levels are quite short, and you can restart from the level you failed at, which makes Megami Strike overall less challenging than harder Bullet Hell games, that usually force you to complete half-dozen levels in succession.\n\nMegami Strike has microtransactions, which are apparently the reason behind all negative reviews. However, these microtransactions carry far less impact than in most other Online CCG: all characters can be obtained over by completing missions or training, and the game is also quite generous with bonus items like upgrade cards. So it is quite easy to play without needing microtransactions at all, especially since buying Megami Strike on Steam already awards you with a number of cards and items.\n\nThe game\u2019s weakest point is very brief tutorial, which barely explains the most basic aspects of the game. Fortunately, I tried to solve this problem with a guide I posted, which explains the game\u2019s basics (and I will be happy to answer further questions people might have to best of my ability, though my own knowledge of the game is far from perfect).\n\nIn conclusion, I fully recommend Megami Strike to all fans of Bullet Hells games, who either like CCGs as well, or are willing to give that genre a try.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 618, "steamid": "76561198043960246", "playtime_forever": 12314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "last_played": 1464462900}, "recommendationid": "22882769", "votes_down": 7, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.509942", "votes_up": 28, "timestamp_updated": 1462814712}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1456556504, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Sad to say, but I just can not recommend this game and I'd been looking forward to it since it was on Greenlight.\nFor starters, this is a barebones port.

Sometimes, a game gets bashed simply for releasing for mobile first and despite the fact that the game doesn't really pull any dirty mobile shenanigans at all. Maybe it's missing a few options we'd like to see but it's overall fine and doesn't deserve a bashing, but still gets one. \n\nThis is not one of those times.\n\nMegami Strike is a horrific mobile ripoff vehicle in every sense of the word. The gameplay is a typical Cave-inspired shmup with bullets flying everywhere, and the gimmick is that you have these random waifu trading cards that act as bonuses during gameplay. Like a mobile idle game, these waifus can be leveled up by sacrificing other waifus and, of course, by finding new ones through IAP purchases. That's what the DLC is for this game, you get 5 copies of the \"Emma\" card, for example, because you're supposed to use all of them up to level up some other character and then you're supposed to buy five more Emmas and so one for infinity. In a game they normally charge you $10 for. You've already guessed that the game, obviously, is designed to be stacked against you so you have to chase more waifus and power up your waifu ships. Because, as we all well know, waifus won WW2 through the power of trading cards or whatever. \n\nAnd, as if the game design itself wasn't evil and dirty enough, here's everything else it does that qualifies it as an Officially Awful Mobile Port:\n\n- Teeny tiny phone-suitable resolution with no option to change.\n- Only mouse controls because adding keyboard and controller support is hard. No option.\n- All instructions say \"tap\", because editing the text is madness. Ain't nobody got budget for that.\n- Subscription plan. Spend a stupid amount of money to have imaginary currency delivered to your inbox every day! Our best offer ever!\n- A trillion fucking boxes to tick and bars to fill through wasting your money. The character screen has every damn pixel filled with boxes, buttons, bars, whatever else.\n- Has to contact the server to check if there are new IAPs to lure you in with. Takes forever to launch and every single screen has to contact the server with a little loading animation. Every screen!\n- Some screens don't even offer any navigation options, because I guess you would've swiped or something on the phone? I don't know, it's weird.\n- A slot machine mode.\n- Daily login bonus.\n- Ads pop up randomly. Buy this pack! Special limited offer! September exclusive pack! Monday exclusive pack! 4:00PM to 4:10PM ultra exclusive pack, buy before it disappears! Buy this $999.99 pack to get the most premium, exclusive, rarely seen and optimal waifu! (Disclaimer: will only be exceptional until next month when we drop the next ultra-rare for $999.99.)\n- Features intended to get you to campaign for this game among your friends. Why not ask a friend for help? Here's a convenient invitation button!\n- If you die, you can pay money to resurrect. Are you even surprised at this point?\n\nAt least you can go on dates with your collected waifus. I'm sure that's worth picking up a few of those $25 IAP packs for! Gotta get that date with the rarest of waifus. (I'm not kidding, there is seriously a date feature in the game.)\n\nIn short, what I'm saying is fuck this game and the people who made it.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 6567, "steamid": "76561198048799891", "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "last_played": 1497186927}, "recommendationid": "26284094", "votes_down": 10, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503598", "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1477723737}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1478440952, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "The game itself is a shooter with some dating sim parts and the game's structure is similar to Brave Frontier (or similar games) with the differencies that this is a shooter and that is not free.\nIt's a mobile port and is also a crappy one but the real problem is that most of the time you can't go past the login screen: I have played the game 2 times with at least 15 tries.. then I have requested (and obtained) a refound and it's the first time that I have done this.\nI have checked the Steam forum and it looks like this problem is present since the game launch so don't give money to these devs because they don't deserve it", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 4018, "steamid": "76561198025102372", "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1478429426}, "recommendationid": "26456907", "votes_down": 9, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506553", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1478440952}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1479967266, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "a fun shooter, can't see how it could've gotten so many negative reviews. and you don't need to pay anything extra to play.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 8, "steamid": "76561198340968403", "playtime_forever": 1467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1486308288}, "recommendationid": "27041651", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.491698", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1479967266}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1466721529, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Absolute trash, no effort put in at all to bring this to PC, filled with constant mobile gaming annoyances, no controller support.
