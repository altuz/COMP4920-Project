However, I would exhaust the other options in your library first, and i would HIGHLY suggest waiting for a big sale as $9.99 seems far too much for what you get here.\n\nThe plot is pretty standard, nothing unique.  The dialogue is horrid and the voice acting is even worse.  It's simply not well written (or possibly not well translated, in this case).  For instance, the dialogue from the little boy in the story sounds like nothing that a kid that age would say in a real conversation; for me, it was a little jarring.\n\nPuzzles are your basic minigames that you find in this sort of games, nothing that stands out overly much.\n\nHidden object scenes are not bad and some have multiple parts which I enjoyed; for instance, picking up objects in the first stage and then placing them back into the scene during the next stage (essentially \"cleaning up\" the scene).  My only complaint would be that some of the situations weren't intuitive where you had to complete a series of steps to get the items.  That premise isn't unique, but some of the sequencing didn't make sense, as in \"why would I ever even think to do that?\" situations.  Other than that, and some oddly named objects as another reviewer mentioned (likely translation issues), the HO scenes are pretty well done.\n\nTL;DR:  worth it if you can get it on sale and have exhausted the rest of your library, just don't expect anything above-and-beyond the ordinary.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 987, "steamid": "76561198035785835", "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "last_played": 1456538495}, "recommendationid": "21488502", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.527525", "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_updated": 1456539090}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1456393106, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I've played worse.

If you're on the fence about this genre, skip it. If you're a fan of games like this in general, it's probably worth the price. Maybe. Definitely if it's on sale.\n\nHonestly, the only really objectionable part of this game is the very few instances when I felt like there was a translation issue.

It is OK for a HOG, but it is a bit clunky in terms of puzzle mechanics, and the acting is TERRible. I never use hints in HO scenes or puzzles (I do play a lot of HOGs), but with this one, I had to just to figure out what I needed to do. It is trying for different kinds of puzzles, and I do appreciate that, but mostly this is a miss. If you are itching for a HOG and this is the only option, then hey, if it's on sale, go for it. Otherwise, I would move on. FYI, if the game is not properly full-screening for you, you should still be able to select options and then switch off the full screen mode.
