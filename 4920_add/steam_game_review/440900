See their progress reset before you. Hear their lamantations on their reddits.\"\n\nRated primarily from a solo play perspective (IE going into PvE and PvP servers alone). Early access review.\n\nPros:\n - Good variety of building blocks to build some visually impressive structures and cities.\n - Huge potential with the thrall system. Looking forward to the day when you see slave armies crashing into slave armies.\n - Faithful to the source material.\n - Regular updates, some of which added significant content to the game.\n - Community quite friendly, even in PvP zones (The roving band of jerks in T3 gear appear to be the exceptions rather than the rule).\n\nCons:\n - Game is far from finished with many promised features missing and many basic functions still rudimentary or bugged.\n - Expensive for the content being provided.\n - Ho-hum combat mechanics. Trading blows generally the most effective way to fight.\n - Frequent server resets on official servers. Don't get too attached.\n - Odd developer priorities (The Scourge has yet to reveal themselves, but we've got some sexy emotes now!)\n - Brainless AI. PvP primarily the focal point for the game.\n - Sparsely populated servers. Best to go in with friends or a community.\n\nInteresting Bits:\n - Battle-Eye included as part of the install package for the game.\n - Turn the nudity on and play with the skin colors to see some interesting things happen with the default position of the \"endowment\" slider (spoiler, your high school perspective on such matters will likely play out before your eyes).\n\nWould Suggest To: Survival game fanatics who also happen to be Conan fans. Survival game fans sick of servers overrun with trolls and over-geared predators and who are bringing a few friends/a server full of people for the ride. Minecraft players who considered tearing down structures with TNT and Creepers just as fun as building them up. Patient people. People with understanding SOs.\n\nWould Alternatively Recommend: Minecraft (For the crafting enthusiasts), 7 Days to Die (for the crafting enthusiasts sick of the Minecraft asthetic and who don't mind playing another game that will likely never be finished). Subnautica (For the survival fan looking for a more robust single player experience).", "comment_count": "6", "author": {"num_games_owned": 190, "steamid": "76561198000326220", "playtime_forever": 3302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "last_played": 1505078314}, "recommendationid": "35078687", "votes_down": 37, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.525961", "votes_up": 43, "timestamp_updated": 1506184154}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1507005329, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "So Far anyway, Conan runs as expected, a little derpy here n there, but the overall shows serius potential, and I'm sure as more content is added, that will change.
