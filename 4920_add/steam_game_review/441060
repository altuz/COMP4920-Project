While Sara is in her sleep, she experiences a dream where she could hear the deceased at Silver Creek Falls crying out to her. With the departure of Agent Valdez the following day, Sara and Colonel Davis attempt to locate another informant and find evidence on Bolt Pharmaceuticals's involvement in the research facility as a mystery adventure with thriller, plot twists and supernatural references.\n\nThis chapter is shorter than the previous chapter and no longer has the humour and comedic references in the previous chapter. Without the comedic references which made chapter 2 entertaining and more enjoyable than chapters 1 and 3 combined, the short delving into the supernatural in this chapter to replace it although interesting and could potentially be a good gap and mystery filler for this series and for Walsingham Files in future is too short and hardly explored anything to be noticeable at this stage. [spoiler]Also, the part to override the security system at Bolt Pharmaceuticals is a bit large and repetitive.[/spoiler]Recommended only for fans of Sapphire Dragon Productions and its only other mystery visual novel [i]The Agency Chapter 1[/i] or the Silver Creek Falls series, for those who like a short and easy linear adventure game with easy achievements and when in good discount or bundle offer as it takes less than 10 hours to finish the game.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 2216, "steamid": "76561198006413390", "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 91, "last_played": 1501256641}, "recommendationid": "33861335", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.572170", "votes_up": 33, "timestamp_updated": 1501312906}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 2, "total_positive": 13, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 15}}
