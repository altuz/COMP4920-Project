With a little more polish, it could probably be a truly incredible game, and I look forward to trying it again in a few months to see if any of its issues have been improved on. Until then, it really isn't that great of a platformer game outside of its somewhat-unique gliding / wind mechanic.\n\n---\n\nFull review ::\n\nThe level design for the first two stages (the only ones I've been able to get to) are either uninteresting or poorly-designed. The placement of traps, projectiles, and enemies aren't common, but when they are, they seem to be designed more for a twitch-based platformer, which is problematic because the character's movement is fairly slow. It takes a non-insignificant amount of time for your character to change direction or to jump, which is problematic when the game is made to be speed-ran and the game is a one-hit-kill.\n\nYes, the game is meant to be speed-ran. There are challenges listed at the end of each stage, one each for \"feather count\" (a collectible that's tallied throughout the stage), how fast you ran the stage (for the stages I've seen, [1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2], it appears that it will be impossible to achieve the goal for both feathers and speed at the same time), and \"crystals\" (which seem to be a sort of waypoint reached, of which they're out of the way, again preventing you from reaching both speed and crystals in the same run).\n\nFurthering this issue, if you get killed (one-hit kill, remember), you start over from the last waypoint, but lose all of your previous collections. Additionally, the timer continues from the point you died. If you're going for any of the challenges, you'll be spending a lot of time memorizing levels to figure out what the optimal paths are to be able to achieve whichever goal you're going for (collectibles, waypoints, or speed). On your first play through of the game, skip over trying to achieve the challenges. You might be able to do the feathers or waypoints, but you'll probably end up frustrated. Better to just enjoy the game the first time around (especially as it appears to have a \"level select\" in the starting town once you beat a particular level to try to achieve its challenges).\n\nGoing back to the character's speed, this became a very, very significant issue for the boss of the second stage (2-3). It's an overhead enemy that periodically spews out maggots, which function as a sort of bouncing bullet. You can't really see where they're coming from without jumping a lot, which is an issue because you only have one jump height, and touching  the boss kills you (again, one hit from anything and you have to start over from the last checkpoint).\n\nThis boss became especially frustrating and is where I quit because, after the fifth hit against the boss, it launches ~20 of these \"bouncing bullet\" maggots. They rain down on you from pretty much every direction, and the only way to defend yourself is to move out of the way and to use a slow, short-range, horizontal-only attack (the only attack you seem to have in game, or at least up to this point).\n\nWhat pushed me to stop playing the game was spending about half my time playing against this single boss, getting up to the same point in it each time, and dying because the character doesn't move fast enough to dodge around these bouncing bullets, has to be cautious about where they jump (both due to the overhead boss and due to the falling bullets) and having only a slow, short-range horizontal attack. Note that I was using a controller for this. I can't imagine what type of a nuisance it would be for people trying to play on a keyboard.\n\nThe game is beautiful, yes, and don't get me wrong because it's looking like a decent-enough game already. It has a few problems that prevent me from really enjoying it, though. It looks like it could be an incredible game with a bit more polish. The level design needs a brush-up and the way that the second boss (at least) works should be looked over again.\n\nThis is definitely a game I'll try again in the future, to see if these issues have been improved any. I hope it has, because it looks like it could be a great game with a bit more polish.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 111, "steamid": "76561198072720408", "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1498662334}, "recommendationid": "32941062", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.511402", "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1498663694}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 5, "total_positive": 9, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 14}}
