Games which aren\u2019t just good in terms of graphics, level-design or story, but a great experience overall, like the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoj/recommended/345820/]Shantae[/url] series, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoj/recommended/332200/]Axiom Verge[/url] or the genre-defining series of Metroid and Castlevania themselves, are few and far between. This makes discovering Pharaoh Rebirth ever so better.\n\nAll in all, Pharaoh Rebirth closely resembles the games from the Shantae series, which is good thing in my opinion, since those are great metroidvania games, which do many things right. From stylish old-school 2D graphics and great overall art style to an upbeat soundtrack that fits the game to the, from responsive and tight controls to balanced level design with just the right difficulty of platforming, the level of quality throughout all of Pharaoh Rebirth is surprisingly high.\n\nYou play as a renowned treasure hunter Dr. Jonathan Banfield [spoiler]coincidentally he was turned into a rabbit[/spoiler], who is assisted by his hacker friend Jack. While trying to stop your ex-companion Andre Betancourt [spoiler]coincidentally, turned into a turtle[/spoiler] from pillaging a legendary ancient Egypt oasis, you uncover an unknown sarcophagus. Andre\u2019s decision to open it results in you both being placed under pharaoh's curse to die in 7 days, so now both of you scramble to find the seven holy grails, which is the only way to save yourself from the curse. The story might not sound that interesting, but it fits the overall adventure atmosphere of the game just right. It is also greatly augmented by the game having charming and funny characters and quirky humor.\n\nGameplay is top notch, with all of the genre-specific features present and being done right. The game itself is divided into several different locations, each of them represented as a separate interconnected Metroid-style map, which isn\u2019t fully accessible to you right from the get go \u2014 some areas will be hidden off, while other will require having specific abilities to reach. When raiding each location, you\u2019ll find all sorts of treasures, which either boost your stats or unlock new abilities for your character. So it\u2019s always a good idea to go over the areas that you\u2019ve already visited after receiving these new abilities, as there might be more treasures waiting. Overall there are over 80 treasures scattered throughout the game and over 10 sub-weapons [spoiler]which will greatly improve your experience[/spoiler], different items, power-ups and so on. There are plenty of cleverly designed enemies (like Cycads and Totem Poles that blend into environment, or even False Jonathans that mimic your own appearance) and some not too hard boss-fights; at least they won\u2019t be hard when you\u2019ve powered up or have a good strategy for each boss. But bossfights aren't the only highlight, there\u2019s more: there are some on-rails platforming and turret sections to spice things up and break the flow of the game, an additional secret level (if you find all of the map pieces within the game) and a boss rush mode. The enemies also interact with the level in some cool and unexpected ways. For example, you see an exploding enemy. So what? Trigger and walk away. Now imagine the same enemy, but on the train. And the carriage you're standing on has just been decoupled. Pretty tense, huh?\n\nI can honestly say that going in, I didn\u2019t expect Pharaoh Rebirth to be such a great game in its whole, which makes it even sadder, when you look at its sales numbers: SteamSpy estimates sales at around 10k copies sold, which is just asinine, no matter how you look. So, if you\u2019re even slightly interested in such type of games, you should definitely give Pharaoh Rebirth a try.\n\nP.S.

It's closer to a weird Mega Man / Donkey Kong Country hybrid, but less fun than that sounds. \nThe controls are not clean and don't feel great, strike one in a primarily platforming game with instant-kill spikes everywhere. \nThere's a lot of issues with actually making the game run smoothly for a lot of people, I managed to get it going after several restarts and trying different options out after 10 or so minutes. \nThe upgrades are OK and typical enough for a Metroidvania but the level design, gameplay, world selection, etc. all speak to it being more of a typical platformer, with Metroid style movement upgrades which largely amount to unlocking 1 secret in a past level and letting you progress in the current one. \nThere's no excuse for the car level. It's just objectively bad and again, reflective of a platformer game design in the middle of something that just isn't quite in one place or the other. I don't know how air horns blasting at you every 5 seconds (sometimes faster) as you retry over and over got through any kind of \"fun\" test. I had to mute the game to get through that section.\n\nIf you've played Axiom Verge, Hollow Knight, Ghost 1.0, Shadow Complex, all the Donkey Kong Country games, all the 2D Super Mario games, actual Metroid games, Castlevania: Symphony of the Knight, Mega Man collection, and a few others I'm forgetting right now and you still want more, then OK, this might scratch some of that itch, or at least make you eager to go back to one of the good ones.
