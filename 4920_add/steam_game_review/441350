They just repeat one attack that reminds you of a bullethell game. This also makes it feel like they have way too much HP.\n\nIf you launched the game for the first time with a gamepad plugged in and notice that no buttons are working that is because you have to first navigate to the options screen using arrow keys and 'Z' 'X' keyboard buttons then set to use the gamepad.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 634, "steamid": "76561197995922227", "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "last_played": 1505642965}, "recommendationid": "35020100", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504607", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505644879}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 8, "total_positive": 18, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 26}}
