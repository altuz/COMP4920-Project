Glad to be able to play it on my laptop now instead of only on my tablet.\n\nCore gameplay involves you strategically picking units to take into each level, and strategically deploying them to defeat the enemy's base, in a tug of war style scenario.  There is a lot of depth on picking which units you want to use for each scenario (based on the opponent's makeup) and how to best use each unit.  As you beat scenarios you will research new units that you'll be able to use, encouraging a fun feedback loop of maximizing beating each level with trying to research as many units as you can (there are a lot).\n\nThe units are well designed and balanced, the story is clever and entertaining, the challenges are strategically hard in a rewarding way, and there is lot's of replayability to try and unlock everything.\n\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 361, "steamid": "76561197961099763", "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1464530989}, "recommendationid": "23273235", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501707", "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1464531366}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1464561084, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Pokemon-esque educational game with a flair for the dramatic.

I'm a fan of collecting monsters and doing simple things with them, where this scratches the itch quite well. The price point and ability for this to be played as a great podcast game make this a good recommendation. I wasn't completely in love with the combat and pacing of some of the levels, but that's not enough to stop me from giving a thumbs up.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 850, "steamid": "76561198001180221", "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 113, "last_played": 1468513896}, "recommendationid": "24317847", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501684", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1468514710}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3}}
