In 2 days got like level 43 and starting to play it with my brother now on steam.\n\nThe game is really worth the low price and it would be even better if they put some more stuff into it. If they could bring NPC's, more enemies, more biomes, a story line they could easity sell the game for 30-40 euros. Shame it's such a small studio and they weren't able to support this great game the way it deserved. \n\nI'm looking forward to reach level 50 and try out vehicles and the most advanced stuff. So far one of the few complains would be ranged weapons being seriously underpowered, I can kill any enemy with 10 hits from a big hammer but need 1000 shots from a laser rifle or an assault weapon!!?? \n\nIt's definitely a game worth playing and I hope they can continue to work on it and bringing in more content.\n\nIt's really DUMB design that I must do a new character for each server, we should be able to create multiple characters and select which one we want to use anywhere we play, go try Grimm Dawn for a good example, being a small studio is not an excuse for shitty design. Also get resolutions properly set, every time I minimize the game I have to go into the options screen to fix the weird resolution because I'm not using the same as the desktop.\n\nAfter trying out online play I can say I feel extremely angry that the developers chose SHITTY servers to host the game, there's all sorts of sync problems with online play and it's really frutrating. Offline gameplay is much smoother and enjoyable. I have like 3 people playing on my server and everything is slow, developers should sell the game to a proper studio that can develop the game and have proper online servers.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 7, "steamid": "76561198122699896", "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506347303}, "recommendationid": "34977697", "votes_down": 11, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.480923", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505574838}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "total_negative": 216, "total_positive": 158, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "num_reviews": 6, "total_reviews": 374}}
