If it wasnt for the story the game would be a failure in my opinon. The story is one of the best to date and the feel of the outside environment along with the charcter build up is one of the best out there.  The battle system is really fun and reminds me alot of other games in the 90's that used that same battle system.  That being said this game could still use some work.  The enemies are pretty much all the same which exception of color and HP/Damage stats changing which is unfortunate because so much detail was placed in other parts of the game.  The lack of interaction with items and no sense of importance was also a huge downfall for me as well. All in all I still recommend the game for the story alone.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 6, "steamid": "76561198399075178", "playtime_forever": 1413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1504145942}, "recommendationid": "34972209", "votes_down": 6, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.512568", "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1505483231}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506572134, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "The dialogue is lacking in many ways. The quality in general is poor and it often leaves a lot left to be desired. This isn't poor translation, responses to your dialogue choices are often disappointing, there really is no point to the choices. Honestly I was getting immersed in the menus, reading about the locations and such, only to be pulled out of it very quickly. It's quite mind-boggling that such effort went to add all this information about places, items and enemies when the dialogue and its options are so poor. I couldn't help but feel they could of used a lot of this text in the game-world, rather than leaving all of it in the menus.\n\nIt took me a few seconds to realize a flashback was happening at the shrine at the beginning of the game. This was because characters on screen were talking, and they were in almost the same positions in the flashback. Poor execution and Setsuna go together.\n\nWhat can I say? Some materials are green when I can sell stuff to the magic consortium (the nightrite npc), yet I don't know why. Food hadn't been explained to me yet. I guessed they were used for something else. Materials to upgrade my weapons? No... They're for cooking. So I read the names. The other issue is... What the hell is this system? Selling items so an npc can sell you abilities? Because money is involved and this is labelled as buying and selling, so it is confusing, how much are you buying nightrite for? Are these materials used for other things? Oh, and the first time I used this system, I was selling items separately when I could just go and make them... But the nightrite are grayed out in the menu and as it's the first thing you see, you simply ignore it.\n\nCombat... Where do I start? I play turn-based games so I don't have to time things with animations or dodge attacks. I find turn-based games... Relaxing. The Momentum system is anti-thetical to the turn-based experienced. You see, many things are based around the Momentum system. You feel like you need to use it. A lot. You hit a key when a character attacks an enemy once you've got a charge... But you gain charges by waiting when a characters turn is ready. When you do use Momentum, the animations are so short that it's not hard to miss it. You see... If the animation were longer, I wouldn't have as much of an issue but... This is a turn-based game. It's like when you feel you need to use summons in FF8 and you feel the need to use the square button to get the most out of the system. Instead of enchancing the game, these features degrade it. Not only that, but the Momentum system detracts from the actual combat in general. And the moment it gets hectic, I just don't care. I don't really give a fuck. That's my honest opinion. When I discovered Momentum carries over through battles, I found myself sitting at my PC doing literally nothing.\nJust waiting. Then I got bored. And that's a terrible thing.\n\nThe save points... For fucks sake, my favourite podcast is on. I like to take my time going through a game without feeling rushed. I like to explore and make sure that I don't miss anything. So I keep moving forward, then I'm flooded with 20 accessories to look at and decide what to buy and how to equip my character .... Oh boy, how much fun. Fuck off and give me my save point already.
