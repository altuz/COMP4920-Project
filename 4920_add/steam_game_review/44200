You have a color. Planets generate ships depending on size. Ships attack and defend 1:1. Deplete a planet of enemy ships and it's yours. This sounds simple, but it plays out in frantically-paced battles where you have to micromanage planet-by-planet, while overarching resource-management also affects outcomes and turns of fate.\n\nA round takes about ten minutes to play, so it's easy to get in a casual round. Unfortunately the server browser leaves a lot to be desired so sometimes you spend another 5 minutes looking for a game that hasn't started and isn't empty. There are still a number of regular players although there tend to be few populated servers to choose from.\n\nStill, when this goes on sale, it is worth picking up just to witness the simple, elegant strategies that unfold when you remove all the crazy additional variables that most RTS games introduce. Galcon Fusion doesn't reinvent the genre, but it streamlines it better than anything else I've played. It's also available on a bunch of different platforms, so yay Galcon.\n\nBuy it! And one protip: don't immediately attack someone with all your ships when a round starts! You might survive long enough to enjoy it!"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1487288801, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520886", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29973240", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028673669", "num_reviews": 320, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 5466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 368}, "timestamp_updated": 1489187550, "received_for_free": false, "review": "One of my 1st games on steam, 150 achievements were something amazing back in the day :O.\n\n+Visuals: Pretty nice, colorful, fully changeable and easy to understand interface.\n+Soundwork: okay.\n+Gameplay: A lot of various play modes, some of them too hard for me and simply unplayable.
