The best virtual pinball simulator has gotten better. Great visuals and better progression system, add to that cross platform play and high scores and it equals the top of the line pinball platform. The ever growing library of liceneced tables from a variety of IP's make this my favorite go-to steam game when I \"have nothing to play\".

Almost all the tables from FX2 carry over to FX3. So there is no reason not play this. One thing that may cause confusion is that they repackaged the tables in the store into different bundles. So you wont be able to tell what you own from the store page. You have to go into the game itself. The new universal studios pinball tables are good, especially the Back to the Future table, which lets you select a mission before you start the game.
