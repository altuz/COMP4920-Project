The levels progressively become more difficult, with increasingly sophisticated puzzles. But every puzzle teaches you lessons that can be potentially applied toward the next puzzle. Keeping an open mind and being patient allows one to succeed!\n\nThe artwork is aesthetically pleasing and the soundtrack works well with each level, making the experience more immersive and adding depth to the gameplay.\n\nMy wife and I really love this game and plan to play it to completion. Kudos to the developers on a job well done as this type of game is tricky to get just right!\n\nDisclosure: I bought this game on a recent Steam sale for a fraction of its suggested price.\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 456, "steamid": "76561197972510616", "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "last_played": 1469989659}, "recommendationid": "24111500", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502528", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1467732111}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1470336453, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Inaccurate controls and full of bugs.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 52, "steamid": "76561198057189251", "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1467829531}, "recommendationid": "24712541", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.491299", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1470336453}, {"votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_created": 1456863983, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "MMMMMMMMMM Yesss'sss i shall sip on my chardonnay while listing to this beutiful sound track and just ravishing my self in caviar MMMMMMM Yesssss'sss this is most suited to my taset bud's \n\n\nps\ngrate work on the game \nmusic 10/10 \ngame 10/10 \n\nthanks \n\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 110, "steamid": "76561198254720089", "playtime_forever": 987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1466239108}, "recommendationid": "21571803", "votes_down": 13, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.472754", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1456863983}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1493422108, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "It was fun in local co-op until the black myst chasing level.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 162, "steamid": "76561198044218149", "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 78, "last_played": 1492102618}, "recommendationid": "31427115", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1493422108}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "num_reviews": 5, "total_reviews": 5}}
