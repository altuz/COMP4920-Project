This might be real harsh knowing it feels like one or two people made this game but it isn't fun at all. \n\nPicture this, you basically shoot zombies, move to place, shoot more zombies, move to another place, shoot even more zombies and so on. Heck there is even glitches too and bad AI teammates that act stupid to go through one door. I feel like this game should have been more of an Alpha stage to me since there are many things need polishing.\n\nHowever, the third person zombie shooter was pretty neat to start with including how realistic the animation acts with movement and such but it's a real let down to it's gameplay and plot of the story too. It's hard to get interested on what the characters say in the game.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 130, "steamid": "76561198062821341", "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1471376866}, "recommendationid": "24960190", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.540393", "votes_up": 42, "timestamp_updated": 1471377427}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1471387737, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I can see the gameplay being fun but the thirdperson and the big levels causing lag makes it hard to play,plus the houses are empty and have no use for being there and dosen't reward you for looking around.It would be nice if they made individual levels because it would reduce lag like how Valve does with Half-Life.Firstperson would make playing the game a lot easier,and opening the tab to change weapons shouldent make you stop all motion just to change weapons.The melee button should be changed,and a tutorial level that would have the same element as other good tutorials would be great. \n\n-Needs tweaks and a change of how the player plays the game and how the game plays out!\nIt would be a great game if some of these changes were made", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 73, "steamid": "76561198074438429", "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1471386724}, "recommendationid": "24963097", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.521523", "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_updated": 1471387737}, {"votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_created": 1471416066, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "No, No, No, this is so wrong, if it were free i would not play this and here is why.\nThe play control lacks, controller support is half a$$ and you can't run thus zombies are always on your heels, can't switch to other weapons it seems cause action is happening while you try to use item or swap weapon in tab button menu, maybe there is another way but it is not shown how to.\nGame is so unballanced, the zombies are OP and keep coming non stop making you feel you accomplished nothing when shooting them and they block your every escape because you have a massive hit box so you can never get around them.\nI really wanted to like this game because of the third person view and support the devs but honestly i made a better game using the Game Guru program.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 364, "steamid": "76561198019031178", "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 94, "last_played": 1471415013}, "recommendationid": "24968258", "votes_down": 4, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.510110", "votes_up": 19, "timestamp_updated": 1471416672}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1490356444, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This game is appropriately titled as my mind was dead within 5 minutes of starting to play this game.
