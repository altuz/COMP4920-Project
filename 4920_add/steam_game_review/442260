To be completely honest, I assumed it would be some boring flash game someone put on Steam to make a quick buck.\n\nHowever, after playing this game, it's clear that Sprinter was made with a lot of love.\n\nThe art style is clean and unique and its simple appearance complements the gameplay incredibly well. Mixed with the serene, ambient music, it creates a great atmosphere. In fact, despite some of the final levels taking a lot of attempts, I don't think I got nearly as frustrated as I probably should have. I attribute this entirely to the soothing and rewarding soundtrack.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fun, addictive and ultimately satisfying. The controls work perfectly - whenever you fail, it's always your own fault. Fairly simple mechanics, combining reaction speeds, hand-eye coordination and split second timing. No qualms on this front.\n\nHowever, the game definitely isn't perfect. Firstly, the content. The story consists of 30 levels, which comes out to about 2 hours play time. I don't personally care about play time, especially with indie titles like this, but be prepared that the game isn't that long. I liked what they tried to do with the story, but it just didn't work for me. Difficulty curve is a bit off, struggled mostly at the start (learning how to cut corners perfectly) and the final chapter, which would be gruelling if it weren't for the music (seriously guys, I really like the music). Also, if you do the whole game in one sitting, the colours can get a bit harsh on the eyes.\n\nOverall though, it's a great game. Interesting, fun and the kinda game you can come back to in six months and experience it as if it was your first time. Solid indie game and I'm curious to see what else the dev will come up with.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 173, "steamid": "76561198127148213", "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1456454241}, "recommendationid": "21467245", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506733", "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1456456752}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1457207373, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Sprinter does a lot right.

My PC can put some nice graphics on the screen playing GTA V and even though it says 60FPS in this game, it stutters at points (memory-leak?) to a point where it does not accept some inputs from the controler, which of course is gameplay breaking like nothing else...

You have to guide your character in a succession of corridors at the same time as pushing A to open doors, X to distract the guards, up to disable the cameras, LT to steal keys and open chests, RT to charge a dash and B to use slow-motion. You have to use all those actions very rapidly and numerous times to finish the levels. The game is separated in 6 chapters and you unlock new actions at every chapter until chapter 5, where the last levels are a combination of everything you learned. You have to finish the levels under a given time, and once you finished the 5 levels of a chapter, you unlock the possibility to do the levels again with an harder time to beat, the golden time.
