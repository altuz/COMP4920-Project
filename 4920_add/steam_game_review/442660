Started out with quite a few game breaking bugs but the devs have stepped up and fixed many of them and seem to have optimized it a lot since release. \n\nVery immersive, beautiful, detailed worlds. You can spend some time just admiring the graphics and huge scale of the landscapes and castles. The collision detection and movement is done well. I never got stuck in a wall or in a half-opened  doorway. I did have quite a few opponents go crazy and glitch out at times though.\n\nI love when devs enable touchpad and teleport at the same time. The option to have click to move would be better because when you are trying to use the inventory it is too easy to make yourself move by accident by barely touching the trackpad.\n\nPretty good story and script. Not too many cut scenes and you have the ability to click through them.\n \nI liked the simplicity of the spell casting. You aren't forced to memorize anything. A little extra help with the staff and crystals would be nice. It is hard to figure out which combos do what.\n\nCombat actually worked better than expected. I could block my opponent's sword fairly intuitively but the AI leaves something to be desired.\n\nOverall worth the money. Hopefully they add the additional content without making us wait very long. (not holding my breath though, I have been burnt by quite a few early access VR titles lately).\n\nProbably about 3-5 hours playtime if you don't rush. I had to restart many times due to early bugs.\n \nI run a 1080ti and a i7-4770 stock clocked and ran it on ultra settings.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 210, "steamid": "76561197969984517", "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 103, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506551815}, "recommendationid": "35250906", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506553552}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504902090, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "I really enjoyed the first campaign. \n\nAfter the 1.2 update I was able to play through the first campaign on Medium settings with RX480/Oculus.\nI recently upgraded to a GTX1080 and can now play on ultra settings. \n\nThe graphics on ultra settings are some of the best I've seen in VR.\nI'm really looking forward to the following campaigns and seeing how things progress through early access.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 47, "steamid": "76561198348977979", "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505360391}, "recommendationid": "34822386", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503992", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504902090}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504844329, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "+ great graphics, no motion sickness thanks to teleport \n\n- lags on i5-4590/970, bugs\n\nto do list:\n\n1. teleport at many places didn't work when free locomotion work\n2. change teleport button to touchpad\n3. disable free locomotion buttons in teleport mode\n4. add shield in 1 hand instead of sword, look at Mage's Tale\n5. add easy story mode, the game is too tough for me\n6. music is too loud, can't hear speach often\n7. remove darkness when wounded, it's too dark world anyway\n\nEdit: After Patch Version 1.3 the game is much better.
