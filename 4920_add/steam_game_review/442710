There are many pros and cons to this game and hopefully if you are looking to try this game, you might find answers to any questions you might have.\n\n\nPros:\nGreat gameplay\nAwesome game to play with friends\nIncredible amount of depth \nMany different variables of weapons and armor\nOld rustic feel\nRelaxing music\n\nCons:\nUnresponsive/ Uninterested Developers\nMinor glitches\nA few problems with quests like houses not being available (devs have to do this manually)\nVERY Small Community\n\nNow that I've told you about the pros and cons I want to dive into the cons to let you understand how many of these can be temporary and will most likely be fixed, or can be ignored. First of all, the developers took a big hit when an event that I call The Blackout occured. This is the weekend in June of 2016 that the servers just told everyone to screw off and lagged a bunch. (of course this is figuratively, there was just a whole lot of lag) After that weekend the plentiful community that would have a constant amount of 50+ members on a server at one time plummeted to around 5-10 at a time. I just want to say that for the year that I have had this game, this has NEVER happened other than this one weekend. Now after this everyone lost hope and the Developers stopped releaseing patches due to the bashing and lack of support that they were getting. I am willing to bet if the servers healed like they are starting to that the Devs will come back and continue doing an amazing job. As for the minor glitches, there will occasionally be some minor glitches with your movement in the game, but after a few minutes you get used to it. All in all this is a great game that you should definetly give a shot before rejecting completely. I have happily played 222 hours so far and I will continue telling my friends about this amazing game. If you do decide to give it a go come find me and say hello! Thank you for checking out my reccomendation and have an awesome day guys and gals!!!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 38, "steamid": "76561198043497469", "playtime_forever": 19014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506042099}, "recommendationid": "29456225", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.514709", "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1485239659}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485273501, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "a free to play game that feal's like golden sun. the questing system is solid sortof on the line's of wow though were it's mostly click click click what am I soposed to do again, all in all great game and is very nestalgic.\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 55, "steamid": "76561198018653186", "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1485235171}, "recommendationid": "29464775", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500070", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485273501}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1462729698, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "review": "Great game, 43 hours in and having much more fun than i ever expected i come from a competitave gaming background and this is exactly what i needed a nice casual game that is totally relaxing, plenty quests all the way up to about 35-37 then a little bit of grinding.\n\nI actually spent alot of time grinding while watching tv shows, movies and twitch its very easy to do; great fun met great people.\n\nHop on it play the trial for a few hours and you'll want to buy the pack for a few extra's the backspace is worth it xD\n\nCheers.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 151, "steamid": "76561197988726531", "playtime_forever": 13515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1498575005}, "recommendationid": "22867345", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501423", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1462729698}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 4}}
