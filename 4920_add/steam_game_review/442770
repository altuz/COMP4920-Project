The controls were a pain to use, had to use both hands and you can't change them, the camera turns by itself when transitioning areas and you can't turn that off which is unpleasant for the motion sick prone and uses up a lot of time.

I have searched a lot in order to find intriguing and different games. This game is amazing! It is completely an \"out of the box\" game absolutely suitable for all ages and not only for children.\nI really love the concept. The graphics are gorgeous! The world of \"minims\" is unique, big enough and have potential for many more stories. I loved the characters, they are cute and I liked very much the 3rd chapter. It's my favorite! \nThe music contributes very well, I liked it! Nice melodies and soundtracks and I noticed a kind of a very discreet humour at some points! \n\nThe main aspect is that the whole game is a beautiful experience!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1, "steamid": "76561198335360953", "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1478204626}, "recommendationid": "26414247", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503954", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1478258832}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1461523095, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Very refreshing!  A lovely game with no violence, netherworld creatures chasing you, or the protagonist trying to saving the world against dark magic while precious time is ticking away.  This game is set in a serene, simple world all its own.  I want to stress the word serene here because the music and pace of the game are very calm and slow.  Part of me was thankful for the change of pace from most games being released but another part of me was going crazy not being about to skip through dialogue, walk faster, or jump to known locations.  I kept going, though, because the animation, score, and story line are all outstanding and the puzzles were unique and inventive.
