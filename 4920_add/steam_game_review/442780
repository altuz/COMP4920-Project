However...\n\nI kept an eye on the updates for the game, there have been a ton of massive updates improving the game in every aspect and addressing much of the issues and complaints from the community.\nNow with the release of the Millennium Edition, the biggest update yet, and a 50% off sale, I decided it was finally time to give STRAFE a try.\n\nHoly hell this game is so much fun. First things first, as many reviews have stated, this game is NOT Quake, or Half-Life, or whatever else you might be imagining from that era. It is an FPS rogue-lite that attempts to mimic the visuals and mechanics of that era. It does not have masterfully hand-crafted levels, but it does have hand-crafted sections of levels that are fairly seamlessly joined together to form some relatively interesting procedurally generated levels with suprisingly decent flow.\nThe gist of STRAFE is that you play through these procedurally generated maps, which move through different episodes, each of which have their own theme, much in the vein of classic id Software games. You kill a lot of enemies, get a lot of upgrades, buy various items like double jump boots, thruster packs, and much more... Most importantly however, you kill lots of enemies, very, very quickly.\nSTRAFE gives you a choice of 1 of 3 main weapons which you can upgrade rapidly throught your run, as well as random secondary weapon drops, all with unique and interesting design, though the secondary weapons do run out of ammo quite fast, you can throw or smack enemies with them after they are depleted, which is awesome.\n\nThe game is extremely fast paced, it even has pseudo Quake-style bunny hopping which allows you to move around VERY quickly. The enemies have farily simple AI, but it gets the job done. The enemy variety is decent, many of them with unique attacks and requiring different methods to approach and deal with them. The music is pretty good, it does a good job of heightening the intensity. The weapons look and feel great, the sound design is solid, every weapon has good impact to it. The game actually has a really good atmosphere, it even gets kinda spooky later on. The art direction is on point, it looks incredibly reminiscent of games like Quake and Half-Life. The game even has something of a story... Well about as much story as a game like DOOM had, which is perfectly fine for me.\n\nThe ONLY real complaint I can come up with is that the game does drop frames a little bit for me when a lot is going on, still perfectly playable, but a bit annoying nonetheless. There is a low-fx option that i don't have enabled since I don't feel I really need it, but I'd wish to see a more fleshed out options menu in general.\n\nRegardless, the game is fast, exciting, engaging, and does a really good job of capturing the difficulty (did I mention this game is REALLY HARD) and excitement of classic FPS, but with it's own spin.\n\nAs of writing, I haven't played a ton of the game since I just bought it yesterday, but I have almost beaten it once already. I will update this review with any further details in the future if I find anything more to say about the game, but I really wanted to get a review out because seeing this game at mixed reviews is kind-of a bummer, the devs have put a lot of time and effort into improving this game since launch, and I want it to show.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 836, "steamid": "76561198043607485", "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 329, "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1507182240}, "recommendationid": "35460489", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1507082358}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1507084136, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Definitely an underrated game.

The story-line is beyond simple. It's a joke really. You are a spacemarine (of varying gender identy, which was apreciated) tasked with picking up scrap from some old ship named ICARUS (that's at least 3 tropes right there)\nTo the surpise of nobody, it has monsters! So, you are given one of 3 (and a secret 4th, shhh) weapons, which all behave as expected. \n[list]\n    [*]Machine Gun: high fire-rate, somwhat accurate, low damage, grenade launcher\n    [*]Shotgun: Low fire-rate, innacurate, high damage...grenade launcher.\n    [*]Rail Gun: Low fire-rate, precise accuracy, obscene damage and...*sigh* grenade launcher.\n[/list]\nIt's a shame, I would've liked to see some varience to the secondary fire, but ah well.\nWhat the game lacks in actual secondaries, it makes up for with a huge arsenal of weapons that can be found scattered throughout the level. These have a wide range of usefullness, such as straight upgrades to the basic aresenal, as well as rocket launchers, and a weird air blast gun that I personally hate.\nWhat makes these interesting is that they all have one clip each, and when it runs out, the weapon turns into a one-use, one hit KO melee, and you're back to the stock. While at first I wasn't down for it, it really does make these weapons feel like their worth more.\n\nThe enemies! \nEach zone (of which there are 4) have a generally unique set of enemies, ranging from close quaters to long range. I'm not going to go into all of them, as there has been a recent update, and I legit do not know how many are in this game now. (that's a good thing) For the most part, these guys go down easy, in large, unrealistic spurts of blood and viscera. It's very satisfying, and a ton of fun to take down waves of them.\n\nLevel Design\nWowie, another randomly generated game! So innovative! This game does it just as well as most randomly generated games. Nothing special, but each run does at least feel a little unique. I'd rate the random generation as a \"slightly above meh\".\nHowever, anyone who's played the original DOOM games can attest to the problem I'm about to bring up. \nThe maze-like corridors, and the fact that every single wall looks identical, can make it particularly hard to navigate. This is fine for more linear levels, as the blood splatters are a good indicator you've been this way, but some levels require backing through previous areas, and I find myself getting lost very quick, and it's not fun in the slightest. This is more of a problem with the genre of space shooter though, and not something I hold against the devs. However, I will hold the absolutely awful map against them. I'm probably just stupid, but I cannot for the life of me understand how to read the map! \n\nOther things: \nThe newst update added daily runs (sick!) speedrun weeks (nice!) and a way to unlock optional game modifiers as you play (Radical, Dude!)\nThere are TONS of very well hidden secerets (and it's not just mashing use on walls, thank the Gods), as well as a completely different game-mode hidden around in the menu! \n\nConclusion: Pretty rad game, would recomend at full price, but does have some big flaws.
