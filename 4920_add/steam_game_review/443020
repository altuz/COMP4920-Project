It's good on strategic level but really shines on tactical (battles) level. \nIt can be challenging but is never unfair. Battles can change rapidly from \"I've got this\" to \"Now I'm fukked\" and back to \"I've got this\" in a minutes. I recommend playing it on hard or at least normal level on \"ironman\" (I've played \"Into Russia\" on hard and managed it at first try, although I got lucky a number of times). I also recommend reading a manual (at least part about battles, as it is important to know the modifiers behind the rolls). It's a bit shame that you can't play as England here, but it makes sense from the gameplay asymmetry perspective. Interface is allright, graphics & music too, no bugs experienced.
