There is no way I would ever recommend this to anyone. Unless I really hate them. I mean HATE them. The \"gameplay\" is so basic it is nonexistent.  I was hopeful when I read it was Quake like, then I realized that was complete BS because it is single player only, and Quake looked better.

I love you steam.\n\nNeutral: It's single player. Kind of disapointing for a first person arena shooter, but I can't hold it against them since it's honestly marked that way in the steam store.\n\nCons:\n- The game has 1 level. There's buttons to change to others but apparantly they were never put in\n- The game pretends to have 2 modes to play, but they are actually identical, just the same arena with you versus another insect\n- No music during the game, cheesy repetitive sound effects (and very few of them)\n- Gun variety? There seems to be 4 but they are all slight variations in the SAME model with just different lights, they function and sound all mostly the same. It actually took me a while to even notice that the guns were different occasionally.\n- The game description says it's all about flying; but the \"flight\" button just makes you sort of jump and hover for a couple seconds. It's more about \"jumping sort of not really that far\" than it is anything resembling flight.\n- This is a 1 versus 1 arena game.. that's it. There is litterally NO CONTENT.\n- No in game feedback, the UI is void of anything that tells you what is going on. No kill counts, no death counts, no way to know what you are supposed to do or why. I mean sure the goal is simple \"kill the enemy 10 times\" but you don't even know how many kills you are currently on and no, counting for real isn't an option because:\n- You have no idea if your actual kills were done by you or the environment. Both you and the enemy will die randomly to things completely not under your control. Walk near a gas cloud? you dead, Bump into a building and clip through it? you die. Walking too fast and the game bugs out? you die. If the world killed the enemy while you were shooting at it, you won't know. \n- You will spend most of your time in this big empty arena (the only one...) waiting for the content to find you. Just one lonely bug walking over and shooting at you, over and over again.\n- the enemy hit boxes are wonky. empty clip after clip into one body part or another and there's no feedback telling you if you are hitting anything (no bullets, no hit effects). the enemy just occsionally falls over dead (but then it does that even if you aren't shooting at it sometimes so you really have no idea if your bullets are effecting it)\n- I could on about how bad the content is, but there's so little of it, what's the point?\n- Beyond that it's technically put together badly. Game has lots of bugs, lots of clipping issues, lots of what you would expect from say an amateur gaming developer that hasn't been properly trained. \n- Even the most fundamental game basics are broken here: you have to restart the game to change the sound effect levels; seriously? \n- Game breaking here: Switching the screen resolution is on a \"cycle\" you litterally have to change and WAIT for the new resolution (and hope your system supports it) before you can \"cycle\" to the next one. If your monitor doesn't accept the next resolution in the list before you get to the one you want? Too bad, the game just goes black with no way to recover. Don't worry, it won't remember your resolution anyway so just force it closed. You get to cycle through every resolution every time you want to play the game. I haven't seen resolution settings this bad since DOS games were a thing back in the '90s, haven't we all learned how to make a settings menu that works yet?\n\nI gotta stop, there's about 1000 more things wrong with this game. At it's very core I am finding it difficult to even call this a game. I have personally played student graduation projects with more content than this. At best this is a tech demo you might use to show the earliest stage concept of what your game is going to be about. But what you have here is a developer who made 1 big empty level and called it a full release product. And that 1 level was not even properly designed or tested.\n\nEpic Failure in every way.\n\nAs a final note of just how poor the development quality is on this game? They couldn't even be bothered to name their launch file properly. If you open task manager while playing (which I had to do several times due to game breaking bugs that forced me to close the game) you will find the game is named: \"Made with UDK\"; that is litterally the default name for a file that anyone will end up with simply from launching the Unreal Development Kit.\n\nThis \"game\" could be made in a weekend for free by anyone simply by downloading UDK, uploading a few free models, putting in a basic menu screen and than launching the UDK movement demo to shuffle your models around.\n\nStill curious? Watch this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLKefFA-mgY\n\nThat is litterally 100% of the content in this game. You've missed nothing and there is nothing else to see or do. Big empty world, 1v1 against another bug using boring weapons.\n\nThe game has a total of 3 minutes worth of content and none of it good.", "comment_count": "16", "author": {"num_games_owned": 353, "steamid": "76561198075324976", "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "last_played": 1463008010}, "recommendationid": "22918745", "votes_down": 4, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.527861", "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_updated": 1463008852}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "total_positive": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2}}
