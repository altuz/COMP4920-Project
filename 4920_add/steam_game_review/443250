Then I unlocked practice mode. A bit backwards, don't you think?\n\nSo here's how it works:\nYou are the cosmonaut, basically a herodude out to kill hordes of machine enemies who share your colour scheme. You move your mouse to move around like it was the mouse pointer, left button is a standard attack, right charges your super attack when you hit/kill things with it, both buttons at the same time unleashes your super attack. You gather points and unlock in-game achievements in the 5 different stages. \n\nThere are things I like - the infinite continues, the mouse moving the character (as a concept), but I really don't care about hunting points and trophies when the story and gameplay is this anemic, the soundtrack just alright and the design sort of bland (with some additional issues keeping track of the hero and shots). The stage variations are of the early arcade model - they're a different background with a different set of enemies, there's no terrain features that do anything (to my recollection).\n\nIn short and my humble opinion: cool controller idea, needed some more work before being worth 7.99 Euro.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 382, "steamid": "76561198005413139", "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "last_played": 1482707286}, "recommendationid": "28651396", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.508927", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1482708104}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1482566172, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I'm a casual fan of the shmup genre and this game hit just the right spot for me.

It's telling that the only characteristics of the protagonist are his name and his tacked on grin, without which he would sit right at home amongst the enemy drones. The pattern continues with art which lacks most of world building background detail and most enemies have a theme of mechanical and gray. I'd really like to see more beautiful high-resolution 2d art in games, but the resolution must be filled with detail - otherwise low-res pixel art is better when I can use my imagination subconciously to fill gaps of pixels with detail. The Music is great and fits the game very well. \n\nNothing above would really matter if the game had an interesting gameplay that challenged and surprised the player. There's a serious lack of bullet patterns in this game. Fighting becomes so predictable and boring way too fast. Unfortunately bosses know only a few tricks, different phases only having more difficulty or speed added. Same applies to basic enemies. First level of most other shmups has more to see that this game. Most shmup pattern staples are just missing like bullet barrages that move at different speeds or mazes. Currently once I find where the bullets come from and find a safe spot I rarely have to move.\n\nThe replayability is really nice touch with challenges and different weapon loadouts.
