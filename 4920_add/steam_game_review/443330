[b]I myself kinda liked the game[/b], but I honestly don\u2019t see many other people enjoying it. I might be wrong, tho. But well, let me talk about my experience with this visual novel.\n\nIt\u2019s a kinetic novel, you don\u2019t make any choices and you only read about the MCs fate, Will. He goes to Japan to work as a researcher at a Japanese university, and there he meets his three coworkers: Yuri, a girl that loves water bears with a burning passion and talks about herself in third person; Suzukake, the main researcher and which also is very connected to Yuri; And there\u2019s Yae. [spoiler]Right in the beginning of the game it\u2019s stated that he is a boy. He likes girly stuff a lot, and tries to make moves on Will. I liked because it was something different from the characters that I\u2019m used to see in the visual novels that I play.[/spoiler]\n\nThe art style is gorgeous, I really have no complains. BGM was okay too, and the VA was awesome. The story starts very light and suddenly things change faster than you can say f*ck. The thing is, [i]Malus Code[/i] makes no sense. Its contents are divided between three episodes (which covers Will\u2019s coworkers routes), and none of them are connected. So it\u2019s basically three different stories [spoiler]about the Malus Virus[/spoiler]. By the end of episode three, it gave me a feeling that all of the episodes were clues for the player to try to solve the big mystery of this VN. But I don\u2019t know, it lacked something. Not that everything needs a clear answer (at least to me, a lot of readers like to have answers and that\u2019s totally fine), but this title made me feel like I was reading a cheap rip off of Higurashi. The concept of Malus Code was somewhat intriguing to be honest, but in my opinion the writing was the biggest problem here. Things are so mysterious that it just ends up being like a total f*cking secret and you barely have hints of what\u2019s happening. At some point it made me not care anymore about the mystery.\n\n4/10. I only recommend this game when it\u2019s on a big sale, if you like random creepy stories, [b]AND[/b] if you don\u2019t mind unanswered questions. Also, I only gave a thumbs up because of Yuri\u2019s story (the first episode). [spoiler]Will thought he was going to see some beewbs but he ended up being a nice meal to her. Sometimes turning the lights off is not a good idea, I guess\u2026 Anyway, that made me surprised and amused at the same time.[/spoiler]", "comment_count": "2", "author": {"num_games_owned": 791, "steamid": "76561198120348301", "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 385, "last_played": 1499819098}, "recommendationid": "33482853", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.581552", "votes_up": 42, "timestamp_updated": 1499875491}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502721861, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "This games okay, I saw it on Lost Pause's channel and thought, meh, seems good, maybe if there's a sale I'll get it. Recently after, there was a Christmas sale, so I though \"Fuck It\" and bought for 2.50$ for a meh game like Malus Code, that's a good deal. \nThe game's slice of life, with a dash of romance, plus horror near the end (It's not that creepy) and it has three different routes for the three lab team members. I do admit tho, when the creepy music started playing and Yuri went crazy (in both the Yuri and Suszikake, or whatever her name is route) I did get a bit jumpy. So I'd say 6.5/10 on the scare factor. \n\nI'll list Pros, Cons, and Okay things about this game.\n\nPros: \nGood character designs/sprites\nNice backrounds\nGallery of photos is cool\nJukebox soundtrack is cool\nGood menu, with lots of things to tweak, like voices, screen, text etc. \nCharacters had interesting personalities and reactions \n\n\nOkay things:\nMentioning scientific terminology \nThe slight scare in two of the three routes\nCharacter Development (the way they developed) \nThe dash of fanservice \nThe \"romance\" \nThe backstories\n\nCons: \nPrice is too high \nThey should have worked on the plot some more, to make it more spoopy \n\n\nMy final rating: 3+1/2 stars (three stars, plus half a star) \n\nSeriously Steam, get a meh button, some people don't like or dislike something, they're in between.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 20, "steamid": "76561198280634243", "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1505592204}, "recommendationid": "34236927", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1502761786}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 15, "total_positive": 40, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 55}}
