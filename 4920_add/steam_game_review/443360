The story line is very weak, basically one of the heroes gets some brain implant and they travel to the future to get it removed via plastic surgery, thats it. Most of the characters are reused, there are maybe 3 new characters in the entire game. The game itself is very short,\n\nThe only possitive thing about this game is some funny dialogs, but even those are scarce, in the first game you could talk to characters about many subjects, in this game almost all of the dialogs go straight to the point.", "comment_count": "4", "author": {"num_games_owned": 96, "steamid": "76561198063459813", "playtime_forever": 3263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1503624870}, "recommendationid": "34501356", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.495146", "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1503742752}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 4, "total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 7}}
