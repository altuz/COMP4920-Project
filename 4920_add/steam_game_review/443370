It fixes much of the gameplay & pacing issues I met with previous episodes. A strong recommendation, one of the best match-3 games around. (I'm not sure why they still bother trying to sell us a story, though... There is absolutely nothing that's told here. Just like in most of the series. Not that it matters much, but a good story is always a plus, even in a casual game.)", "comment_count": "3", "author": {"num_games_owned": 3393, "steamid": "76561198081340622", "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 122, "last_played": 1498223103}, "recommendationid": "33482680", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.516437", "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1499874978}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 7}}
