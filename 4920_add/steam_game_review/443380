This is not Fate Stay Night in a bad way.\n\n They either did not read Fate Stay Night or they do not understand the themes of Fate Stay Night to understand how these two works differ vastly in narrative quality. There is clearly attempts made to invoke things Fate Stay Night does, but they all sort of miss the original purpose of their inclusion. Visual Novels tend to be slow to get going if they are long so I played the rest hoping it would redeem itself after the refund period had already passed. It did not redeem itself. The quality of assets and voice work is great but for me most of this game was trying too hard to be cool and ends up unrelatable and uninteresting power fantasy chuni nonsense. This visual Novel makes me hesitant to trust any other Novel made by this developer even with positive reviews. I am clearly not the targeted audience. Maybe this appeals to someone who isn\u2019t me.\n\n- - - What I disliked about the game - - - \n\n\n__Blasphemy built for the \u201clowest common denominator\u201d put bluntly is Not Interesting.__\n\n\nThe angel doesn\u2019t act like an angel ahaha, The devil doesn\u2019t act like a bad guy hahaha. Is tired and uninteresting without more layers. This game doesn\u2019t really have layers. What you see is what you get with a ton of biblical references thrown that are mostly excuses. You could count the amount of interesting/not forced biblical references on one hand if you are generous. The game is written clearly expecting you don\u2019t know much about religious philosophy and thus never does much with it\u2026. Which should probably be the whole point when at least 30%% of what is supposed to be interesting is the interaction of man, heaven, and hell in some forced cohesion.\n\n__Insanity is everywhere in the visual novel and done way too simply.__\n\n\nThe angels find out they are no longer immortal and this understanding of mortality shocks them so much that they start gleefully killing themselves and each other in a normally idealist place with no war or violence. But not all the angels\u2026 only the background character ones\u2026\nIt is more interesting to see the reaction of the character responsible for it than what could have been an interesting debate on what the knowledge of immortality does to people. But they chose the non sensical edgy isn\u2019t that so rad dude way.\n\nThere are examples like this everywhere in the novel as far as why things happen.\n\n\n__Nothing is very relatable and sensible/interesting motivations are scarce__\n\nI don\u2019t mind spoilers in negative reviews\n\nThe main character blames himself because he is an artificially made Jesus and feels responsible when a very very scientific world, which would normally turn people away from religion, suddenly needs faith because war that is never explained, as is how its possible to make proto jesus, but everyone goes crazy because oh my false Jesus isn\u2019t actual Jesus. I am using Jesus almost literally here.\n\nThe normal girl who you are supposed to be sort of able to think of as a normal human is artificially created by the bad guys to do some weird new world nonsense. Basically they tried to up the stakes in her route which cut the legs off developing her as the normal relatable character. Though the enemy motivations in this case are interesting it sacrifices any potential she has outside of being flat.\n\nAngel is BG because her motivations are clear enough you can understand what she is trying to do. However the reason for this is \u201c because it\u2019s what I do\u201d and generally ends up not being that interesting either. \n\nDark fun loving slootay school girl outfit pushed in girl is left super ambiguous till the final route because the whole point of the character hinges on it so she\u2019s entirely flat till you find out she isn\u2019t real but then that gets totally ignored in the ending and all that\u2019s left is how anime trope of the week she is.\n\n__The Fights are not grounded in any kind of rules and thus not relatable__\n\nAll my bones are broken, I instantly heal them with nanomachines\nNice way to artificially raise the tension and then remove all consequence of it\n\nThis sword summons sin stuff and every time there seems to be a limit it gets broken, and every time the limit is broken why that amount of summon power isn\u2019t always used becomes questionable. O\n\nObviously the chuni battles scale is so far from reality it becomes hard to gauge anything and thus you rely on the novel to have all opinions and thoughts for you\u2026. Which is difficult if you are a person who likes to think.\n-\n\n\n- - - What you might  like about the game - - -\n\nGood production values and art consistency \n(though nothing I found appealing enough to remember much of such as music\u2026. The music in the trailer being the major one I remember as I heard it a bunch while debating buying it and I get into the groove of a VN by playing the Opening video/theme every time I play it)\n\n\nSuper Power Fights\n(If you like people being so far from human and doing awesome stuff I am told this appeals to people like that. However it doesn\u2019t ground much in things I care about such as motivation or reason.)\n\nCLOSING\n\nThis game is not Fate Stay Night\n\nOne is about a normal person who meets various heroes while the visual novel debates heroism and sacrifice\n\nOne is about a guy who does super power stuff who is barely human that they spend the whole game trying to make relatable.\n\nShirou isn\u2019t a best main but at least I remember his name.\n\nI could rag on this game more but I would go way past character limit.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 303, "steamid": "76561198028422216", "playtime_forever": 1473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1463253658}, "recommendationid": "35009550", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499874", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505604813}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 3, "total_positive": 30, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 33}}
