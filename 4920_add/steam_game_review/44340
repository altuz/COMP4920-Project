You will actualy feel like your in tajikistan as you wade through country side on foot or in humve. The tatic plays are decent with being able to place orders to your 3 AI team mates who, for the most part are actualy good other than a few slip ups here and there. Orders such as protect person, or if you need to defend an area, can order them to take a building and defend it by using windows to shoot out of and such.\n\nIt angers me when people say that they cant stand the guy talking in the ride all the time because for me personally that just adds to the realism (now i have never joined the army) but i assume this is close to what it felt like during those times. Also people say that they cant stand the long humve drives, and again this for me plays a big part in actualy feeling like i'm traveling to my destination insted of 'skipping to the location'. If you have patience, you will love this.\n\nTL:DR This game will provide hours of enjoyment <<<\n\nPros:\nStoryline\nTactics\nVery Good AI for its time\nRealistic\n\nNegatives:\nCan feel clunky at times\nAppeals to certain people\nYou need patience!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501993772, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34052434", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198202508784", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1502040491, "num_games_owned": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 310}, "timestamp_updated": 1501993772, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Let me start off by saying, this game is one of a kind. This game puts you into a realistic and immersive environment, with not only objectives to complete, but you also have to maintain your squad. Now with Arma and Squad coming up, there really isn't any reason to get this title. If you like to have a nice fun, Immersive storyline and gameplay, then definitely try this one out. If you're looking for something a little more free and a little bit more challenging then definitely try out Arma or squad. Personally, I think this game is getting a lot of hate for the hole xbox live thing, but really I never had a problem with it. My final score would be a 6/10, this is only because they still have some bugs and they could've worked a little bit harder for some longer missions and maybe just a little less talking from the Sgt."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501494275, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499070", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "33924052", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108396650", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1501466821, "num_games_owned": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 12}, "timestamp_updated": 1501494275, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Idk if it's just me or maybe windows 10, Everything is updated win version, drivers etc, Ran fine when i had the non steam version back on windows 7, But, Now works fine until i get into a campaign misson or fireteam engagements, Crashes after 1 - 2 mins of playing, I've tried it 5 times now campaign twice and 3 times on fireteam engagements samething happens each time...."}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502750332, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488308", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34244919", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198271806838", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1501406709, "num_games_owned": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 383}, "timestamp_updated": 1502750332, "received_for_free": false, "review": "wtf happened?"}, {"votes_down": 10, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501245091, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480329", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33854668", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198079784502", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1501232480, "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 31}, "timestamp_updated": 1501320245, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Horrible game.\n\nA very annoying one to be specefic.
