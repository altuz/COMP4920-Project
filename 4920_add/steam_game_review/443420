Almost all the games I buy on Steam are from indie developers and I don't expect anything close to AAA features. But I do expect enjoyable and interesting gameplay.\n\nFirst impressions of Artificial Defense are really poor, not at all what I was expecting. The interface is confusing, even the tutorial took a while to figure out.\n\nThis is not really a TD game. If you are looking for an action game with very poor graphics and poor controls with only a few TD elements then this may be the game for you.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 510, "steamid": "76561198007513026", "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 199, "last_played": 1494280766}, "recommendationid": "31614764", "votes_down": 3, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502130", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1494280867}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 8, "total_positive": 29, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 37}}
