The addition of a dash and block are good but I hardly used them since I'm coming from the school of Power Stone where those things were an illusion. Controls feel ok but a tad loose. I can't explain it only that it doesn't have the snap of Capcom's aforementioned fighter. Also you're essentially doing what you did in Power Stone, collecting three maguffins to become a super being and reigning down pain on your opponent. Kinda wished I knew that going in. Also regardless of who you are you can only tranform into four monsters from what I can tell. They have interesting powers and they definitely turn the tide of battle which to some extent helps with balancing but the uniqueness of the characters doesn't get a chance to shine through. \n\nAlso the UI is missing some things for the sake of simplicity I wish would just get added instead. The Stone Counter and Radar I wish was present so it's a tad more obvious who has what stones and where they are on the maps. Items aren't nearly as diverse as Power Stone's Gallery but there are some interesting ones ala missles, boxing gloves and a helmet that gives you Zeus' Lightning. However, they're also stage specific. The stages themselves are an ok romp. Some are simple stages and some up the ante with hazzards that make you think of Power Stone 2 but you're still relagated to one arena. \n\nThe story was both good and bad. It's good in the sense that it doesn't take itself too seriously and is actually pretty funny. There's story transitions that last under a 40 seconds per fight so it's really quick but there are only two character campaigns in a roster of 10 characters. That's kinda sad man... Also the story has a very spotty anti drug message that seems to get lost in the fact that you win fights by taking the very same drugs you're mad at everyone else for taking.\n\n\nAlso, I kinda wish there was a tutorial. The game is simple enough to jump in and go ham but the AI starts doing some high level business that you kinda wish you could pull off. \n\nAll and all, this is a solid effort but it does need a tad more in the area of content for my liking. It's essentially a party game but I'd like to see the developers make more with it. I'm not sure it's done enough with the license to make me start going after LASTMAN as a series to follow and I do wish there was more content on display. \n\nI will say that getting it for it's $13 price is decent if you can part with that much for a bare bones brawler, especally if you're itching for a Power Stone fix. Otherwise, wait for a sale that takes a tad more off the top. If you can get it for $12 or less I can definitely recommend. The game is good but it shows potential to be better.\n\n", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 142, "steamid": "76561198114660148", "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1471841986}, "recommendationid": "23092431", "votes_down": 5, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.513834", "votes_up": 17, "timestamp_updated": 1463719170}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1463726827, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "LastFight is an excellent arena fighting game.  It is fun and casual-like, anyone can enjoy this game even if you're not a pro at fighting games.  I highly recommend this game.\n\nGameplay is fairly straightforward and with simple controls, you have:  attack, special attack, grab dodge, jump, block and dash.  There are no special inputs that you need to do to pull off combos they are all preset, so you just keep tapping the attack button and the character will pull off their unique moveset.\n\nWhat makes this game unique is there are items in the game that spawn and you can throw them at players.  There are also powerups that you can grab and transform into a super being for a limited time and wreak havoc.\nEach character in this game are all unique, you will definitely find a favorite.  The stages are well designed and are fun to fight in.\n\nThe replay value lies in the versus mode, you can team up with bots and fight against bots.  Just start a game and start brawlin to the death.  The story mode is VERY short, I completed it in 20-30 minutes, and there are only two characters with story missions.  They are pretty much the same fight-wise\n\nI have no gripes with this game.  All I want is more characters, modes, and stages.  From a hours to money standpoint I would say you will get your money's worth if you have friends over.  Playing solo can get tiring and not really worth it at full price.\n\nI hope this review was helpful.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 476, "steamid": "76561198040837514", "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "last_played": 1474871665}, "recommendationid": "23093493", "votes_down": 2, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.511488", "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1463726827}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1463722348, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "If you loved Power Stone 1&2 then this is for you.\n\nSame premise: 1vs1 or 2vs2 fighting in an open 3D arena, with lots of items & weapons to throw or use against your opponent, if you grab 3 unique power ups, you turn into a monstrousbeast that can perform special attacks and deal much more damage.\n\nPros:\n\n- tight controls, it feels really good\n- great amount of items & weapons\n- great visuals, cool art style & music\n- balanced difficulty \n- 4 player local co-op support\n\nCons:\n- No branching / choosing key levels\n- No real boss fights\n- Arenas are static, they don't change throughout the fight, unlike in Power Stone.
