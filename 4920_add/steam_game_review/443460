There two different scenarios in this game where you play as either a Male or a Female. Each character has their own endings and you have to complete every ending in the game to unlock \"The End\" ending which is a satifying ending in general. Some actions you do for one character will influence the outcome of some endings for the character. However, I have done some actions that led me nowhere but until I reset the game and I did the same thing and got the intended outcome... \n\nOverall this is another nice walking simulator with a good art style and music that has good replay value thanks to the multiple endings. Though be aware that you might have to restart the game at some points in case you get stuck at times.\n\nRating: 6/10", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1060, "steamid": "76561198166771313", "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 75, "last_played": 1492146037}, "recommendationid": "31129348", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505618", "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1492147199}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 9, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 10}}
