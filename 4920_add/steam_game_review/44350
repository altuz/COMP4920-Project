This is no exception. THe handling, graphics, and sounds are wonderful. Codemasters\u2122 has yet to fail. However, highly doubt that would ever happen due to their quality of games for the past few years. On the topic at hand; GRID 2 is a game that excites anyone. The game runs at over 120 FPS on my PC. Yes, it is very stable. I tested GRID 2 on a Mac too, and, it works fine. Of course, running it on my PC with 120+ FPS is the best experience. Anyhow, I bought this for $5 off Steam during the Summer sale. However, I feel this is worth it for its full price. Games such as PROJECT Cars that have poor handling and driving physics, GRID 2 is a relief for the racing sim market. My favourite video game is NFS World. Of course, with over 1000 hours on NFS World. Obviously, it would be my favourite video game. And that is correct. As you may know, NFS is an arcade racing game. I do like sim-racers though. So far, I feel that GRID 2 is the best sim-racer out there. Yes, beating NFS Shift and NFS Shift 2 Unleashed. From a technical standpoint; this game is lovely. However, not a lot of people play online. Well, you will occasionally bump into racers from time to time. Racing with friends, online, on GRID 2 is fun. You'll love this game if you like cars and enjoy racers. Hope this has helped. ^^"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506535040, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35246462", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198259972007", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506747964, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 544, "playtime_forever": 1486}, "timestamp_updated": 1506680784, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The most fun I've had playing an arcade racer and I've played a whole bunch of em. it's my go to game for a fast/good time with plenty of gameplay variety.\n\nNoticed a lot of people complain about cockpit view.

It is essentially the street version of Dirt 3, by the same developers too. The game is very playable, even with a controller, and probably keyboard too. Fun races, and the ability to play the full game without buying DLC. Controls are changeable, and you can custommize your livery quite alot. There is a career that is fun, and you can even do splitscreen, which is intersting for a game now, and it works perfectly as well. I generally enoy this game, and is fun to play when you need to relax a little. I definatly recommend this game to anyone who likes Dirt 3, or wants to try a racing game that is not overly difficult without a steering wheel like Asseto Corsa or Project CARS."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506112225, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499838", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35136973", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198168516924", "num_reviews": 30, "last_played": 1506626642, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 264, "playtime_forever": 318}, "timestamp_updated": 1506112225, "received_for_free": false, "review": "nice game"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506912086, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497983", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35402686", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198121975294", "num_reviews": 36, "last_played": 1506911606, "num_games_owned": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "playtime_forever": 224}, "timestamp_updated": 1506912086, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Could be a good game. It looks great, nice cars and all that but one problem. The first race you MUST use a Mustang. Now I like the car but not in this game. The car goes all over the place and is incredibly hard to control. I must have tried the first race 20 times and never got past 6th. One spin out and it is over and alas so is my game. I even tried buying DLC to use another car but it will not allow you. So your only option is custom races where you can use a decent car. I tried and won at that.
