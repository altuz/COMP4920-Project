Wasn't expecting a soviet russian dystopian future but I went with it. I was immediately drawn in by it's beautiful yet chisled graphics. It's portrayal of a terrible future outlined in stark yet plain colors, harsh yet real. \n\nWhat I didn't expect was to plumb toilets and fix motorbike wheels through. Too much for a private investigator like me.\n\nThe story drew me in, but the toilets spat me back up.

A society that is serving to make itself obsolete.\n\nThe visual style and musical accompaniment are quite well done. At times however it feels like the game underutilized it's own potential and comes off a bit short and brief. It feels like it's lacking a bit in exploratory options. Perhaps a bit to linear and in need of a bit more interaction in order to allow for greater immersion. \n\nThe English translation is a bit basic but it's well understandable although it could be worded much better. Gameplay wise it's not much besides some very basic shooting games and a bit of puzzle solving. You're probably looking at about 2 hours total from start to finish. \n\nThe visual statements are well represented at least. It's really the artistic merit that makes this game so enjoyable. The soundtrack is also pretty well done. The music does a good job of setting the mood as it changes from screen to screen with a number of enjoyable catchy tracks.\n\nThat being said if you're someone that enjoys Orwellian landscapes mixed with some good synth soundtrack. Along with a fairly short but intriguing tale of a Janitor caught up in espionage, confronting a cold technocratic socialist future that is spiraling out of hand.

As far as I have played, there are no real puzzles/you can't really decide how to interact etc., the game tells you where to go and that's that. Perhaps this will change later on, but I don't want to play until these horrbile bugs are fixed.
