The graphics is better, the AI improved and so it is more pretentious to play against the AI.\nWe also find up here in this season the cars, teams, tracks and drivers of the 2011 season. It is also possible again to play a whole career, which is very similar to the last year ones, to drive just short races, to drive on the tracks and to set times to learn the tracks better. \nThe car handling and visual details are significantly better, and the new Co-op Championship mode presents an exciting new way for your friends to experience the intense racing together. Maybe the driving physics and F1 rules could be embarrasing for amateurs, but for F1 fans it will be incredibly motivating.\n\nAt least I can only say that Codemasters optimized the whole game, better graphics, better sound, better AI and details like the customizing options, and a great coop mode. the game content is almost the same and is a big fun.\n\nI liked the game, every F1 fan who played F1 2010 as well, will like it too!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503957532, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34563265", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000577215", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1503957262, "num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 82}, "timestamp_updated": 1503957532, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Not working on W10.
