Still very doable of course, but without a controller you are going to have a lot more frustration, and a lot higher bloodpressure after a fer hours.\n\nOverall I would have to give this game an 8.5/10 .

Very goofy, playfu and gruesome theme that works very well\n- the gameplay is most of the times very fun.(depending on what level you are on). like mentioned earlier its probably inspired by SMB and Flappy Bird and it has taken the most appealing parts of thoose two games and merged them well.\n- Motivates the player to replay levels to get coins and unlock hats \\^O^/\n- a lot of varied levels to play\n- no bugs encountered! gratz!\n- fun but slightly too chaotic multiplayer mode.\n\nBAD\n-I only have one negative thing about the game to say but its a biggie for me. some of the levels are very unfair and not fun at all especially lvl 45... which is a fun idea but a horrible experience to actualy play. All the hardest levels are sadly at the moment the least satisfying. because they require precision to complete and the game lacks that in some of the controls, which leads to just replaying the levels untill you happens to slip through by chance (atleast for me) the charge move which should be used for precision sometimes put you in an unexpected direction after being used which contribute to this problem. \n\nI still think it is worth playing in its current state. the price is very fair for the content.

Word of advice to the developers, if you wish your game to sale PLEASE include a multiplayer and I GUARANTEE  sales will rocket  especially when youtube celebs begin playing it.
