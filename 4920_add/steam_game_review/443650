So, with that being said, I would DEFINITELY have to recommend this game based on its interesting storyline, extremely awesome soundtrack, and the art style! I enjoyed a lot of the different aspects of the different characters that you had to use throughout the game. That being said, this game did have bugs, and I did have to restart the game once to fix one of these bugs! Despite this, I would still reccommend the game to anyone who wants to play a game with a truly unique story and characters!", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 53, "steamid": "76561198057561552", "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1499644834}, "recommendationid": "33418385", "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505571", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1499645828}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "total_negative": 5, "total_positive": 17, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 22}}
