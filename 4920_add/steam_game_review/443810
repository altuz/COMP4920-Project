It starts out with an amazing premise, interesting gameplay, unique characters and then just doesn't do anything beyond that.\n\nLet's get this out of the way first: TitP is NOT a Visual Novel. It is not a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" game that many people seem to think it is. TitP is a simple management sim game and that's all it is. The choices presented to you throughout the 20~ hour story have little to no effect on the story. They may help you get to the end of it but they will never change the outcome. In this way it's essentially nothing more than a management sim with an on-rails story.\n\nStory wise, you \"play\" as Jack Boyd, a retiring police commissioner who wants to earn $500,000 before he retires in 180 days. The game takes place over those 180 days (gameplay wise it's around 150 days). You'll be introduced to the corrupt Major Rogers  who holds your job by the balls, the Sands Mafia who controls the city from the underground as well as a bunch of other interesting characters as you try to survive for 180 and earn all that money.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes it's not overly complicated. You spend 99% of the game overlooking a map of Freeburg (the city the game takes place in). Crimes will pop up around the city and it's your job to send officers to solve them. Your offierces have \"Professionalism\" points. Each officer will earn +10 every time they arrest the purp and officers with over 500 points are almost entirely self sufficent, being able to solve crimes on their own. There are some unique dispatches as well.  City Hall will sometimes ask you to do certain things (like fire all black officers) and it's up to you wheteher you wish to do things like that. Very early on in the game you get to choose a mafia side to team up with (you can't say no) and they'll sometimes ask you not to send officers to crimes in return for some money.\n\nThere are more options that open up as the game goes on, such as bringing back contraband to the police station or the mafia, sending officers to protests and forging evidence to pin any violence caused their on a certain faction. There also detective cases which are really quite fun. Sometimes a murder or robbery will happen and you'll have to send detective(s) to try and work out the crime. Every day a detective is assigned to it there's a chance you'll obtain photos of the scene. Once you have enough photos you can use witness accounts to piece together the crime and arrest the criminal. It's an interesting idea and stays strong throughout the entire game.\n\nSo where does it go wrong? The first and i'd say the biggest problem is that the game is just simply way too long. Story elements are few and far between and the game overstays it's welcome even before the halfwway mark. 150 days is a LONG time. The early game is absolutely the most fun as you're struggling to level up your ragtag officers, teaming them up with other awful officers to try and create a strong police force all the while trying to juggle tasks between the mafia and city hall. As the game goes on, it more or less just becomes \"send your best dudes and a few smaller dudes to the crime\". Once you get an officer past 500 points the game essentially becomes unloseable. If somehow a low point officer dies you just recruit a new one. Even the heavy crimes such as massacres and armed robberies become nothing to a high point officer leading some rookies. You can also choose to send a swwat team and paddy wagon to some crimes but with enough high point officers this isn't at all needed.\n\nApart from the game being too long, the gameplay remains stagnant. After learning what everything does and how to control your squad, the game does nothing with your experience. You will spend all your time sending officers to crimes. Mid game an interesting side quest pops up, but it can be solved fairly quickly and doesn't deviate from normal play. Choices you make have no impact on gameplay, officers dying means little, not sending officers to crimes doesn't seem to have much repercussion (sometimes you simply just don't have enough officers). Essentially, as long as you don't screw over the mafia you can coast to end game with a few strong officers.\n\nReally, there isn't much else to say. The gameplay is repetitive and never changes and the game goes for far too long. It could have ended after 60~ days and it would have been amazing. You unlock a sandbox mode after beating the game but by that time you'll never want to touch it again.\n\nPRO'S:\n- An interesting story with unique and interesting characters\n- An amazing concept with (inital) amazing mechanics\n- Each crime (and there's well over 500) has unique text that is almost always worth reading\n- The detective cases add a nice distraction from the gameplay\n- A great art style\n- Simple and easy to grasp gameplay\n- Great soundtrack\n\nCON'S:\n- Story elements are few and far between\n- Your choices made in game have little to no impact on anything\n- Game ends up becoming repetitive and goes for FAR too long\n- After a certain point the game requires no thought and is unloseable\n- No way to speed up each day\n\nTL;DR A interesting and unique concept that falls flat on it's face. The game lasts far too long with no incentive to go forward apart from the scattered story elements.

The music is excellent, and I was happily buying new music from the catalog the moment it was available. The voice-acting is top-notch (with the notable exceptions of a few characters). The story dumps you into a seedy and intriguing world of police-work that legitimately makes you want to see what's going to happen each day (for a few hours).\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe game's main mechanics just do not hold up to the amount of time you have to spend to complete the game. By halfway through the game, it had become a grind and I just wanted the days to be over as quickly as possible so I could get to the next cutscene. The story starts to become a bit predictable as well, and the depth of characters becomes noticably worse somewhere near a 1/3 of the way through the game.\n\nAs many others have already pointed out, the game's inclusion of real social issues holds a lot of promise for deeper narrative and difficult choices, but the the issues are presented at such a shallow (and sometimes farsical) level and with so little consequence that it borders on being insulting to one's intelligence. It's a bad sign when the game's primary motivator for serious social encounters, City Hall, is something you start to laugh at and ignore routinely because you know nothing will really come from it.\n\nRecommend?\n\nIf you're the kind of person who really enjoys routine, you might find joy past the first few hours of this game. I have trouble sticking with games that don't stay \"fresh\" throughout, and if you're the same, I'd say give it a pass.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 193, "steamid": "76561197969567077", "playtime_forever": 691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 302, "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506389226}, "recommendationid": "35214031", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500185", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506390760}, {"votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505742694, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "It's a good game only because I liked the story.

Well I guess if you like point and click games, sure.\nbut it's nothing more than that.\n\nSome interesting aspects are the in game mini game, but it was so poorly executed. There are 2 in-game mini games that happens without giving you any hints. So you either get i or you don't.\n\nAnd the \"skip scene\" option that they provided so that you can fast forward dialogues also fast forwards all the frames, what that means is, pressing once will skip 4-5 frames. meaning you'll miss certain aspect of the story.\n\nLast point I have about the game is that when bad things happens to your officers, sometimes you don't know why. and so you will keep sending out your officers to respond to calls and then they just die while on the way there. no reasons, no idea why and what that means, is that you cannot rectify the problem.\nIt happened to me in the last 2-3 weeks in-game. and i had at least 15-20 officers die on me... And i can't rectify the problem or don't know why... And all the replacement cops are too lousy, so when they respond to bigger cases, they get shot...\n\nI am giving it a Thumbs up despite my mostly negative review, and it is only because i like the story and story telling methods.
