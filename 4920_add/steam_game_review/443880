This game was a bit difficult for me, and I admit i'm not the best gamer. Finishing it in one sitting isn't realistic for me. The video advertised that the enemy took a card from you when you died (That doesn't sound too bad right??) but you actually lose ALL your cards and all progress when you die. I thought this was going to be a cutesy turn based costume quest- It's not.", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 48, "steamid": "76561198121076471", "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1500257872}, "recommendationid": "33598848", "votes_down": 11, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.483576", "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1500258384}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 28, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 29}}
