So I wishlisted it, being a sceptic towards early access and all. But ever since I did, I've revisited the gamepage frequently, rewatching the trailer dozen times every week, reading reviews, searching for more footage from the game. 2 days ago I couldn't resist it anymore and I just HAD to buy it. And boy am I happy I did!\n\nIf you're like me, and enjoyed the post-apocalyptic atmosphere and badassery of Lucas Arts' \"Full Throttle\" and Double Fine's \"Brutal Legend\", and don't mind this game being neither 3rd person 3D or \"point and click\", then this might be something for you.\n\nYou traverse in a \"semi-openworld\" game, and by \"semi\" I mean that there's a map with locations that you can choose and instantly travel to with your motorcycle, meaning that you don't partake in the actual travelling. To be an actual \"openworld\"-game IMO would be if the game had several different routes interconnecting the world that you would either have to travel manually or at least be given the choice alongside a fast-travel option. Personally, I don't mind really. In fact, for this game in particular, I prefer it this way. And maybe you do to. ;)\n\nWhen travelling to different locations you'll encounter alot of interesting characters, some of them just there for the sake of giving the game more depth, many NPC's for subquests, and others further developing the main story of the game. So nothing out of the ordinary there compared to other games, but you're actually given dialogue-choices, so depending on your answers, the outcome is changable, and I think it's AWESOME!\n\nMany interesting locations to discover! Keep in mind that it's early - VERY EARLY - access, so there aren't too many locations yet, I've been to all the current locations in just over 2 hours of playtime, but those locations that are currently available are some next-level eyecandy! There's some platforming, enough to keep the leveldesign interesting, but not too much. It is mainly a 2D brawler with grinding-features and an actual story. Now, what I mean by grinding is that you travel back to areas you've been to, just for the looting from foes and staged away throughout the areas, so that you may craft new items from all the scavenging and looting. If you don't care much for crafting, then stay clear of this game. But if you don't mind that extra feature, then go for it! :)\n\nTo sweeten the deal, there are voice-actors for every NPC's I've encountered thus far. Most of them are decent, while some of them are just terrific! As a matter of fact: the voice of the narrator (and also the protagonist's stepfather) is one of the many reasons why I ended up buying the game. To sum it up: although early, and even though combat might feel a bit clunky and lacking finesse, some of it might feel unpolished and quirky, but still I am happy I bought this game. It's truly unlike anything I have in my library, even though it can be compared to other titles in terms of core mechanics and gameplay. I have high hopes and expectations for this game, only by experiencing it in it's current state, and you should too. ;)", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 587, "steamid": "76561197984662922", "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1505947419}, "recommendationid": "35108475", "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506011214}], "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 18, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 19}}
