The worst. There are no worse games.\n\nI can excuse the poor translations, the questionable framerates, the graphics...but this game simply is impossible to beat. It cannot be done.\n\nI spend AN HOUR WITH THIS GAME. So you can thank me later. I spent an hour with this game and I could not progress past that point. Though really, you can reach that point in about...maybe fifteen minutes, probably less. Ten? Just depends on how good you are at avoiding instakill laser \"traps\" and bear traps. Lots of bear traps. And lasers. And bear traps.\n\nWhich is kind of hard to do considering your character sort of wobbles around like a Teletubby on a Skittles binge. You sway side to side and step on things you didn't think you would step on. \n\nI got to a section where you have to jump from platform to platform to advance, but the mouse button that makes you jump only seems to activate at random, meaning that you will simply walk forwards without jumping into the black abyss only to respawn at the beginning platform (without even the coutesy of having your joke of a stamina meter recharge).\n\nIt was an exercise in futility. This game doesn't work. Steam refunds, you are my Jesus.\n\nTo hell with this game. I saw guns in the video, but I never made it that far. I at least wanted to get to the part with guns. I wanted to at least get three bucks worth of lulz out of this game. \n\nBut no. No such lulz were had. \n\nTo hell with Unknown Battle.", "comment_count": "1", "author": {"num_games_owned": 205, "steamid": "76561198070983964", "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1458033095}, "recommendationid": "21848921", "votes_down": 15, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.566028", "votes_up": 67, "timestamp_updated": 1458048843}, {"votes_funny": 68, "timestamp_created": 1458015613, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "I actually barely have words for this game.\nYou know what, fuck that, I have tons of words.\nFirst off, fuck this game.\nSecond off, fuck this game.\nThis game is made in Unity.

Seriously. It's so simple, and yet after nearly two hours, I still haven't been able to get through it because sometimes you will just not jump at all, no matter how hard you smash your spacebar. Also, don't be fooled by the \"Load\" option on the main screen, there will be no saving your progress. At least not of your own accord, even at places where I assumed the game would probably save, it didn't. Before getting to the jumping maze, I had to watch the little intro about 10 times, and then a few more times after I made the unwise decision to ALT TAB to lower my volume, and the game proceeded to crash and somehow slow my whole system down. \n\nLook, I didn't expect it to be good, I just expected it to be at least somewhat playable. I wanted hilarabad, and all I got was \"Why won't you just jump?!\" \n\nNever even got to shoot a gun. \n\n...I'll probably go back to it at some point because I'm a masochist and I'm determind to beat the stupid maze, but for now, I need a break.
