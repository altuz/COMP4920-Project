They mixed SAO, Minecraft, and fanservice in order to attract the demographic of ecchi anime gamers. Sometimes it looks like they literally ripped Minecraft screenshots to put in the game.\n\nArt isn't bad, but is sometimes inconsistent since they use at least three artists and their styles are sometimes not consistent with each other. This is especially true in the colouring and shading. If you're bothered by this, it will probably throw you off, though I only saw it happen once in the time I played. Also, you are not going to see anybody with less than a DD bust in this game, unless it's literally the MC's mom. If you want variety, this isn't the place for you.\n\nThere is nothing special about the story since it's just a vehicle to get you to the boobs. The writing is sometimes awkward, and there are more adjectives for things than you can shake your purple prose bible at. I will give them props for having some creativity with the world (literally called Burokku) though they mostly used Minecraft elements to justify it.\n\nI am not usually into ecchi, but I do like ecchi with good stories or comedic writing. In this case, this was just not for me. But if you're part of the aforementioned demographic and are OK with just going for the fanservice, give it a go.\n\nEdit: In case you guys want a preview of what the game looks like, I did a playthrough of the first half of the game. https://youtu.be/kJthKFXPPFA", "comment_count": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 420, "steamid": "76561198049734003", "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "last_played": 1455830149}, "recommendationid": "21331411", "votes_down": 22, "received_for_free": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.575062", "votes_up": 68, "timestamp_updated": 1456561738}, {"votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_created": 1456101522, "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "review": "Burokku Girls is a short, mostly linear visual novel with ecchi themes, and an emphasis on women with large breasts.

I did actually like the story and think it had a pretty decent plot that might've made a good Anime OVA like those from the late 90's with only 3~6 episodes. That being said, I wished the story could've been longer with more choices. If you're interested in purchasing, and the physical appearance of the girls isn't a turn off for you, pick it up on sale like I did, when it's around $4.99, or so. I think that's a better price point for a VN of this length with it's limited choices. Don't let my play time fool you. I read slow due to poor eyesight, and take lots of breaks while reading.

This confuses me, since Time Tenshi's cliffhanger ending still hasn't been resolved with the sequel yet, but what can you do, right? If you haven't played Time Tenshi, the basic gist of these games is a focus on a deep \"plot\" and \"well-developed\" characters, by which I mean \"great big gazongas\". The actual storylines aren't bad, but at times they feel like more of a conveyor belt for floppy funbags, and it's safe to say that if you're not buying it for the sweater puppies you might want to look elsewhere. I didn't really like the story of Burokku Girls as much as I did Time Tenshi, but it was still decent outside of the occasional moment where it fell too deep into anime cliche. This game is notably darker than Time Tenshi, however, which might be off-putting for people just looking for a good wank. But the real question is, does it end on a cliffhanger like Time Tenshi?
