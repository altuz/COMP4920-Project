{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499625915, "review": "Intro: When I joined Steam in 2012, my first attempt at VNs (visual novels) and A.I. storytelling was Analogue- A Hate Story and Hate Plus. I discovered Unhack shortly thereafter and I can say with certainty that InvertMouse's series is the more accessible of the two. Both make my list for VNs that I would recommend to newcomers, but if they approach this after being introduced to anime or manga, Unhack is better choice and Unhack 2 has significant improvements.\n\nPros: [list]\n[*] The first narrative (while simple and summarized in the first minute of the story) is the foundation for the sequel. Going from this I did not expect narrative directions that genuinely surprised me. While pushing forward to this end, Unhack 2 still finds time to respect the first game's characters; provides time to feel closure; and delivers an emotional punch to conclude the entire story. Much appreciated.\n[*] The art impresses and takes leaps and bounds from the original. Excellent variety of expressions, some beautiful wallpapers and the impressive new artist mimicking and contrasting the old style using pixels, low-res/high-res images, and color work. Even more impressive when it makes narrative sense that A.I. have multiple generations of graphics for past and present.\n[*] Reasonable length so it won't take too many hours out of your life (Unlike some MUCH longer VNs. Looking at you [spoiler]Sunrider Academy[/spoiler]).\n[*] Gameplay is more interactive than the usual VN, which I appreciate. Requires skill thinking the further you get to the end. From my experience, dual-genre VNs don't often have this narrative/game balance (Again I'm looking at you [spoiler]Sunrider Academy[/spoiler]).\n[*] By losing the voice acting, reading speed and narrative flow have improved. And if you need to hear those actresses again; there are bits of the soundtrack narrated by the original cast. \n[*] And on that note, it's a damn good soundtrack.\n[/list]\nCons (or Meh points): [list]\n[*] Considering the narrative, this will likely be the last Unhack game. It was a good ride and I'm glad it impressed me as much as it did. \n[*] Looking the works of InvertMouse as a whole; I may prefer Cursed Sight and The Last Birdling slightly over Unhack, but only because I value cultural stories and there are roughly 10 well-known A.I. stories (or rather A.I. names) that I can recall in various mediums. Not for lack of trying, but I'm not 100% familiar.\n[/list] \n\nSummary: Thank you InvertMouse for making a phenomenal sequel. I believe this series achieved what it wanted to. A more heartfelt look at A.I. interactions with humans. Considering I can still ignore Cortana on my PC, I'd say we're safe for now and I can enjoy narrative journeys in peace. Here's hoping the future is full of friendly A.I. who aren't comprised of HAL, GLaDOS, Wheatley, SHODAN, and the Sibyl System. [spoiler](Those five would terrify the hell out of me[/spoiler]. Keep up the great work and I look forward to The Last Birdling and Without Within 3.\n\nP.S. May the mouse be ever inverted and the costume mods forever declined.\n\nThanks for Reading\n\nShining_Falcon (~RB)\n\nSimilar Game Titles to Recommend: [list]\n[*] Analogue- A Hate Story and Hate Plus- Two other great introduction VNs. Analogue has a bit of code typing required, Hate Plus does not, but both rely on A.I. or computed-recorded Human memories to tell their story. A lot of text and a lot of diary entries to read, but it makes the emotional punch when it has to. Plus you get commentary during the game like Unhack, so good job for that. Plus they have multiple ending including an optional harem ending, which most VNs refuse to do. [spoiler](requires remembering the code to a particular diary entry)[/spoiler] All in all, worth looking into and Christine Love's earlier work.\n[*] Portal, Portal 2, or System Shock 2- Other A.I. stories. Just scary, funny, and all over the place. Won't forget these ones easily.\n[*] System Shock remake- Releasing in 2018- Hopefully it lives up to the legacy of the 2nd game.\n[*] Ghost in the Shell (&Stand Alone Complex )The big franchise which tackles something similar to Unhack and Unhack 2. Lot of anime films, TV series, Live-action movie, or a free-to-play game to work with. Not a series I particularly enjoy, but I've only seen bits and pieces. Worth having a look since it's all on Steam now.\n[/list]", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510888", "timestamp_created": 1499625743, "recommendationid": "33411658", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "steamid": "76561198077101270", "last_played": 1499370816, "num_games_owned": 334}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500876163, "review": "Solid game, took about 3.5 hours to complete.\n\nMuch more story-focused than the first game, with less actual gameplay, but more dialogue.
