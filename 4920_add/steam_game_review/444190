You have to make good use of the 3 planes you can dash into (Example: normal grunts you can just run up to them and slash them, but spear grunts will most likely hit you first if you do not use the planes to get behind them). Bosses are kind of cheap, but that is just part of the charm of a game like this (Pay attention to the trailer on how to make big damage to them ^^).\n\nSome nice touches the game has:\n - Heroine is basically an anime version of the female character from the first Golden Axe (This is WHY she has that outfit on).\n - The mount works almost identical to the ones on Golden Axe (Get knock out of the once and you have a chance to get on them again, get knock twice and you lose the mount).\n -  When you beat a stage a map shows up the next stage (like you know what game).\n -  When the heroine loses a life, she stays KO on the ground while the HP of the next life fills up and then she gets up again (a nice touch instead of the generic \"flashes dead and appears again\" that most games like this has).\n - While short, it actually is pretty challenging on the normal difficulty and up (you have a limited amount of continues).\n - Last but not least ... the big grunts can bearhug our heroine! xD\n\nWould bring again a barbarian waifu home!!! 11/10", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501157", "timestamp_created": 1482886157, "recommendationid": "28733097", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198016042536", "last_played": 1483612119, "num_games_owned": 343}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1473236114, "review": "Got to the end within an hour.

The difficult is a bit high but it's ok after a few game over -_-\"\n\nPro :\n- Smooth animation\n- Responsive Control\n- Rare to find air combos in side scroll type\n- Good AI and variety enemies attacks\n- Great boss fight\n- Cool BGM\n\nCon (you can fix in future update) :\n- I think enemies should drop some HP / MP recover item\n- Should add invincible frame for special attack\n- the air attack combos hitbox should a bit more wider.  Sometime air combos miss if you get to close to enemy.\n\nStill waiting for future update.\nIf you like side scroll beat'em up and challenge game.

The game is running quite flawlessly for a game that is in early access and has just been released. \n\nBug-wise, I ran this game a couple of times by now, and I ran into no critical ones yet. \n\nPerformance-wise, it performs very well even for my quite old laptop. \n\nGameplay-wise, the character animations feel smooth, and the designs are pretty neat. The main heroine's voice acting is pretty decent too. Hits seem to register correctly. The combo system is pretty straightforward and not too difficult to get used to with one's preferred key figuration and precise timing. I played on Normal difficulty, and the balance between mobs, bosses, and the main heroine felt pretty fair. It might feel unfair to some of the players as the main heroine can't guard and has a shorter range than the enemies. However, they all have certain patterns that you have to adapt to. It's just something you learn the hard way.\n\nSound-wise, it might not look like it from the trailer, but the hit sound effects are good enough. BGM-wise, it does get repetitive, but I feel like the gameplay makes up for it.\n\nTherefore, the game seems to be on the right track, generally feels worth the price, and most importantly, it is fun.
