As such, it had simplified controls, simplified models, simplified textures, simplified UI and simplified everything else. This was fine, and in time the game has gotten a small community of it's own. But porting the mobile, severely dumbed down version back to PC, has not made it a true alternative to the original.\n\nI'll make it simple for you.\nIf you play Blitz on mobile devices a lot, and only occasionally want to play a game on the PC, do go ahead and try this. It will let you play the same game, so you keep your progression and everything else between your mobile devices and the PC.\nIf on the other hand you don't play mobile games much if at all, and just want a game to play exclusively on the PC, please forget about this. Then you should go download the full, original World of Tanks for PC from their webpage. It's just as free, much better, more content, bigger community and more fun.\n\nOh, and if anyone thinks they can use this game to sit on a PC with keyboard and mouse, and stomp on players running it from mobile devices. Sorry, but there are separate matchmaking queues.

I personally don't think this is as casual of a game as it seems to be considering that if you don't really have a plan or be versatile with the situation, you can die very quickly missing put on a lot of the action. I must include that it does not mean that you're supposed run away from everything just to survive until the end but to understand your role in the battle and act accordingly. Acting accordingly can mean many things differing with which tank you're driving hence gaining experience the hard way so you know what to do in certain situations.\nOne thing to mention is that this game is not a pay-to-win game and is more skill based, although I think that WarGaming is heading towards a grey area with recent updates but ultimately, those functions are boosters and there is still skill required to be able to effectively draw the full potential of each tank.\n\nI ranted on too much and for those who felt that it seems too complicated I'll just say that its not that hard of a game if you learn and think, everything else should naturally follow with it.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508984", "timestamp_created": 1485498697, "recommendationid": "29515858", "language": "english", "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198093376980", "last_played": 1505276028, "num_games_owned": 7}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 4}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1487891197, "review": "[h1]pros: [/h1] \nits one of those skill required games. these are always not so good for new players but you will learn over time. \n\nif you ever wanted to drive an old tank from the yee old times you can vurtually do it. \n\nsuper easy to run compared to actual world of tanks, also no artillery!\n\nevents for basically free tanks.\n\nits free.... why would you not want a free game?\n\nvery fun when you get into it.\n[h1]cons:[/h1]\nmobile optimised but who really cares about that?\n\nP2W basically but i do not suggest getting any premium tanks. just rush the tank you use the most to a higher tier and you will be more happy than a premium tank that is stuck at a certian tier.\n\nlots of toxic use of the voice chat. mainly used for throwing shit at other people doing stupid things and camping tank destroyers when they should be used as campers.\n\nno autolock (unless you right click) but hey, your not a console player... your a pc gamer.... you dont need it.\n\ngraphics are kinda meh, but dont let the graphics stop you from playing\n\n[h1]conclusion:[/h1] \nif you like world of tanks but you have a potato for a pc and you cant run the other version of world of tanks, this is your game. its free. its fun. i cant recommend it enough\n\n\nnotes: this opinion is not bias.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509715", "timestamp_created": 1486917937, "recommendationid": "29877368", "language": "english", "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": "24", "author": {"playtime_forever": 6781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 791, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198233661432", "last_played": 1506979409, "num_games_owned": 23}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 15}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1485916753, "review": "Finally found a game where I can interchangeably play from the PC and then swap to the tablet when it's time to do business elsewhere, involving porcelain.\n\nOn a serious note, I actually enjoy playing this much more over the original World of Tanks mostly because of the smaller size teams, maps, and no Artillery.
