It's a very relaxing and \"zen\" type of experience that serves as a great way to pass some time. \n\nThere are 120 stages in all, with many \"Alice in Wonderland\" themed mosaics to complete. The puzzle scale up in difficulty but remain enjoyable. Think of assembling the mosaics as doing a jigsaw puzzle with no exact edge pieces. This game has you instead focus on the shapes of certain pieces and the the colors, which makes it very stimulating. It can also be very challenging to get the 100% rating on each level (complete it, complete within time limit, complete with no mistakes), but the game doesn't give you a penalty or make you feel bad if you do make a mistake or take a long time to complete it. You can always go back to play any puzzle you've already completed if you feel like re-attempting. There are also opportunities to use hints or add time to the clock to help you achieve your goals. You can keep re-attempting a puzzle as many times as you'd like to \"practice\" it, in order to make it easier with each attempt. \n\nThis is a very \"friendly for all\" type of game for the above reasons. If you are not a completionist or simply want to play at your own pace, you can do so without having any fun taken away from the game itself. If you want a bit more of a challenge, then you can try to perfect each level. \n\nThe only tedious thing about this is the 100,000 coins achievement - as I only ended up with just over 50,000 after I finished the game. There was no new puzzles for me to complete, so you sort of have to \"grind\" for the rest of the coins. The game features calm music (although it's only one song throughout), great variety, relatively easy achievements and cards. Would recommend to any puzzle lovers.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513899", "timestamp_created": 1495918003, "recommendationid": "32005318", "language": "english", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "steamid": "76561198053984243", "last_played": 1496356655, "num_games_owned": 881}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 15, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 14, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
