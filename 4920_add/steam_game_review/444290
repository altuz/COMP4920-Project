Now, if you're familiar with the aforementioned game, then that one statement will already have said a lot to you regarding this latest release.\n\nAs far as top-down, wave-based shooters go, this title has got to be one of the worst; it's so bottom of the barrel the developer didn't even finish it. Yes, that's right, despite several delays that cumulatively amounted to over a year, Dagestan Technology still had the nerve to release this pile of steaming poo even though there are only three levels in the entire game. Once you kill all of the zombies in level three and speak with the scientist, he will tell you there are still more zombies that are alive but there aren't. \n\nThe only developer \"support\" in the forums are a total of four comments, saying that the game will be released \"soon\" sometime last year. 28 Waves Later released in March, 2017 and was obviously swiftly abandoned, as there are no indications that the developer is still working on the title, and he does not address the 3 pages of threads regarding all of the bugs. So forget the fact that there are only a handful of zombie models, the same repeating background, terrible enemy AI, that the gun clip can go into negative bullets and still be functional, the complete lack of health and ammo pickups... the game isn't even finished! To top it all off, the achievements don't even work.\n\nAnd to think, Dagestan Technology is trying to sell this hunk of gorilla turd for $5.49 CAD at the regular price, it isn't even worth the $0.54 CAD at a -90% off sale. Absolutely inexcusable, and insanely familiar of the bullcrap that Lord Kres pulled with Journey of the Light. Now all that needs to happen is when Steam goes to pull this game down, the dev claims that a pre-upload patch fouled the game up and that there actually are more levels. Yeah... right.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING. Scam developer.
