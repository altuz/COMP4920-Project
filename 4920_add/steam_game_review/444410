That will be more fun to play with than this game...\n\nThis is not a game, it is a cryengine map.\n\nThe only plus of it, is that cryengine allows the forest in the middle to look somewhat nice if you ignore the floating grass that is around.\n\nAll the game consists of, is walking around a dull maze, finding 8 pressure plates, and then finding the exit.\n\nYou are even able to just fly around the map if you press f4 to go into flymode (Intended for developer use)\n\nI bought this game because i enjoyed maze runner, and thought i'd give it a shot.\n\nBut seriously, dont buy this game in its current state.

I'm a fiction writer, therefore games like this sometimes serve as inspiration, putting me in the right location mindset, the rain, the desolate quiet, the somewhat eerie aloneness...  I get them for atmosphere, to kinda put me in the right place in my mind to write.  Which basically means, I got what I paid for.  A strange world to stand in and wander a little to get a feel for a location.  Sadly, otherwise, I can't think of any reason to get it.  Head bobbing you can't turn off, no save feature, and endless rain, walls of bricks that seem to go on forever, grass, mountains and rocks that hover over the ground...  I mean, you get what you pay for I suppose, and I only paid 62 cents, but still....  Do I recommended it?  Not really.  It says I played it for 1.8 hours.  That's because I fell asleep 3 times trying to find all the plates to stand on.  Found the end of the maze just fine, but then to find the last three plates...  I just couldn't hold my head up anymore and looky at that, no way to save.  *sigh*  This COULD have been a lot more.  So I say give this one a pass.  I might go back in to try agan eventually, but right now, no thanks.
