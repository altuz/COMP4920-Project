This is below even the Bubsy games, at least I could finish those.\nEvery enemy in this game has instant attacks, the game is grid based, except when it isn't and the delineation isn't clear. The concept is interesting, but the execution is so poor that ramming your head into your desk until you forget about this game is a better use of your money.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "timestamp_created": 1504402489, "recommendationid": "34699744", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "steamid": "76561198132473019", "last_played": 1489412676, "num_games_owned": 390}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 11, "review_score": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "Negative", "total_negative": 9}}
