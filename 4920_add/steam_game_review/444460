After all the problem with most these games is that once you are seen its often game over, so that mechanic could had been cool if used right. Unfortunately it has mostly some useless telekinetic kick and push options and its very hard to push a character off the edge of the map in fact I havent succeeded once. Otherwise all enemies are clones of each other, the dialogue is so bad it had to be on purpose, or written by very young, or very very very unskilled people, or non english people... its hard to tell but ... it really goes further than cringeworthy and just is flat out ... corrosive to read, and eats at you that such blind display of low intelligence is on a storeshelf product. Anyways I tried to finish map 2 but some invisible enemy started sniping me through walls once i got to the top of the platforms and I am thinking it was just hardcoded there to obfuscate the fact that there is no more content after that", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498497", "timestamp_created": 1493556567, "recommendationid": "31462953", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1973, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "last_played": 1493556153, "num_games_owned": 4956}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495487560, "review": "Really? a 70$ game with no sense at all if this game worth 1$ still don't buy it :-(", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495834", "timestamp_created": 1495487560, "recommendationid": "31907993", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "steamid": "76561198098294496", "last_played": 1459880611, "num_games_owned": 717}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": true, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 26, "review_score": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "Negative", "total_negative": 24}}
