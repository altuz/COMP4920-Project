Implemention solution to puzzles is a chore and clunky. Figuring out puzzles straightforward. Story is flat and flavorless.\n\nPlatformer with one screen levels and either shadow clone management or multicharacter management. Levels always stay the same except you can use shadow clones as platform. In that sense it reminded me a lot of \"Another Perspective\" Broken Dreams is arguably worse without controller support, and with more fluff text for story but it mostly involves a love obsessed stalker and some kind of hard to get valley girl. The core gameplay is always to bring objects to an exit point and rearranging either crates, protags, or shadows to get there, getting a nugget of story on the next level as reward.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1501971439, "recommendationid": "34047637", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1973, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "last_played": 1501971242, "num_games_owned": 4956}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 75, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 43, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 32}}
