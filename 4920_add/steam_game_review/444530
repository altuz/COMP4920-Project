Right now it just pauses for 5 seconds and the music doesn't even change. Probably just needs a sound effect.\n- It'd be nice for the lasers to 'lock on' when you point it at the correct location. There were many instances of when the mirror would move as I let go of the trigger, mostly at long distances.\n- I couldn't work out how to see what progress you've made as you go. I didn't know what level I was up to but pressed the menu button. In the main menu all the targets are red and didn't know how to get back to the last level I was on. Perhaps if they changed colour upon completion. Perhaps a scoreboard or progress indicator on the wall in game.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506880", "timestamp_created": 1460463008, "recommendationid": "22374125", "language": "english", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561197964105282", "last_played": 1462707270, "num_games_owned": 84}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1460532882, "review": "Fun game, no need for a teleport mechanic, it fits entirely in a 2m x 2m area (you can squeeze by with a little less in one dimension, like 1.8m).
