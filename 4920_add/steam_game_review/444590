So here you have them, revel in their existence.\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Category[/th]\n        [th]Score 0 to 10[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Artstyle[/td]\n        [td]9[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Sound[/td]\n        [td]9[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]8[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]World/Atmosphere[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Interface[/td]\n        [td]6[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Performance[/td]\n        [td]7[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nSo there you have the numbers...happy now?\nA quick sentence to each category to explain the scores would help in my eyes so here we go:\n[b] Artstyle 9 out of 10[/b] \nThe Art style is pixel art in its whole pixelated glory. There is still room for improvement, but as it is now it's a strong pillar of the game quality.\n[b] Sound 9 out of 10[/b] \nSoundtrack is very fitting, and adds a lot to the atmosphere, only problem here are your steps when walking on snow. They feel out of sync with the actually steps and are kind of annoying. The sound is equally well done as the artwork.\n[b]Gameplay 8 out of 10[/b]\nQuite good and solid gameplay, takes some time to get used to and is fairly limited in the number of moves you have. But there are enough to keep the combat from feeling boring or stiff. There are some minor problems, like walking into rooms and getting hit instantly, but a quick roll as soon as you enter normally solves this^^\nI highly advice to experiment with all the moves and tools you get, as everyone has its value and will help somewhere quite considerably.\n[b] World/Atmosphere 10 out of 10[/b]\nAll the care that went into art style and music really pays off here, as well as all the little hints and details about the story and world. It feels amazing whenever I understand a new part of the whole place, and it is even more amazing as I know that all these things will play some part in the next game of this developer. One of the most important parts of any game with a soulslike death mechanic, the lore explanation for the immortality/reviving of the protagonist after death is really well done here\u2026this goddammed watch, I always stare at it with horror as it ticks forward scarred of what shall happen\u2026\n[b] Interface 6 out of 10 [/b]\nWhile not broken the interface is far from being intuitive and is easily the weak point of the game. There is no sign to tell when a dialog is over, textboxes from picking up lost vitea can easily block the view over characters/enemies and the interface for choosing different actions when talking to someone feels kind of to awkward to navigate. But the important parts, like the main menu are working just fine and even when something feels unintuitive it still does what it is supposed to as soon as you understand how to use it. So, while bad at certain places, it does not manage to take much away from the experience as a whole.\n[b] Performance 7 out of 10 [/b]\nI played through the game without any problems at all, but since then I can\u2019t start it without crashing. The developer promised a bugfix in around a week or so, and it seems to only affect win10 laptops of a certain kind. But because of the refund system that steam has I do not see this as a problem, if it does not work just give it back. Otherwise no lags or even small bugs or glitches in my playthrough. If the Bug is fixed I will obviously change this part of the review.\n[b] Final Words [/b]\nWhile surely not a game for those who are unwilling to learn and maybe suffer a bit on the way, it is a good choice for all those that like pixelart, passion fuelled projects and a dark atmosphere.\nThanks for reading, if you still have unanswered questions regarding the game feel free to ask. \nNow just get the game and sign the contract.\nIt\u2019s for the best.\nTrust me.\nMaster of Suicide", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505182", "timestamp_created": 1505139339, "recommendationid": "34883542", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "steamid": "76561198068648180", "last_played": 1505309504, "num_games_owned": 178}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507057057, "review": "Shrouded in Sanity is a magnificent little gem of a game that I stumbled upon by accident, and I consider myself fortunate to have done so. It is a wonderful action/adventure/rpg with clear influences by Bloodborne, as well as the Souls series, utilizing the aforementioned game's sense of constant danger, terror, and nuanced lore in order to draw players in and keep them engaged throughout the, about, 4 hours that the first playthrough lasts. \n\nIn terms of story, the game starts with our unnamed protagonist being unearthed and resurrected from her grave by a mysterious person, absent any recollections of who she was before her death. The mystery man tasks her with exploring a large mansion, and its surrounding estate, in order to determine the origin of a forbidding fog that has veiled the land and, if possible, lift it. In exchange, this cryptic benefactor promises to reveal her identity, as soon as her mission is completed. The plot is wonderful, the lore being progressively revealed by strange characters the protagonist will come across in her quest, as well as nuanced by examining various objects and points of interest throughout the environment, classic Souls style. There are strong Lovecraftian elements incorporated in it as well, which was a huge plus for me since I am a great fan of his work. \n\nGameplay-wise, the game is a straightforward action/adventure/rpg, as mentioned in the introduction. You explore the mansion, fighting and slaughtering any enemies you find obstructing your path in order to survive as well as salvage their lifeforce, which can be used to strengthen your character's various stats, be it health, damage, stamina or number of \"potions\" you can carry, among others. If you have ever played Dark Souls, the game's mechanics will strike a familiar cord immediately, as will its interface. Their mentality is also the same; explore huge, imposing settings, battle imposible boss fights, piece together the lore of the game and, finally, die. Alot. Just be prepared for that last part because, at least during your first playthrough, chances are your character will meet an untimely end more times than you can count. But each death will bring knowledge, information on the behavior of certain enemies as well as specific places that you need to pay special attention to, making you more formidable with each ressurection. So, persevere, and you will emerge triumphant.\n\nRegarding music, the game mostly consists of ambient sounds and soft, background tunes to keep you company without distracting you, which I liked. The sound effects are also great, further adding to the experience.\n\nAbout graphics, Shrouded in Sanity uses a detailed, pixel-based art style which I loved. The artist has worked meticulously in order to convey the oppresive and mysterious atmosphere of the setting, having constructed a darkly ornate mansion and lonely, surrounding garden that will suck you in immediately, as well as a few other environments which I will not reveal, to avoid spoiling the surprise.\n\nIn conclusion, I totaly recommend this game, especialy if you are a fan of games like Dark Souls and Bloodborne. It is quite difficult, yes, but never unfair, and will reward you handsomely if you persevere. The story is deep and meaningful, the gameplay easy to learn and not so tough to master, and the setting both terrifying and alluring, just like the eldrich horrors you will face while exploring it. I am really looking forward to the sequel.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502496", "timestamp_created": 1506508649, "recommendationid": "35239227", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 104, "num_reviews": 15, "steamid": "76561198070887333", "last_played": 1506171156, "num_games_owned": 104}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504631854, "review": "Well made 2D rendition of Dark Souls combat.
