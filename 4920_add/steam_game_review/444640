It's more like 'tower OFFENSE.' \n\nWhat I mean is that the game modes are basically made so that matches are as short as possible. There's a very clear meta in the game in terms of what towers are best, which sends are the most difficult to defend against (and when to send them), etc. What this amounts to is that almost every game plays out exactly the same. All of the people who have good winrate percentages play like they are the same person. You might as well just be playing an AI that does everything it can to screw you over. \n\nSure, there is a defensive mode, but hardly anyone ever plays it, and even that mode is kinda made so that you 'late game' matches are a rarity. You are also limited to 3 towers in that mode as well. \n\nThey also just recently patched the game with some tower rebalancing, and it's made everything even worse than before. \n\nThe quality of the game isn't bad at all... my only gripe with it is that I am a tower defense player who likes to put a lot of thought into tower selection and placement against endless waves of sends. Unfortunately, in this game the meta is so winningly powerful that you basically have to play WITH and AGAINST that meta in order to stand a chance, otherwise you *will* lose fairly quickly due to people all doing the exact same crap. Try doing your own thing and using some imagination and you'll get decimated by an early zebra heart rush. (Which, once again, everyone does.)\n\nI can't complain much since the game was free (I even purchased the club pack for it) but after about 2,000 matches or so, I just can't recommend it for lovers of tower defense games. If you are the type of player who merely wants to win no matter what, and don't mind sticking to a meta and doing the same stuff everyone else does, you'd probably think this is a great game. Unfortunately, you are forced to play a certain way. \n\nNot a bad game per se, just highly disappointing.
