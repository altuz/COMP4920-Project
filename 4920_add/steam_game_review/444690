It looked very interesting even despite the few negative reviews.  Here is my review, as of 08/17/2017, in the game's current state.\n\nI think this concept is absolutely awesome.  Study and capture the infected, maintain your base, install security ( turrets, robots ) , play with friends, loot enemies that are military and take over their territory, even scavenge locations and take raw resources from things such as wild animals.  However, I havent found many animals besides raccoons?  I can hear bears but I havent actually seen one yet.  The graphics are also rather beautiful at times.  I had no idea you could jump in the water and when doing so, the contrast changes as well as the sound effects of submerging in water.  This is awesome.\n\nThe highlights of what I believe need immediate attention and fixing are the combat mechanics and FPS drops.  I do not have a low end computer.  I have a high end PC.  I have great FPS in this game (60+) , but at random times or more of , random locations, there is a HUUUGE FPS drop that brings me 10 fps.  Its almost as if some areas are optimized and some are not.\n\nThe mechanics of weapons when in combat with Military or Mutants, this is the main problem that I have found that has turned me sour.\n- At times if you are close to any sort of object , tree, car, rock, and you decide to shoot back at an enemy who has zero problem hitting you, you shoot and a black bullet mark/hole appears in mid-air almost as if you are shooting at an invisible wall that you can not see.  I have wasted entire clips shooting enmies only to see bullet holes literally floating in mid air in a wall that I can not see.\n- The Desert Eagle handgun?  It is a 1911 .45 cal side arm, that is labeled as a desert eagle.  The iron sights are literally UNEVEN.  It is almost as if your character is holding the weapon at such an angle that he wants you to question the craftsmanship of the weapon.  One side of the iron sight is higher than the other and the barrel appears to point to a North Western angle.  I do not understand this.  Also, I have a huge love for sidearms/pistols/revolvers/ call them what you will, and this killed it for me. \n- The guns in general feel very clunky and just not equal or right.  I hope they tweak the weapons to feel more realistic or atleast just more functional and fluid.\n\nI am an optimistic person and I do not bash, hate, or try to ruin any team's idea whether it be a video game, a movie script, or a play.  I will rate this a positive review only because I hope this project is unlike a large portion of other early access games and it will improve and become what it was meant to be.  Anyways, it's still afun game.  More fun with friends.  But it does need some work.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497769", "timestamp_created": 1503979981, "recommendationid": "34568257", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "steamid": "76561197961522486", "last_played": 1504074805, "num_games_owned": 167}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500634775, "review": "Dont waste your money.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488583", "timestamp_created": 1500634775, "recommendationid": "33693785", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198320400713", "last_played": 1474599207, "num_games_owned": 56}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 8}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 48, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 28, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 20}}
