Not too expensive, and worth the purchase for those that would like a hidden gem packaged in a similar light as Irem SHMUPs.  The best way I can describe it is R-Type charging mechanic meets vertical screen format.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1504476005, "recommendationid": "34722464", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "steamid": "76561198128371609", "last_played": 1504475569, "num_games_owned": 458}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 7, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
