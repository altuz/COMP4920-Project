Yeah it is cheap, but seriously this game is buggy as hell and far away from being fun.\nThe enemies are mostly anoying than a challange. The game has bad or simply bugged bossfights (espacially the last boss which simply doesn't work).\nThe last dungeon is the most bugged hell in this game, there are some chests you never can reach again after beating a miniboss.\nYou can waste you time with more fun things than this, seriously its not worth your time.\nI'll never get my wasted time back. :(", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502762", "timestamp_created": 1506087992, "recommendationid": "35128181", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198039498089", "last_played": 1485126149, "num_games_owned": 513}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 119, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 66, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 53}}
