The music is nice and graphics are adorable. it gets increasingly more difficult to find all the bulbs and bones, so the game design is quite good. I like how there's no explicit dialog, because it would probably just get awkward and the mechanics are so simple that not much explanation is needed. Also, in the beginning the game will help you out if you get stuck and no matter how far you get, there are always hint balloons that'll help you figure out the puzzles. However, although the game has controller support, it's a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 nightmare to play using a controller since so many puzzles are reliant on click-and-drag mechanics that are optimal for a mouse/mousepad. That's the only drawback, otherwise it's a pretty good game and a clear improvement from the first one.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1502176679, "recommendationid": "34097586", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "steamid": "76561198349195327", "last_played": 1502199423, "num_games_owned": 110}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 25, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 23, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
