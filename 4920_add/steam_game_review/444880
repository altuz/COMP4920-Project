This is a phenomenal game if you have friends to play with locally or online. However the further you go into the game, you'll start to notice little hiccups and glitches. Then you'll start realizing the game should have more potential to be awesome, but falls very far from being an outstanding game.\n\nDeath Stair is a game in which there are four participants. 3 participants will be runners while 1 will be a gunner. The gunners objective is to hold the runners back as far as possible for a set time limit. Runners have to push the gunner back until they reach the final checkpoint before the time limit runs out. The gunners ammo will vary from stage to stage. Some of the ammo included is giant beach balls, brick launching mini-gun, mine deployment and a water cannon. There is one stage in particular where the gunners ammo isn't the most effective - so tough luck if you're a gunner on that level. The levels themselves are very few in numbers, but are fun and challenging. Some levels (especially the ice level) can be quite burdensome and a little too challenging for the runners as there is no \"safe spots\". Some levels will have divets in the walls or the floor for runners to hide from incoming fire. Runners have 4 abilities : run, dodge left, dodge right and jump. Besides that, runners cannot interfere with one another. Overall, the [b]gameplay[/b] is alright, but quite stiff in its delivery. \n\nThe [b]visuals[/b] are ok at best. The amount of different types of weapons is nice and is satisfying to see a bunch of balls rolling down the stairs knocking players back. The actual hitting effect and ragdoll effects are at best (again) - ok. There is nothing too substantial or fancy when it comes to this domain. The user interface is also a little buggy and wonky. The [b]sounds[/b] are also at best ok. They are not diverse and quite repetitive, especially after playing a few rounds. \n\nOverall, the game is ok and fun if you have people to play with. If you have a friend at your house and two online, you cannot play together... well the local component won't work with the online component. Meaning, unlike Blazerush or other games of the sort you cannot play with local players and play online. Either you play online or you play local - no in between. This was quite a drawback for me. I will not be recommending the game as I don't think its top quality. Sure I bought it on sale for about a buck, but I do not see a lot of people playing this for hours on end - even with friends. If this does appeal to you, I would suggest to have a group of friends who also own the game and to buy it on sale. \n\n\nRATING : 6.0/10\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n    [td]Gameplay[/td]\n    [td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n    [td]N/A[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n    [td]C[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n    [td]C[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Replay-ability[/td]\n    [td]C-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Overall [/td]\n    [td]C-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503874", "timestamp_created": 1500165239, "recommendationid": "33573309", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 202, "steamid": "76561198044146972", "last_played": 1502084479, "num_games_owned": 300}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501453260, "review": "10/10 funny game.\n\nedit: Developers should fix the keyboard and xbox controller's p1 problem.\nThe both controls want to be p1.\nIt should be when xbox controller plugged, keyboard should be p2 (or reverse)", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1500507653, "recommendationid": "33661704", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "steamid": "76561198262084824", "last_played": 1501793510, "num_games_owned": 259}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500228566, "review": "Yet it is cheap no one playes it and if you dont have xbox controller your pretty much screwed....", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "timestamp_created": 1500228566, "recommendationid": "33590719", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198040867274", "last_played": 1506879422, "num_games_owned": 49}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501651770, "review": "ONLINE CONNECTIVITY SHOULD BE FIXED PLEASE!
