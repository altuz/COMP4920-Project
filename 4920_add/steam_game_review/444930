That said, at least the 2016 and 2017 remakes are pretty good tables, so do pick those up. There are a few other gems (Devil Riders has a super neat gimick with it's raised board with its own flippers!), but most of the old tables are ignorable. Actually try the demos before buying a table.\n\nWhy a net positive review then? Because for VR, this is currently the best collection. Credit where credit is due: Magic Pixel Kit nailed both the table simulation. It doesn't have FX2's annoying things happening outside the table to distract you. Sure, I have some minor complaints: the VR menus for configuring a machine are overly complicated and move around. Achievements will pop in VR and will often display over where your flippers are (which is a bizare oversight). But on net, if you have a VR headset, buy the VR support and the remake tables.
