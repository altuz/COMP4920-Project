It's about an hour of game play initially but I could see myself going back to it from time to time. Extremely well controlled and fluid combat make it so much fun to play. I think the sword is the weakest part and I had a very difficult time playing with only the sword. It just felt with this close of a camera it was impossible to see what I was running into. Also it felt I should have redirected the bullets back but I took the hit anyway, perhaps a hit box problem.\n\nAnyway this is solid and at some point I'm sure I'll pick up the others in the series.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "timestamp_created": 1504563264, "recommendationid": "34745019", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 176, "steamid": "76561198006575550", "last_played": 1504562713, "num_games_owned": 615}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504311572, "review": "UBERMOSH:BLACK is the second game in the UBERMOSH series, which is a fast paced cyberpunk bullet-hell upon which you can slaughter waves of enemies through either shooting, slicing or deflecting for as long as you can. My review for this will be very similar to my review on the first game\n\nPros:\n-Gameplay is still smooth and fast, along with different classes which you can select and master to obtain the best score in each class. The new ability called Brainclap which was introduced in this game is a great addition\n-Visually appealing with it's retro cyberpunk feel to it\n-Soundtrack is amazing and adds to the atmosphere and pace of the game\n-Improved AI, making the game even more challenging than its precursor\n-It has Steam Achievements\n-It's really cheap at R12 (~$1)\n\nCons:\n-Can't change the volume in-game, which can be pretty annoying as the game is very loud\n\nOverall, this game improves on the previous installment, but still retains the qualities that made UBERMOSH so amazing to play. Worth a look if you are a fan of these type of games\n9/10\n\n[code][h1]Accidently Reviewed[/h1]\nFree Games? Reviews? Competitions? Amazing Community?
