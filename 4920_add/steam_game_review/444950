If it gets updated with much better english maybe I will give it another go.\n\nEdit: Version 2.0\n\nI had no idea I would be one of the only reviewers for so long, so apologies for not providing a more detailed review like the much more in-depth review the other guy has.\n\nFirst off I will say I didn't get far in this new version of the game, but I can say that the translation which was the main point of the update is better - I still wouldn't call it great but a lot of things are more understandable now for the most part. There is a lot of text in the game and it would be hard to translate it all properly so I can forgive some misses here and there. That said It still could do with a better tutorial and more importantly fixing the crashes that happen - which is why my play time didn't go up much more on this new version. Only made it to the 4th day before I clicked on an option that made me crash.\n\nSo all that said, I understand some of the mechanics of the game better, others have been updated but still no explanation of what they do.. for example one of the stats on the helpers is \"maths\" which is self explanatory I suppose, but I'm not sure why farmer Nanai might need to know Trigonometry.\n\nHonestly there isn't much else to talk about that me and the other reviewer haven't gone over. The translation is better but as you can see \"maths\" isn't really correct either. The game has some crashes and if you click on the wrong options (In my case I was trying to see if I could find a log of some sort for each of the sales I made for the day) the game crashes. You'll spend most of the time hitting the play button and watching text move by saying things like \"Soba Noodles sold for 5.\"\n\nI could go further into the game to try and see if maybe the story picks up or if something epic happens later, but I'm sorry I just don't have enough self-discipline to play something I don't like for that long to find out.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657405", "timestamp_created": 1456562697, "recommendationid": "21493780", "language": "english", "votes_up": 129, "comment_count": "8", "author": {"playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "steamid": "76561198042864202", "last_played": 1474133992, "num_games_owned": 407}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 18}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1476553231, "review": "Really nice cafe management game.\n\nInteresting game mechanics:\n1. A lot of different items for sale:\n a. normal items that you can buy from several shops, some shops are rare and available only temporarily\n b. items that you have to farm for in different locations\n c. items that you can grow on your own farm (like Ish-World egg that you can get if you buy some chickens for your farm)\n d. items that you can make after you sell enough of other items (like selling 200 of Steamed rice allows you to make Ish-World riceballs and Rice porridge from it)\n e. items that you can make after you sell a certain combinations of other items (like selling 50 Chileroo tofu and 50 Ish-World clams allows you to auto-buy Chileroo miso soup)\n2. Progress in each item\n a. at 100 items sold you become able to auto-buy this item in the morning\n b. at 200 items sold some items allow you to use them to produce other items\n c. at 500 items sold you become able to auto-buy this item at any time when amount reaches 0\n d. at 999 items sold you can use some items on altar to gain extra boosts.\n3. Different workers accumulate merits by doing their job and become able to do other better jobs (not sure if it is possible to upgrade workers, they seem to be stuck with the same skills forever)\n4. No rush. You have to pay about 2k each month, but it is not hard to get that amount and it seems it does not increase later, on the opposite you repay the debt and payment decrease, so you can just focus on developing\n\nThere are some problems with the game though.\n1. Translation may look confusing so it's better to experiment with different options and ask on forum if you are confused to see if someone else managed to understand the game better and can explain some problem. Personally I did not find this too big a problem, enjoyed exploring and experimenting\n2. Crashes happen often and there is no autosave system, so you tend to lose your progress ocassionally if you don't save often. On the other hand all crashes that I've seen are reproducable so if you report them with exact steps on how to reproduce them there is a chance that devs will fix them. Also because they need certain steps to be reproduced you can just avoid those steps and walk around the crash (for example, I had a crash when one guy was requesting a Healthy herb, I just removed the herb from the storage and the crash disappeared. did not complete a quest though). I got another crash that blocked my progress - it happens at the beginning of a day when certain person comes to request an umbrella, so there is no way to avoid it.\n\nOverall I think the game deserves positive review due to interesting mechanics although it still requires some patches.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507475", "timestamp_created": 1476553068, "recommendationid": "26053059", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198009021982", "last_played": 1476551768, "num_games_owned": 2178}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1465266715, "review": "[h1]This game was the first game I reviewed for my \"Steam Redlight\" series, where I review games when they're 'in the red' in reviews to see if it's deserved or or not. [/h1]\n\nYou can see the video review / reaction [b][i][u][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv_EBcEi2fo]here[/url][/u][/i][/b].\n\n[b]In summary, I can't recommend this game in its current state.[/b] As Materia User said, the biggest offense here is the translation. Poor translations are pretty funny; I laughed quite a bit at some of them. However, poor phrasing is the death of you in this game if you're trying to sell anything more than basic-bitch noodles and bottled water.\n\nA lot of this game's features (or keywords) isn't really explained in the tutorial, which I guess is a lot like life, or running a shop when you're spontaneously thrown into it by your mother. Hell, 'ma gets you to take out a small loan of a million dollars. The characters overall are pretty uninteresting, which is fine, because you're playing it for the gameplay and not the story. However, you're pretty weighed down since you really can't figure out how to get out of the T1 shop items. [b]I still don't know what mana is used for[/b]; I can't cast spells, I think. Unless they haven't told me that part either.\n\nOtto gets my award for most useless supporting actor in a video game series. Eve asks for a help, dude says get lost. Even Shiva is more useful, and the dude spends his spare time gambling with you whether or not he's going to buy stuff or get free food. I think he's probably the only person I trust in this game to actually give me useful information; he made sure to remind me that I have to pay taxes. I can't tell whether or not I need to thank or curse him.\n\nUI is clunky and overall pretty lackluster. You get like, a 12 red-bar section in the top left that tries to be organized, but the poor phrasing and bad formatting will normally make text blend into one another or just be straight up incomprehensible. [b]My time came to a pretty upsetting close when I clicked on a dialogue box aptly named \"To determine the number of stock to the store when produced buy\"[/b]. Clicking that option causes the game to crash, and there's no auto-save running the background. [i]That was definitely outside of the budget's scope[/i]. I lost roughly 30 minutes of progress, but since I forgot about it, about an hour into my next attempt at a playthrough, I pressed it again and lost another thirty minutes or so since I started trying to save normally.\n\nSo, if you have $9.99 and you want to have a great time reading poorly translated games, then this will do. Hell, you might even be able to get a fifth shelf so you can sell more than four items (you start with three shelf spaces). Who the hell goes to a shop that only sells three items? Ma couldn't cut me a little more room from the inn? I have no clue if you can [i]\"beat the game\"[/i] per se, I'd assume it's when you pay back part of the loan you owe ($10,000) but I can't imagine this game expects you to get that far.\n\nSorry [b]Let's Eat! Seaside Cafe[/b].
