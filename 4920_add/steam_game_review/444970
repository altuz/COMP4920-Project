I can see in monitor of sound devices that virtual sound card produces sounds, but i fails to re-route it to actual sound device. Razer Surround and Creative  Blaster X Acoustic Engine can do that without problems. Another problem if you have non english names for sound devices this poorly coded software would not even display or allow to select it, until you rename it to something 100% latin.\n\nOne more problem - not like most of software on steam it cant start without steam, so you are always going to be \"in a game\" while you run this, and this thing will prevent steam from shut down and will prevent pc from sleep.\n\nSoftware UI is very limited and poor on options, it just has very few presets you cant teven properly set up (except for delays), you can even configure EQ and calibrate positioning of virtual speakers (i mean you cant drag an reposition virtual speakers which is THE MUST core option for any sofware that emulates surround speakers) for your headset, you can only choose from predefined settings for most popular (as they think) phones and thats it. Even freeware version of Razer Surround was not that limited as this PAID piece of crapware.\n\nComparing to OVERPRICED pro version they sell on their site for, which has required options THAT SHOULD BE IN ANY PAID VERSION (like calibration of position of speakers around head), this version feels like TRIAL or DEMO that should be available for free... and they dare to sell this limited demo version for money.\n\nSupport is non existent. Usually you get respond in less than a day, i left my complains about broken state of software more then 12 hours ago and i still have no reply.\n\nThis is all sounds great on paper, but on practice it does not even work.\n\n\nI tried it with Xbox One Controller headset both via usb cable and wirless, wtih TV connected via HDMI and with Creative H7 headset connected to Xbox One Controlled via jack and connected directly to USB - no luck, no sound.\n\nAnd surely there is no TV mode available, so if you dont like to sit in heaphones that squeeze your head until you start to feel the pain, you are out of luck - software is not calibrated to provide spatial sound from stereo speakers of TV, which is shame. They position software as suitable for movies - but who watches movies with headset? You connect pc to tv and watch movies with friends or family with stereo sound (until you have some rare tvs that has built int spatial surround emulation or use some sound bars that emulate 5.1-7.1 sound, like Creative Katana) of TVs speakers, or rarely from surround speakers (by the way i do have them, but im tired of many wires on my floor and decided to go spatial direction). This sofware is not suitable for movies while it only supports headsets.\n\n\nGoing to ask steam support for REFUND. Maybe ill try it later when devs will unbroke this broken mess and will add required configuration options and tv mode.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505640", "timestamp_created": 1499595109, "recommendationid": "33399735", "language": "english", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "36", "author": {"playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "steamid": "76561197971617923", "last_played": 1499592607, "num_games_owned": 938}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 48, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 44, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
