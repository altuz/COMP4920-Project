{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1461904655, "review": "Part 3 is actually a radical departure from the other two games in terms of gameplay. Instead of being a linear experience with multiple branching paths, this one is an open expanse world that you can endlessly wander and explore. You have to collect clues, find and kill the sevent serpents, and figure out how to cross this land. There are even beacons that allow you to travel time so that you can accomplish various goals. So therefore, the entire land is actually two worlds because each has a present and past version. Sounds fun right?\n\nWell, the problem is that it wasn't implemented very well. This game contains and absolutely absurd amount of backtracking. Seriously, you have no idea. You have to explore basically the whole entire present version of the map to find all the serpents, but you also have to traverse the past version as well in order to cross the wastes. This means you have to constantly go back to the towers and fiddle around with the beams that change the terrain...its mind numbingly tediuous. To make matters worse, a lot of this super huge area is just boring filler. Literally, many locations are just filler that says something like \"you're walking blah blah blah ok you move on\". The entire swamp zone (1/3 of the map!) is just an endless cycle of getting stuck in the mud. \n\nA lot of the RNG and arbritrary nonsense from the earlier games is also present in this game. Random choices instantly killing you. Ridiculously cryptic unhelpful jerk NPC's. Items that don't actually do anything but trick you into thinking they are imporant. Extremely obtuse puzzles. You might be thinking \"but they did have this stuff in the other games to, so what's the big deal?\" You don't understand. They took all those elements and ramped them up to 11 out of 10. There are even scripted encounters that just take away your items, even your sword so that you can't fight anymore!\n\nHands down the most annoying thing though, is how a lot of the serpent battles are actually non-battles. Some of them are defeated with special items that are just an insta-kill. I was expecting a climactic and awesome boss battle, but instead the situation is resolved within the span of a few dialouge options. I know that the book series had problems with this too, but this was a really golden opportunity for them to fix that aspect and they didn't take it. \n\nOveral my experience with this game could mostly be described as tedious. It is nothing like part 1 where you have branching paths that automatically exclude other paths and significantly change the story. Going through part 3 multiple times would undoubtedly give the same experience.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557780", "timestamp_created": 1461904655, "recommendationid": "22699133", "language": "english", "votes_up": 48, "comment_count": "8", "author": {"playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "steamid": "76561198071689614", "last_played": 1464838156, "num_games_owned": 155}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 18}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1461737724, "review": "Usually I find \"Epic Heroic Fantasy\" boring.

Steve Jackson has a truly incredible imagination, and the writing is both excellent and extremely clever.

One note though, its mechanic seem to slightly differ from game to game which in my opinion keeps the mechanics fresh but there are some drastic differences in the game in this part but I will say that I do not expect them to keep the mechanics the same as just like the books you won't fully expect what might be in your adventure.

Part 3 is the third game in the same series developed and published by inkle Studios, the same people behind the 80 Days game.

I don't know if it was lifted compltely from the gamebooks or written by the developers themselves but each character has a unique \"voice and tone\" despite never speaking a single word and the locations are so well described I couldn't help but to get myself immersed in all of it\n\nBesides simply talking your way through problems you can always ignore them and walk away or perhaps use your sword arm or even magic to solve them. However, while the combat presentation is stellar the actual mechanics themselves leave a lot to desire for\n\nSorcery! Part 3 contains an incredibly well fleshed out world full of realistic characters, interesting locations and plenty of difficult choices to make which come with actual consequences. The combat system might be lackluster but the writing is absolutely top notch and the few issues Sorcery! has can be easily dismissed once you're immersed in to the world\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1480263472, "recommendationid": "27850427", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 543, "steamid": "76561198062813911", "last_played": 1480263391, "num_games_owned": 540}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1483673243, "review": "This is an amazing work of interactive fiction.
