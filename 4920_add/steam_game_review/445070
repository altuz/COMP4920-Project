Very nice concept for a board game.Thinking to buy a physical version as well. The only problem is that the AI is way too easy even on hardest level. High difficulty level should be more about optimal play than hostile rng. But it is a casual game with endless replayability and serious depth. At the moment the players database is small -though you can always find easily an opponent- but this is a quality classic board game that will eventually be recognised. It is relaxing to play and it takes same approach as backgammon: One should play lots of games and with better players than him/her self  in order to become better.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502633", "timestamp_created": 1506357375, "recommendationid": "35206253", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 5082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 495, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198112027835", "last_played": 1507066225, "num_games_owned": 78}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 11, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 11, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0}}
