Downloaded it back in 2010 after playing the first Tasty Planet game. It will always hold a special place in my heart.\n\nIt's a rather simple and short game (about 3 hours for the story). The local multiplayer works well and fits the type of game that it is.\n\nI'd suggest this game to anyone and everyone that asks about it. It's being sold for $5.99 but I'd still be willing to pay $10 or $15 for the game (though that might be due to the nostalgia).", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "timestamp_created": 1499486765, "recommendationid": "33362586", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198095901571", "last_played": 1499486894, "num_games_owned": 88}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503180232, "review": "I hope that we will get a third :D", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1503180232, "recommendationid": "34360181", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198118111803", "last_played": 1503180101, "num_games_owned": 80}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504287762, "review": "nice", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1504287762, "recommendationid": "34665287", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198068042350", "last_played": 1505671124, "num_games_owned": 6}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": true, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500547637, "review": "Fun casual game (except if you hunt for gold in single levels).\nTwo player mode is even more fun and thankfully easier.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499433", "timestamp_created": 1500547637, "recommendationid": "33669675", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "steamid": "76561198062288127", "last_played": 1502179387, "num_games_owned": 922}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 118, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 100, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 18}}
