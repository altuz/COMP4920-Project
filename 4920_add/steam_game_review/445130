Many of the choices simply don't make sense.  Instant oatmeal is instant.  You add hot water, and it's done.  What do you mean, the oatmeal isn't even near done?  That's not how instant oatmeal works???  Also why is \"asking someone\" how to use a kettle an option but \"googling it on your phone\" not?  Given what we know about Sam, looking it up online seems much more in character but it's not even a choice.  I get that the options are limited to prove a point, but it's used to an extent where it just feels lazy.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514346", "timestamp_created": 1485917894, "recommendationid": "29619335", "language": "english", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198165153431", "last_played": 1485917380, "num_games_owned": 27}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485117045, "review": "In [i]The Average Everyday Adventures of Samantha Browne[/i] you play as Samantha, a college student who lives alone in a dorm. She gets hungry and decides that the best thing is some oatmeal. However, she also has severe social anxiety that will encumber her trip to the kitchen and back. It is up to you to try to make the correct decisions and keep Samantha's anxiety level to a minimum.\n\nThis game is a visual novel meaning that it is mostly story-driven and much of the game is just reading. You make choices along the way that dictates Samantha's actions during the course of the story.\n\nAs I understand it, the main purpose of this game is to show what it is like for a person to have social anxiety. I admit that I am not an expert on this topic. Although I have certainly had times in my own past where I had difficulty interacting with others or getting nervous over relatively minor things, I have never been diagnosed with any sort of disorder.\n\nTo start off with the positive aspects of this game, I thought that the artwork was pretty good. Although not necessarily detailed, it looks good and helps to tell the story. \n\nHowever, I thought the writing in this game was weak. As a shorter visual novel, there was not much room for any character development. As such, Samantha came off as a rather unlikable character who gets angry and apparently hates the few people she encounters for no real reason. There is a sort of implication that being spiteful is just part of having social anxiety, which I doubt to be true. There are ten or so endings in this game, but there is not a lot of variation between them. Even though you can achieve 100% completion in under an hour, it still felt like a chore to complete.\n\nDespite the nice art, I thought the main character was rather unsympathetic. Since the story revolves around her, I feel that I cannot recommend this game. Still, it is short so if you are curious enough it might be worth a play.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506937", "timestamp_created": 1485117045, "recommendationid": "29430496", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "steamid": "76561198129411711", "last_played": 1485111956, "num_games_owned": 19}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486333592, "review": "Very realistic!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504879", "timestamp_created": 1486333592, "recommendationid": "29730446", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198026876845", "last_played": 1486324590, "num_games_owned": 759}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487481757, "review": "This is fun and relatable.

The only reason for this is because we aren't given enough time to get to know the main character. So instead of understanding where that person is coming from and why they feel the way the do we just get, \"I have anxiety, look everything's hard. Ugh do I really have to talk to them?' We are never given time to see how this person has gotten to that point and what really drives the fear other than that it exists and we should just be sensitive about it.\n\nAs for the game itself. Based on the theme and it's length there are few things to say. Not being able to skip the timer sections was annoying. Because you have to reset when you fail and go through it all again was annoying as well. The options were not inline with the person. Just inline with the anxiety. In otherwords, illogical. The way it plays out is pretty much worst case scenario in every possible way except the decided right way. It would have been nice to explore the anxiety and watch it play out in more ways than just total meltdown or hurray I made oatmeal.\n\nI enjoyed the first 3 minutes. It had less substance than I thought it would and I just can't recommend it for the reasons above.\n\n3/10", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "timestamp_created": 1486805422, "recommendationid": "29843080", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561198095162266", "last_played": 1467107165, "num_games_owned": 444}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487780569, "review": "that game just a horse shit", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490633", "timestamp_created": 1487780569, "recommendationid": "30102292", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198184905353", "last_played": 1463125911, "num_games_owned": 7}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 4}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1488228948, "review": "I let the game run and stay on the \" dizzy hallway\" scene\n\n...the sound of it helped me sleep. \n\n \n\nShe finished her oatmeal. \n\nAnd that was that. :)\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484942", "timestamp_created": 1488228948, "recommendationid": "30227765", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198345403000", "last_played": 1480168185, "num_games_owned": 51}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 8}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487396626, "review": "This game is a very realaxing.
