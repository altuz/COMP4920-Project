If you liked the old Infinity Engine games, you will like this one (even though it is turn-based, not real-time).\n\nWhat initially struck me about this game, besides the beautiful art style and fitting soundtrack, was the interaction between several systems in the game. You see, the conversation choices matter more than just directing the storyline (which, compared to some RPGs, there are some interesting ways the story can go based on your choices!). Each of your party members has 4 attributes that they like in their leader (Such as Aggression, Peaceful, Conceited, Honorable, Cunning, etc). If your conversation choices match what a party member likes, they will gain morale. Choose the opposite option and they will lose morale.\n\nWhat does morale do? Well, it will increase or decrease the character's physical and mental defenses. A high physical defense might prevent a character from being knocked down in combat and a high mental defense may allow a character to resist being taunted. Also, if you want to romance the romancable characters, they better have a high morale!\n\nFor another example, look at the lethal vs. non-lethal options in combat. When fighting, you have the option of being lethal or non-lethal. In non-lethal combat, none of the enemies will die (they just fall to the ground and writhe in pain), and you cannot critically hit anyone for extra damage. In lethal combat, sometimes the enemies will die and you can critically hit for massive damage. However, by keeping certain enemies alive, it may assist you in completing a quest or even later in the story.\n\nHowever, this game is not perfect. There are still a few bugs (which, to the credit of those who made the game, they are actively fixing), so be sure to have a couple different save games handy.\n\nAlso, you get to be a Viking, so why aren't you getting this? YOU ARE A VIKING. YOU GET A SHIP! A VIKING SHIP!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500086", "timestamp_created": 1505703056, "recommendationid": "35037601", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561197996067665", "last_played": 1505534527, "num_games_owned": 153}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505987749, "review": "https://youtu.be/0KGmEV84xjw\n\nThe first thing I want to say is that this was a very enjoyable game and I\u2019m surprised to see that more people didn\u2019t pick this game up when it came out in April. That doesn\u2019t mean this game isn\u2019t without its flaws. But I think this game is worth getting into if you\u2019re into turn based strategy games akin to games like XCOM or Divinity. So if you\u2019re looking for a decent strategy game at a decent price I would say this one is well worth your money. Buy this game is what I\u2019m trying to say. It\u2019s a good addition in your steam library and I\u2019m glad to have played it.\n\n\tSo I can\u2019t really say enough about this game. The combat is fresh and challenging. The story is well crafted and intriguing. I have spent a lot of my time playing this game the last couple weeks adding up to almost 50 hours. Honestly this game had me hooked with the word Vikings as I\u2019m a sucker for historically based games. You have a free reign to choose your own path whether you want to be a raider, a diplomat or a trader. The outcome of the game is based on the play style you choose. I can\u2019t honestly articulate why I had so much fun with this game other than its challenge and many diverse options in dialogue and combat. The challenge adds depth in combat causing you to figure out solutions to problems. Sometimes the best option is to literally rush into your opponents to keep archers from picking off your men. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air to not have a game that holds your hand every step of the way and let you live with your mistakes. But altogether this game has fun combat, well-crafted dialogue between characters and diverse options for what type of campaign you want to do allowing you to craft your own story. \n\n\tSo I want to air out some of the flaws I think the game had these are few and far between though because the game functions perfectly for what it\u2019s intended to do.  First off the game seems lopsided to favor the enemy no matter what setting you have the difficulty on and this can make some of the battle you\u2019re involved in utterly frustrating. I\u2019ve also noted that in some cases the enemy can literally shot you through walls not certain if it\u2019s just a minor bug but it\u2019s frustrating all the same. I also had a problem with the ending. While the game can run you through almost 50 hours of gameplay the ending feels rushed and kind of falls flat. Hopefully they release DLC to add an endgame mode that continues the lifespan of the game. I\u2019m not sure it just ends so abruptly that it doesn\u2019t feel satisfying more or less just kind of empty. They could also update the animations a bit to add variety to your actions outside of combat. I also found that sometimes the game would drop you in a battle with full option to attack the enemy but in most cases you combat will start at a handicap not allowing you to perform actions only to move your first turn. There isn\u2019t a way to predict when this will happen when starting combat. And there are few dialogue options that allow you to gain the upper hand in combat through deceptive means which I would appreciate. But those are just some minor irks I have with the game as a whole and in no way makes me rethink my review as positive.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1505933549, "recommendationid": "35090088", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 3261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198026574363", "last_played": 1505960725, "num_games_owned": 218}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506490011, "review": "Dont buy, game doesnt seem finished much after the tutorial.
