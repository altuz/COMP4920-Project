{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505611938, "review": "This game is surprisingly addictive and interesting, BUT it also has some serious flaws.\n\nThe good:\n- Building your ship is great fun. You can make some really awesome things. I've seen ships from most sci-fi series out there faithfully recreated in this game. Editing a ship to delete something refunds you the money you spent on that thing, meaning you can play around to your heart's content, until your ship is just *perfect*.\n- Exploring is fun too, at least at first. Although it gets dull after awhile, some part of you will always wonder what's on the other side of that jump/gate/wormhole/etc.\n- Combat has some great moments. Vaporizing an enemy in a second. Knocking the enemy into spinning like a top. Taking out a boss. Etc.\n- The community seems friendly, and there's a wiki that covers a lot of stuff about the game.\n\nThe bad:\n- Early game combat is a nightmare. You don't get shields until several material tech levels in, and combat prior to that will damage your ship parts, potentially breaking core functions of your ship and requiring slow trips to a repair dock every, single, time. This game is like EVE Online in that you have to spend some time doing boring mining before you can actually shoot anything and hope to survive.\n- The main English server for the game is \"family friendly\". Translation: you'll get in trouble if you so much as use the word \"ass\".  Seriously. This wouldn't be an issue if there were multiplayer alternatives, but there really aren't. There are only about 3 active multiplayer servers with decent population, one of them is PVP, and one of them is in German. \n- Many of the enemy ships are shaped like spaghetti. Horribly long and thin. This makes them a nightmare to hit, especially because actually shooting them tends to result in them spinning at dizzying speeds, so its rather like trying to hit a paper straw being spun at 7000 RPM by an electric motor - and every time you do hit them, they change speed and/or direction. Stupid.\n- Mining is tedious. Having a fleet of mining ships to mine for you is less tedious, but managing them is still tedious... and seems to remove the resource constraints from the game in a way that some may find un-fun.\n- The interface has its good days and bad days. While there are some great elements, like 'auto-assign' for crews... there are also some semi-game-breaking problems, like the fact that fighters set to attack don't attack anything except what you tell them to, lack 'mine/salvage continually' options, and removing fighter bays gives you ghost fighters on your ship that you can neither delete, nor get rid off your crew screen. This meant I was unable to use 'auto-assign' for crews, and couldn't find any way to get rid of the fighters short of deleting the ship containing them, and even then I did not get the fighters back. Similarly with the interface, I never worked out how to deselect a block on the ship editor, how exactly the stats in the editor were being updated, or basic things like how to increase my max velocity. Some of these things I had to eventually resort to the wiki / asking other players for, but this is a major problem because if you're playing singleplayer on a single screen you don't necessarily have the ability to ask other players OR look at the wiki. So, the interface is awkward enough I'd suggest playing multiplayer from day one just so you have people to ask these sorts of questions. As part of this, shipyards REALLY need to come with some sensibly designed bigger ships you can buy. Heck, designs for some staple ships should really be included by default. DO NOT assume that everyone uses the workshop.\n\nThe maddeningly frustrating:\n- Interacting with stations is a nightmare. Not only do you have to get close to them to do anything with them, but you also have to get yourself within a TINY distance of a special docking port on the station, and remain there for the entire time you're interacting with the station (during which time you, in menus, can't move your ship). God help you if the station is drifting (e.g: because you bumped into it), because in this case it will never be possible to stay close enough for long enough to actually use the damned thing.\n- As stated above, some long/thin enemies are so frustrating to fight that I've actually had to change my weapons/etc to auto-targeting instant hit weapons purely to deal with them. This is NOT my preferred playstyle, but the horrible enemy ship designs makes it unavoidable.\n- Game servers seem to randomly go down at times. Sometimes for minutes at a time. There is never any warning of this. \n- There is no easy 'creative' design option in singleplayer, and for a game which revolves around building ships, there damn well should be.\n\nOverall, this is a bizzarely addicting game. I've played a ton of hours of it over a few days. Once you start, you just don't want to stop. Along the way, though, you'll encounter some bizzare/frustrating things. Hopefully this sort of nonsense is fixed before the game leaves Early Access.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534558", "timestamp_created": 1505611938, "recommendationid": "35011369", "language": "english", "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": "7", "author": {"playtime_forever": 5732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 404, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197995190389", "last_played": 1506503643, "num_games_owned": 157}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504631508, "review": "Want an EVE Online-like experience with ease-of-access but without the difficulty or learning curve?
