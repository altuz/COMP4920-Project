I don't play online multiplayer so, can't speak about it.\n As I long time heroes franchise fan let me throw some quick points:\n\npros: - random map\n         - 7 resources\n         - easy to navigate and grasping the new mechanics, thx also to the heropedia\n         - good battle mechanics \n         - very nice sync between units and hero abilities, you need to know tho from the start what you want to be your fighting style - magic-shooters, might- offense melee/range, etc\n         - game balance seems decent, depending on your style you can actually have fun with factions that are played differently\n         - diversity in battlegrounds and the lenght of the fields is a nice touch\n         - decent waittime for AI turn\n\ncons: - no sanctuary and inferno, I know there was a vote by the fans and those 2 were excluded, but Inferno shouldn't have even been on a poll and Sanctuary actually was pretty diverse and nice faction to play with complex mechanics\n          - some random not often occuring crashes, but for now just 1 save got corrupted after trying to reload\n          - the battle gauge, tears/blood reputation and specializations from h6 are missing, which were nice\n          - random map no seas. I've created by now about 10-11 random maps with mixed terrain and there wasn't water in any of them. Dunno if it's some crazy luck or just water is missing from the generator.\n\n---------------------------------\n Summed up a solid hybrid between h3 and h5 with some nice game and battle mechanics. Would recommend it, if you wanna just chill and play casually the game.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510937", "timestamp_created": 1500127922, "recommendationid": "33560324", "language": "english", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 8010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 284, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198054180972", "last_played": 1507106143, "num_games_owned": 12}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 4}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500270747, "review": "A very addicting game and really fun with friends.Real nice campaign\neven though ubisoft doesnt give a shit about this game and half of the developers are writers\nIts a game I have enjoyed a lot", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500331", "timestamp_created": 1500270624, "recommendationid": "33601344", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 9253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198100988724", "last_played": 1502814255, "num_games_owned": 71}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 57, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 25, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 32}}
