My hours belong to the version sold by\n www.jlist.com.)\n\nThis game is designed for people in one of three categories:\n1) Those who have oceans of patience and actually WANT to be\n   micromanaging dozens of statistics every moment\n2) Those who wake up, look in the mirror, and marvel about how\n   Earth is blessed to have someone so great as the person in\n   the mirror\n3) Those who like immersive role playing games.\n\nIf you belong to one of the first two categories, please read\na different review to this game. On the other hand, if you\nbelong to the third category and NOT the other two categories,\nI invite you to continue reading my review.\n\n(Aside note: Many thanks go out to Theonegod for making a cheat\n tool that allowed me to enjoy Aselia the Eternal despite being\n an average gamer. See Cons section point #1 for details.)\n\nPros:\n+ This game presents a very immersive experience. The starting\n  few hours really pulls the gamer into the world of the game.\n+ Very few games have tried to do what this game tries to do.\n  In other words, this game is rather unique in the world of\n  PC games.\n+ If you take the time to understand the game system, you will\n  hopefully come to understand the genius of the game. The game\n  is very well crafted.\n\nCons:\n- It would not have been terribly difficult for the game maker\n  to make a difficulty game option suitable for the average\n  gamer, but the game maker did not do so. Therefore, if you\n  are an average gamer, I HIGHLY recommend you go to URL: \n  http://dakkodango.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=151. \n- Game design decisions were made with one thing as the first\n  priority: the gamer should be handicapped in a truly absurd\n  number of ways. Because of that game design priority, there\n  are many parts of the game that are not consistent with the\n  lore of the game world.\n- The game preaches about the evils of war and wanton use of\n  natural energy for the sake of convenience. The preaching gets\n  old REALLY fast, but it persists long after the messages have\n  been absolutely and positively drilled into the audience.\n- The game seems to be designed for lolicons. Prepare to see\n  and hear very young girls in your army tearing sinew, breaking\n  bones, and ripping the earth a new one. You have been warned.\n\n- *** Extremely Important *** \n  The skip button will skip ALL scenes between battles.\n  Sometimes there are a dozen scenes and I only want to skip \n  6 out of the 12 scenes. Aselia the Eternal was made\n  prior to the convenience of a settings screen that has options\n  such as \"skip one scene\" and \"skip all scenes\". FYI\n\nKnit-picking gripes (feel free to ignore):\n*) Disclaimer: I gripe because I am a fan of the genre and I \n   would LOVE to see the genre get better. However, since the\n   world economy is slow, better games aren't getting made.\n   Therefore, games like this continue to stand out as being\n   exceptional. Don't take my gripes the wrong way. \n1) How many times must gamers endure a complete and utter lack\n   of proper reward for difficult tasks? I turned the air blue\n   with profanity when I received the same mana for the second\n   dragon as what I received from the first dragon. The second\n   dragon was 4 times the fight (at the very least)!\n2) Black spirits are only truly useful for the enemy since the\n   enemy has so many more troops than the protagonist. This\n   violates the lore of the game, but since game difficulty is\n   more important than game lore, black spirits become bench\n   warmers for the protagonist. To the Abyss with that filth!\n3) I am continually amazed at how many difficult JRPGs have\n   VERY secret requirements for the good endings to the game.\n   Seriously, is it not enough that gamers suffer through the\n   steep difficulty of the actualy strategy part of the game?!\n4) [spoiler] Why do the spirits at the end of the game act like\n   they are not swallowed by their swords? It would be closer\n   to the lore of the game if the enemy spirits in the Empire \n   were all obsessed with duty, discipline, and death. Instead,\n   many enemy spirits are still preaching about how evil war is.\n   Get off it already--the gamers have received the message, oh\n   Almighty Game Design Team! Honestly, it reminds me of being\n   thumped with a Bible at church. Nobody wants that. [/spoiler]\n5) The scripted battles add nothing to the game. In fact, they\n   defy game lore as well as game mechanics. They detract from\n   the overall presentation of the game. Scripted battles are\n   nothing new to JRPG lovers, but they are always unnecessary.\n   Scripted battles are a cheap cop-out for game makers, and\n   therefore they will continue to be used. Oh well.\n6) If the game is going to have scripted blocks in the road, the\n   game should (expletive) TELL YOU THAT! Instead, you must make\n   decisions without really knowing what the game expects you to\n   do. This game is one of the very worst I've played in that\n   one single regard.\n7) Even with unlimited resources, training units is a total\n   and complete pain in the backside. For some people, this\n   translates into just one of many handicaps given to the\n   gamer. For me, it GREATLY detracts from my desire to play\n   the game through a second time. Yes, I could play the game\n   through a second time in Normal mode. But the game offers\n   enticement for those that play the game in Hard mode. But\n   if the gamer does that, the player will be once again forced\n   to train their units again. See the end of the PDF guide to\n   learn what the enticements are for those who decide to deal\n   with the irritation of training their units again. (Hint: it\n   is in the Io's Boot Camp section of the guide.)\n\nCheat tool suggestions (see Cons section point #1 for URL):\n1) At the very least give yourself a boatload of currency \n   (999999 Ether). Doing this more than once during the\n   progression of the game will still provide the average gamer\n   with more than enough opportunity to save spam.\n2) Setting the turn counter to 1 is also VERY useful for \n   missions that don't have story events pre-programmed to \n   occur at set turn numbers. Look at the PDF guide for the\n   game to know which missions have story events embedded in\n   the middle of the missions.\n3) If you don't constantly wish to be micromanaging the skills\n   of your individual units, set the skill usage cheat for all\n   units.\n\nFinal recommendations: \n1) (See Knit-picking gripe #3 for the reason for this entry.)\nIf you have a waifu you want to see \"the good end\" for...\n[spoiler]\nuse the PDF guide for the game and hit every single +1/+5/+10 mind\nor love choice for that particular waifu. Of course, you will\nneed to complete the game twice if you want to see \"the good\nending\" for Kyouko or Tokimi. And if you want to see \"the good\nending\" for Uruka, choose all the subspirit options\nas opposed to choices for Aselia, Orpha, or Esperia. [/spoiler]\n\n*** Very Important ***\nTo get a particular waifu ending, you also must \nSLAY WHOLE ENEMY SQUADS with Yuuto/waifu team\n\n2) (See Cons section point #1 for the reason for this entry.)\n[spoiler]\nThere are seven \"good endings\" for the game. I would also\nestimate that the gamer gets 10 percent or less than the\nresources the gamer really needs (if the gamer is an old fart\nlike me). Because of those two things, I am guessing that the\ngamer is actually expected to play Normal mode more than once\nprior to moving onto Hard mode and then to play Hard mode more\nthan once prior to moving onto Absurd mode (which is my word\nfor the game mode as opposed to the game maker's word for it).\nIf you read the bottom of the PDF guide, you will see the level\ncaps for Normal and Hard mode. Keep those level caps in mind\nwhen you decide how much Ether to give yourself while cheating.\nOR you can decide to set the Ether pool at 500000 every time\nyou boot up the game.\n[/spoiler]", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506752", "timestamp_created": 1502054803, "recommendationid": "34069124", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198085941437", "last_played": 1480961245, "num_games_owned": 435}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 31, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 27, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
