This game kinda makes you feel overpowered sometimes, especially with the sounds. The maps are randomized so there more replayability, and the difficulty ramps up on the spot as you kill hordes of enemies. My only downside of this game is that there's not much to unlock. I already have all three characters at level 10 (max level cap) and all that is left are the trophies. \n\nIf there are a few thing I want this game to have is more unlockables, increase the level cap, and especially more characters.\n\nOther than that, the game is mighty fun.
