Definitely brings me back to the Sarges Heroes games I used to play growing up. The themeing is spot on. Shooting and flying all the different aircraft works great on my xbox controller. The game shines in multiplayer, the campaign so far is decent.\n\nCons: If you get motion sick in VR, you should stay away. I do not get motion sick in VR, I can play any game including detatched and eve valkyrie, hell I can stand up and look around on a VR rollercoaster without any effects. But this game? Holy shit, using the stunt plane I definitely felt uncomfortable in a dog fight. I didn't get \"sick\" per say, but felt very uncomfortable in that particular plane when I have a speed power up.\n\nPlayerbase is almost non existent. I only managed to get one public game lobby going and a few of them were friends. It's still new though so maybe it will pickup. Worth grabbing just for the campaign though and you can always make a \"multiplayer\" game with bots.\n\nWorth the price though.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1497158535, "recommendationid": "32334645", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198001758110", "last_played": 1497079535, "num_games_owned": 130}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497154646, "review": "BE WARNED   Vomit TRON -    I played this for one minute and had to the game as it simply made me feel sick. I've played a few flight sims and this one is the worst in terms of motion sickness... not sure how the devs can fix this without dampering the game play.    \n\n Looks like fun with simple flight controls... but oh man the motion sickness kills it.   No attention to limiting the motion sickness has been taken into the game mechanics   ( I've developed a few games using Unity )  and this needs some serious upgrades.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492465", "timestamp_created": 1497154646, "recommendationid": "32333854", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198054350781", "last_played": 1497153787, "num_games_owned": 67}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 26, "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 19, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
