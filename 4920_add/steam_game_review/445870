I don't find this release build to be too difficult, the Alpha and Beta versions were far more crippling in terms of difficulty\n\nThe story is cryptic, the environments are beautifully crafted, and the effects of (distortions and glitches ) are really well done, and add alot of atmosphere to the game.\nAll in all, if you enjoy games like HLD where skill is a requirement, and you will die often and learn from mistakes, then you might enjoy this one as well.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503536", "timestamp_created": 1502688809, "recommendationid": "34229209", "language": "english", "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 114, "steamid": "76561198277984478", "last_played": 1502722400, "num_games_owned": 290}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 7}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502613840, "review": "It's is promising, gorgeous looking game, which has all chances to be a great game. Here i'll try to describe my pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n- Amazing art style! Aminations, particle effects, attacks look very juicy. 10/10\n- Stylish neon-ambient mucis and sound effects. 9/10\n- Fact that the game has a story makes me happy. 8/10 for story\n\nCONS:\n- Not perfect gameplay. Because some enemies are so annoying my usual tactic is - teleport through whole map get in locked room. Destroy all enemies -> teleport to other locked room. 7/10 for gameplay from me.\n- Enemies hit me when i talk with NPCs!!!\n- I'd like to use environment objects to throw them into enemies, but that green aim circle just isn't working properly with mouse and always rotates very strange. 7/10 for stability \n\nOVERALL:\nI'd give this game 8/10 for now, which i beleive could be 9 or even 10 after some fixes. If developer will make not so repetitive gameplay, tune battlesystem a little, make enemies little smarter and fix little bug like enemies hit while you talk with npc's - this game will be PERFECT. But now it's still very very nice game, that has it's atmosphere and style.\n\nLooking forward and believe this game could be a hit!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480159", "timestamp_created": 1502613783, "recommendationid": "34209154", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198023540692", "last_played": 1502612114, "num_games_owned": 33}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502944399, "review": "According to developers [b]Phantom Trigger [/b] is a \"Slasher\" with RPG and Roque-like elements. I never heard of the \"Slasher\" genre and the game has little to no elements from RPG or Roque-like \\(-_-)/ As far as I am a concerned this is a hack&slash game with a very simple combat and no control over customization of skills. Unfortunately, this game has a lot of glitches and questionable design choices specifically when it comes to combat. Phantom Trigger has some really cool visuals but the levels tend to be very bloated with effects. Honestly, it has a lot of great ideas but they came together like a trainwreck. The only thing that pushed me to barely recommend it was a well done psychological story.\n\n[b] Technical Notes [/b]\n\nI encountered numerous glitches from going through walls to enemies that get stuck in walls while you have to kill them to progress. Needless to say, some of the achievements like killing all enemies are impossible with those glitches. Fortunately, I have not encountered any game breaking glitches but some people have (although I had to restart from last checkpoint several times) Framerate was getting low in few places when there is too much on the screen. Game settings are extremely limited.\n\n[b] Combat [/b]\n\nThe game does not rely much on numbers.It is mostly a reflex based system that does not motivate you to kill enemies (you can skip about 80% of them). The combat is not very deep to carry itself without much RPG elements. You can unlock several cool combos but I found them to be kinda unnecessary. Special attacks on a third hit often put you at high-risk low reward situation. I made a suggestion to transfer some of the interesting moves to cooldown abilities which I think could improve the game. I don't hate the feel of the combat as much as I hate the progression in combat. Developers need to figure out how to keep it interesting because it got really freaking boring to activate everything through 3 hit combos. There is also a neat color system where you can only damage some enemies with a specific attack of the same color.\n\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+Pretty pixel-art and visual effects. Although there is too much junk on the screen sometimes.\n+4-7 hour length with multiple endings.\n+Offline Coop mode.\n+Compelling psychological story and intriguing plot.\n+Really enjoyed the sound effects\n+Dialogue options.\n+Fun achievements to grind.\n+Fair difficulty. \n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n-Lots of enemy recycling.\n-Stages look different but do not feel different in terms of new challenges. \n-Combat is slick but gets boring with no RPG management. \n-Combos are the only means of progression and they sometimes do not work. Also balancing is questionable and I did not feel like using special attacks.\n-Some pacing problems and convoluted goals. \n-Good music but why so few tracks? I listened to one song for like 4 hours damn you.\n\n[b] Final Thoughts 7/10 [/b] \n\nPhantom Trigger has potential to be a fantastic game but some technical and design problems hold it back. $10-15 is a little bit of a stretch for a game in this state (hoping for some good updates) I enjoyed the story and aesthetics a lot more than combat that did not evolve enough over the course of the game. The first hour was really good but the game drops the ball on a variety of enemies and challanges. There are several more refined games in a similar format so I think it will be a hard sell for most people.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506799", "timestamp_created": 1502843019, "recommendationid": "34266598", "language": "english", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 97, "steamid": "76561197995669628", "last_played": 1503875499, "num_games_owned": 597}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 4}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502407187, "review": "I was very much ready and willing to overlook the blatantly derivative nature of this game in return for some fun and rewarding gameplay. Sadly however, this fun and rewarding gameplay was not forthcoming. \n\nCombos feel laboured and inconsistent. Allowing the dash button to form part of the combo system itself leaves you with a dash that works differently depending on when and how it's used when, for the most part, all you really want it to do is get you out of harm's way and into a better position. The length of the dash itself also causes issues by being perhaps twice as long as it needs to be. The majority of the time the dash, if it works, will leave you either too far from an enemy to continue the fight or just drop you slap bang in the middle of a damage inducing obstacle.\n\nAesthetically speaking it's not terribly interesting. Art style is identical to Hyper Light Drifter without any of the charm. Music is a very familiar ambient mush that is both unobtrusive and yet boringly repetitive, I'm reasonably sure the first and second areas had the exact same score.\n\nWhat I got from the story was... weak. I'm guessing the writers were dealing with English as a second language, which can have it's own charm to it, but when the game itself is this mediocre it simply becomes another area worth criticising. Much of the dialogue is very disjointed and can make little sense from one sentence to another which could work in a sort of pseudo David Lynch, dream like way but again, other things are needed to prop up such a feature.\n\nUltimately I was hoping to feel that \"imitation is the sincerest form of flattery\" when it came to this and Hyper Light Drifter. There is a good game in here somewhere, a little love and attention given to the mechanics and various features would do wonders. However, as it stands, this comes off as little more than a cynical wannabe.
