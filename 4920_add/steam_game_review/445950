They can be beautifully designed, fully realized, and still lack any semblance of balance. This is not one of those games.

A gorgeous soundtrack, simple yet stylistic visuals and estoteric gameplay. I found myself playing for hours at a clip. I won't lie, some of the boss fights are very challenging, but always unique. \n\n  It's been years since I played a side-scroller so satisfying and so well realized.
