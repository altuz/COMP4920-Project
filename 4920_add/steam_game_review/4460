Turns out that i still can't find the song that is played in the store trailer either; it's not in the game's music folder and neither is it played while playing the game. If the store music is what you're after, better move on. There are similar 80s music in the music folder but not nearly as interesting. \n\nFrom the store's description it seems like an interesting take on city builder sims by delving deeply into the inhabitants interactions but i dunno how that will pan out in actual gameplay. Certainly not the easiest game to get into. \n\nMore detailed review later after i put more hours into it. For now just 5/10 but i'm leaning towards recommended just because it's a little different from other city sims i've played."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499443391, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500304", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "33346850", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197969177473", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1500585255, "num_games_owned": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4281}, "timestamp_updated": 1499444095, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Rightly the developer company of this game went out of business. Biggest bullshit game ever. Nothing is better with the 2008 update. There is no chance to build up and plan a city so the city will always crash. The range ring of the buildings is shown false. There is only change if at all is with luck to hold a city which won't crash. I hope the former developers of this game will never get a game developer job again."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501143699, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498676", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33826858", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198401924112", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1500212139, "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 281}, "timestamp_updated": 1501143699, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Soooooo gooooood game :)"}]}
