Plus it still looks good, you can adjust the graphics in the settings (car details etc). There are settings for a wheel set-up (force feedback etc), however you can play it with a Xbox 360 controller as well. You have four driving perspectives to choose from: cockpit, over the hood, bumper and third person. There are weather effects in the game.\nIt has all sorts of assists: AI difficulty, damage realism, automatic gear shifts, brake and steering help, tire and brake wear, as well as indicative arrows for corners and gears. So in theory anyone can play this game. You can adjust everything of importance: gears, tires, brakes, differential etc. The AI can be adjusted with impressive range: timid, clean, realistic, aggressive etc. \nTo sum it up: great driving physics, awesome sound, nice selection of tracks and cars. GTR gives you an immersive GT experience."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1403391097, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523228", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "10637582", "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198006514763", "num_reviews": 44, "last_played": 1474913865, "num_games_owned": 643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 258}, "timestamp_updated": 1403439887, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Don't let the GUI scare you away and you may have to look for the right video mode code (36 and 75 seem to work for NVIDIA 1920x1080) for higher resolutions, but once you're there it is a good solid racing sim. \n\nFFB works well (I'm using a GTDF), graphics is functional for a sim racer and not something that will distract you while racing.\n\nNice tracks, nice cars.\n\nOld, but gold.\nGet it while it's on sale!"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1404340021, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511931", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "11038931", "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198111649540", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1497513814, "num_games_owned": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1254}, "timestamp_updated": 1404340021, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I have to say, this is a good game.\n\nBut if you are going to buy this game, buy GTR 2 too.\nMore cars, better tracks, more game modes- and also easy to mod.\n\n(P.

I have just purchased \"GTR\" via my \"Steam\" account, and I have to say to anybody who used to own this game, back in the days of \"M/Soft\" XP, that this game has now been upgraded to \"WINDOWS 7\" COMPATIBILITY. The graphics are a lot better and clearer than the games predessor on the XP version. If anybody still owns the XP version, it will not play on \"WINDOWS 7\". I have had the origional of this game on XP, which has been collecting dust for the last 2yrs due to non compatibility with \"WINDOWS 7\". The GTR car racing series is a pretty good range of games to buy. On the market at the moment, there is GTR 1, GTR 2, GTR EVOLUTION, GTR LEGENDS or RACE ON,  which I believe is now also part of the GTR series of games. I now have the complete range of this series apart from GTR LEGENDS.I can recommend all of these simulation games to the ultimate motor racing fan or anybody who fancies their chances of having a great adrenlin rush and testing their racing skills against the best drivers of these games.  Good luck to you all and enjoy yourselves. All the best everybody.  (COLIN.D.)
