Euro Truck Simulator because you get to choose your direction in a semi-open world and bring some goods here and there for a profit\n2. Elite Dangerous because you get a persistent vehicle that you can upgrade, whether by purchase or by scavenge\n3. Car Mechanic Simulator because you get to chop and change the car's parts manually, and you have to do this *regularly*.\n\nAside from all this I can see the developers (or modders if it's allowed) adding new vehicles and parts, new cities, new goods, new mechanics. \n\nJalopy is yet another example of how graphics play second fiddle to gameplay.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504600", "timestamp_created": 1506474640, "recommendationid": "35233164", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 644, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561197975475684", "last_played": 1506536333, "num_games_owned": 321}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505968855, "review": "I think this game is a relaxing chill out game.

I score it a solid 8/10. It had a fair share of bugs, forcing me to restart the game a few times. This is annoying as it moves your car back to the most recent checkpoint. For a game that's been out as long as this, there shouldn't be game-breaking bugs occuring with this frequency. Without bugs I would give Jalopy a 9/10.\n\nGem is not a word I throw around lightly, but it's the most appropriate term for this game.\n\nIn Jalopy you find yourself in the company of your aged uncle. He proposes a trip across the country from Germany in order to reach Turkey. Your means of travel? An old Laika 601, and all of the special problems that come with it.\n\nThe game could use a more complex maintainence system. After a while it boils down to just applying your engine repair item to the various parts. You may have to make decisions as to what to repair, and when, but I wish there was more troubleshooting involved. When you open the hood, it's immediately apparent what's wrong. That's not how a real car works, and video games have their limitations, but I feel it could be reworked into something better.\n\nThe story driven segment of the game is a decent length, took me about six hours to finished comfortably. The game doesn't end there though, you can drive around forever if you like.\n\nThe game has all kinds of small charming things. To open the engine bay, you have to pull a level in the cabin. To drive, you have to start the engine by turning the keys and releasing the parking break. When you get out of your car for roadside repairs, it's a good idea to put the hazards on. When it rains, throw your wipers on. When it's dark, put your lights on. There's other things in the game world you can interact with to promote immersion, such as lightswitches and doors. Really small, but immersive things that I loved. \n\nOver time, you watch yourself develop into a skilled motorist and preventative mechanic. You collect upgrades for your trusty Laika, stop forgetting to turn your car off, and devise the optimal way to organize your trunk space. You feel confident in your fuel and vehicle condition to explore off-road paths, and discover the special things they may hold.\n\nYou find yourself immersed in this journey, carefully maintaining your car and checking tires at every stop. You mix and match parts to figure out how you like to drive. You find yourself as a motorist with a destination, as the character of this game. It sneaks up on you in such a special way, that it's not an experience to rob yourself of.\n\nIt's a fun little game, and more than meets the eye. At it's current price, I say Jalopy is a definite purchase.\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1506218667, "recommendationid": "35168498", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 274, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198046648745", "last_played": 1506140070, "num_games_owned": 96}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506533938, "review": "interesting game,but in urgent need of optimization", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "timestamp_created": 1506533938, "recommendationid": "35246177", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 416, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198249651666", "last_played": 1506625616, "num_games_owned": 37}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506268110, "review": "Beautifully austere aesthetic, and a brilliant idea... that I am unable to experience due to a game breaking bug (peripheral conflict) - Whenever I try to drive, the wheel locks to the left (this is with Keyboard/Mouse).
