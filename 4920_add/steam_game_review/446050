And what if this problem isn't delicate anymore, but it's green, it slurps and it's eating people? Oh, don't hope for 'good' ending, you know what GIANT SPACE CORPORATIONS are like.\n\nThe game is a funny puzle with black humour. You and your team land on various space objects and try to eliminate an alien threat. Officially. And unofficially you have some other objectives that are not written in your papers.
