Or Noyes. Pick what you prefer.\n\nThe game graphic is good pixelart. Gameplay is quite fun. There is a quite a bit of stuff you can unlock (mostly weapons and equipment). I like the music too. Character design actually is pretty good!\n\nBUT. I have to say but, and it's okay, because let's admit it, everyone is looking for buts in the review section. No pun intended, I swear.\n\nThe levels feel... a bit too much all the same? The game is pretty short (even for a roguelite, imo), the challenge/difficulty parabola doesn't convince me too much (a little too much steep, again imo, should rise a little more gradually), and most of all, the most unconvincing part of the game is at the end: instead of throwing lots of new, nasty foes at you, there will be all the most powerful enemies you have encountered previously in the game and a couple of upgraded enemies... that really are the same as before but shoot faster or instead of firing bullets, they launch rockets. Things like that.\nThat really makes you feel as you're playing a really poor-of-content, cheap indie. \n\nConsidering how much simple the game is in matter of graphic and programming (just for info, I do have basic programming knowledge, I do know and make pixelart myself, and I do 3D graphic professionally), there are no excuses: everything is needed to fill this game with lots of level designs, varied rooms and textures, weapons, characters and amazing enemies is creativity and passion. Nothing else at all.\n\nAnyway, considering the game is in early access, I still recommend this game and I'm quite happy in supporting this project - but be aware of the fact that I wouldn't recommend it as a final product, right now.\nAnd if the points I discussed won't be improved in future, at least for what regards content, I will change this review and will discourage everyone in buying it. The game has great potential, but a lot of games have it, and very, very few are effectively developed enough.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510055", "timestamp_created": 1498780163, "recommendationid": "33015377", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198146674484", "last_played": 1503177974, "num_games_owned": 128}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496811283, "review": "I was able to pick the game up on sale, for 1/3rd of its retail price. I'm happy with the game and would enjoy having paid full price after realizing how the game plays... I have to say the trailers for this game do it no favors at all, as the trailers try to depict some zany, \"Borderlands-esque\" sense of humor with that lame ass announcer, which isn't present in the actual game itself at all. It has some bugs with the UI after completing a level to be wary of, but if you're just looking for a stylish, frantic shooter / dungeon crawling type of experience in a sci fi, 8 bit aesthetic, this game has some amusing effects and enemies. The sound design and soundtrack -including what sounds like a sample of the \"Doom\" guy wincing on one track inparticular- are well done. \n\nThere is a base building mechanic and you gather credits during levels, as well as various other stat boosts you can upgrade from the game's currency. There is a trading and selling system /marketplace camp of the seemingly limited items / guns available. Cool, my guy can smoke dudes with a shotgun, or the pistol... or rocketlauncher... but what can i do with these 5 guns other than just aim, strafe, and shoot??? Which is harkening to the game's roots (early FPS...?)  but I do wish there were some more customization with the guns ie scopes, larger magazines (I think a vest/gloves you can equip adds to ammo capacity...) I am playing the game as of it's 0.4 version (I believe) which I think saw a fair amount of changes to the pace of the game, but I do enjoy playing it overall and hope to beat the end stage of its frantic and at times overwhelming odds, but it's fun to blast dudes and dodge their  attacks down hallways. \n\nIf the game doesn't have bosses (I'm hoping they are present as the end of the level/stage, but haven't made it that far...) I think implementing a sub-boss / mini boss system would benefit some of the redundancy that begins to emerge in some of the repeated combat encounters w/ dog type enemy, drones, cyborg, spider, etc... \n\nI encountered a bug a couple of times when finishing level and trying to press A on Xbox One while plugged in w/ USB, when hitting A on controller, if I didn't make sure to navigate w/ mouse at the elevator's UI screen to go to 'next level' then the game would occasionally hard lock, but it could be my end of things. The developer(s) seem really receptive to feedback and actively supporting their creation, to their credit, and I like the overall style and effects of the game. They responded already to this, and other people on the forums from what I've seen. \n\nIf you like dungeon crawl / fast-paced, retro FPS combat with cool, frantic effects / explosions but don't mind somewhat repetitive environments/enemies/combat and limited locales, I think this is a fun FPS with loud guns / enemy effects and a cool, futuristic spy type setting / soundtrack, but I do wish it had \"one more thing\" to it in some ways (the ability to switch between characters during level? I don't know..) but what is here is cool.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507869", "timestamp_created": 1496811054, "recommendationid": "32232703", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "last_played": 1497167432, "num_games_owned": 800}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496420617, "review": "Bunker Punks is awesome!\nI bought this game on sale, and opened it up thinking it would be mediocre at best. Boy was i in for a treat! After playing for half an hour i realised that this was no ordinary shooter. You have different characters, who each have a unique passive ability, and a special move. They also have unique starter guns. The soundtrack is really good. I absolutely love it. The music goes with the fast combat of the game. \nDid I tell you there is no sprint button?\nWell, there is no need for a sprint button.\nYou zoom around each floor (the level) with insane speed dodging and jumping over bullets. There are many, many types of enemies and they each have unique ways of attacking you. There are dog robots which charge at you and try to squish you, there are small drones which fly up to you and self destruct. There are more than that too!\nNot only does this game have great combat. There is also a base building aspect, albeit a small addition to the game but still a fun thing to do inbetween the levels.\nHave I mentioned how no level is the same yet?\nNo level is the same.\nWith the randomly generated levels this game has infinite replayability. You do not want to pass this game up. Finally, there is an almost RPG like system in the game, where you can collect different types of guns and armour. Each piece of armour has a stat boost for either a weapon, or even extra health from the pickups.\nWait,\nI forgot something.\nThere are different shops you can unlock, and new rooms for your base. Even when you die it isn't truly over. There is a currency you collect whilst playing, and when you die you can spend it to unlock new things in your next play through. This game is Great!\nIf you dont get this,\nyou are really missing out.\nI rate it 9.5 out of 10\nBrilliant game\nBrilliant Soundtrack\nToo long review\nIf you read all of this, good for you.\nOne last thing.\nFor a game that is in early access, its better than some full games.\nKeep up he good work Devs!\nAnd thanks for a great game!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487236", "timestamp_created": 1496420617, "recommendationid": "32132673", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198272216352", "last_played": 1500107041, "num_games_owned": 76}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499157145, "review": "Fast paced, great audio, interesting story.

I still love and play Doom to this day, and the shooting in this has a chunky Vlambeer feel to it which is satisfying, but my god, the art is absolutely atrocious. The randomly generated levels all feel exactly the same. There's no atmosphere at all, every location is shockingly ugly and samey, every enemy is incredibly boring to both look at and combat. The loot is tiresome and boring. There is no real inventory to manage. Every item is just \"This jacket gives you +5% damage for shotguns\" Wow. Yawn. Ultimately it ends up just feeling like Wolfenstein 3D, because the \"rogue\" elements do not impact gameplay to any noticable degree. It's just a thin layer of micro-boosts.
