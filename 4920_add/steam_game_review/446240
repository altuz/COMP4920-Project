It's like a bad halfway-point between really cool existential gaming (where nothing is encouraged or rewarded, and the correct action is always whatever the player chooses to do) and all the other straightforward clearly-defined-goal-oriented stuff. The player that wants to relax and enjoy the experience of creating something is prevented from doing so because the developers decided that the pace at which the player discovers items must be rapid and frenzied.\n\nHowever it is absurd that the devs are even considering the feelings of the goal-oriented audience in the first place since a game like this would not in a thousand years appeal to the goal-oriented audience.\n\nSo here's my advice. Get rid of the fucking bell. Make a light that turns from red to green or something. If you absolutely must put some kind of intrusive trawl-alert, make it one that doesn't interrupt and actively discourage the entire purpose of your game. Also the list that is permanently overlaid on the typewriter pages grows over time, so if you discover too many items you can't see what you're typing anymore. Fix that, too. Oh, and there's a bug where the bell triggers even if you haven't put the trawl out, so you can just sit at the typewriter and write spam and spawn discovered items non-stop.\n\nI paid six bucks for the opportunity to give you my honest feedback so I hope you appreciate it.
