The game has \"Dreamcast level quality\" in both the complexity of its gameplay and graphics. Neither will blow you away for anything revolutionary, but if you go into it with somewhat tempered expectations what is present is pretty robust, including stealth sections of gameplay, a combat roll to evade enemy attacks, plentiful boss fights, and a narrative presented in both cutscenes and a bunch of dialog. \n\nThe levels have a good variety to them including all-out gun battles with bosses, stealth sections sneaking around turrets, defending other NPCs, and plenty of sections smoking a ton of zombie-like creatures. \n\nSome effects and gameplay elements just look and feel kind of shoddy including your main character's running animation which looks a bit like she might be sprinting to the nearest banyo without wanting to put too much downward force into each step. The grenades you can chuck seem like an after-thought and are very inaccurate. The auto-fire by holding B on Xbox One Controller makes your character auto-aim and flail their arms around rather clumsily-looking. \n\nThese goofy parts aside, overall I enjoy the game for its violence and enemy variety. The frequent bosses all have their own unique combat scenario including evading grenades chucked from a human character throughout a warehouse, blasting a dissolving, abstract gelatinous enemy, and dodging the katana slices of a female antagonist. The sound effects are all good enough with groans from the monstrous enemies and loud attacks from the bosses. Although the sound of the shooting of your main pistols can get a little wearing after awhile they are nowhere near as horribly loud as depicted in the trailers. I'm not sure what's up with the audio mix there, but the audio in general is not that obnoxious or blaring. \n\nI was wanting a macabre twin-stick, isometric shooter and I'm glad I picked this up as I wasn't expecting it to be as in-depth with its boss fights and stealth sections.  More variety in its guns or player abilities would be nice, but it's a fun game to boot up, crank out a few levels, and then take a break.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496721", "timestamp_created": 1499648931, "recommendationid": "33419156", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "last_played": 1501132468, "num_games_owned": 799}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 7, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
