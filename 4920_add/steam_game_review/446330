Buy it, like, yesterday.\n\nReview: This is the best CYOA game to be released by Hosted, bar none. It continues where the first game, Sabres of Infinity, left off, following the rise (or fall) of the protagonist, a dragoon officer. The writing is largely reminiscent of Napoleonic fiction, and I wouldn't be surprised if the author had a stack of Bernard Cornwell's novels at hand for reference in writing the material. That being said, the game world is wholly original and incredibly immersive, and I always enjoy coming back to the richly detailed characters and locales.\n\nImportantly, the gameplay is much improved since the first game, particularly in regards to balancing. Where one found min-maxing inevitable in the previous installment, the choices offered and their influence on the main character in both stats and relationships is far more nuanced and a bit more forgiving in this game. That being said, you can find yourself in no-win scenarios if you plunge your character into deeds of daring far beyond their capabilities, which I enjoy.\n\nIf you need a military-fiction fix, or are thinking about trying a CYOA game for the first time, this is your best bet.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1504587090, "recommendationid": "34749835", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198053053591", "last_played": 1504497132, "num_games_owned": 258}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505099157, "review": "I've owned and played this game both on IOS and via Steam, Cataphrak's work is always amazing.
