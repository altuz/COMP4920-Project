It's a click-to-move game with only 5 positions.  Very basic and not engrossing.  The jumpscares will startle you a couple times and then it's repetitive and boring.  This should be a free game on Miniclip, not a paid title.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "timestamp_created": 1507163518, "recommendationid": "35483189", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 44, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561197971684421", "last_played": 1507163305, "num_games_owned": 92}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 127, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 109, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 18}}
