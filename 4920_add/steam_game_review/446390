I dont have much more to say besides its an absolutely incredibly entertaining piece of software that any fans of DMC should pick up. I never, ever, push myself to get unlocks and achievements but this title got me doing it.\n\nThe combat is fast and fluid. The graphics of the character models and combat are fantastic and high resolution, however the enviroments are decidely low resolution but  very varied. This actually doesnt subtract from the fun I had, because the combat kept me well occupied.\n\nOnechanbara Z2: Chaos has sass and style for days. The banter the ladies say between eachother is at often times hilarious.\n\nThe fighting is also very deep too, and provides a comprehensive training option to get the timing for the \"COOL\" moves down pat. These are some of the most deep mechanics i've experienced since DMC and trust me, you will never master all of them as each of the characters has a different moveset, pre and post transformation.\n\nAnyway, long short, this game is good. Yeah it looks like its shovel ware, lewd ware etc, But get past that and you're in for an excellent time. Cannot recommend this enough, Oh and the music, just wow.\n\n+1. 9/10", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1505049826, "recommendationid": "34861871", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561197976794215", "last_played": 1506865958, "num_games_owned": 67}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 150, "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 107, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 43}}
