I have an issue in both games during opeing level. In Treasure Island it is the find the mistakes puzzle. It does not respond to my mouse commands in any way. I the other game the first paper puzzle has a piece stuck off to the side I can not pick up or move. all other puzzles are working so it is not a mouse isssue. Please fix as I was enjoying the concept but the product I recieved is a rip off. Sadly this is my first steam purchase made without a demo. I won't make that mistake again.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510419", "timestamp_created": 1490566804, "recommendationid": "30761583", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198369800976", "last_played": 1491765302, "num_games_owned": 10}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
