Somethimes you have to combine objects to find the required things', it has been for the most part just context-less hidden object scenes of tools, produce or animal figures. It misses the point of hidden-objects in that they are hidden, the objects are just all layed out on shelves or tables around the room, you just have to walk around and find them.\nThere isn't a penalty either, you can just click on every item because there isn't a point & the game doesn't even care if you are playing it properly.\n\nThere are atrocious fetch quests where you have to wander the entire main hub map finding 16 or 21 screws or worse, shields which are often indistinct circles laying on the ground or on top of blocks & shields on walls which while they are shields aren't the shields you are after & when you get all the objects there isn't really any pay off, just another door opening.\nThe hub maps are windy catacombs with numbered doors, but you don't enter them in sequence, sometimes you open door 1 first & then door 5 which is at the other end of the map is the next one that opens, the game will give you keys but doesn't appear to tell you which door they open (i actually just got told I got a key to Door 9 but there isn't a map & pressing the Hint key just highlights all the remaining puzzles with question marks, not numbers, so even when you are told where to go, you really don't have any idea where that actually is), so you try them all & get a basically identical puzzle to the last one.\n\nDuring one 'match produce to these silhouettes' mini-game, I clicked on everything in the room 4 times before using the Hint button, only to have it highlight an area of the room that was empty of all objects, still clicked it & progressed though. Make that 3 times now, one of the items spawned inside the thickness of a shelf & a second time in the same room, the object the Hint highlighted had spawned beneath the floor.\n\nThe store page says that there is a story, I would say there is a premise; Doctor Watson gets about 5 lines of explanation at the start as to why you are there & I haven't seen anything further, there aren't notes or other thoughts given by Doctor Watson during the game to show that he is even mildly interested in the weird surroundings he finds himself in, there are skull & skeleton ghosts flying around & laughing at him & he's collecting animals, vegetables & tools for untold reasons & he just keeps going without even a hint of curiousity.\n\nThe lack of music outside of random, spooky stings every now & again & the \"story\" is so thin, make this game (so far) feel like I'm being punished for liking the hidden object genre.\nThis almost feels like a rage game, it feels buggy & boring in a way that borders on aggressive & I will finish it out of a grim determination to see if there really is a story & I've already played too long to get a refund.\n\nI did finish it & I was right, the ending was of such an anti-climactic, low quality that it feels like I got trolled.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549950", "timestamp_created": 1457142249, "recommendationid": "21631625", "language": "english", "votes_up": 37, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 77, "steamid": "76561198086542708", "last_played": 1457151586, "num_games_owned": 3586}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
