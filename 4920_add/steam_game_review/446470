Their intent was to make a couple shit simulators and that's exactly what they did. Any publicity, is good publicity right? Not really, but good job. As far as the games go, it's open and shut. They are pure garbage, Controls are terrible, UI was done by a 12-year-old. The city or \"New York\" is clearly European. Same goes for the cars/assets and the THUMBNAIL doesn't even match you GAME NAME! Don't just take my word for it, give it a watch.

Take your dollar and use it to buy anything but this game. It'd be better spent. This game does not represent even New York City, and even America itself correctly.\n\nFirstly, you're allowed to drive on the [b][i]left hand side[/i][/b] of the road. Does this game hate America?\n\nSecondly, none of the taxis in this game represent the actual taxis that exist in NYC. The NYC taxi fleet are made up of Toyotas, Chevys and Fords, and more, but not this unbranded abomination of a relic from the past century that looks like it came out of communist Russia during the 80s.\n\nThirdly, the gameplay is terrible. Apart from the bs from the physics engine (is there even one?) that causes you to crash into cars and lampposts alike, and the bland, endlessly repeating, poorly textured landscape, the game mechanic itself is very elementary. By that I mean that this game contains about as much gameplay as a free flash game that you may be able to find online somewhere like FreeOnlineGames or Miniclip.\n\nFourthly, the levelling system. I wanted to explore the game further to write a more comprehensive review but the levelling system is entirely aimless. The \"Classic ride\" passengers are never seemingly satisfied (might have something to do with all the fire hydrants I'm hitting on the way), and always rate the ride 1/5 stars. There is no explanation as to how this star system is calculated, and therefore I would have had to find out by the method of trial and error. However, my patience had run out two passenger rides into the game, so I never got a chance to find out the mechanics behind that system.\n\nOverall, this game is NOT worth playing. There are free flash games out there that are better made than this game, and I would definitely not recommend this game to anyone I know (except to maybe gift them the game to annoy them).\n\nI have also made a video review that you can check out if you want the above description in less words and in more pictures.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTcHJjFHYu8", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505433", "timestamp_created": 1467142257, "recommendationid": "23903193", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198051589272", "last_played": 1498877024, "num_games_owned": 182}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 16, "timestamp_updated": 1460418360, "review": "great game", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419044", "timestamp_created": 1460418360, "recommendationid": "22364949", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "steamid": "76561198155782794", "last_played": 1460493151, "num_games_owned": 140}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 46}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 5, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
