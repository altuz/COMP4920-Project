Their intent was to make a couple shit simulators and that's exactly what they did. Any publicity, is good publicity right? Not really, but good job. As far as the games go, it's open and shut. They are pure garbage, Controls are terrible, UI was done by a 12-year-old. The city or \"New York\" is clearly European. Same goes for the cars/assets and the THUMBNAIL doesn't even match you GAME NAME! Don't just take my word for it, give it a watch.
