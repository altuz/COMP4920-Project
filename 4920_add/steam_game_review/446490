And no, there is no Denzel Washington in this game.\n\nThe only positive thing I really have to say is that it runs fast on Max settings and boots in seconds. It is also only 300mb meaning uninstalling it is easy. That concludes all the positive things I have to say.\n\nThe game's trailer does not lie, there are \"Technical defects\" and \"Weathering\" (To my brain as it wonders how the F*** this got on steam). The Train you are given can move forwards and back on the same section of track and you can switch the points to the Rib tracks (I don't know, im not a train person!). Thats It.\n\nYou also have Barry the Magical Mechanic at your disposal who can fix tracks with his mind. Just click the Defect and Barry will fix the issues, [i]In a jiffy.[/i] His job is pretty easy all things considered, as the defects all appear in the same spot. Furthermore, The Questionable Cargo Transporter Company That Shall Not Be Named Because Copyright Inc (TQCTCTSNBNBC inc) convieneiently leaves all of its cargo in the same spot each time. Every mission is the same bar one where the train catches fire and even that mission was made easy thanks to Barry (Who is also immune to fire). Every mission follows the same pattern:\n[olist]\n        [*]Go to cargo by Spamming the \"S\" key\n        [*]Use the cargo manager to violently smash the Trains together in the hope that they will blend.\n        [*]Go to designated Track by switching the points and Spamming the \"W\" Key\n        [*] ???\n        [*] Profit!\n        [*] Please refer to step one\n[/olist]\n\n[b] td;dr [/b]\nIn short, this game is like being forced to watch the intro of Thomas the Tank Engine over and over again at full volume. Right now its 80p on sale so if you want a few laughs, go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, steer clear of this game.\n\nAnd finally, my favorite quotes:\n\n \" [...]*Dink* *Dink* *Dink* *Dink* *Dink* *Dink* *Dink* *Dink* *Dink*[...] \" -Barry\n\n\"Graphics: Easy\" - The game launcher\n\n\"To reverse, hold the reverse key.\" - The help menu\n\n\"[Infernal Noises]\" - A random Badger that stole Barry's hammer and set my train on fire.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486558", "timestamp_created": 1467039879, "recommendationid": "23863787", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198134579071", "last_played": 1467037138, "num_games_owned": 110}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 12}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1467520966, "review": "Does not work", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482442", "timestamp_created": 1467520966, "recommendationid": "24037413", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198147991221", "last_played": 1467520903, "num_games_owned": 40}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 8}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1465565142, "review": "not bad 4da money", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462826", "timestamp_created": 1465565142, "recommendationid": "23484297", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198307503820", "last_played": 1465875859, "num_games_owned": 8}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 21}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1465319963, "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHfGdrmp_-g\n\nNot good, but not bad. \n\n+ Trains (I bought this game because I like trains, I don't know why but I like trains)\n+ Main Menu\n\n\n- Bad camera view\n- Bad graphics\n\nNote: It's a Sim game.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442396", "timestamp_created": 1465319963, "recommendationid": "23438372", "language": "english", "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "steamid": "76561198055837109", "last_played": 1465313760, "num_games_owned": 1633}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 36}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1475340874, "review": "I played the game for 17 minutes, It was boring after 5.
