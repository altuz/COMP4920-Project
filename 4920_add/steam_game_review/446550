You get 10 shots to get the ball in the hole, and each putt you miss deducts 1000 points (2000 on first putt) from the hole total. It looks something like this:\n\n10,000 Hole-In-One\n8,000 Albatross\n7,000 Eagle\n6,000 Birdie\n5,000 Par\n...\n\nPROS:\n\n* Fun visuals\n* Community created holes\n* Customization for golfers\n* Couch and Online play\n* Decent gamepad controls. Great keyboard/mouse controls\n* Fun casual music\n* Non-traditional scoring and power-ups make the game different from most mini golf games\n\nCONS:\n\n* Able to make a 9 hole course from community holes but can't play them multiplayer\n* SFX are present but seem hollow, lack oomph\n* The unlock system is a little obtuse\n* Non-traditional scoring mixed with traditional terminology might be confusing (par doesn't matter)\n* The scroll speed on the customization menu is too sensitive\n* Could use more than 3 themes (Kid's Bedroom, Halloween, Christmas)\n\nFINAL:\n\nI like this game. It has its shortcomings, but I do enjoy playing it. I have only tried solo play, but I hope couch and online are just as fun.\n\nP.S.\n\nYou can change the shape of the ball for all those GWYF fans.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1499554538, "recommendationid": "33388144", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561197999783126", "last_played": 1500435695, "num_games_owned": 371}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501033415, "review": "VR REVIEW ONLY:\nSo I bought Infinite Mini Golf VR and decided to give it a try, without knowing it doesnt support Vive motion controllers... well well I thought, could be fun anyway. So here are my initial thoughts and a first gameplay on HTC Vive playing some holes in all 3 environments on HTC Vive, only single player mode:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM6nuOh3NWc\n\nWell, how to sum this up... Indeed its a great looking game. Graphics are polished, its very detailed and vivid. I played with max in-game antialiasing of 8x and SuperSampling on 1.4 in SteamVR, and it was very sharp and crisp still running perfectly without reprojection (1080Ti)\n\nGame feels cute and fun, there are around 800 holes to play (including custom holes), a course editor, multiplayer and much more. \n\nIts a very nice minigolf game indeed, but how about the VR support then? Well, this COULD have been a blast, if they just added motion controller support. I dont find it entertaining enough playing games like this with a gamepad, not for more than 10 minutes maybe. Of course the VR view  works really well but most of the VR immersion is just not existing because of lack of motion controller support.\n\nThey added positional tracking so the roomscale is working as well. But without being able to hold that golf club and swing, the VR support feels quite limited and practically not needed. Yes you get quite immersed just like in Luckys Tale, mainly because of the beautiful surroundings. But the golf-feeling itself suffers :(\n\nSo all in all, I will give this thumbs up as it's a great minigolf game, but for VR gamers, I would recommend you guys to wait with purchasing this game just for VR. I look forward to an update with \"real\" VR support, because this game has huge potential to become the best minigolf game in Virtual Reality. \n\nI will keep it in my Steam library, and cross my fingers.
