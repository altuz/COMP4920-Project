You use your phone as a dance controller.  You mimic the dancing from your chosen avatar.  If you have a camera on your PC, you can see a recording of a snippet of your dancing.  You can also take photos from your phone dance controller.  You have to have UPlay to activate.\n\nThe scoring from the phone app is less than stellar.  You will get OKs and won't be able to tell why, even if you think you did the move perfect.  You're limited to seeing dances and challenges from other PC users (there's no crossplay).  You can like players dances or do their dance challenges.  You can also upload your own.\n\nAlso, the kinect does not work on PC other than as a webcam.  That's really a shame.  You get 90 days free of Just Dance Unlimited, which is just access to more DLC dances.  \n\nRate 7/10 good game, but they have forgotten PC players", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504249", "timestamp_created": 1505355267, "recommendationid": "34940721", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 210, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1505270956, "num_games_owned": 846}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505707912, "review": "Cannot recommend this game right now. There must have been some sort of update. I'm currently subscribed to one year of unlimited, the premium service for this game. The interface for searching new songs is clunky. And now the options for \"Unlimited A-E\", \"Unlimited F-J\", etc, are all gone. There is no way that I can see to find unlimited songs except by manually searching for them. If anyone knows how to relist the unlimited songs, please add me and let me know.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502015", "timestamp_created": 1505707912, "recommendationid": "35038568", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198042372544", "last_played": 1505704431, "num_games_owned": 97}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 127, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 102, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 25}}
