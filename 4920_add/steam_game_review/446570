I am looking forward to what it will offer as it, hopefully, gets updated. For now there are better VR browsing experiences. Will recommend when it is worth paying for.\n\nWhy similar apps are better:\n- I am not wanting to be looking all over at the open browsers; I will likely be typing so all the windows are going to be in my front field of view.\n- Need to be able to control the windows pitch you open; otherwise when you move them around they just look odd and are unable to see proper. \n\nYou can only browse the web; I get it that's what this is for but what is the need to see all the windows in awkward positions. I can't really find a need to have this or what I would realistically use it for within the limited environment.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513774", "timestamp_created": 1463219003, "recommendationid": "22972668", "language": "english", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561197993269206", "last_played": 1463223955, "num_games_owned": 906}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
