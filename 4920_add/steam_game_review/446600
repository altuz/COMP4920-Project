The writing is sharp, and I adore the art style (as witnessed by my avatar) and it really helps to sell the atmosphere of the game itself.  While there are not a large amount of characters in the game, I think it works to the game's benefit and enables it to maintain its focus and the main cast feels fleshed out.\n\nAs a downside, it feels on the shorter end of VNs with only needing about two and a half hours to see everything and there's really only one \"good\" end if that matters to you.  (Also said without seriousness, that there's no harem end.)\n\nI would personally love to see a sequel down the road with Sophie, Charlie and Eri.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1499787059, "recommendationid": "33458445", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198396754786", "last_played": 1499786802, "num_games_owned": 30}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 39, "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 28, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
