Now, Bunny Bounce, the third and final game of the franchise (as far as I know), dropped the ball.\n\nIt\u2019s shorter than the second game and it\u2019s about the same price. The story feels more like a spin off than an ending to the series, with all the animal ears and Tomo going f*cking insane. Also, the endings were [b]horrible[/b]. [spoiler]You basically end up with Yuuki or alone. What about the other girls? I really wanted an ending with them since Yuuki is my LEAST FAVORITE character. lol[/spoiler]\n\n3/10. Get it on a good sale and only to complete your collection. If you\u2019re new to this franchise, you might dislike this title.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566462", "timestamp_created": 1493340050, "recommendationid": "31405082", "language": "english", "votes_up": 34, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 385, "steamid": "76561198120348301", "last_played": 1490100445, "num_games_owned": 791}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 10, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 4}}
