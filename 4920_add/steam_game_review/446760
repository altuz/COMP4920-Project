The game starts you out looking at a group of animals sitting on a couch together, but as soon as you get into the game you think to yourself, \"Huh, this game looks pretty empty.\" Then, five rounds later your like, \"This game is too easy, give me a challenge.\" and then the next round you are just killing some robots and then BAM you get kidnapped by a demon snowman that takes you into a corner and repeatedly beats the everliving shiz out of you. I have only played the game a little while now but holy crap this game is entertaining as heck and I still don't understand why it isn't more popular. Overall, I give it a 9/10, the only thing they could've done to make it better is to add some more gamemodes.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1502240152, "recommendationid": "34115281", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198291303991", "last_played": 1503888972, "num_games_owned": 26}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 11, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 10, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
