You really are left clueless and everything about it just is bad. Put it this way, I got stuck at the very beginning, which is not somehting that should be happening. This game feels like something I could do if i just bought a weapons pack and map pack on Unity and put it together, then sold it on steam...\n\nOverall pretty terrible game.\n\nRating: 1.9/10\nRecommend Price: $0.00 Don't buy it", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510022", "timestamp_created": 1493747738, "recommendationid": "31510675", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 226, "steamid": "76561198049020554", "last_played": 1493747751, "num_games_owned": 2464}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496278795, "review": "AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!! This game is WRETCHED. Monotonous glitch galore huge levels and before you think it no that isn't a good thing in this game,thesecond stage is huge and overall pointless. There is no direction or story in this game which ok benefit of the doubt but it just makes the hugeness of the maps even more pointless since there is no secret note for extra plot like in outlast. Or even really important supplies since you can just run past the enemies. The game isn't scary no atmosphere at all and lag spikes all over the place the game doesn't even restart the game itself is trying to stop you from playing. There are basically 2 types of levels in this game maze levels and supremely long monotonous levels where you are endlessly walking to the next insignificant area. The maze levels are even worse endless running through different areas with one trillion pointless rooms for one room with the right portal aka level 4. All of these things you can find in level four it is dreadful you guys it really is. Just reach that level and you will see what I mean sorry this was so long and overstayed its welcome...ahem", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1496278795, "recommendationid": "32097584", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198326743187", "last_played": 1496275665, "num_games_owned": 7}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 64, "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 24, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 40}}
