It's [b]not[/b] a traditional tycoon game, it's [b]not[/b] a simulator, it [b]is[/b] a transport [u]builder[/u] ... a good one!\n\nNot being a 'tycoon' game there are no competitors to face down or fight with for resources, nor are you planning detailed itineraries nor driving your vehicles. If that is what you want, if that is what you [i]need[/i] then this game is probably not for you. But. If you love creating routes to fulfil your game-world's needs, finding novel new ways to get wood delivered to a sawmill and get those planks to the tool shop in the right quantities to combine with the steel created from the coal and ore you've delivered to the steel mill  ... all to meet the demand of a growing population of workers who need transport to get from home to work (and back again). If you love designing, creating, tinkering, seeing a world come to life then this game will be right up your street!\n\nIf you didn't play Train Fever (the developer's previous title), be aware that there is a bit of a learning curve, especially if you are familiar with those other tycoon games, the way supply and demand works is different; I'd say more \"realistic\". You will need to plan routes very carefully and make use of the signals and waypoints that are available. Thankfully, unlike Train Fever, there is something of a tutorial and a couple of \"campaigns\" that do a reasonable job of introducing the basic concepts.\n\nIf you [i]did[/i] play Train Fever and gave up in frustration, you will (hopefully) be pleased to hear that they have fixed a lot of the issues in that game. Terrain alignment problems are significantly reduced, track laying is much, much, better and so much more flexible (double slip switches anyone?). Likewise, routing is a lot better; with platform selection and even waypoints on roads! Vehicle upgrading/replacing is also much simpler now and requires a lot less micro-managing.\n\nIf you played and enjoyed Train Fever, then Transport Fever will give you more with bigger and more challenging maps - you [b]will[/b] need to organise and manage your cargo routes very carefully end-to-end. It is also really reassuring that the developers are still engaged with the player community and continue to work on improving it, both in terms of performance as well as playability and features.  That said, while the addition of boats and planes does provide more options for your transport network, they are still more often than not going to be fun eye-candy rather than core components in your grand scheme.\n\nWhile I am more than happy to play a \"builder\", for me there is one feature that I do miss ... [u]disasters[/u]! I loved the fact that trains could crash or bridges collapse in Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon. Having to deal with a failure to properly signal my lines or maintain those old wooden bridges would make me very happy indeed. Losing money or failing to meet demand is one thing but having my favourite loco fall into the rushing river waters - that would be a cool challenge!\n\nTo be fair, and highlight some of the deficiencies of the game:\n[list]\n[*] Performance can be an issue (but then, mapping thousands of 'sims' and hundreds of vehicles, over large custom maps is never going to be easy)\n[*] There are still too many terrain issues such as \"too much slope\" or \"terrain collision\" where you really wouldn't expect them\n[*] The number of included vehicle assets is not particularly impressive (but there is a very lively and creative modding community that more than covers this deficiency)\n[*] Some of the game mechanics or logic can be difficult to determine - why aren't people using my train, how can I meet the demand for tools to keep the coal mine operational? \n[/list]\n\nKeep in mind that Transport Fever is not a Transport Tycoon, it is not a Transport Simulator, it is a Transport BUILDER and I think you will come to love this game as much as I do. Just be warned that it keeps a [i]lot[/i] of it's logic and options hidden from plain sight so be sure to check out the community guides, forums, Lets Plays and the like to uncover all it's secrets.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503258", "timestamp_created": 1506719720, "recommendationid": "35312611", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 10182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1094, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198032155756", "last_played": 1506991695, "num_games_owned": 25}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506800883, "review": "This game scratches a lot of my itches.\nIts finally a worth successor to isometric (and iconic) Transport Tycoon\nTheres a big community of modders constantly expanding the game with great visuals\nI love riding the trains on the tracks that i built. For that itch i had to play train simulators in the past, which still werent quite as satisfying, because you mostly couldnt just sit there and watch, not to speak of a lack of eye candy in train sims and train tracks limited.\nIn Transport fever you can ride ANY of the vehicles and watch them travel through beautiful landscapes.\nI even prefer hilly terrain because it looks so much nicer than flat land. Slopey tracks also are so much nicer than just straight forward.\n\nBut...There is no multiplayer, no coop, no AI. So it does get boring rather quickly because there is no competition and not that many industries to connect...\nDistances bewteen cities arent that long and the map sizes (even the larger experimental ones) arent that big. i didnt have a game so far, where the concorde airplane could actually reach full speed on a flight from end to end of a map...\nAnyways. Transport Fever is the best game of THIS KIND with nice 3D visuals.\nIf you can live without riding your own trains and are in for multiplayer/coop or competition with AI and fine with isometric 2d graphics, go play OpenTTD, as it offers everything this game offers, for free and with a huge fanbase too.\nYou might also check openttdcoop.org.

The user interfaces look uncannily similar too. However, TTD does a better job when it comes to UI functionalities and gameplay. The developers must be a big fan of Chris Sawyer's games.\n\n- The tutorial is pretty nice but it's common sense, I don't need to learn the basics. I want to jump to the advanced courses. No such option! In the end I had to skip it all together. \n\n- Need a setting to define the size of the user interfaces. I feel sorry for those using 4K monitors; My 2K monitor is bad enough already. Definitely not playable for those who has presbyopia unless you buy glasses designed for looking at computer monitors.\n\n- No AI players to compete with therefore you can't play funny pranks on the stupid AI players like you can with TTD. LOL! Bummer!\n\n- No setting to define the density of towns and industries. Need more industries and more varieties!!\n\n- no setting to choose the percentage of land, water and mountains. \n\n- Only has about 2 dozen towns in the biggest map. The original TTD has at least 50 and OpenTTD has at least 100 towns!!!\n\n- In my current game, out of the 24 towns, only 4 are by the waters which makes building ships boring! My last biggest map, only 2 towns were by the waters. Wow! That's fun... :/\n\n- Industry icons are microscopic whether you zoomed out or zoomed in - have to click on each industry to identify. The purpose of zooming out is to see a larger map to identify the industry supply and demand locations and the best places to lay tracks. How about color-coding the industries like in TTD? That way you don't need icons and can be seen from afar.\n\n- industries are so sparse that it is not worth building routes for them, both economically and physically. So, this game is known to me as \"Passenger Transport Fever\" as I mostly build routes for passengers only.
