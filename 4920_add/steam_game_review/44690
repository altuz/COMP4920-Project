You can unlock car and tracks, buy them and form a car collection! And with these legendary cars, I can spend hours'n hours into it *-* \n\nI can't see any cons. No I am serious. This game has no cons in my opinion! And with that cheap price, that game should be on your library. No, not should. MUST. If you're here, that means you like sim racing, and if you like sim racing, you MUST have this!\n\n10/10. Thank you SimBi... oh well... Sector 3 Studios..!!"}]}
