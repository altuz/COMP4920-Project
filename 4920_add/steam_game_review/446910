I think I am over my brief foray into horror games. This game has the mechanics that I think FNAF should have had. I think I might have actually liked FNAF if it played like Night Blights. The two games share in common the concept of keeping monsters out. But I found the gameplay in FNAF to not be very engaging. In this game, at least you can move around the environment. You have to perform different actions to block out the monsters. You also have to collect and stockpile toys to feed to the night Blights to appease them. I think I actually like this game more because it reminds me of how much I hate FNAF. Now I realize the sequels to FNAF might have added more involved gameplay, but I'll never know, I checked out after the first game.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "timestamp_created": 1498618291, "recommendationid": "32906720", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 97, "steamid": "76561198096079278", "last_played": 1503878864, "num_games_owned": 113}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496407238, "review": "Its fun, and spoopyyyyyyy", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1496407238, "recommendationid": "32128175", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561198299591621", "last_played": 1504282060, "num_games_owned": 23}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1493701775, "review": "Creepy shit", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496937", "timestamp_created": 1493701775, "recommendationid": "31500253", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198207895451", "last_played": 1506674299, "num_games_owned": 12}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 4}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495899605, "review": "sucks A**", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480793", "timestamp_created": 1495899605, "recommendationid": "31999448", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "steamid": "76561198156077418", "last_played": 1469987718, "num_games_owned": 23}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 9}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 31, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 30, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
