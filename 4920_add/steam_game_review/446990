The first chapter of 5 is free but the rest will cost you. Not sure if they're worth the asking price but when they're on sale, definitely worth it.\n\nThe Huntsman: Winter's Curse is a turn-based RPG where the skills you use are based on a deck of cards. Every piece of equipment you use (weapon, armor, and 2 accessories) will give you access to a different set of cards and sometimes a special bonus (or negative effect). So there's a lot of strategy in what you decide to equip. On the same page where you choose your equipment is also a skill tree. Everytime you level up, you get to choose one perk - all passive.\n\nBattles, as I've said, are turn-based. There's a bar on the top of the screen that your characters and the enemies move along and get an action at the end of. Many cards have effects that push the enemies back on the bar. Of course, they can do the same to you. You get 3 cards to pick from (you can only choose one) each time you can perform an action. They're random. As soon as you use one, another random one will take its place. Some of the perks on the skill tree will allow you access to more cards in each hand - for a total of 5. It's definitely nicer to have more choices. At the end of a fight, all your HP is refilled. (YAY) I really loved the battles. \n\nThe art in this game is lovely and the music is pleasant though there's not much variation. \n\nThe story.... it's interesting, to be sure. But the main characters always seem to be bickering so I kinda want to smack them. Still, I'm enjoying the journey. Throughout the plot, you get to make many decisions and I'm sure these affect how much exp you get sometimes and items you can find. At some point, I'm sure I'll play this again just to see what different choices offer. I've completed 4 of the 5 chapters so I can't tell you if the ending of the story is any good. Let's hope so!\n\nThis is not an action game in any form. It's strategy all the way. This has been one of the more enjoyable games I've played this year so I definitely recommend it. Oh, a heads-up for achievement hunters. All you have to do to 100% the game is play through all 5 chapters. That's it.\n\nAdditional: I played the game again, making different decisions and using different strategies. I can indeed attest to the fact that decisions matter. They change exp gained and what items you may or may not get. They determine how many enemies you face or if you face any at all. It was neat to see the differences. I really love this game.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562946", "timestamp_created": 1498478756, "recommendationid": "32812135", "language": "english", "votes_up": 28, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 1943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "steamid": "76561198138437975", "last_played": 1498860935, "num_games_owned": 1174}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498441269, "review": "Winter's Curse is really pretty to look at. There's a lushness to the art that reminds me of Child of Light, and a consistent, immersive dark-and-beautiful feel to the visuals.\n\nUnfortunately, that's almost all there is.\n\nWinter's Curse does deserve some praise for all the ways it doesn't fall on its face as a licensed game. It isn't just a re-tread of Huntsman movie stuff. It develops its own characters, independant from the ones in the franchise. It also builds its combat system around a few simple gimmicks that, nonetheless, are pretty fun. Most in-game encounters come with dialog choices, most of which feel meaningful.\n\nWinter's Curse's problem is that, apart from the art, it doesn't really excel anywhere. Equipping new items is fun, but then the inventory starts to fill with cloggy nonsense. Battles load quick and look nice, but combat feels a bit draggy after the third encounter. The art brings the setting to life, but the writing sometimes undercuts it. The first piece of the game is free, but it's also the most generic part. Things pick up considerably in the following chapters.\n\nI can't bring myself to condemn Winter's Curse for only being kinda fun, though. Still, there's such a wide swathe of other games out there that I can't really urge people to jump on it either.\n\nIf you like the art style, you like lighter RPGs, you don't need a game's writing to be Planescape: Torment caliber, and you want the opportunity to frantically spam makeouts on your sorcerer companion in hopes of \"breaking his curse\", this is a pretty reasonable buy. I wouldn't pick it up for full price unless you *know* it's going to be your jam, but having bought it at ten bucks, I don't have any regrets.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504003", "timestamp_created": 1498441237, "recommendationid": "32795826", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "steamid": "76561198029904609", "last_played": 1501196626, "num_games_owned": 364}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 30, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 25, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
