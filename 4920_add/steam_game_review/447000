Noob here!  This 'point and chat' adventure starring a 'bit of a bell end' aspiring poet & his snarky brain was such a breath of fresh air!  Set in Northern England, this quick witted, sharp tongued narrative on bureaucracy and social interaction was a lovely departure from basic platformers and shoot-em-up first person free for alls.  There is SO MUCH good I can say about this game: amazing dialogue, top notch art style, OUTSTANDING MUSIC, good character development, overall had a fun time playing from start to finish.  There are also a few not as good things I could say about the game: the end was super bizarre and left me wanting quite a bit more closure, sometimes your tasks felts a bit 'run-y around-y', the controls occassionally hiccuped a bit (no bueno for a point and click adventure).  If I wanted to be hyper critical, I'd say that the game was a bit short, but it was a good play from beginning to end.  B+ overall.  Thanks to the developers!!
