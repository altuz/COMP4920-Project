So I'll be presenting my views for both long time players, and those who haven't owned/played farming simulator before.\n\nIf you have a real nice computer to run this on, it's almost a work of art- There's detail where you'd least expect it. The gameplay is also wonderful, you have a couple different \"routes\" you can go when it comes to making money; making the biggest farm you can, handling huge heards of animals, or furiously logging. The game also has a pretty sophisticated economy, which takes a lot of variables into consideration, and also makes you think about how you can maximize your return on investment.\n\nCompared to previous versions of Farming Simulator, it certainly is an improvement in several categories, including visuals, physics, and general game mechanics. Many people do say that it's not much of an improvement compared to Farming Simulator 15, and I partially agree with them. I feel the part that makes it worth the upgrade would be the assortment of new and improved assets- some things in FS15 just felt poorly put together, meanwhile FS17 offers a wide variety of equipment (with lots of extra options too), all of which brings a new or improved experience to the table.\n\nIf you own a previous version of FS, I'd suggest watching YouTube videos of FS17 or potentially seeing if a friend can let you play, because my opinion of it being notably better than FS15 may not be the same as your opinion as to how similar it really is, and you can decide for yourself if it really lives up to the hype.\nIf you've never owned/played Farming Simulator before, and you're interested in it, I highly suggest this game for you, (partly because there's no major advantage to purchasing an older version), as it'll be able to provide you with hours of fun (or screwing around), and there probably won't be another version until around 2019.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516433", "timestamp_created": 1504906072, "recommendationid": "34823509", "language": "english", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 7752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198066097098", "last_played": 1505513953, "num_games_owned": 101}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506332692, "review": "[i] See below for my notes for owners of Farm Sim 13/15 [/i]\n\n[h1] Review [/h1]\n\nIf you like Simulation games, this is a great one to add to your collection. It's a great family and cooperative game that is both fairly relaxing and deceptively challenging. You can certainly play the game casually, but playing it as intended means a fair dedication of time. It will take a long time to do everything there is to do, and there is a lot of it. Farming ranges from the typical grains to the more involved root crops. You also have animal husbandry available and it goes well when done side-by-side with regular farming. The last major job available is Forestry, which is one of the most engaging tasks available in the game, although it can be frustrating due to in-game physics.\n\nEach map starts you with a couple of fields, farming equipment, and a loan of varying amounts depending on the difficulty. From there on, you make your decisions as to how to play and what to do. You can sell all your equipment right from the start and do whatever you like. Fields you don't yet own are \"owned\" by NPCs who will offer you jobs to work that field and is a great way to make early money. Just don't spend too much time on other fields and not your own. Each job raises your reputation for that field and in turn lowers the price to purchase. Jobs are unfortunately but understandably not available in multiplayer. You can take a bigger loan to expand your business, make money from selling crops when the price is high, or even hunt hidden \"nuggets\" for a big cash bonus and an achievement. \n\nThe amount of vehicles and tools available to help you in your chosen roles is astounding and here might be one of the drawbacks. It can take a while to fully understand what they all do and what the advantages of each are. You are likely to have a whole selection of these that you will just never use unless you purposely try them all. With more tools and attachments come more key bindings to remember. The F1 help menu is great at listing the main keyboard shorcuts, but many are only learned if you dig deep. The game is not difficult to play by any means, but it is difficult to master. Parents who play with their kids should definitely aim for about 6-7 yrs and up unless your child is very familiar with these type of games.\n\nGraphics are great for what the game is looking to achieve. Most of the game engine power will be dedicated to tracking your crop and equipment status and you'll grow to have a lot. The equipment is incredibly detailed with great animations of moving parts all realistically working. Older computers can still play the game but will be forced to lower settings and limit the amount of equipment on the screen. Forestry may be very difficult with slower PCs as the tree rendering and physics will cause lag. Sound design is decent but some of the machines do not feel powerful. Sounds are also shared across some equipment which leaves little to tell them apart sound-wise. I imagine some of these tractors and harvesters have very unique engine notes that sadly do not stand out. There is a built-in game radio that your can tune to online music streams and comes with some basic \"radio stations\" with a few songs each. You'll likely listen to your favorite music separately and never use the in-game offerings.\n\nIf you like downloading add-ons or \"mods\" for games, you will find a wealthy offering by the community. The game features a built-in mod browsers which is a huge step up over previous versions. The mods available here pale in comparison to those available at many online sites, however. Do be warned that some of these sites may have ads or even malware, so be careful when browsing. The community mods can vastly add and transform the game, making it more realistic, larger, adding more vehicles, crops and even jobs like mining. Giants also has DLC avaliable, but nothing that you really need. Kuhn DLC has extra tools but nothing spectacular except the square bale wrapper. The Big Bud DLC requires a large map and you won't have the need for big tractors unless you're later in the game and made some money for bigger fields.\n\nAll in all there is a lot to do here. If a job gets too boring there are other ways to do it or other jobs to do to keep it different. There's multiple approaches to almost all jobs and money making is fairly balanced if you're playing it as designed, so just do what you like. You'll obviously have to like the sim genre, but the game offer the best farming simulation out there. With several major releases under their belt, this latest release really does have a complete package. Not entirely without faults, but it is by far the best of its type out there, and a fantastic investment in terms of play value; especially with friends. Highly Recommended. \n\nIf you are unsure about whether you would like the game, or cannot afford it, you will find a lot of what FS17 has to offer in the older FS15, but the newer version is definitely superior. See these notes below for some of the differences\n\n[h1] Notes for owners of Farm Sim 2013/2015 [/h1]\n\nIf you own the older FS13, you will find a huge step up in content. There are changes to some mechanics so watch a couple of videos online if you're not too sure. Definitely worth the upgrade.\n\nFS15 players I know are going to be on the fence. I actually decided to write this review almost just to point out some of the reasons to upgrade. Obviously this will be personal opinion but I feel those saying FS17 offers nothing new from 15 are wrong. Here is is a quick list of the new things:\n\n[list]\n[*]Soybeans and sunflowers now stock crops\n[*]Pig farming\n[*]New vehicle types like weeders (Work like fertilizer)\n[*]Performance improvements (FS17 runs better and looks better on my PC over FS15)\n[*]In-game Mod hub\n[*]You can pickup and move objects (Great for Forest work in a budget)\n[*]You can strap objects down! (No more logs floping all over during transport)\n[*]Vehicle customization (Change engines wheels and other options in the shop, you can upgrade vehicles after purchase)\n[*]Vehicle lease/rent now stock\n[*]3 Fertilizing stages + plowing actually does something (+10 % yield from plowing)\n[/list]\n\nCatch it on a sale if you want, but it is worth the update to FS17. FS15 mods are almost all available in 17, and the new Platinum version coming out in November actually looks pretty good.
