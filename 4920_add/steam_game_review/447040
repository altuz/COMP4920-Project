Due to marcus unlocking 2 drones early on in the game that have infinite respawns as long as you wait around.

I personally think there are more enjoyable characters in this game than the previous one (yes fuck you Aiden Pearce you cool looking but boring af character), but I still didn't particularly care a lot about the protagonists, because of how \"cringey\" (don't know if this is the best way to describe) their dialogues is. The antagonists from both Watch Dogs games are interesting, but I personally preferred the gangs from the first one, because they feel more threatening. The overall story/plot is alright. I mean if you want to play this for a solid story, I don't think you should play this. For me, the story has its moments, but it just didn't deliver overall. It didn't make me feel like: \"Wow, that was fucking incredible\" or even \"This story is really enjoyable\" \n\nGameplay have more varieties in this one, but it's pretty much what you expected from a city open world game. There's driving, which is still oddly stiff. Since it has guns, there is a cover system and shooting, which is mostly smooth. Then, the biggest part of the gameplay that makes Watch Dogs Watch dogs is the hacking. The hacking in this one offers more opportunities, which is a nice touch. In terms of technical issues, the game runs smoothly for me at 50-60 FPS, but sometimes after returning to the game from a break, it will lag to 20 FPS for a many seconds. Idk if this is the game's issue or my computer's issue, so don't take it too seriously.\n\nThen, the open world...\nWhen I say it gets boring (not \"af\") after a while, it really could for a lot of players, because it feels like another of those typical open world games like Assassin's Creed games where the map shoves a ton of collectibles to collect and activities to do into your face. What I basically want to say is that, unless you are a completionist like me, you couldn't care less to forcefully do these mutiple repetitive side activities, which consists a lot of \"walking/driving around, find the collectibles, hacking puzzles that gets annoying the more you do it (unless you love puzzles)\". The side stuff makes the game feel grindy in a way I guess.\n\nSo, yeah I don't recommend this game to anyone. OBVIOUSLY, this doesn't mean the game is utter garbage. If you want a score, then I'll give this game a 7-7.5/10.\n\nAnother pro I guess is that I appreciate the fact Ubisoft shows improvement in their product.
