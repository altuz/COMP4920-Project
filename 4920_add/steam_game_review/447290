As far as top down action games go this is definitely one of the best I have played alongside the Hotline Miami games. Exhilarating action from start to finish, very addictive and easy to pick up and play.

No combos or special abilities. Just punch, kick and use all sorts of melee or ranged weapons. Every weapon that is used against you can be equipped and used as well.

The game is challenging in some parts, and later on requires alot of dodging around rooms and counter-attacking at the right moments.

Sadly, it isn't frequently at its best. \n\nI loved Mother Russia Bleeds, a realistic simulator of a day in the life of an average Russian fetal alcohol syndrome suffererer, to which this game bears some similarity in terms of environment and general technical progression. Mother Russia Bleeds used the resources available to it to create a unique and varied brawler experience, with enemies requiring various combinations of techniques to overcome and a unique atmosphere. \n\nWhile some of that can be seen in Redeemer, the additon of another dimension in combination with far more readily available firearms leads to a combat system which is exploitable and boringly easy if not set to hardcore. The copying of certain elements, mainly countering, from the Arkham games doesn't help anything. And instead of filling the shoes of a degenerate in a hoodie, this time you're a standard human enemy from Stalker who has given up his manhood and now lives in a colony of eunuchs and hands out pamphlets in airports.\n\nRedeemer is obviously more expensive than Mother Russia Bleeds and yet simultaneously comes off as emptier and cheaper. Sobaka wanted to make a Blood Dragon and manage to shoehorn in a few 80s action references, although most of them are in the glossary or the names of achievements. But it's evident massive cuts have been made and it feels very much like the budget offering it is. The bizarre, decadent, dingy, Eastern European environment of Mother Russia Bleeds is here replaced by a clean, literally comic book story and military resarch facilities which wouldn't have felt out of place in an older Resident Evil game.\n\nStill, the game looks good and runs basically without a hitch outside of a few sequences, and there's some pleasure to be found for a while in navigating its labyrinth of foes, combining techniques to take them down efficiently, which I understand is what Sobaka was striving to achieve. But it's short, there's virtually nothing to the plot or any of the characters, and you can practically see the scissor marks where the ending boss fight should have been. There's little to no replay value unless you want to find the hidden scrolls or do no-death runs of the stages, and it's honestly not worth the asking price.\n\nRedeemer is not a terrible game if you enjoy brawlers, even if the developers clearly overbudgeted for vodka when working out the financials and had to cut the game down, but wait for a discount, because you just aren't going to get much out of it. If you want dingy, bizarre, and Eastern European, play 'The Underground Man'.\n\nI'm kidding, don't.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502613", "timestamp_created": 1504761578, "recommendationid": "34788532", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "steamid": "76561198088752220", "last_played": 1504759985, "num_games_owned": 319}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505071460, "review": "The game is pretty fun though the amount of different fighting moves is a bit sad, you can do like 3 different combo's and thats about it.

Doesn't have the thing that would make it shine, pretty boring altogether. The combos, if you acknowledge they actually exist because I don't, are as simple as possible and don't really make a difference anyway and the actual fighting feels oh so slow. Weapons don't really have an identity, I don't feel the difference when I'm hitting someone with a machete or a tonfa or a battleaxe. Guns have different sounds and do more or less damage, obviously, but that's as much variation as you'll get. \nThe game does look good to an extent, even though the protagonist looks like he shoved a .50BMG rifle up his ass, but nothing spectacular.
