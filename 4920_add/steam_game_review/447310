At first impressions, the game is fun and enjoyable to play and the crashes are hilarious for a while, but then that is where the positive part of this game ends. As after that point this game becomes more of a frustrating chore than a fun game for the casual gamer. I don't care if this review gets voted down as the truth is not always nice. If you have a high tolerence of patience, then sure buy the game. But for the casual gamer, I would recommend something less frustrating.

I do not hesitate to call the overall design and concept \"brilliant\", and far exceeding the average.\n\nPaper Train: Traffic is a very special game. Special in its simplicity, in its design and concept, in its wonderful anything-but-simply graphics (though simple to understand), and special in the joy of playing such a FUN game. (Oh, yes, VERY special in its wonderfully low price.)\n\nThe premise to Paper Train: Traffic is nothing new, so the learning curve isn't even an issue (except for helping to develop skills.) You have a number of trains crossing the screen. Pretty much all the player can do is stop, then start traffic on specific tracks to avoid collisions (which are quite fun, and not necessarily rage-inducing), or switch tracks on some levels. (Perhaps other things later on.) There are variables to consider, such as trains are of different lengths and travel at varying speeds, f'rinstance. (And did I mention that the trains aren't always the same in every attempt.....) Some of the tracks are very convoluted, and involve many crossings. You are also able to \"boost\" the speed of the entire screen in order to increase points generated, but then aren't close to the \"stop/start\" buttons. Any collisions results in a \"Retry\", while a level completion results in a grade of 1 - 3 stars. As in most games of this type, cummulative star count opens features, and each of 300(!!!) levels must be accessed through completion of prior levels. There is also at least one leaderboard with the option to compare to friends only (and perhaps other choices.)\n\nI haven't played Paper Train: Traffic very long, but I really don't need to to recommend it at this price. My suggestion? Buy it, play it, decide for yourself within the \"refund\" period. I suspect there will be few refunds requested.\n\n(Hopefully more as I have more to report.)\n\nThank you.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546170", "timestamp_created": 1457222376, "recommendationid": "21653779", "language": "english", "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_forever": 1299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 112, "steamid": "76561198140299850", "last_played": 1497108152, "num_games_owned": 1211}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1471791153, "review": "* Launches game in excitement (trains! logistics! woohoo!)\n* Gets easily to level 6\n* Trains crash, failing the level\n* Restarts level and plays the same moves\n* Trains crash again but earlier despite playing the same way\n* Realizes the game is not deterministic but randomized on each run\n* Quits (and probably won't launch the game again)\n\nI really wanted to love this game. Beautiful graphics, and relatively simple UI. But the randomized nature of the level becomes really agonizing in the later levels. There is no way to learn the flow of each level, instead, everything is purely based on reflexes and good observation skill. Which is probably want the designer intended it to be!\n\nBut the biggest problem turned out to be the way to handle multiple stop buttons. The mouse is just not particularly effective when you have to quickly click small rectangles around the screen. This probably works way better on touch screen than with a mouse. When you fail almost completed level just because you misclicked a small button, it really gets to you...\n\nTo emphasize: This is NOT a logistics puzzle game, this is a twitch kind of action game.
