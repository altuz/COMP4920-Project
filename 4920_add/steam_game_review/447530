It's more than you live, it's something to breathe and enjoy. It's like a bad habit.\nAfter a brief lyrical retreat, I'll give you a brief overview of the story.\nHow can you understand. The events of this game unfold in the cyberpunk of the universe. We are offered the opportunity to plunge into this wonderful world of high technology and the decline of mankind, when all the former values \u200b\u200bcreated by man are collapsing under the onslaught and oppression of the robotic universe. Where even the usual \"Beer\" became a rarity. Instead of it, customers have to mix that stuff that everyone used to call beer ... But I know that it's not.\nWe play for a young girl named Jill, who does not have any special talents or skills - she's an ordinary bartender, and in fact that's all she can do. Not only is she buried in taxes, so she drinks and smokes ... But who am I to go into a man's soul? You noticed? I said: \"to the person\", and in fact so it also is. She's a human. Unfortunately, you can not say about the majority of the population of Glitch-City (where our history actually unfolds).\nWe are assigned the role of bartender in the same bar: \"VA-11 HALL-A\". We must create drinks and make destiny, as Jill said. Well, I think I can not see the point anymore. So get this game, and you will not regret the time that it was spent. VA-11 HALL-A - you will be surprised, that's for sure.\nOh, yes, I almost forgot about the evaluation. And the amazing soundtrack forgot to mention, and did not reveal the universe properly, and did not tell about the gameplay itself, did not even reveal the characters... Who cares? After all, everything has long been known.\nMy assessment: 10/10 OMG!\nP.S.: I went to f*ck Jill.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506579", "timestamp_created": 1506998886, "recommendationid": "35433532", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 206, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198345433760", "last_played": 1507125150, "num_games_owned": 66}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505688537, "review": "You get to make anime grills drunk.\n\n\n\nIn All Seriousness, This Is An Extremely Well-Made/Well-Written Game, And I Do Hope For A Sequel.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490559", "timestamp_created": 1505688537, "recommendationid": "35034754", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 85, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198148429331", "last_played": 1506783006, "num_games_owned": 131}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505682202, "review": "10/10 Would mix drinks and change lives again", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500183", "timestamp_created": 1505682202, "recommendationid": "35033135", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198061111943", "last_played": 1498715618, "num_games_owned": 47}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504735240, "review": "interactive visual novel set in a bar with a bunch of people with problems\nmemorable characters funny dialogue\n\n\ngood if you like reading", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1504735240, "recommendationid": "34783939", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 133, "num_reviews": 54, "steamid": "76561198041976377", "last_played": 1506450219, "num_games_owned": 180}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504757938, "review": "This is the first visual novel I have played.

Jill works in a bar, mixing drinks for customers, listens to their stories, and of course, earns some cash, like an adult.\n\nThe gameplay itself is really simple, you listen to each character, make them a drink, and read some more dialog, nothing more, because it doesn't need anything more than that. As Jill said: \"Time to mix drinks and change lives\". You are the bartender, you make drinks, nothing more(of course you'll chat with customers, but there won't be any dialog to choose, everything's filled for you). Basically, all you have to do is to make a drink for your customers, depending on what they want.\nTo some people it will get repetitive quickly, yeah, sure, but if you decided to buy it, you are probably buying this game for its story, which is quite beautiful(so far, as I'm still playing it now).\n\nThe setting of the story is somewhat pretty, a dystopian city, and you're just a fellow citizen living your live, meeting different strangers every night, and everyone has their own story, and their stories are remarkable, I mean, I'm those who will forget a character's existence fast, but not this time, when a new character appears, I can remember them easily, even if my memory slipped a bit, I can still recall it. And during the interaction between Jill and customers, it's quite real, and it's like you are part of the story, rather than just a bystander, or just some self insert stuff.\nAlso there're some memes or jokes and stuff in the dialog, well it's kinda funny, it's a plus I think.\n\nNow I wanna talk about Jill specifically. Maybe because I'm assuming the role of her, I like this character so much. However there's more reason behind that. Being the female protagonist, Jill isn't really the usual \"cheering\" waifu even she can change people's lives with her drinks, she's more like a calm, and with some sarcasm within her. And then I realized she's somewhat like me, like, I can relate to her. If she was real I believe we'd be smoking and drinking together, and sharing stories.\n\nOverall a really really great game.
