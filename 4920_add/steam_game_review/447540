The foundations of a good game are there, but it just falls so flat. Given the nature of these problems, I might pick this game up again if it gets updated to fix these problems.\n\nThe biggest issue is that it's a buggy mess. There's this bizaare glitch where your gun fires when your NOT holding down the fire button. This would be fine, just let go when you want to fire, but it fires at random. There have been huge gaps where the lil' guy wouldn't fire his gun when being swarmed by bats. There is also a bug where if you try to jump while a ladder is underneath you, you will instead hop off the ladder. Given how many ladders there are and how much you need to jump, this is a huge problem. \n\nBy far the worst bug is not being able to pick up the space ship part. You're supposed to press F, but it did nothing. I thought it might be an error with key mapping, so I pressed every single button on the keyboard; I got nothing. (This is how I found out that 9 can be used to jump. Wierd)\n\nAs long as I'm listing bugs, I found an exploit that involves you turning around when facing a wall. Because you move backwards slightly when you do this, you can clip into the wall and shimmy down to the lower level. I thought it was fun.\n\nAside from the bugs, I don't like the text. The maker literally used the logo text for everything. It's unnecessarily hard to read for things like menu text and descriptions. The creator should have toned it down a lot or used a normal font.\n\nAs for *positives,* it's fun to move around and shoot, and it's satisfying to kill enemies. Music's alright, fits well. I like the *prospect* of unlocking new characters, but that's unfortunately not possible with the aforementioned ship part bug not letting me progress.\n\nI would love to play this game as a finished product, but the bugs REALLY need to be ironed out. I hope Charlie Evans reads this, because I'm hoping for a big patch,", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529051", "timestamp_created": 1459038661, "recommendationid": "22074744", "language": "english", "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": "8", "author": {"playtime_forever": 1, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198115386359", "last_played": 1459036856, "num_games_owned": 35}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 17, "timestamp_updated": 1459052903, "review": "Do not get it it dosen't work most the time you cannot shoot sometimes you cannot use the thing to get the next level it is pointless i would love to see some patches and some glitches fixed and then maybe change it a little from risk of rain go check out risk of rain if your looking for an non buggy game", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.354209", "timestamp_created": 1458985632, "recommendationid": "22059879", "language": "english", "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": "8", "author": {"playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "steamid": "76561198064698588", "last_played": 1458985279, "num_games_owned": 133}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 110}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
