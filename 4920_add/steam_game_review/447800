Early in the game you find your long lost mother from the former game, but she can't be free until you save the kingdom from a curse.  The gameplay is the same.  You run and jump like a platformer and the mouse drag creates wind to help your character reach higher places.  Eventually, the wind power receives upgrades to be able to have whirlwinds, the ability to blow fire, and much much more.  There is one new power that is offered in this game that was not offered in the previous game.  The addition of seasons also really drastically changes the gameplay as water that once could be swam through is no longer swimmable when it's a block of ice.\n\nThe story takes a backseat to the metroidvania like gameplay as you seek out treasures, new skills, and answers to the curse you are trying to solve.  There is a lot of back and forth, and this time the puzzles and monsters are a bit tougher.  I enjoyed it, it's very kid friendly as far as graphics, sound, and basic gameplay, but the wind function may leave them very frustrated as it's not always intuitive and simple.  Some areas may take a few trial and error moments rather than being automatically successful.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the series if you're all able to deal with the kid friendly atmosphere and the not too serious or difficult gameplay.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500069", "timestamp_created": 1505673302, "recommendationid": "35030312", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 200, "steamid": "76561198002506911", "last_played": 1505672971, "num_games_owned": 2805}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 18, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 16, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
