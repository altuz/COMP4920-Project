SO much better than rising storm 2, if you care about that.\nthe games hosts many types of maps, from the beaches of normandy, to the tight corridors and urban warfare of the greek city of crete, to the freezing cold and snowy fighting of bastogne.\na big part of the game is the gore, which is pretty visceral. after an artillery strike wipes out a team, survivors can walk around in the aftermath to limbs and torsos strewn around the area. you can turn it off in the setttings (ALTHOUGH I THINK IT MAY BE OFF BY DEFAULT???)\nthere's also a suppression system. when being shot a lot, your vision blurs greatly , making it hard to see.\nthere are 4 main multiplayer gamemodes, as well as a few coop modes where 8 players fight against AI. i don't know much about coop since i never play it, but i've heard the AI is really good and it's a lot of fun!\ninvasion- to me, this is the premier game mode and the best one hands down. 30 waves for the defenders, and 15 waves for the attackers. attackers have to capture every objective to reveal the location of the communications building, and they have to destroy the radios inside. once the attackers capture the objective to reveal this communication system, the defenders waves will go down to 0, regardless of how many waves they had.\nfrontlines- 5 waves for both teams and both teams need to capture every objective in the map. they both start with two objectives, and must meet at the middle objective to fight. every time an objective is captured, it gives the team an extra wave. the last objective for both teams is a radio system in a building, and whatever team destroys it first, wins.\nliberation- 5 waves each, both teams start with no objectives captured. capturing an objective gives your team another wave. if a team holds all 3 objectives at the same time, they win.\noffensive- like a mini version of invasion. attackers start with 5 waves, defenders start with 15 waves. attackers have to make it to the defenders communications building and destroy the radios to win. the catch to this game mode is that the defenders need to send one person back to their spawn area to regroup and let everyone spawn in. if someone doesn't do this for a substantial amount of time, everyone will respawn automatically.\nthere's a class based system that works really well. every class feels completely different. it's supplemented by the loadout supply system. you start out with 10 supply and are able to allot it however you want (more attachments on your gun instead of utility like smoke or grenades, etc etc). by securing an objective, you get 2 supply and every 5 kills you will get 1 supply.\nofficer- one of the few classes able to wield an SMG, able to call in different kinds of artillery/air support depending on the faction. all 3 factions can call in artillery barrage which completely devastates a large area with multiple shells over a small period of time. then there's carpet bombing which calls in a plane that drops multiple bombs really quickly in a smaller area. you can also call in smoke barrage, which lets you place large amounts of smoke cover on an area. the last universal support is supply drop, which drops a supply crate for healing and ammo. the commonwealth has access to a typhoon strike, which is a surgical rocket strike into a really specific area. they also have access to an incendiary barrage, which drops in the same way as a smoke barrage, but instead of smoke, the shells contain white phosphorus that provides cover as well as burns the opposition. the americans have access to a surgical gun run, that sends multiple planes to strafe a small area with armor piercing rounds that easily cut through buildings and cover. finally, the germans have access to the stuka dive bomber, which calls in a stuka plane to drop one bunker busting bomb that penetrates any sort of cover.\nradioman- the radioman is as essential to winning the game as an officer is. without a radioman, the officer can't make any calls. the radioman usually has access to exclusive semi automatic rifle that no other class can use (m1 carbine for americans, gewehr for germans, and the ithaca shotgun for commonwealth, although the assault can also use the shotgun.) the radioman just has to hang out with the officer to be used for calls, so staying alive is a huge priority. if somehow your radio gets shot and you don't die, you'll need to resupply at a crate to get a new one.\nrifleman- standard class, germans and commonwealth get a bolt action rifle (kar98 and lee-enfield) while the americans get the semi automatic m1 garand. the german variant of this class is called the grenadier, which gets access to 2 grenades at the start instead of 1.\nassault- access to smgs, as well as a shotgun on the commonwealth side. able to run faster than every other class, which makes him extremely useful for rushing objectives. a lot of people don't realize this, but you can actually put a radio on your back as an assault which lets you be a radioman, while still being able to keep your assault speed and weapons. i do this all the time with my girlfriend since she loves the guns on the assault class.\nsupport- guns usually have low amount of ammo in clips, but are powerful and penetrate through pretty much anything. their guns consists of light machine guns like the FG42 and M1918 BAR.\nengineer- access to bolt action rifles and smgs (FOR 5 SUPPLY, WHICH IS A LOT FOR A GUN CONSIDERING THE SHIT THE ENGINEER HAS TO CARRY). the engineer is the only class that gets to use special explosives like rocket launchers, incendiary launchers and TNT. these explosives are essential to opening up shortcuts marked by walls that look cracked and about to collapse. these shortcuts are essential to capturing some points.\nmachine gunner- commonwealth has access to the vickers, americans have the browning 30 cal, and the germans have the mg42. these guns are heavy machine guns that can not be shot from down the sights. it's recoil is crazy when you try to hipfire it, and you'll seldom hit anything. the point is to find a location where you can hunker down and deploy your bipod. the machine gun penetrates the most out of any gun in the game, and when deployed on its bipod, it's recoil is manageable and it shoots directly where you aim it, like a deadly laser beam. really useful for suppressing the enemy team as well as flushing out buildings.\nsniper- every game's gotta have one! equipped with bolt actions rifles and a 4x scope/7x scope depending on what you want. obviously good for long range.\nflamethrower- i don't have too much playtime on the flamethrower 'cause i suck at using it, but it's really good at flushing out enemies from buildings.

This game is simply.. fantastisch camarade!\n\n\n\nRemember these very old \"Medal Of Honor\" games you used to play back in the early 2000? Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory?\n\nBack when gaming, the art of making an actual good game was still a thing? A cared products? \n\nBack then before all of the nasty, money greedy corporation fucktards, busyness mans and their nasty decisions to please the mass for the only sake, the only quest of making a shit tons of money?\n\nRemember that era when games were made by gamers? For the gamers? \n\nBack when it was made for you to play & have fun for.. an extended period of time? Not just made to be merely enjoyable for only some weeks, months, until you forget it forever...  \n\nJust, just so that they can shove you their next title up the throat, into an infinite loop of pure smelly shit? \n\nBack when games would actually define their generation! Mark the minds for years! To give you an actual experience? To give you pleasure and a nostalgic feeling to come one day.\n\nRemember that time?\n\n\n\nWell friends.. This game picture perfectly the vibe I had when I was a kid playing these amazing, fun video games which actually introduced me, a lot of us to FPS.\n\nIt is a very unique product, a very well made, fun game, which you can actually feel is being cared about, built for extended pleasure.\n\nNow for you, dear readers, which might been enough lucky to be born in the right generation, this game feels like a very good mix of the early \"Medal Of Honor\" and our almighty, beloved \"Return To Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory\"!\n\n\n\n\nNow this game is definitely not your usual, casual game. \n\nSo for that reason, I wouldn't not recommend it for the \"Casuals\" gamers, or more precisely, the impatient players. \n\nAlthough the game can be quite fast paced on some occasions, you'll need to be abit patient, use strategies in some others, have good judgents, momentum to do what is right on a given situation.\n\nBut I highly recommend it to the true, and the old school gamers.\n\nIt is not a game I personally see fitting for the mass at all, which are much, too much accustomed nowaday to all of the.. ''modern'' pieces of garbages, so called \"games\" we have seen since the last..  Maybe 10 years.\n\nDon't expect to go all \"CS: GO\" in that game, you'll get destroyed, ragequit, might spit a bit in both the chat, and the steam review before leaving. \n\n\n\n\nI see alot of crying, complains concerning the ''Hitbox''. \n\nCrying that the hitbox suck, that the game suck... While in reality, you just can't aim for shit and take the right decisions, son.\n\n\nNow i'd like to add concerning the \"Hitbox\", if you can aim, it work 90-100%% of the time.\n\nThe only moment I'd consider the \"Hitbox\" to be tricky, is that alot of time, against prone targets on long distance, the shots might get very tricky to land properly! \n\nAnother cause would of course be of ping issues, which can play a great role into a game into which you need to be so precise to kill an enemy.\n\nBut again, if you can aim, it will work.\n\nI myself had some trouble early, until I adjusted my mouse sensitivity properly and got accoustumed to precisely aim on my targets, after that I now top the scoreboard most of the time.\n\nSo make sure that you play with the settings abit to find the right, optimal setup for you.\n\n\n\nThis is a game of team play.\n\nI'd even go has far to say it's very close to a War Simulation type of game. \n\n( I salute you ARMA players, you should like this...) \n\nAlthough now that I think about that twice, DOI is actually incredibly more fast paced of a game in comparison to ARMA, considering the map size.\n\nBut you'll need to be clever, patient, swift, while remaining precise! You'll need to take proper decisions. \n\nSometimes you might even have to go prone and advance slowly toward the enemy front line, while laying down, slowly... For 2/3/5minutes? \n\nAnd all that.. Just to get killed? \n\nOr to actually kill couples, to all of the enemy threats! \n\nBreak their defences, frontlines, which will give your team the edge, the opportunity to push and capture a given location.\n\nIn some situations it can be a more clever of a decision to do that, than to run in the middle of the field just to get killed, death after death... But you know, the total reverse situation can also be true.\n\nBut I'm drifting away, so let's get back to the review!\n\n\n\n\n-The maps are all generally well balanced, well thoughts, very fun, I actually like all of them! \n\nI especially like the snowy types of maps, their color palette, their vibes... Remind me alot of the old WW games I used to play when I was kid.\n\nBut be aware that some players tend to spam the same maps, which personally can get on my nerves. ( Cr\u00e8te, Br\u00e9ville, Dunkerk )\n\nThe Devs are also still updating and adding more maps right now as I write this review.\n\n\n\n-There's also a lot of cool success to make around, which also give in-game rewards! \n\nSuch as different melee weapons, knives, trench tools, axes, different rifles wood skins, cloth wrap, all to show your prowess, skills, achievements of how of a fearsome soldier you are.\n\n\n\n-There is also a good, long lasting leveling system which can make you unlock different army units, with each different rarity has you level up! \n\nBut you can also just buy them via the shop if you want, but I feel it then make the leveling pointless, so if you want a more, longer lasting fun, don't buy them! \n\n(  I feel like an asshole saying this though, because this game is really amazing, incredible for the dirt cheap price they sell it for all of our fun... The best FPS I played since longer than I can remember.\n\nThey deserve much more than 20$ for such an amazing product! So I kind of feel like a bloody asshole promoting you guys to not buy their in-game units skins. \n\nBut! You can be always be a cool, good fellow and recommend this piece of art to all of your friends, family and even to your little sister.\n\nLol, seriously. )\n\n\n\n-Another interesting feature is that the game is designed around an authentic voices system, for every nations! \n\nSo American nation speak like Americans.\n\nBritishs got their very distinctive accents, and their funny expressions. \n\nWhile the Germans actually speak German! Its not like English with a German accent, If you know what I mean! Good way to learn abit of the German tongue.   \n\nAnother interesting feature is that the Mic.Chat, can be heard across the whole team! ( Nothing special).\n\nBut it can also be heard by enemies, if they get couple of meters nearby! It can be used to lure enemies, or to taunt your nearby killed prays after killing them.\n\nI've have had some very funny moments I'll remember for a longtime from using the mic with enemies by both of these ways, I thought it was a cool feature worth letting you folks know about.   \n\n\n\n\nSo.. yeah!
