Due to its (supposedly) very brief playtime, lack of any kind of save option, and its rapidly declining quality from start to finish, I have gone from being initially super interested in what this game was presenting to not even wanting to bother completing it and finding it hard to recommend to others. \n\nAlthough \"Walking Simulator\" isn't in the game's description or tags, that is how I would categorize this game. At first I was stoked to be playing this game with its \"trippy\" / surreal / ominous / abstract / hallucinatory environments and effects, but it quickly became obvious the game was going to provide very little beyond the most mundane of puzzles.  \n\nThe game is surreal at times and can have strange, immersive effects. Unfortunately they seem to become more sparse and cheap as the game goes on, from strange alternate dimensions in an apartment building to very bland 'cube-looking' / generic puzzles.\n\nI will briefly describe 3  (ofr the maybe 6?) subsequent environments the player encounters. The first section I began to feel like the game was bogus included a very obnoxious \"screen-wobbling\" / \"disoriented\" effect which didn't relent until the player had finished a puzzle which consisted of simply pressing E on some shapes until the player rotated them to be parallel to some black shapes in another area. The next area consists of walking up a generic-looking, winding staircase, which is little more than just some blocks leading around in a spiral until you get to the top, all the while with strange metal-creaking sound effects taking place. As you ascend the staircase, you're supposed to push a few buttons / screens on your way up which makes water begin to fill the bottom of this area and you must walk your way up the stairs (there is no sprint, only your one plodding pace) before it fills up all the way or you happen to fall off and start again at the bottom of this bland room. The 3rd section (immediately after the previous \"water\" section) includes more 'restart-forcing' water in a similar spiral type layout, where if the player slips off at all they start the section over again. At the center of this spiral however are 12 rune-like devices the player must then go up to and press E to rotate to match a display at the start of the area. Sure, I guess 'pressing the interact button to rotate Icon ABCDEFGHIJKL and making sure they match the image / display at the front of the area' is a \"puzzle\" and all but why make the player do it 12 times over and over instead of just a handful when none of them bring anything new to the table? \n\nUnfortunately and perhaps game-breakingly to some degree, it appears according to the forums there is no save system, which seems to plague many other walking simulators, forcing the player to restart long segments if you happen to turn the game off before you've completed its brief play time.\n\nMost of the puzzles in the game are little more than \"looking at some graphic that shows the pattern / sequence you need to walk over to and input at a separate station by sitting there and holding E until it rotates to the proper one to match the graphic\" You could have an equal amount of fun bashing your stereo until it emits some kind of shrill static or warbling noise, buying a combination lock, and rotating its numbers a few times to unlock it.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511855", "timestamp_created": 1498340987, "recommendationid": "32744875", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "last_played": 1499406412, "num_games_owned": 800}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 6, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
