At least Xbox360 pad was detected and working.\n\nFlash Grade racer involving miniature cars. Does not fullscreen correctly. Play area looks like centered 640x480 at best. Sound effects and sprites look firmly underpar. Game features a score attack or a time attack but the two objectives dont blend together very well as drifting means you are usually taking longer to finish. When I tried to exit I got stuck in the menus and had to force close process.
