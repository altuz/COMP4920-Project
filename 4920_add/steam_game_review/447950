Although upon exiting the game, I have fornd that the BadCatepillar.exe sometimes stays hooked, and keeps running in Windows 10 64bit. Get that fixed with an update an the game will be what it should. Task Manager is not what you should have to use in order for the executable to unhook upon quitting. \nOverall a great retro game. I would love to see \"Joust\" become one of the great returns.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515715", "timestamp_created": 1492803683, "recommendationid": "31282012", "language": "english", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561197972753004", "last_played": 1492801412, "num_games_owned": 324}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496220459, "review": "Like Centipede but bad.\nNot bad meaning bad\nbut bad meaning good.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495718", "timestamp_created": 1496220459, "recommendationid": "32080918", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 268, "steamid": "76561198188515021", "last_played": 1482311399, "num_games_owned": 1196}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 14, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 14, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0}}
