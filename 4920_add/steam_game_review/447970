I know games are very hard to make and I feel a lot of effort was put into this one. There are plenty of positives in the game. The sound track is really good, some of the tunes even got stuck in my head. There are plenty of power-ups and ship upgrades, they are all very fun, and all of them could be the diffrence between winning and losing. And there are good attempts at variation, like the levels where you focus on dodging enemies instead of shooting.\n\nBut it has problems. The scrolling is far too slow. While many of the power-ups and enemies are made for this speed, it makes the pacing of the game feel too slow. I also don't like the controls. You move with the mouse and it doesn't feel right to me. Like i'm not moving a ship but moving a cursor, and this also makes narrow paths hard since even a small hand jolt can be fatal. This leads to another problem though. The hit boxes on the \"white platforms\" are sometimes off. I would destroy them and empty spaces would still kill me. I think there are amazing idea's here and the developer got many things right. But this is hard to recommend as these weaknesses kept me from enjoying the game.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504219", "timestamp_created": 1499786776, "recommendationid": "33458341", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "steamid": "76561198194763051", "last_played": 1499786284, "num_games_owned": 154}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500204496, "review": "Envoy\nfast game with modern day graphics with easy controls that moves from location A to B to C and so on, \ngood amount of action and special effects, \n\ngood game.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502498", "timestamp_created": 1500204496, "recommendationid": "33582726", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 340, "steamid": "76561198113014119", "last_played": 1500203962, "num_games_owned": 519}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 11, "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 8, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
