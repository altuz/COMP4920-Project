Each character, for example, may either parry and attack or kick an enemy away. The \"dashes\" also vary in a variety of offensive or evasive designs.\n\nMatches are fast pased with one hit kills and fast movement speeds. The game has a SamuraiGunn or Towerfall vibe in that sense, although the game has much more of a traditional arena brawler design.\n\nDespite fast movement many attacks are a little slugish to execute. While this doesn't damage the experience so much it does, sometimes, feel a bit counterintuitive - although this may become more natural as I play more.\n\nUltimately Blast Brawl 2 is pretty tight for an early access. The only real issues are poor default key bindings for controllers, and an unattractive menu screens, not huge issues.\n\nDeffinately worth a purchase if this is your type of game.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510391", "timestamp_created": 1477658672, "recommendationid": "26265835", "language": "english", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "steamid": "76561198085189433", "last_played": 1478248153, "num_games_owned": 491}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1477925131, "review": "Really like the game, still in early access so I cant give a final note, but it is on the way to a solid 10/10\n\npros\n\n- The music/sound\n- The style of the game fits pretty well\n- Really good tutorial, not too annoying or complicated\n- characters play totally different\n- suprisingly high amount of variating enemies\n- different mods with different possibilities \n- one of the few really playable games while being early access\n\n\n\n\nrecommendations\n\n- story mode would be really perfect, the style of the game would let a lot of variations for the story mode and give it some more longtime motivation(like finding stuff for characters or unlock characters on different difficulties) which it seems to lack at the moment\n- just buying the characters is ok, but, in my opinion, a little blunt, it would be way better to get them through different kind of achievments, for example: reach wave X on some map, finding the character while playing story mode, killing 50 enemies in a row without dying, etc. (similar to games like Risk of Rain) \n- parying melee attacks isn that good, maybe it could stun for a short duration aswell, but then again maybe I am too noob and cant use it usefully\n\n\nAll in all I totally [spoiler]recommend[/spoiler] the game though!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502192", "timestamp_created": 1477921596, "recommendationid": "26336259", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197995394318", "last_played": 1488830510, "num_games_owned": 151}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486902623, "review": "Very good addictive game. This game is great with a couple of friends on the sofa. Fast paced and lots of fun. The charactors work very differently from each other which gives lots of aspects to the way you play the game.

I believe this mode would really make the game complete and give you a more focused goal to play alone or with friends.\nOveral very enjoyable and addictive gameplay.
