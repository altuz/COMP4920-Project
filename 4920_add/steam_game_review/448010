Basically, you can record a copy of yourself doing stuff, and then cooperate with your recording to solve the puzzle. The recording time is limited to something around 20 seconds, and the recording also doesn't loop (unlike in Misadventures of Winterbottom).\n\nThe Good:\n- low price\n- 64 levels, and they do get pretty difficult after about level 22\n\nThe So-so:\n- very early puzzles start to rely on precise timing. I know there are people who like finger dexterity contests (e.g. fans of Meatboy) but I'm a kind of player who wants to simply figure out how the puzzle should be solved and not spend next 15 minutes torturing myself with precise execution. But that's really a matter of taste or age (I'm 34).\n\nThe Bad:\n- annoying music which resembles that in NES games from the 80s, I had to turn music off after a few minutes\n- can't re-map keys. I kept pressing Space to jump because of my habit from other games, but space actually records your clone..\n- the graphics are pretty bland, almost amateurish - nothing comparable to the gorgeous visuals of Misadventures of Winterbottom, for example. Even in this quasi-8 bit style some decorative elements would help liven the scenery a bit.\n\nConclusion: buy it if you are really into time-travel stuff (like myself), tried the other games I mentioned and still want more.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503420", "timestamp_created": 1460314166, "recommendationid": "22345130", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "steamid": "76561198071531076", "last_played": 1460470209, "num_games_owned": 44}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1458029408, "review": "This is an extremely fun game that offers unique puzzle platforming mechanics.
