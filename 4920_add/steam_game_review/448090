Not even WASD keys? ENTER is not working?\" Needs more user-friendliness.\n\u2022 First few seconds in the game settings menu: \"Wtf is Angling? No descriptions?\" Well at least the character does have one. \n\u2022 Warning messages (such as those that appear when picking up upgrades) disappear quickly.\n\u2022 No panels for texts? It hurts my eyes.\n\u2022 Some texts go through the edge of the screen, making it impossible to be read.\n\nGameplay review:\n\u2022 Pressed Tab and the game glitched and froze in a white screen. Happened twice. Stopped playing after the second one.\n\u2022 The limit in shooting at certain directions is kind of weird for a shooter game. I mean, we aren't in the 90's anymore. The angled shot concept is interesting, but I still disagree with having to shoot at 4 directions only.\n\nDesign review:\n\u2022 Main menu seems to give a sad feeling despite the cheery music in the background.\n\u2022 Some sprites look cute. Some... Look weird.\n\u2022 Some sprites blend in badly with the tileset.\n\u2022 Music is okay, but it loops and after a few good loops it's kinda boring to listen to.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1483223208, "recommendationid": "28883774", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561198065064203", "last_played": 1483223217, "num_games_owned": 55}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1460407782, "review": "Man this game is fun as hell but could use a layer or two of polish.

Virtual rougue is a twinstick shooter, where you play as note, a notebook inspired character. Honestly it lost me there. This game is a binding of isaac clone, but very much worse. The graphics aren't pretty, the menus are clunky, the tutorial is useless, and so much more. \n\nThe gameplay\n\nIn Virtual rogue, you have a laser gun with which you shoot enemies with. The enemy pool is tiny with only about six in the first few levels. All characters in the game are computer inspired e.g a calculator or a folder. The enemies are a mixed bunch with some being stupidly easy to defeat and some being much harder. The game has the difficulty of binding of isaac but with no learning curve. \n\n\nThe rest.\n\nThe game has randomly generated floors, which are terribly generated making multiple useless sections on the map. There are a few other characters that are unlockable but honestly, the game isn't fun enough to make it worthwhile unlocking them. The tutorial is TERRIBLE, it's just white text on your screen. \n\nConclusion.\n\nVirtual rogue is not worth buying unless you want it for the cards or to just simply own it to up that total games number. It's a binding of isaac clone that isn't fun to play.\n\nTL;DR\nBinding of isaac clone, terrible.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491992", "timestamp_created": 1473149959, "recommendationid": "25377221", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198076154141", "last_played": 1473149456, "num_games_owned": 303}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 10}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1481167211, "review": "Summary:\n>BORING\n>stupidly overcomplicated game mechanic(floppy disk, active/passive ability items)\n>not worth $3\n>id rather get a sawed-off rustcoat named \"tetanus shot\"\n>interesting concept\n>BORING\n>might get better at later levels mabye\n>kinda like binding of issac\n>but with backwards ass design and control\n>not a pickup and play game\n>i didnt play much so my opiion might be worth shit\n>except the 3 dollars, its not worth it\n>and the rust coat sawed-off\n>and it being BORING\n>BORING\n>very frozenland(haha reference)", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488185", "timestamp_created": 1481167211, "recommendationid": "28246782", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198243448906", "last_played": 1474222665, "num_games_owned": 23}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 7}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1473506695, "review": "As embarrassed as I am to request a refund for 69p I felt it was required on this item.\n\nThe premise is great, the graphic style is awesome, it has everything going for it.... but the gameplay.\n\nAnd for a twinstick shooter that is kind of essential.
