Although with an early access game there are going to bug, but this has little effect on the game play. \n\nFirstly I am going to talk about the character it's self. The character is obviously French, and not to mention that you need to drink wine to heal, which is also a big giveaway as to where the character is from, and if it wasn't enough the first cut scene is set in a somewhat of a look a like to Paris. \n\nSecondly I would like to talk about \"Minion\" the little character who follows you about as your travel to other planets/worlds. In my opinion in a game like this it is always good to have a character who follows you about. I'm going to use another game as an example to also describe this. So, for example take Portal 2 where you have the side character \"Wheatley\" following you about for most of the start of the game, until he takes control of GLaDOS body. Anyways getting back to this game, Minion is a really fun, but sometimes annoying side character. Although, and this is a big factor of the game. Minion is a loveable a character, but I need to get used to him as a character.  \n\nThridly there is bad things about this game, but these aren't major problems, and will be fixed easily. The main one is the controls always reset everytime you go into to check them, and hopefully this will be fixed by the next update. Yes, the game is in early alpha, but apart from the one problem the game is perfect right now. \n\nNow we're getting to the gameplay, and firstly the world revolve is amazing. By this I mean as you walk the world will spin round, and I really enjoy this aspect. I also enjoy the flight to each different planets, and the world designs are amazing themselves, but the ship is greatly detailed. Although the graphics are kinda similar to \"Don't starve\", but let's not get into that. The dev's have done amazing work to the game, and that shouldn't be taken away from them. \n\nFinally as a whole I would recommend you go out, and buy this game. Before it goes off sale, and the game is also pretty easy to get achievements on, and the game also get's harder as you progress through the game, and it deserves a lot of support from the steam community.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472812", "timestamp_created": 1461605131, "recommendationid": "22633314", "language": "english", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561198076069623", "last_played": 1461547879, "num_games_owned": 223}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1461606699, "review": "9/10 \u2013 Travel space with your alien pal! \n\n[b] Not much of a reader? Watch my gameplay! [/b]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVEbiwKGBXk\n\nSo Long Earth is a beautiful adventure game about a guy named Dominique traveling across the universe alongside his alien pal who I've named Timmy. The first thing you'll see is his girlfriend dumping him and throwing him a bottle of wine because he'll surely \"need\" it. Turns out that you do need the wine because it'll numb the pain away - I mean, it's like your healing potion. \n\nYou'll get to ride an awesome spaceship in which you could also use to rub against (or mine) asteroids. In this game, you collect coins to buy more maps to progress. You could also buy wine and other things. It also includes some puzzles, which is always fun to figure out. \n\nWhile you travel from map to map, you'll encounter some enemies so prepare to kick butt before they kick yours!  \n\nThe game art is similar to Don't Starve and Don't Starve together, which is what the developer was going for. I've read (on his twitter) that the game art is inspired by those games. \n\nNonetheless, this game is fun to play and is definitely worth trying it out.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495982", "timestamp_created": 1461606699, "recommendationid": "22633728", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198145577378", "last_played": 1481889867, "num_games_owned": 352}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501158914, "review": "I just throw objectivity out of window completely; so be prepared for unpleasant ranting or you can just scroll away and hit that dislike button ;)\n\nLike probably everyone else who saw images of [i]So Long Earth[/i], I thought it is distant cousin or side project from[url=https://www.kleientertainment.com/] Klei[/url]. To my surprise it wasn't at all, and I thought cool - love the aesthetic, like the idea - it looks pretty good to me. There was no doubt I want to play this game, and with \u00a30.99 price tag on sale, it was no-brainer.\n\nI had my expectations. Not biggest one to be honest, but I was bracing myself for lovely couple of hours. \nI saw in this game something from [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/219740/]Don't Starve[/url] obviously, [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/293240/]Cosmochoria[/url], from image in menu I was hit by personality, music started really nicely ... I was so convinced, I will like this. \n\nWell, I didn't at all.\n\nFrom moment when I started to play, everything in this game felt kinda uncooked and highly unintuitive, which led me on path of frustration ... I took that road once again, ffs. \nControls are horrible. Don't know about controller, but with keyboard it felt unresponsive, delayed, and something like this should be on point in platformer like games (right?). You won't get any explanations how things work, just some little ghost hanging around you, for no apparent reason. UI is just baaaaaaad. \nUnintuitive, everything about this game is like that - [u]UNINTUITIVE[/u].\n\nThere is also a strong identity crisis going on. Because I wasn't entirely sure, what I am playing. Is this about space exploration, survival, story driven, puzzle-platformer - so much things happening, and none of them at the same time.\nNothing to hold on. Nothing to get hooked on. What a shame. Just pick something and run with it.\n\nVisually it is really pretty, I dig this look. Planets alone seems nice, distinctive; habitants on them as well no matter how cheap they look and interact. But it just a facade - like pretty girl with cold heart and no brain. I can't wrapped my mind around how some people have more then two hours in. I have to be such a delicate idiotic flower, when I can't and don't want to handle more.\n\nI feel that [i]So Long Earth[/i] could do so much better. There is so much potential to move forward. With inspiration from other games is possible to build something unique and enjoyable, and not be looked upon as a copy. Potential to create much more pleasant gaming experience. Potential to create basic structure that would be strong enough to keep me playing for hours despite the lacklustre features. If the core would be stronger, then I would be happier spending my time with [i]So Long Earth[/i]. In this current shape and form - no at all.\n\n[i]Grade:[/i][b] D-[/b]\n\nP.S. I was caught off guard, when some mysterious person showed up, after my first death. I don't get it, why this was chosen as story device, or whatever you want to call it. If someone is Tim Burton fan, there could be other things to introduce something new. Also it would help, not to be compared to certain tittle I already mentioned.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505370", "timestamp_created": 1483544905, "recommendationid": "29009570", "language": "english", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "steamid": "76561198094221272", "last_played": 1483539612, "num_games_owned": 1343}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 7}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1461772232, "review": "This game has a lot of great artwork in it, a lovely story and great music.\nthe developers obviously put a lot of work and effort into creating the characters and the world around it with a lot of passion for what they were doing.
