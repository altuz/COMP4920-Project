SERIOUSLY!\n\ndevs, listen, and listen closely.\n\nyou wouldn't PAY for this \"game\" you wouldn't even entertain it as a free to play title.\n\ni get what you're doing. 10 minutes in and i couldn't bare it no longer.\n\nconstant flickering, horrid user interface, ZERO collision detection and the controls are a little too loose.\n\nhere, for your next update, do these few things, and the game will improve, i promise.\n\n1. fix the horrendous GAMMA exposure. when you're in space, WHITE is not the surrounding colour. niether is GREY.\n2. tidy up, manage and reconfigure your User Interface. going through menus leaves me feeling queezy, constant jarring of random things flickering in and out. i honestly had to quickly peek at what i was doing (for example changing my user name) and look away while doing it.\n3. triple and quadruple check each and every object that should have a collision, ACTUALLY HAS COLLISION.\n4. check again, for collisions.\nhave an active defence or at least some kind of manual defence against whatever was shooting me... flying saucer?\n5. after improving / fixing/ correcting the visuals, i suggest you fix whatever it is that is flickering constantly disrupting the gameplay.\n6. make this game FREE for alpha / early access, give back the money to whoever was unlucky enough to buy this.\n\ni truly understand how hard it is to make a game, that is why my games (however much better looking and controlled) have never been for public consumption, never mind for a price.\n\nus PC gamers don't have high resolution monitors with high white black balance to be greeted by GREY, UNOPTIMISED gameplay.\n\ni'm not asking or telling you to make better animations, better weapons and usages, i'm telling you the basics of what a game needs. the premise is very exciting, the product is not.\n\ni test.\n\nit's what  i do, i like testing and i like finding bugs. the latest hitman game, i tested that in alpha, found numerous bugs and ugly animations and a hell of a lot more screw ups than a game of that calabre should have. i reported near 80 mistakes and apparently the finished game no longer has them. imagine how many more mistakes there were.\n\ni'm bug reporting on my review because everyone needs to know what they are buying.\n\ni don't care about the price, the fact is, you think it's worth something and it's worth nothing. at best it's johnnys picture on the fridge... it should be taken down soon and forgotten.\n\nthere is no cockpit view like you show, just a FPS version of what's in the third person perspective with no cockpit.\n\ni admire the task you have taken upon yourselves. but you need to be told, since you think it's worth something. it's a terrible game for what i have played.\n\ngetting any online game to work is already a thumbs up... i don't play online games though, they're not my cup of tea. i don't know if it's balanced or even playable. i do know the single player is bad enough for me to tell you how bad it is.\n\nclean up those points, make the game more friendly to the eyes and menu operation including whatever was happening with the \"upgrade\" menu... i was pressing \"6\" forever until i thought it could be a \"g\" and even then, couldn't make any \"upgrades\".\n\nwhat i've mentioned should only be tweaks and fixes..... you have made a mistake and you need to be told.\n\nselling this game is a joke.\n\nthe gimmick, right now, can pass off as something for a child to play. or something a child made. but even then, it's not worth a penny. i look forward to a fix to these issues. i have no idea how many more there are, but the ones i've seen make it horrific. it's a good job i'm not epileptic! i am deadly serious.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508760", "timestamp_created": 1462229178, "recommendationid": "22769334", "language": "english", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198024120645", "last_played": 1462227740, "num_games_owned": 268}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1458406108, "review": "This game is just horrible.

Welcome to AsteroidsHD!  This is an early access rock and enemy ship blasting game that is worth MANY TIMES it's asking price!  At 99 cents for his early version of this game, the developer shows that his heart is much more about delivering a fun experience then he is trying to make a quick profit!  ..That alone deserves some respect in my book here on Steam, especially considering the sheer amount of rip-off crap that is launched in early access these days here.\n\nControls are simple and easy, WASD to move through space, and your move your ships direction around, while your mouse buttons give you two different types of blasts to clear enemies and those big space rocks floating around.  A joy to play with very responsive and understandable controls.\n\nYou start off in a space void with a few huge rocks, and a single enemy ship who will shoot at you if you don't find him and blast him first!  Thhere is also plenty of different power ups, ship repair, and ammo icons floating around to aid your cause.  Shooting a space rock blasts it into many smaller rocks at high velocity, and damage values are clearly shown as you blast the rocks and baddies making it a satisfying endeavor.  \n\nWhile the first level might seem casual and too easy, just keep clearing out all those space rocks to move on to the next level, and pretty soon you'll be in over your head and having to dodge all kinds of crazy enemies and rocks which multiply each time you pass a level.  Super fun, especially for the price!\n\nSadly, not enough players have bought this game yet when I reviewed it in early access, but I will buy a copy for my son and have him play some multiplayer games with me and update my score and post some video links when that happens.  ...For now this game scores an impressive 75% from me, with a good chance of only going higher once more players are available for the \"Up-To-8-Player Multiplayer action\" and as this game continues to get further developed through early access.  \n\nThumbs up!  If you're at all curious about this game, this game gets my support and my high recommendation!  Give it a try, you'll probably be surprised what a dollar can buy!  :-)\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484425", "timestamp_created": 1457276545, "recommendationid": "21666758", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 292, "steamid": "76561198053422627", "last_played": 1457297560, "num_games_owned": 956}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 9}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1458081826, "review": "Cute little game, but I can't find anyone in online to play with.
