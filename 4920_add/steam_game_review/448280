Since as now; hyper-realistic products are continuously missing the mark, because of a reason or another (maybe shooters are the only genre that seems to translate easily in VR), this game/Experience, takes the toon graphic and blocky elements, which can be seen as negative, and make them a positive. You never take yourself serious in this game, and neither does the game.\n\nYou start in the lobby, where you can choose one of the 4 profession: office worker, food stand worker, mechanic or clerk in a convenience store. Each one is interesting on its own, and they are fundamentally playing differently; although the common elements are there, to give continuity.\n\nThe graphic is colorful and blocky; so it gives you very little sickness when looking around for some reason. Also it is fast enough to allow you to play at a decent framerate, even on weaker GPU.\nThe sound are awesome and hilarious at time. The robot voices are all monotone and flat, exactly like you would expect from a robot; and the interaction with the oculus controllers is pretty good.\n\nKids love this game; especially because you can do whatever you want while playing; there is no wrongdoing, even if you trash the place or scan 100 times a product for a customer. IT is the ideal game to show to kids and to give to people that never played a VR game; it is guaranteed that they will enjoy it.\n\nThe game itself is not much of a game; you have tasks; you complete them doing certain actions and move on. You can play each job as many times as you want, starting from the beginning or just loading it and do crazy things; replayability is very limited once you get over the novelty; so you may end up showing it only to people visitng or to kids.\n\nThe only negative I found is the horrible management of the play space. I had issues to find a decent setup for a week; since for some reasons, the game at launch does not care about your position, even if you reset it; so I end up with the 2 cameras facing me. and when the game launch, I have to face my right. I did try to re-calibrate the sensors, the device, reset the app and everything else you may think... no luck; the view is stuck in whatever the app wants to use.\n\nGlad that they did add a \"kids\" mode, so the height of things is reduced, allowing young ones to actually play the game (before I had no luck to see my kids to play the game, since they could not reach the \"tickets\" that start a specific task).\n\nOverall, it is an interesting product; won't call it a game, but more like a fun experience; and a time-consuming experience for kids, if you want to keep them busy. Job simulator hit the spot, and does everything it should. Worth the 20 dollars that they ask.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502361", "timestamp_created": 1505614356, "recommendationid": "35011934", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 100, "num_reviews": 22, "steamid": "76561197967524117", "last_played": 1506819290, "num_games_owned": 108}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504623263, "review": "I really like this game, but i would add more jobs!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502968", "timestamp_created": 1504623263, "recommendationid": "34758088", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198163439665", "last_played": 1504443601, "num_games_owned": 11}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505789829, "review": "Must-Have game for VR.
