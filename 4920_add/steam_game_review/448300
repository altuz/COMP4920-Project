Not even worth the .99 price tag.\nThe barbaric saving system and extremely limited UI will give you a blast from the past, all the way back to the late 90s. I would like to see some of that get fixed, because as I said I believe the game has good intentions.\nThis game is certainly nowhere close to being called \"finished\", and I understand that. However, if the creators do not decide to apply some extra effort to this game, I would not recommend getting it at all.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502155", "timestamp_created": 1464198523, "recommendationid": "23205307", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198307638881", "last_played": 1467140699, "num_games_owned": 7}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
