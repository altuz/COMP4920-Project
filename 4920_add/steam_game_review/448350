{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 39, "timestamp_updated": 1457664474, "review": "Boy, I wish I loved anything as much as this game loves crashing. There's not even any rhyme or reason as to WHY it could be crashing sometimes; it's just doing it because it has a burning passion for crashing and it's not going to let you or its parents or the town mayor tell it otherwise. It crashes at the start menu. It crashes at the loading screens. It crashes if you try and record it. It crashes when you enter a room. Let me tell you, if [b]Case #8[/b] could crash while it was crashing, it'd be all over that. There are people kept in padded cells and fed on a pole that are more stable than this game.\n\nWhich is kind of a shame because, honestly, [b]Case #8[/b] isn't a horrible game. 'Good' might be stretching it but it's at least average, bundles together a handful of decent scares and is fairly priced. From what I managed to play, there's nothing in the way of combat with the game wheeling out some basic puzzles and item collecting instead as you progress around the prison, gathering the odd piece of scattered lore here and there. It's pasted together in FPS Creator which might well be the source of its problems as this definitely isn't the first time a game from there has been spat out riddled with mystifying bugs.\n\nObviously, I can't recommend something this ridiculously broken at the moment, regardless of the game's quality. It's possible to shoulder your way through a lot of the crashes by reloading or relaunching but I reached a point after the third stage where it refused to pass the loading screen five times in a row and, with the gaming backlog I'm sure we all share, I had to ask myself whether it was worth the strife to persist with it. I settled on a 'no'.\n\nWhatever joy I managed to squeeze out of this crashaholic is below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l1PWCaeW3M", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550752", "timestamp_created": 1457664474, "recommendationid": "21758470", "language": "english", "votes_up": 44, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 115, "steamid": "76561198169311898", "last_played": 1457568639, "num_games_owned": 1798}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 12}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1457566308, "review": "Game crashed a few minutes in.

The walking felt really slow, but considering the first part of the game is set in a small area, it makes some sense if they want the game to play a tad longer, but even the running was barely faster than that and felt way too slow for a game. The puzzles I played were pretty bland, lack-luckster, and had been done countless times since the 90's, nothing really special there, although I didn't get the full experience as the game keeps crashing when loading the 2nd area. Sound effects were great, but the lack of music made it awkward. No, not tense, or suspensful. Awkward, and kind of distracting from the whole atmostphere.\n\nThe writing seems bland, un-motivated, and very simplistic. It's kind of obvious they were going off of nothing here, which isn't inherently bad, but it really didn't have anything special going for it. Bland \"puzzles\", bland writing, no music, and decent at best graphics didn't really give this game much to stand on.\n\nHonestly, not a bad game at all, the devs are off to a good start, but it doesn't seem polished yet. I can't say it doesn't feel complete, as I didn't get a chance to finish the game, but the part I HAVE played, the beginning, wasn't very polished, and the beginning is where you want the majority of your polish, since it's the first thing the player gets to experience for your game, and will form A LOT of assumtions and expectations for the rest of your game, so it's important to set that tone and atmosphere correctly, but who knows? Maybe it has better puzzles once you beat the beginning in 10 minutes!\n\nOverall has the potential to be a cool game, but right no it's not worth the money unless it's you have some extra steam-cash laying around. I think the developers have potential, FOR SURE! They just need to work on polishing their skills a little more and maybe communicating with others in their field to gather opinions and playtesters to REALLY polish the game and make it a solid $20 experience rather than a half-baked $4 one. Maybe do some more research as to the deep, intricate analysis of video games. Games aren't as simple as just making them, there is A LOT of thought that must go into all aspects of games, and that's something I personally find enjoyable to educate myself about, and is a necessity for any budding game-developer. Good luck to the devs and their future endeavours, and if you decide to buy the game, I hope you can actually load all parts of it!\n\nEDIT: As a side note, there are no options in the game either.
