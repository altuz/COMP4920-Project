{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505468402, "review": "I bought this game ages ago basically because it was a game about blowing the crap out of IS. I never played it until today because frankly I wasn't expecting much.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThis game is actually pretty damn good. Obviously it's not an in-depth immersive experience but for what it is it is genuinely a hell of a lot of fun. The skill tree and special abilities really make the gameplay more involved than just 'aim-shoot-repeat'. Some of the abilities are milestones that make the game 10x easier (increased fire rate, no reload etc.). Personally I find it a shame that they allowed 360 movement to become unlocked as it kind of removes the entire Q/E yaw functionality but it does allow for more brutal, fast-paced meat-grinding which is pretty much this game's selling point.\n\nWhile I would have liked some humor in the mix to spice up the enjoyment factor, for example suicide bombers shouting \"Allahu akbar!\" as they ran at you, I understand that this may have wound up with some offended parties.\n\nAll in all a surprising little gem that delivers some solid fun while not trying to be anything more than it is.

You're going to be mowing down digital humans for fun, it's hardly important what clothes they're wearing so chill your triggers.\n\nSecondly, it's a puddle deep turret shooter with some progressive persistent unlocks. So enter only those who want a violent alternative to minesweeper.\n\nThat said lets get onto some observations.\n\nThe persistent unlocks offer something to strive for, of course that also means once you've unlocked some of the juicier items you're left chasing scores and leaderboard positions. These do highlight your friends which is kind of neat but you can only see this while playing, can't see an option to do it from the menu which is a bit odd.\n\nAs the developer of Hatred I did expect a bit more gore but alas you'll need to settle for some nice explosion effects. Reality is you'll rarely see or have time to appreciate any of the human/bullet relationship detail. \n\nGrind. Each map unlocks after achieving a cumulative enemy and vehicle kill target. This means you'll be playing the same map many times before you can move onto similar gameplay over a new canvas. The lack of variety therefore is a bit of a negative, the positive being you're not going to see all the maps in less than 4 hours and well you'll be earning xp to unlock those persistent skill upgrades.\n\nAs noted by other reviewers, some of those upgrades remove a lot of the hinderances the game starts off with such as needing to reload or operate the rotation of the turret via keys. Judge yourself whether you feel this sucks although it should be said you don't have to upgrade those skills (but you can't deactivate one you've purchased!).\n\nLevels play out randomly which can impact your run and I question to some degree how leaderboards would be totally reflective of people's skill when RNG could influence the result but bah, it's a silly game so why worry about that.\n\nAn annoyance I found most impacting of my fun was the attacks from the sides. While it's neat you are forced to change your focus to a new area of the maps it's also often done while you're also being attacked from the front. There are some support powers you could call in at this time but it again leaves you somewhat open to RNG on how much damage you'll be unable to avoid.\n\nOn the whole. I'd reccommend this if you want some dumb brainless fun with some challenge (and a sprinkle of RNG). Workshop support is in there (although I see only two entries as of writing) so there may be some additional longevity or at least eye candy in the future.

Wrong.\n\nIS Defense does exactly two \"edgy\" things - there are suicide bomber enemies (and not weird scifi ones like in R6 Siege) and some enemies carry ISIS' flag. That's IT. The opening movie mentions the real life fact that ISIS *renamed* their organization to \"Islamic State\" (i.e. note the crucial distinction that the devs are just saying what \"IS\" stands for, and do NOT actually identify IS as Islamic, even though they factually are) and they declared a caliphate. In the ridiculous dystopian future of the game (which is set in 2020) IS has taken over all of northern Africa, but it takes pains to claim that the locals were all forced to support IS (i.e. there is no mention of Muslims voluntarily joining IS).\n\nThe guys you're shooting are never identified as Muslims.\n\nI'm pretty sure the words \"jihad\" and \"Allah\" are never used!\n\nYou never even get a good look at the enemy soldiers' faces.\n\nThere is no gore - the only satisfying kill is when you blow up a truck (which takes a STUPID number of bullets) and the jihadists all go flying as ragdolls.\n\nThe enemies never ululate (that high-pitched trilling \"la la la la!\" noise that terrorists like to do)\n\nYou don't get to rescue gays that IS was going to execute.\n\nI'm pretty sure you never get to kill any camels. (Even Metal Slug had camels!)\n\nThere's tons of upgrades (which you NEED to grind for to have any chance of beating the later levels) but nothing offensive - you don't get to upgrade to bacon bullets to do extra damage. You can buy bacon bullets in REAL LIFE, but not in a game about killing thousands of Islamists.
