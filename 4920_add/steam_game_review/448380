Time for the pros and the cons.\nPros: Quite a couple challenges to do, many cars to choose from and unlock. Slightly replayable if you want to try surviving for as long as possible.\nCons: First challenges are hard to do, and there are no tutorials on how to do an ultimate skid, other tricks newbies don't know how to do. \nThe game is very good, I truly love it.

Unfortuately it's hard to recommend for vr at this stage as it's very rudimentary, menus are impossible to navigate without taking the headset off and pointing it in the right direction so that you can see the menus on the screen to use the mouse to choose the options. This also means it's very difficult to see your objectives as they only show up for a short time when you start the game, and you need to spend this time getting the headset in place as the game starts pretty soon after. Xbox controller is also not well implemented for the menus, it works great for the gameplay, just not for menu navigation.\n\nGraphics are basic, obviously the style that they're aiming for, but I'd hope the finished product will be a bit more polished, and the flashing double vision that you get sometimes is horrendous in VR, it really does need to be toned down.\n\nI haven't put a negative review despite these issues because the core game is a lot of fun, and obviously a work in progress.
