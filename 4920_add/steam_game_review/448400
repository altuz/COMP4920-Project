Each game has about 3 hours of play-time and they tend towards having interesting plots to buoy the experience. If you're a fan of HOG, this bundle is a definite good buy, especially when on-sale. Two-sentence reviews of each game:\n\n[h1]Cruel Games[/h1]\nThis game is a little odd in that the story doesn't really ever come to make sense. While it tries to tell you things are urgent, the gameplay does not reflect that and neither does the artwork and styling, so there is a bit of a disconnect between what you're shown and told.\n\n[h1]Kronville[/h1]\nThis one is probably the least visually-appealing of the pack and the story isn't handled as well as it feels like it could be. The Dreamwalking element keeps things interesting and varied as you work through the crime and mystery.\n\n[h1]Panopticon[/h1]\nThe idea for this game is great, but graphics wise it falls flatter than most of the others. The ever-changing setting makes this game feel a bit more adventurous than others in the pack, despite the story being a bit lacking beyond the idea.\n\n[h1]Lake House[/h1]\nStory-wise, this one takes the cake for this pack. It's darker than the others and beautifully created to match the tone that story sets. This one was probably my favorite of the pack, although the next two are also high up there.\n\n[h1]The Other Side[/h1]\nThis game has some interesting components to it that aren't found in others in the pack and create a slightly different gameplay experience, which was fun. Your cat sidekick is fun to have around, and the story great.\n\n[h1]Mexicana[/h1]\nI was excited to play this game in particular, as I was a fan of the idea for the setting. It is not as intricate as the two above, story-wise, but it certainly hit the spot and the artwork is gorgeous, so it didn't let me down.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "timestamp_created": 1498602278, "recommendationid": "32893980", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198067253012", "last_played": 1479009108, "num_games_owned": 283}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496770219, "review": "This is a super deal.  Each game costs less than two dollars even if you have to pay $11.99 for this bundle of games.  All of the games in this bundle will allow you to correct the aspect ratio for a widescreen monitor.  They all have good graphics and sounds.  Two of the games will display fullscreen graphics on a widescreen monitor.  The other four games have a 4:3 aspect ratio.  They were created before most people started using widescreen monitors.  The Other Side: Tower of Souls is definitely a masterpiece.  I haven't seen a hidden-object game quite like it.  It does have amazing graphics.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500377", "timestamp_created": 1496706076, "recommendationid": "32210177", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561198043162376", "last_played": 1498293960, "num_games_owned": 68}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 22, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 22, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0}}
