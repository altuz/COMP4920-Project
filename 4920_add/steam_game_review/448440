{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501283589, "review": "First of all, I personally don\u2019t recommend this game due to many flaws I had to go through; however, I will give this game a blue thumbs up for putting a lot of effort in the game.  There are still some redeemable qualities to the game.\n\nHere are a few flaws that needs pointing out:\n\nThe \u201chow to play\u201d menu should be available to view if you have an option screen.  I remember my first playthrough (after restarting five minutes in) that I accidentally skipped the \u201chow to play\u201d box.  When I tried to look for it in the settings or the main menu, it is nowhere to be found.  I realize I couldn\u2019t figure out what each cursor meant especially when the pictures are so small to understand.  I had to restart to learn it again.\n\nAnother issue the dialogue \u201ccut-scenes\u201d.  I believe it is best that we can pause and click after each dialogue.  I feel that the dialogue moves too fast at times and I don\u2019t have enough time to process what they are saying.\n\nAnother problem is the cursor, specifically the \u201cwalking arrow\u201d.  I believe the developer should remove the default arrow.  There are a couple of areas where you only need the default arrow but that should be enabled on the other cursors.  Any item or person that can be clicked, the avatar will walk towards them anyways.  I understand the changing cursors for different dialogue or action purposes but the default cursor should be removed.  If not that, maybe change the setup in your engine.  Sometimes when I forgot to change the cursor, the avatar just walks to the object or person. Sadly, the avatar is now blocking the object or person and starts talking about himself/herself.  At first, it was funny, now it\u2019s annoying.\n\nThere is a small bug I experience after I leave to the community hub.  After I leave the hub, dialogues tend to go extremely fast out of nowhere.  I\u2019m not sure what causes it.\n\nHere are some positives of this game:\n\nThe game is still pretty cheap and there is a good length before finishing it.\n\nThe story is bordering passable.  You can feel bored with the whole story or actually feel interested.  The story is different than other games I\u2019ve played so that\u2019s a plus.  I personally thought it was alright but slowly got bored over time.\n\nThe engine\u2019s graphics won\u2019t blow anyone away but it does feel different than your typical engine such as Unity, Cry Engine, Unreal Engine 4, and RPG Makers.\n\nYou can play between two different characters and have two different experiences.  I believe this is the developers own unique touch to the game.\n\nAt the end of it, I believe the developer(s) tries hard to put as much effort in the game to make it quality.  There are several hit and misses that really needs a makeover such as the cursor.  Again, thumbs up for a hard effort but not as recommended; however, if the consumers are curious, they can still try the game out.  The price isn\u2019t expensive.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512242", "timestamp_created": 1501283589, "recommendationid": "33867862", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "steamid": "76561198376317844", "last_played": 1499949849, "num_games_owned": 137}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503567319, "review": "Bizarre Earthquake is a good casual adventure game. \nIt has an original storyline compared with those in the \"game industry\" as a whole, including the adventure genre. No horror, no blood, no zombies, no vampires, no trashy things : nothing that will hurt your feelings. It's almost family-friendly BUT not in a way that you'll feel like you're playing a children game, far from it. At least it's not violent nor gore. \nAdmittedly it's not realisitic all the way (especially in the end), but it's a game, it's not meant to be a hundred percent plausible and the main idea remains interesting, even though certain aspects of the plot lack some depth. But given the price it's okay and it doesn't take the fun away. \nNice graphics, although sometimes animation is a bit awkward. It's still totally playable and enjoyable. \nThe music is fine and appropriate. Pay attention to it, sometimes it changes a bit to signify you did what you were supposed to.  \nIt's a well-balanced adventure game : not too easy and not too difficult. Puzzles are solvable but the solution isn't given. \nThere are not too many back and forth in the different areas. Sure you'll have to visit some places twice or more but not in a way that makes you crazy. \nYou can play the whole story as the male or as the female character, or you can switch between them along the way. That gives replayability to the game. The characters don't have the same puzzles to solve in order to make progress in the inquiry.  That way you can \"skip\" something you're stuck in. \n\nIf you like \"side quest\", not that there is properly one, there are hidden objects to find in the game. Those are not necessary to complete the game but you will need to find (most of) them if you're going for the 100% Achievement. \n\nLast but not least. Maybe since it's not a big production , the dev might answer nicely to your relevant observation/question.\n\nGiven the price and the size of the team I'd give a mark of 8/10. (Don't mind the amount of hours I spent on it, I've done many playthroughs with both characters to write a guide). \n\nIt's not expensive so give it a try. If you hesitate then wait until it's on sale.
