There is some depth to the mechanics, but mostly what you'll be doing is applying markups, and watching for things like bandits attacks, (a countdown timer until you lose that you have to sink money into your defenses to avaid) and adjusting your merchant to auto-buy and auto-sell more expensive common commodities as your finances allow.\n\nWould be great for it to have more replayability, but at this price it's worth it if it entertains you for a few hours.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516155", "timestamp_created": 1457667170, "recommendationid": "21758904", "language": "english", "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561197995367548", "last_played": 1475720009, "num_games_owned": 269}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485061229, "review": "This is a very short game, but has some replay value.
