The game is a hodgepodge of bells and whistles that keep the player stimulated and constantly surprised. The sheer variety of enemies and obstacles encountered kept me on my feet throughout. The many friendly NPCs also supplied a fair few laughs. The dialog is as charming as the excellent updated visuals are adorable. Every little detail in the game oozes character, adding to the fun-loving tone of the game. The way Walker emotes depending on his health is perhaps the most compelling incentive to actually avoid damage. The game is certainly forgiving, making the game more about enjoying the journey than overcoming a challenge, aside from a few more difficult sections. Still, the world is so delightful and the gameplay so charming that the difficulty is hardly missed. Having a character that can't stop walking keeps the pace moving at a breakneck speed, and challenges hardly overstay their welcome. The game may be short, clocking in at just 80 minutes for me, but it feels satisfyingly complete.\n\nI do have two main criticisms for the game. First of all is the text. The text is very blurry, in contrast to the rest of the crisp pixel art. This makes the menu incredibly difficult to navigate. After looking at some old game footage, this problem is either only happening to me or is specific to the new art update. Either way, I hope that this problem is resolved soon. My other key criticism of the game is that it suffers from Sonic 1 syndrome, in that the first level is so much fun that the rest of the game has a difficult time stacking up. The first few levels are full of so many different paths, mechanics, secrets, and other bits and bobs, while the middle of the game takes a bit of a dip in terms of pacing. While this certainly serves as a good hook, the middle of the game really needs some more stand out moments to keep the game on a healthy interest curve.\n\nDespite any shortcomings, the game is still a blast to play and I would certainly recommend it to anyone considering picking it up, especially at such a low price.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502843", "timestamp_created": 1486935399, "recommendationid": "29883428", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198051575594", "last_played": 1504209720, "num_games_owned": 93}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1461113091, "review": "I am currently let's playing this game on my channel.
