Online multiplayer is non-existent and single player requires you to control two chefs at once. No adding NPCs to help you, no allowing you to dial down (or up) the difficulty at will, and you can only progress by getting certain numbers of stars per level--your only options are to get lucky with simple orders or grind until you're blue in the face, otherwise you're stuck. \n\nThumbs up if you have another friend with a controller/keyboard!

Overcooked is a strange one; it starts out amazing... I was playing with my girlfriend as a co-op experience and the first section of the game is amazing. It presents a good challenge, and simple mechanics that all come together to make a fun game. \n\nThe part I enjoyed, and what I feel they should have emphasised for difficulty is the cooking. Burgers require various toppings and orders are varied; fish and chip plates vary as well as numerous types of soup. When orders are coming quick, and you're trying to keep ontop of chopping veggies/meats, cooking, washing dishes and taking out orders on time... this is where the game excels. They needed to just do levels with more variety and combinations of food to increase the difficulty; but instead they decided to keep the food relatively simple and focus on one or two items per level and make the level difficult to navigate. \n\nThe game goes downhill when tables start moving, you're on moving trucks, conveyor belts and various other things that don't let partners work as a team - but it decides for you what you'll be doing in each level. This went too far for me when one of the levels was pitch black and you are using flashlights to navigate a confusing kitchen area. This isn't fun. What was fun; was the hectic nature of quick ordering, cooking food, and trying to get your order out on time. They needed to introduce different food types on normal kitchen environments to increase difficulty. So basically; give me a level where I need to do fish & chips, burgers, soups, steak & fries, salads etc etc... that would be a lot to keep ontop of but in a good way. \n\nIt's a simple game that was over complicated in a bad way. They increase difficulty in the wrong way and went away from what was fun about the game. I really wish I could recommend the game. If it's on sale for a cheaper price and you are fine to play just the first few hours where the gameplay is strong; that's the best part of the whole thing. As it is; I've quit on the dark level and just found that it isn't fun anymore.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497537", "timestamp_created": 1506299731, "recommendationid": "35193594", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 52, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561198004534280", "last_played": 1506228873, "num_games_owned": 488}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 1271, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 9, "total_positive": 1174, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 97}}
