Along the way levels get harder and you are introduced new elements so the game doesn't get too repeative.\n\nJust that the game isn't done after you have finished all the stages you can focus on getting best time among your friends or even speedrun which seems to have global rankings. The feeling when you try to master a single level but you **** up the smallest jump or timing can be frustrating but getting the best possible time in rewarding on it's own.\n\nOh and the music is great.\n\nEDIT: Just finished my first Speed run. Brutal, but rewarding. \n\nThe game itself doesn't have that much content but it is definitely worth it's price.
