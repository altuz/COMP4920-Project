You still only move the joystick up down left or right, even though your block ends up moving diagonally.

No chance! \n\nThankfully, the difficulty curve steps up gradually, eventually becoming rock hard, through the introduction of limited moves, different coloured sides which must be used to squish matching coloured plants, mined explosives, time limits, porcupine cubes that take you out along with other guard sentries etc.  \n\nGameplay and controls (arrow keys) are really easy to pick up, but as each level becomes more and more intricate, you need to carefully plan and experiment to solve.  Getting past the next level feels really rewarding, while the pop synth soundtrack is also great addition.
