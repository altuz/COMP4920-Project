But I can't really recommend it, and it's most definately not worth anything close to the $4 regular asking price.\n\nThis is a walking simulator with jump scares, that's it. The story is one sentence long and you read it off the main menu.\n\nYou spawn into the game with no memory of who you are, or why you are there, or what's going on. And: there's no way to ever find out.\n\nYou wander around  a lab in the dark with a broken flashlight that barely works (and only for a few seconds at a time). You pray to find a few flashbang grenades. There's no other weapons.\n\nIt has an interesting atmosphere to it, but it's a rather small one map game with nothing to actually... do.\n\nIt seems to want to be a stealth game, but the stealth mechanics are limited to \"you see the enemy first and avoid their line of sight\".\n\nIf you don't avoid their line of sight, you can flashbang them (if you've found any) or ... they touch you and you die. The end. No lives, no tips, no progress, just dead and start over.\n\nBasically this feels like it might have been a tech demo built to show the start of an idea that was never finished. Or just a weekend project by a student game developer learning to use unity assets.\n\nIf you happen to get it on sale or just want to support the developer who made it (an independant who has made a few other decent games), then more power to you. But it's really hard to recomend this as a game when it feels barely started, let alone complete.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500176", "timestamp_created": 1500743201, "recommendationid": "33725288", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "steamid": "76561198075324976", "last_played": 1500747856, "num_games_owned": 353}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 27, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 16, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 11}}
