Its just to  bad that this really feels frustrating to try and plan around. \n\nSo sadly already this game is worse than a free puzzle game on my phone :/\n\nTo add insult to injury the game is roughly 80 tiers of around 5+ levels per tier, so even if you get more features as you progress it will drive you mad trying to actually complete such a long game that has the excuse- oh sorry i mean \"theme\" of being minimalistic, ergo there is nothing but these 400~ puzzles, no soundtrack, no visualy pleasing backround, no clever story supporting it. nope just you doing puzzles for 3\u20ac.\n\nI will disclaim that as puzzles go im really not a big fan of this perticular puzzles style either, all it is, is clicking a tile and the 9 adjacent tiles \"activate\" and activating an activated tile deactiviates it etc. \n\nIm also going to mention the difficulty is really out of control. And i get that you might think im just dumb but thats not what i really mean, what i mean is for some reason the creators thought itd be smart to make certain tiles nonn clickable, so you are actually limited in what options to solve the puzzles wich makes the puzzles with kind of obvious patterns to become actual no-brainers. But at the other end some puzzles can have you just sit there and rageclick hoping to make yourself see the pattern.\n\nbottom line is, if you like the nine tile activation style puzzle enough to do roughly 400 the go ahed, but if you are skeptic or just curious i really do recommend not bothering and instead getting one of the hunderds puzzle apps for your phone or just go to google and type in \"free puzzle game\" and chances are itl be just as good or even better.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506692", "timestamp_created": 1482390951, "recommendationid": "28523174", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198045164915", "last_played": 1482389657, "num_games_owned": 190}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
