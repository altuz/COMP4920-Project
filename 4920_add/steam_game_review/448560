You will recognize some of them, while others may be new to you. Look at the screenshots to get an idea of the kind of problems you will be solving. I think most of them are fun, but some are just frustrating. Yeah, I'm looking at you, \"swap the bishops\".\n\nYes, I clicked the button to recommend this game, but just barely. 'Mind Games' has a lot of problems. To be blunt, for the most part it comes across as pretty amateurish: \n\n- There is no in-game menu whatsoever. No basic options e.g. for graphics and sound, but also no menu that shows your progress or that allows you to go back to previous puzzles you may want to replay because you liked them. You have three buttons in-game: one to exit mind games, one to show the instructions for the current level on the screen and one to reset the current level. There is also no hint system or another way to progress in 'Mind Games' when you're stuck at one particular level. Well, because there is an achievement for skipping a level I went looking for the way to do that. Turns out the 'hint' you see in the second screenshot on this product page, i.e. \"You can skip the level by pressing left-top reset button 100 times\" is no joke. Not very user-friendly, is it?\n\n- The whole audio track is just copied from the game 'The 7th Guest' (also available on Steam). I can't help but wonder if this is even legal, but that's not up to me to look into. But more to the point, 'The 7th Guest' was set in a haunted mansion so the creepy sounds, the ominous music and the maniacal laughter fit that atmosphere. But in 'Mind Games', where you're just solving brain teasers, it feels completely out of place.\n\n- The instructions you get for each brain teaser are written in very bad English. Sometimes this causes you to have no clue at all what you're supposed to do and you'll need to figure it out by trial and error, or by looking up the solution on the net, which spoils the fun, of course. 'Mind games' adresses the player as 'my friend', just like in those terrible e-mails you get when buying something from the countries er... 'on the eastern side of the planet' (Russia, India, China, ...). They don't understand the western side of the globe thinks it's weird to call any and all strangers \"my friend\". \n\n- Some of the Steam Achievements are bugged. E.g. there are some achievements that require you to complete 40, 100 and 200 levels, but the counters for those 3 achievements is stuck at 6 for me and, according to the discussions forum, for a number of other players, too. According to the same forum, other achievements used to be bugged but were fixed, so maybe the current bugged achievements will get fixed in the near future, as well.\n\nSo there you have it. If you like challenging brain teasers and find 'Mind Games' on sale, you have little to lose by buying it. But 'Mind Games' really needs some more work to stop it from sticking out like a sore thumb in the huge selection of puzzle games Steam has to offer. Most notably it needs original and better suited music and sound effects, an in-game menu with at least some basic options and a native English speaker to rewrite the instructions which are hard to understand as they are right now.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523619", "timestamp_created": 1463700931, "recommendationid": "23089524", "language": "english", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "steamid": "76561198042646749", "last_played": 1482347445, "num_games_owned": 700}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1471379210, "review": "Very frustrating, no clear directions as to what to even do... just \"solve this!\"  with no indication as to what even the desired solution is, or how to get there!
