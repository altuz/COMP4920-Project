Both the graphics and sound design are quite good, and are enjoyable to look at and listen to. However, the gameplay itself is pretty garbage.\n\nThe game is kind of similar to FTL in terms of how you navigate. Your mission is to collect a Bell, a Book, and a Candle. Simple enough. All you do is drive from town to town (different nodes on the map), and you cannot actually turn around once you start driving to a particular area, the game doesn't let you. You spend the journey avoiding obstacles (including cars speeding towards you which result in a one hit kill and make you restart the entire game again), and stopping at shops (just a menu screen) to buy drugs that reduce stress (the game never actually explains what this does but I assume it makes less crazy stuff happen on the screen), buy food, and buy car upgrades/fuel, or random stuff, and occasionally explore an alley.\n\nUnfortunately, whether or not the game is actually beatable seems to be largely a matter of luck. The stops you make randomize what is available, and it's likely to get a few stops in a row without a mechanics to refuel your car, which you NEED to actually win. Not only that, but if you try to do the smart thing and buy the book, bell, and candle, and still save some money for fuel, well, then you'd better hope that you have enough money to fill the tank completely, because otherwise, the game doesn't let you buy ANY fuel. What? You have $35, but you need $36 to refill the tank? And the next 3 stops probably don't have gas refills? Tough s**t! Start again!\n\nThis wouldn't be nearly as much of a problem if there was some reliable way to earn money, but there isn't. It's all based on luck. Explore an alley? Might get robbed, or find $50! Who knows! Buy a scratch ticket? Hey, you failed again! 4 times in a row! Man, I sure hope you weren't trying to get just 2 extra dollars to actually pay for some more gas, because that would really suck, huh?\n\nAs many people here have mentioned, cars driving headfirst into you at a fast speed is also an issue that makes the game kind of annoying, especially during a longer run. It just feels cheap and unfair.\n\nIt's also not particularly scary at all. If the idea of a distorted voice saying \"I will eat your soul\" and \"You are out of gods reach here\" frighten you, and 10 screaming ghost faces coming out of literally f**king nowhere to yell at you in the middle of driving make you p**s your pants, then prepare to be crazily spooked!\n\nIt's not good.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495092", "timestamp_created": 1498390417, "recommendationid": "32768069", "language": "english", "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": "5", "author": {"playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561198001077704", "last_played": 1498388875, "num_games_owned": 1196}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 11}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 79, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 71, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 8}}
