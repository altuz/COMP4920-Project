However, it wasn't bad, but I got the game for $1 and got my money's worth out of it.\n\nAnyways... Tutorial was terrible and could be skipped past without any problems.  The asteroid level/minigame in the beginning I absolutely hated, but I can see where it's needed for story (if the game has any) and I wish you could skip passed it at will (you can skip it if you fail too many times).\n\nOnce you get to the game I enjoyed building the houses and doing quests to gain colonists.  The most difficult part is figuring out how to tell them what to do.  For one, someone has to plant trees and another cut when I feel like that should be one job, because the wheat planter also harvests.  Your max inventory is limited to 5 item types with 16 being the max per stack.  I could live with that since, but end up making a lot of stockpiles that only hold one type of item.\n\nFinally, it feels unfinished still: I found a few bugs and there is one resource I never found a use for that you have to mine from rocks.  You can cook wheat to make bread, you can make flower out of wheat, and cook wheat into bread.  Either way you make break you still end up with the same amount of bread per wheat and the colonists don't know how to cook flour so it's a useless resource.  You can put the crafting bench, furnace and a stockpile in the houses, but I was only ever able to place a workbench and nothing else.  I did get lucky a few times; I was able to place the furnace instead of a workbench and also place a stockpile in one house and that house also happened to have a workbench in it.  I encountered a bug were if you gather over the 16 stack size in your inventory without unloading it, that resource vanishes into thin air.  I found it because I was mining rock to build the big house which needs 16 stone.  I mined over 16 and it disappeared.  I just dismissed it as a fluke but it happened a second time too.  After that I was very careful to never overload my character with resources.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507317", "timestamp_created": 1499483551, "recommendationid": "33361573", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198030766240", "last_played": 1499481994, "num_games_owned": 117}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499439397, "review": "Controls are difficult with little to know explaination.
