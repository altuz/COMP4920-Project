Whatever the fk genre this game is. Period. You press shoot they never shoot. You click move they runaway instead. You called that a game mechanic? what a joke. This game is literally unplayable. Screenshot never works only shows black screen. Luckily the dev is even too stupid to fix and patch bug and exploit of this game making it easier to achieve all the achievements with that horrible control and unplayable gameplay. Thats the good news. No I don't recommend this game ever.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510872", "timestamp_created": 1501483119, "recommendationid": "33921599", "language": "english", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 208, "steamid": "76561198114829485", "last_played": 1501482730, "num_games_owned": 896}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 28, "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 8, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 20}}
