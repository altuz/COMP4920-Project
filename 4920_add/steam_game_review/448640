I wasn't expecting anything as epic as Soul of Fire, but the ending felt quite abrupt and left a lot of unfinished business. The good news is, it's a brilliant game in a fully fleshed-out world, with tons of things to do and places to discover. I did not use the guide, so I'm sure there are details I missed, and I will almost certainly go back and replay it while waiting for the next instalment. Jeremy, you are a wonderful game designer and you obviously pour your heart into your games. I especially enjoy your knack for character development and dialogue, and you've tightened up the writing in the cut scenes, which is great. And I adore the artwork. I'm so sick of everybody just copying the Japanese manga style. This is fun, and different, and I love it!

The new characters still have the same quirkiness that the previous ones had. There are the same town names but the world map has changed over the period. There are some quests to be done and many places to explore. The enemies are visible which is a great help. An added help is the enemies encyclopedia which helps to identify them. One great advantage in the game, is the ability to chose difficulty level during the actual game not just at the beginning and this proves quite useful in some areas. The party ball has been updated and now looks like a disco scene with all the colourful lights- maybe not to everyones taste as it is somewhat difficult to see the members in it. The options screen has plenty to choose from eg battle advantages, continuous auto battle and enemy guage to name a few. Another feature is the attributes system which can alter the game play.Also the game uses a day/night system as well as days of the week which poses a unique game play in achieving quests etc.\nEven though this game is still in production at this stage, it is proving to be another great game from this developer with a lot of thought and artwork put into it. Would highly recommend it especially if you enjoyed the first one.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490169", "timestamp_created": 1463429754, "recommendationid": "23026667", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "steamid": "76561198191078731", "last_played": 1463429724, "num_games_owned": 72}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 9}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1483909468, "review": "I don't recommend this game", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463900", "timestamp_created": 1483909468, "recommendationid": "29126810", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 379, "steamid": "76561198042590261", "last_played": 1484377375, "num_games_owned": 517}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 13}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498912889, "review": "~", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1498912889, "recommendationid": "33082091", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198262019931", "last_played": 1478181029, "num_games_owned": 60}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 13, "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 13, "total_positive": 10, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
