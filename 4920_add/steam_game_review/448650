It has some obvious control issues, but is a great learning software.\n\nIt's not half as comprehensive as World Geography - Quiz Game by Atom Games on my Android phone, for example why is the Balearic Islands and other locations not on the map in this game? Now I haven't played that much, but I promise that I will!\n\nSo yeah it's not as comprehensive when it comes to knowledge about geography, but it still brings unique features to the PC. Like famous monuments and random facts, not to mention the unique way of interacting with the map that you can't on smartphone.\n\nMy major concern about this game is definitely the controls. There's too little customization. Too much mouse acceleration so you go too far from where you wanna go, and the scroll wheel doesn't work that effectively. You have to scroll like 3 clicks before it starts zooming in on the map.\n\nIt really needs a function so that we can learn from our mistakes. That's one of the most important things when learning, learn by your mistakes. We should be able to answer our wrong answers correctly at the the end of a quiz so that the next time we get the same question we know the answer instead of just being wrong answer. (yes I know it says the correct answer exactly when you press wrong answer, but that way you didn't choose the correct answer yourself and maybe you even missed it becuase it's fast)\n\nI really don't like the \"Learning Mode\". Of course there should be a learning mode, but it's just really poorly executed. The best way of learning is by multiple choice questions and being informed of the right answer if you are wrong, not to click random countries.\n\nThere's too many easy questions on Hard mode. Like Q: Where is Cook Islands? A: Oceania. And I don't like that there's a time limit on the MCQ. Sure there should be time to calculate your score, but there's not much room for improvements when there's a time limit.\n\nAlso, the game crashes if you alt-tab for too long.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502342", "timestamp_created": 1500085507, "recommendationid": "33549608", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 86, "steamid": "76561197997954065", "last_played": 1505933279, "num_games_owned": 518}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 14, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 13, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
