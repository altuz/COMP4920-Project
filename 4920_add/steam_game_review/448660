Your ultimate aim is to try and reward the entertainer with over $1,000 bucks. This is obtainable by collecting score multipliers which appear in the form of falling money bundles with a rainbow attached. \n\nWhile the game never takes itself seriously with grown out loud jokes like free dlc will be available apr1, there's nothing really hilarious or funny about this game. It just seems like a teenage desperate attempt to get his work noticed using goofball ideas. Other than 10 easy achievements the game is 'empty' in meaningful content, which probably perfectly mirrors the developers personality.\n\nThe only positive thing about the game is that it works, which is not at all comforting in comparison to this games biggest negative which is that the game developer is still developing. Please go back to Macca's and do something meaningful like make me breakfast.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/biTpZCX0gDc\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528609", "timestamp_created": 1504556648, "recommendationid": "34743282", "language": "english", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 183, "steamid": "76561198112866114", "last_played": 1504362294, "num_games_owned": 2624}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504022705, "review": "I didn't play a game so bored in minutes", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1504022705, "recommendationid": "34580568", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 257, "steamid": "76561198095396293", "last_played": 1503874703, "num_games_owned": 799}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500682810, "review": "Should I say this game is waste of money and time?....Yeah!\nBought with -90% coupon, but still.\n\nIt's just a \"how fast you can click\" \"Simulator\".
