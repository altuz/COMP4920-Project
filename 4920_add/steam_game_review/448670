{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1471161983, "review": "Basically, if you're a digital pinball collector and/or looking for some variety, you might want to get this. I'm actually finding it fairly enjoyable.\n\nThere are 15 tables with a variety of themes for $20. That's a reasonable price per table. Yes, this is a mobile port, and it shows.\n\nThe physics are very basic (think Space Cadet, but a bit better), and the designs vary in complexity from very simple to moderately complex.\n\nYou'll absolutely need to apply anti-lag tweaks, and you'll probably also want to force AA/AF externally.\n\nThe 3D graphics are reasonable, but mostly nothing special. The art is quite good, including some decent animations in places. Textures are somewhat low low res and models are low poly, though. No fancy lighting here, but there are some reflections. The graphics/art of the game look much better when you're using the dynamic camera.\n\nThere is no controller support or key rebinding. The game doesn't even tell you what the controls are! But I just use JoyToKey, that's not a deal breaker in this case. Controls are left/right arrow for flippers, down arrow for launcher, space for nudge (just upward), C for camera change. R switches to portrait orientation.\n\nThere are 3 camera views - top down, angled, and dynamic.\n\nNudging, as mentioned, exists, but you can only nudge upward. This is basically enough for a nudge pass. There's a tilt system with warnings on a timer (I think), but it takes more than one nudge to trigger a warning.\n\nDead bounces somewhat work, but are not terribly reliable. Hold passes work on some tables.\n\nBang backs also work quite reliably on most tables.\n\nThe flipper gap is quite small, making slap saves rather effective.\n\nThere is multiball (possibly on all tables). I've seen up to 5 balls.\n\nThere are kickbacks that are on by default, can be depleted and re-raised, at least on the tables I've played.\n\nTables typically will have a mix of passive progressive elements and (simple) goal oriented modes. There are some video modes too. There's a decent variety of playfield elements, including extra flippers and playfields. Extra balls are awarded at certain score thresholds. Some tables have fairly involved progressions that are quite difficult (even for me) to progress through.\n\nMusic and sound effects are ok - nothing special.\n\nThe developers are not native English Speakers (company is based on Russia). This shows in some awkward grammar in places and accented speech clips.\n\nThere are working steam leaderboards as well as local high scores (yes, I set #1 scores on the 3 tables I've played through so far ;).\n\nEach table saves progress automatically, even if you kill the game or if it crashes.\n\nThere are various bugs I've encountered, some game breaking, but they're not too common. Some elements of some tables don't seem to work correctly. There's a glitch that causes serious game-breaking graphics issues occasionally if you open the help while in game and then immediately resume.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602172", "timestamp_created": 1471068798, "recommendationid": "24875082", "language": "english", "votes_up": 59, "comment_count": "15", "author": {"playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "steamid": "76561197967388128", "last_played": 1471160713, "num_games_owned": 3371}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 4}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1470564691, "review": "The first time I've requested a Steam refund. \n\nI was REALLY looking forward to this. \n\nThe table camera views are terrible and only have very limited options to change them. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH !!\n\nMore damningly, the ball ballistics seem to 'float' and don't feel right either. \n\nThere are things to like with the themes and table design but without the above being right then despite the love thats been put into designing the tables it's moot.\n\nLook, as a pinball fan I want to play more virtual tables but with the already existing suberb iterations available via Steam from the likes of FX2 and especially the wonderful if overpriced Pinball Arcade, then there is simply no reason for this to exist in it's current state. \n\nI could be wrong but this feels like a port of a mobile phone game that simply hasn't been given the required love when moving to a much more demanding PC audience. Especially at the entry price.\n\nI love pins so I will re-buy if this SIGNIFICANTLY improves... but not until then.\n\nI'm SORRY as I really wanted this to be the next big thing in virtual pins but I now know that despite the now seemingly ridiculously overhyped advertising verbage it certainly isn't.....

All evidence, both in discussions and Gameprom's website, indicate DEVs have been 100% AWOL for the entire TWO WEEKS since release, despite significant bugs, issues and questions. PLEASE CONSIDER STRONGLY BEFORE PURCHASE.)\n\nFirst and foremost, I LIKE \u201cPinball HD Collection\u201d. I\u2019ve played fifty years of pinball, literally thousands of hours of computer pinball from numerous companies, and no doubt several tens of thousands of games. Naturally, I\u2019ve enjoyed some more, and others less. Computer pinball developers have in general, chosen for themselves a frustratingly Sisyphean task; to compete against those who \u201cport from reality\u201d tables loved (and played to financial success) for decades. But also to create, out of the blue, new tables that will be compared to every table ever made, computer or real, in both design and function. I believe that OOO Gameprom has generally succeeded. (Certainly to this player\u2019s satisfaction.)\n\nThe Pinball HD Collection (PHDC) Store Page doesn\u2019t seem to mention that this game offers FIFTEEN tables, and that might go far toward explaining what otherwise may seem to be a high price. What a player gets for $20US are some of the most interesting, creative and non-derivative tables I\u2019ve yet seen. Admittedly, at this point I\u2019ve only play a single game on most tables, but the need to produce this review weighed heavily on me. \n\nDesign wise, these are generally very beautiful tables, most having at least one additional playfield (and some have more than I\u2019ve ever imagined) but used wisely and productively. Pinball is in actuality far more than simply flippers and balls\u2026it\u2019s intelligent, wise, fun design. And as far as I can tell PHDC offers those aspects adequately (or beyond) in most cases. One concern seems to be is that this is a ported phone app. Not having ever played a game on a phone, I can only make the comment\u2026..\u201dWho cares?!\u201d I care about design. fun and playability, and I\u2019m mostly satisfied. Where I\u2019m not, I\u2019ll go to the next table and perhaps lose a very small portion of my \u201cinvestment\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s said by some that PHDC has poor physics. But it has also been said that computer pinball may never match the physics of actual tables, and no doubt that\u2019s true (at least for now.) While I\u2019m generally loath to mention competing products in reviews, I think this example can be excused, and perhaps this alleged completion is itself a myth for these two games. Most of the community agree that Pro Pinball Ultra\u2019s Timeshock! table has the best physics currently available on any platform. I tend to agree. I\u2019ve played in the neighborhood of 2,500 games of Timeshock!, and when going directly from that table to PHDC, I don\u2019t even remotely experience a \u201cphysics funk\u201d. True, they aren\u2019t directly comparable, but TS costs approximately ten times as much per table, and has been in development since 1997! In PHDC the ball acts as I anticipate it should, and when I hit it, it goes where I expect it to, utilizing the \u201cmiddle flipper sweet spot\u201d extensively. For a game geared less for the elite player, and more for the beginning or average player (99% of the pinball market), it obeys the same laws of physics I do. I think that for the most part, complaints about physics are really more a request for a more realistic (or perhaps faster) speed. Personally, I\u2019d be much happier with PHDC if there were at least two game speed choices available.\n\nWhile it might be nice to make it clearer somehow that in PHDC, the ball is launched by holding the down arrow button, and flippers are operated with the left and right arrow keys, the game rules and instructions are expressed very nicely with a single (though sometimes complicated) graphic of the table currently chosen. (And it\u2019s available during gameplay.) Also, the instructions unfortunately downplay the versatility of choosing from a variety of camera angles during play simply by pressing the \u201cC\u201d key. A very nice feature that may need to be used regularly as the ball enters various playfields.\n\nAt this point it\u2019s not clear exactly how to play the two tables that utilize vertical areas of the gamefield \u2013 Pinball Fantasy and Pirates. Hopefully I can obtain clarification so I can edit this review. And I\u2019m currently not in a position to comment on the 3-D glasses aspect of this game, strictly from lack of knowledge. The leaderboards are adequate, but after placing 12th on six tables in a row I realized I needed to reset them manually by toggling between \u201cLocal\u201d and \u201cSteam\u201d to get accurate data. (But if you want to get in early with some high ranking scores, now\u2019s the time. After a single game on each I managed at least one #1 score, so it\u2019s likely YOU will too.)\n\nWho might enjoy Pinball HD Collection? Anyone will enjoy the creative layouts and original design. For elite players, on some tables some shots can be just too easy to make, and on some of the tables the games may just last too long. (Heck of a complaint, huh?) It\u2019s not for players that value franchise content over the very basic Zen-ness of pinball. It\u2019s also not for those that place achievements first over content. (At least for now. But as I\u2019ve said before, I played pinball for over fifty years before I even heard of achievements.) For beginners, I\u2019d don\u2019t see how a pinball game could be much more satisfying. I still play, and very much enjoy, Balls of Steel (no longer available on Steam) based on it\u2019s amusing and clever layout and design, and I feel fairly certain that if you too still enjoy earlier computer pinball, you will likely enjoy PHDC even more. I\u2019m an average pinball player, but I WILL be keeping this game, and playing it at least occasionally (possibly much more) for a break from the often \u201ctoo serious\u201d world of competitive pinball. I think PHDC is the perfect game for those who just wish to enjoy pinball at both its most basic\u2026\u2026AND more complex.\n\nThank you.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549869", "timestamp_created": 1471049954, "recommendationid": "24866809", "language": "english", "votes_up": 26, "comment_count": "8", "author": {"playtime_forever": 1576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 112, "steamid": "76561198140299850", "last_played": 1502395882, "num_games_owned": 1211}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1472348867, "review": "Hi guys,after 10 mins playing this game,i wanna share some opinions to you guys.

But in this game,i just hope the FPS will get much better on the next update. Anyway,this game still worth to buy ,20 USD is not too much but at this price,the Dev should fix this game much more,to make it look much better. Thanks for your time to read my opinions.
