I would really reccomend that you play with up to three other friends. The maps are badly optimised and is not made for low-end computers. the classes are really generic as there are only four classes to choose from: Wizard, Mage, Knight and Jew. the gun balancing is absolutely terrible as shotguns kill further than assault rifles. Other than that great game. \n\n9.45/10", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453308", "timestamp_created": 1500684655, "recommendationid": "33709397", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198140494892", "last_played": 1500684007, "num_games_owned": 45}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 21}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 5, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
