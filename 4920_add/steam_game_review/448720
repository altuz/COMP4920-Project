If you are unsure if you or a child you have in mind would enjoy the game, try the demo.\n\nPROS:\n*Performance is fine\n\nCONS:\n*Tedious\n*Simplistic\n*Unrewarding\n*No new mechanics or development over time\n*Seemingly absent difficulty curve:  levels in area 5 may as well be levels in area 1 and vice versa, with only very rare exceptions outside the DLC\n*Too small a variety of minigames, given how simple they all are\n*One minigame is buggy\n*Overpriced\n\nGAME LENGTH:\nThe base game can be completed to perfection in around 6 hours.  The $4 DLC pack adds another 5 levels, some of which are \"extra large,\" so expect to play another 3-5 hours.  \n\nSCORE:\n1/10\n\nThat score may seem harsh, but this has been one of the most joyless experiences in my years of gaming.  Since most of the game does require the player's attention, I can't even really treat it as something to do while I'm watching TV.\n\nPuzzle Box features 6 minigames, some of which are initially \"locked.\"  This design choice is a bit strange, since they are all unlocked somewhere around the third area, leaving no rewards for the rest of the game.  I will address the minigames in order:\n\n1.) Color-coordinated block dropping on a still screen with a timer\n2.) Color-coordinated block dropping on a side-scrolling screen with a timer\n3.) Destroying a block shape with bombs\n4.) A platformer in which the player must collect butterflies, avoid enemies, and get a dog to food\n5.) A runner/platformer in which the player must collect 10 coins\n6.) Collecting coins with a floating vending machine claw while avoiding flying gears\n\n--\n\nThe block-dropping minigames are pretty much the same except for the increased chance of failure in the side-scrolling version.  The player gets up to 4 colors of blocks (assigned to WASD or accessible through mouse scrolling) to drop in the right order.  Perfecting these levels for achievements and coins to unlock new areas simply requires accuracy.  Each area of the game features 2-8 of these games, so they make up the bulk of the gameplay.\n\nThe problems:\n\nThese minigames just aren't very fun to play, especially when the levels don't ever present any new mechanics or increase in difficulty much--at least not consistently.*  It is very difficult to fail them and even to fail to perfect them, as the game is rather forgiving about mistakes.  On top of being tedious, easy, and undeveloped, sometimes two or three of the colors that the player is given are very similar, which can cause some frustration.\n\n*Starting at area 11 (DLC levels only), extra large areas are introduced for the first kind of minigame.  I suppose that this adds some difficulty, but the requirements for a perfect score are also made more lenient, so the two changes cancel each other out.\n\n--\n\nThe bomb-dropping minigame is exactly how it sounds:  the player is given 3-4 bombs to drop from above some shape made of blocks.  The player is rewarded with coins corresponding to the percentage of blocks he sends off screen.  Perfection requires eliminating all of them.\n\nThe problems:\n\nAs with the first set of minigames, no new mechanics are ever introduced and the difficulty never increases.  These games are literally over in seconds.  Additionally, since it's probably impossible to actually eliminate all of the blocks, the game seems to grant 100% completion as soon as the player reaches 80%.\n\n--\n\nThe platformer minigame is probably the best part of the entire game, but it would still be a terrible standalone experience, even below the quality of many free platformers.  The goal here is to navigate a stage and collect butterflies.  Perfection requires collecting all of them, completing the stage within a par time (seems to be around 3 minutes across the board), and getting a dog first to some food, then to the exit.\n\nThe problems:\n\nOnly one new mechanic is ever introduced (bombs), but it shows up inconsistently and doesn't add much to the experience.  These levels are generally easy, but very rarely a butterfly will be put in a dangerous location that requires an unusual degree of precision and timing to reach without being touched by an enemy.  This feels inappropriate for the game, as the character handling is somewhat imprecise (floaty) and user-unfriendly (the player is often unable to look below to see if he is going to land on an enemy).  Furthermore, I'm not sure what the additional requirement of feeding the dog adds to the game, since it can be saved until the end of the level, when the player is rewarded with invincibility and the timer stops.\n\n--\n\nThe runner minigame is one of the simplest:  the player simply chooses when to jump (up to 5 times before landing) to keep moving and to collect coins.  I have never failed one of these levels, but missing a few jumps in a row would presumably lead to death.  In any case, the player gets to run the \"track\" two times, giving him a second chance to collect any coins he missed the first time.\n\nThe problems:\n\nAs usual:  no new mechanics and no difficulty scaling.  Additionally, the second lap seems pointless when the levels are so short (and so easily replayable) and the coins are so easy to collect.  At the very least, the developers should have coded the level to end after the first lap if the player collects all the coins the first time around.\n\n--\n\nThe claw minigame is possibly the most tedious and frustrating of the group.  The player is given a long stage and must collect 6 coins distributed across the ground with a claw and return them to \"goals\" while avoiding floating, sometimes moving gears that cause instant death.  Perfection requires completing the level within the par time (seems to be 3 minutes across the board) and never dying.\n\nThe problems:\n\nThe claw is incredibly jerky and gets damaged even by touching walls, which is often unavoidable because of coin distribution and the terrible handling.  Consequently, it is just about impossible to navigate [i]through[/i] the small spaces between gears, so the player either must (1) fly above them or (2) pick up the gears themselves and move them elsewhere.  Both options are tedious and the second is somewhat unpredictable.  Worse, both the player and the coins may bug out:  the player may get stuck in the ground or ceiling and the coins may fly around, getting stuck in crevices.  These are my least favorite levels by far.\n\n--\n\nWith such dreadful gameplay, I probably wouldn't give the game a much higher score even if it had amazing music or visuals.  Still, it's worth mentioning that the music is repetitive and even sometimes obnoxious and the visuals, which you can see for yourself, are nothing impressive.\n\nAdditionally, the level select screen is unpleasant to navigate because of mouse acceleration issues and I'm a bit annoyed that the game's title deceptively suggests that it contains puzzles.\n\nIf I am totally honest, I would not have played this game for free if I had known exactly what I was getting, nor would I even recommend it to children, so $10 (and another $4 for 5 more stages) is a ridiculous asking price.  I only play it now because I was well past the refund deadline by the time I started it and I don't value my time as much as I should.  For its lack of any enjoyable gameplay, I give Puzzle Box a 1 out of 10.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554583", "timestamp_created": 1484668966, "recommendationid": "29319071", "language": "english", "votes_up": 28, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "steamid": "76561198027890302", "last_played": 1484885716, "num_games_owned": 1209}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1476973061, "review": "Recommended... kind of.\n\nI assumed this game had PUZZLES because it's name is Puzzle Box. Well, it does have many different modes - two main ones, and a few \"smaller\" ones - but I think there's too many of them. There's 15 stages to beat - almost all have 6 levels to beat, plus all the levels have their own two mini modes. I only just unlocked Sector 8 and I think I've been playing forever. It's probably because the gameplay really does get repetitive.\n\nI don't particularly care for pixel art, but at least the whole game isn't like that. I liked the main screen, it looked nice.\n\nNow, there's one minus. If I buy a game that's NOT a visual novel without any other gameplay besides making choices, I want a tutorial. But I was never given one. I saw this tutorial screen above on the trailer section, but it was NEVER shown when you start the game. I wasn't even sure what to do and I'm suddenly on my first level. I had to figure it out on my own, which is not always a bad thing, but it frustrated me.\n\nSo this game has a lot of modes, but it does get repetitive.

It was developed with simplicity in mind. However, the  imprecise controls tend to ruin this simplicity by creating a frustrating experience where the only challenge is fighting the controls hoping they'll do what you want. Below, I'll go over each mode and describe them and how the controls have failed me in each one.\n\nClassic Mode:\nIn this mode, you're placing colored blocks as the screen scroll along, and you have to match the colors with the layout. \n\nThe concept is simple enough, but the problem arises when the mouse cursor doesn't scroll along with the screen. On more than one occasion, I've meant to place a block in one column, but the mouse cursor, staying still, moved to the next cloumn when I didn't intend it to. This is frustrating because it penalizes the player for not keeping this mouse cursor scrolling along with the screen, somethign that should be done automatically.\nThere are also two methods for choosing colors. You can either use WASD to choose up to four different ones, or use the mouse wheel to swap between sets of two. both methods work well enough, however, I do wish the mouse wheel would only rotate the colors 1 section instead of 2 sections at a time, because there are moments where you want to quickly place two colors that are on opposite sides of the color selector, and with the current setup you have to place, scroll, place, scroll, place, scroll, and it's not quick enough to be reliable.\nAlso, the whole thing seems like it would control much better with gamepad support, but the game doesn't appear to support this whatsoever.\n\nCopycat Mode:\nIn this mode there's a layout on a static screen, and you have to place the correct colored blocks. If you make a mistake, it doesn't end the game, just affects you score at the end.\n\nMy main complaint with this mode is the same as above with the color selector. In this mode, speed isn't really a factor, but using the mouse wheel to switch between colors makes the mode more tedious than it already is. However, even if the color selector was better, this mode would still feel too tedious to be any fun.\n\nBoom Mode:\nIn this mode, you take one of the layouts you made in copycat mode and drop a set number of bombs on it, in an attempt to destroy all of the blocks.\n\nThis mode is not very difficult and ends up just being boring and not challenging whatsoever. I guess the idea is that very young kids might like watching the level explode, but the explosions don't even look very impressive, and the whole thing just comes off as bland and unexciting.\n\nKubi Mode:\nIn this mode you control a little red square with a face, and the layout you made in copycat mode is turned into a platforming stage, with some extra platforms added in around the sides, and some fairies and other things to collect.\n\nThe platforming controls are not very good, and this mode has one of the floatiest jumps I've ever had the displeasure of exeriencing in a platformer. The mode is also pretty easy, and has definitely been tuned for very young children. You have something like a triple or quadruple jump available, so there's literally zero challenge on the platforming side of things. There are enemies to avoid, but they travel in a set pattern on a loop and never end up chasing the player, so avoiding them is a simple task. The layouts also don't end up making very interesting levels, and the extra platforms on the sides are always the same, so things get a tad repetitive, as well.\n\nRun Mode:\nIn this mode, you take the layout you made in Classic Mode, and run through it as a character named Roy, being chased by some black goo, and collecting 10 coins along the way.\n\nThe controls, like Kubi Mode, don't feel very great, with a somewhat floaty jump, and left & right movement that feels rigid with no momentum whatsoever. Once again, the difficulty is tuned for very young children as well. You have a full 5 jumps that you can use before having to land on solid ground again, which makes it incredibly easy to avoid obstacles and collect all of the coins. Despite this, there is a \"Round 2\" on every stage, where you go through the stage a second time, in order to collect any coins you may have missed. The game forces you to play through this second round, even if you've already collected all of the coins in round 1 (which is super simple, so it's very likely that you would have done so). This makes the round 2 section feel entirely pointless and a waste of time, since it doesn't allow you to collect more than 10 coins, so all you're doing is running through the same stage you just ran through for no reason.\n\nClaw Mode:\nIn this mode, you control a hovercraft with a claw attached to it. You're tasked with using the claw to pick up coins and take them to one of two zones on the side of the layout you created in Classic Mode, all while dodging obstacles.\n\nThe controls in this mode are the worst of all. Where the other modes had controls that felt stiff and rigid, the controls for the hovercraft feel more based around the physics engine, making it very unweildy. This caused me to run into the obstacles and die a lot, and sometimes when I respawned I would spawn on top of an obstacle, causing me to die again immediately, without any chance to avoid it. Another thing is, when you would retrieve a coin and bring it to the drop-off zone, there's no way to release the coin, and it's very finnicky getting the game to register that you've successfully took the coin to the drop-off zone. Easily the worst mode out of all of them.\n\nOverall, the game is simple in it's design, as it was made for children. I could accept this if the rest of the game was good. However, this simplicity also seems to have carried over to the programming, making it an unweildy mess to control. It feels like the developers didn't put very much care into how the game plays, and the graphics, while servicable, are also not very impressive or nice to look at. The game feels like it was created on a very small budget, and it really shows by the lack of care that has gone into it. The concept is nice, but in terms of both fun, and execution of this concept, it completely fails, and I would say there are many much better options out there for puzzle games and platforming games. There really isn't any reason to play this one.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1504366079, "recommendationid": "34688099", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "steamid": "76561197996627259", "last_played": 1504367007, "num_games_owned": 1122}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 9, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
