{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1462654717, "review": "TL;DR; If you want a game to keep you occupied for an hour or 2 or wish to see crowd simulation at work, then at the discount price it is worth a bash. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend paying the full price. But please, read the rest before you judge.\n\n\n\nThis is a relatively simple (and as the developer pointed out - unique) game.  I suspect this game is more an exercise in optimisation (whether it be code, compiler or underlying maths/algorithms) and crowd simulation technology rather than an attempt to make a successful money-earning game.  However, the graphics are simple and well done and the game feels and looks finished though it is limited in scope. \n\nThe aim of the game is to build a pyramid and to do that you need to build fields, bakeries and huts (and extra tax houses if you want to spread out a bit - but the starting one serves) and then employ workers to transport water -> field, field -> bakery, bakery -> hut/tax and bricks -> pyramid.  \n\nThere is probably some ratio of fields -> bakeries -> houses -> total workers/distance but I found that I didn't need to work out what that was in order to optimise as it was simple enough just to mass produce food and thus mass produce silver to employ as many workers as I needed/could.\n\nAlthough this game is quirky I don't think there is much replay-ability in it - good for spending an hour or 2 and maybe for trying to speed run it but that is about it as there are no random events etc.\n\nSomething that could be improved upon is that when you select a building to build, the map could highlight all of the possible places to place chosen building, instead of you having to scroll around trying to find a spot, (which is not always easy because the workers get in the way and the placement \"bounces\" around them).\n\nIf the dev were to extend the options in game, (eg. add a quarry and require you to balance builders/stonemasons/miners) or add some random events (eg. plague, draught) then I would consider changing this review from a negative one to a positive.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596763", "timestamp_created": 1462641591, "recommendationid": "22847927", "language": "english", "votes_up": 67, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198001911536", "last_played": 1462719166, "num_games_owned": 1336}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 8}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1462785759, "review": "This game is simple and limited.

People should recognize that this game is not deep in content or action, but provides a quirky (and what I believe is unique) style of play. As earlier reviewers said, this doesn't seem to be made in the interest of making money, rather I see this as an investigation of new programming styles (and possible a new type of sim game).

I found it fun for the 2 hours or so I spent building my pyramid, and I could see myself playing it again in the future if new features were added or changes were made. \n\nThe cats that appeared around the workers were interesting. It was enjoyable managing the balance between food production workers and the amount of houses for builders that they could sustain. The land surface is not flat and therefore provides a challenge as to where to place buildings and fields as usable spots are limited. \n\nThe game provides the option to translate the hieroglyphs when you hover over the button, and I recommend leaving that turned on because the game does no make much sense otherwise. The developer has made an official guide available which is findable through the main options menu. This guide explains to you the mechanics of the game and its workers and is essential to read unless you enjoy muddling through and figuring things out for yourself.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to people who enjoy cats, city building, and management games and want to waste a couple of hours staring at little workers do their silly moving animation.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507177", "timestamp_created": 1463284364, "recommendationid": "22991282", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198064071208", "last_played": 1463217858, "num_games_owned": 495}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1462655002, "review": "dont buy this game, it looks oke but when your in the game you have no idea what to do. \nyou only see unclear pictures en the guide is unclear as well. if you play for 2 hours you have won or lose, there is an easy way to win and you can do this over and over so after 2 hours of gameplay the game is useless and you waste your money", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488486", "timestamp_created": 1462631061, "recommendationid": "22844982", "language": "english", "votes_up": 31, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198122491366", "last_played": 1462654965, "num_games_owned": 102}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 29}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1466025689, "review": "little challenge and over in 2 hours", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "timestamp_created": 1466025689, "recommendationid": "23576585", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198194163357", "last_played": 1465704086, "num_games_owned": 55}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1463153287, "review": "I kind of like the idea of the game , but the biggest problem I have is that YOU CAN'T FLATTEN THE TERRAIN !!!!!!!
