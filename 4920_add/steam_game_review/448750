Although you can't see your enemies health. The big problem is that it is repetitive as hell. And you keep fighting the same monsters every freaking 10 seconds! Hello!!!... let me explore a bit. Really really frustating.\n\nAlso a problem is that suddenly when you almost at 100% health. You're entire party dies for some stupid reason, because your enemies suddenly unleashes a powerful combat spell.\n\nWant to watch me getting bored.

A bigger variety of enemies could probably make the game much less boring. \n- The character development is way too static. Characters learn predetermined skills by leveling up and you have no choice whatsoever.\n- There is no way to customize the controls.\n- No options whatsoever. (e.g. you can't adjust music or sound volume which is actually pretty annoying after a while)\n- Generic story, clich\u00e9 characters\n\nWould not reccomend.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506184", "timestamp_created": 1460307618, "recommendationid": "22343195", "language": "english", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561197961918996", "last_played": 1460305872, "num_games_owned": 121}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1457143172, "review": "i like the game so far. pretty fun. its kinda encouraging me to make my own with my own story thing i'm doing. i just wish the monsters did't do so much damage. i'm at the hospital & its hard yo get to the top of it with so many monsters spawning & kicking my ass. over & over. other than that... sooper fun. worth the money.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501072", "timestamp_created": 1457143172, "recommendationid": "21631800", "language": "english", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198272468992", "last_played": 1487579039, "num_games_owned": 5}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 6}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1464251220, "review": "^.^ its been awhile since ive played this game and now that im playing it again everything has gotten considerably better. thank you very much for putting in the time and effort and actually listning to our complaints, the sound doesnt absolutly kill me now :P. i would and will definetly recommend this game to others.\n\nthank you Fox\n\n~koga~", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501854", "timestamp_created": 1461479995, "recommendationid": "22603627", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198070413673", "last_played": 1478800477, "num_games_owned": 74}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
