Plays slow, non-responsive, repetative and simply boring.\n\nGame starts with shooting exactly the same astroids for a couple of minutes. I almost alt-f4 right then and there. However I read another review talking about a bossfight that would come after some timer in the top right corner elapsed. Fair enough some boring looking large ship emerged. Because of the length of the ship and the size of the boss shots its almost impossible to avoid some shots. But you cant tell that the shots hit you, only by looking at your health meter. After the boss more boring astroids came and another 3 minute timer... then its was alf-f4 time for real.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553892", "timestamp_created": 1457762831, "recommendationid": "21782266", "language": "english", "votes_up": 35, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198003466976", "last_played": 1457762577, "num_games_owned": 118}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 11}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1477493242, "review": "its not the last stars wars 3d vr game but its a fine indie shooter.\n\nThings I dont like is the option to see leaderboard... its open a web link to the developper page.
