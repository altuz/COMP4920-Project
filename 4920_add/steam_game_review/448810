I mean at least it is a roguelike: grid-based, turn-based, procgen dungeons, permadeath, but sorry, it is very bland and annoying.\n\nThere's a weapon slot and an armour slot but you start naked with no weapon. The first thing you notice is that you have to hold down keys and use the autorepeat because you miss a lot and it takes a lot of hits to kill a single monster. I'm talking like 15 hits is not uncommon to kill a trashy, normal monster; one of the ones with visible armour on can take 50 hits. You're holding that button down, trust me.\n\nThe only thing that stops you getting completely mobbed by mobs and killed on level 1 is the fact that mobs don't pursue you like in most roguelikes, they just sort of move about randomly unless you're right next to them. The tactic is to kind of move round them and avoid them as much as possible, looking for the exit.\n\nAnd that brings me to the map. There isn't one. No mini map, no 'm' for map.\n\nIt's just all rather simplistic. There's no field of view, you can just see everything; mob AI seems really primitive; combat is hold down button and watch your hp and enemy hp go down. The dungeons all look the same at least as far as I got (level 6?). [edit: slightly different wall graphic, I noticed]. You get different looking enemies but I didn't notice them doing anything different to each other. There's supposed to be 3 abilities you can get but I never got one.[edit: got one, see later] You can carry one potion which gives you most or all of your hp back.\n\nGraphics: They aren't bad but they aren't great. There's no animation. The pixel fonts have anti-aliasing on them which looks awful.\n\nSound:  They were obviously aiming for retro 8 bit \"chunky\" sounding samples like old arcade games but the sound effects aren't that good. There's a few little snippets of speech which aren't 8 bit so maybe they weren't going for 8 bit after all, or maybe they just wanted the speech samples to be intelligible.\n\nControls: 4 way movement only. You cannot rebind the controls, it's cursor keys or gtfo. R to rest, e for potion, 123 for abilities (Finally actually got one recently but seems they are limited use).\n\nIti's just-- why would you play this when you can play a better roguelike game for free off steam with more depth, variety and fun? There's loads, from dungeon crawl stone soup to brogue, angband, sil, - there are tons. If you have to be on steam then get curse of yendor- same price, much better game.\n\nI seriously do not recommend you play this game, even if you got it for free.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475644", "timestamp_created": 1488364188, "recommendationid": "30257684", "language": "english", "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 350, "steamid": "76561197993930568", "last_played": 1488366368, "num_games_owned": 4439}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1479930981, "review": "What's the best way to start an adventure to find 7 shards that will grant Torgar the ultimate power?  Armed with nothing but clean underwear and a lunch, of course!\n\nThis is a rogue-like dungeon crawl, questing ever downward in search of the seven shards. It has three difficulty levels, and anyone with a decent sense for this type of game will probably win in \"Normal\" mode after a handful of games.
