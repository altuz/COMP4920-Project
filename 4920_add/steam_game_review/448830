It's full of potential, but none of it is tapped.\n\nAfter I took a sound from 1,001 Sony Sound Effects and rendered it as an ogg in the programs custom sound folder with SpectraLayers, I found the ASMR program loaded the file once I ran the program again. However, my college teacher used Vegas Pro for his audio editing for his radio show for years, and those same 1,001 Sony Sound Effects load into Vegas Pro without conversion, so... my flip just flopped.  This software... is full of potential, but without proper and convenient export and import options, it just isn't as good as a cheap sound effects pack from Sony and a multitrack audio editor of choice, which may simply be the free Audacity.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514581", "timestamp_created": 1493524931, "recommendationid": "31454789", "language": "english", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "steamid": "76561198053438603", "last_played": 1493527390, "num_games_owned": 180}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 24, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 16, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 8}}
