You have to shoot the monsters, before they get to the gold of your castle. Wave after wave, you will get gold which you can spend on skills (such as, more damage, projectile speed....)\n\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to play multiplayer games yet - no one was looking for an online match when I tried. Your best bet is to play with a friend.\n\nRemember, this is an Early Access game and could change / get more content in future updates.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496666", "timestamp_created": 1466129830, "recommendationid": "23606829", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198007278566", "last_played": 1467247005, "num_games_owned": 150}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1461707354, "review": "I like this game conceptually, but I can't recommend it at its current build. There's too little content to justify the current price of $10.99. The dev seems active on the project, so there could very well be a lot more girth to the game in the future, but again it feels extremely Early Access at this point.\n\nOne issue I have is the requirement to forward ports to host a game, especially since the userbase is so small right now. When I've played, there were no games running. This meant I forward ports so my friends and I have a sever to play on, or we can't play the game. While not hard to do, I'm not setting dedicated IPs and forwarding ports for a game. Steamworks should be implemented in a multiplayer only game (currently only multiplayer), or in the least a dev server should be running 24/7.\n\nAll that said, the Dev seems to be working towards these goals. So as long as you're ok jumping on the bandwagon really early, and you're ok setting your network up to play, this might be your kind of game. It currently feels a little underdevelped and too price heavy for me, however.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500330", "timestamp_created": 1461524496, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1461538101, "recommendationid": "22616577", "language": "english", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "steamid": "76561198050405068", "last_played": 1461378646, "num_games_owned": 425}, "developer_response": "Hey, sorry you're not fully satisfied with the game, you can request a refund if you like.\n\nI am working very hard to make the game better and am hopefully pushing out an update by the end of next weekend, you can follow the progress here: https://trello.com/b/sprTWcYU\n\nI disagree with you fully when you call the game \"unplayable\", this is quite misleading and I would not have released the game in it's current state if this were the case.\n\nA matchmaking system is something I want to add in the near future, but you can still see a list of all running servers quite easily, so at this point in time, with the small playerbase, it's rather unnecessary.\n\nFollowing the next update, I will eventually have a few servers up and running, I don't see how it's much of a problem to port forward, people are fine doing this with other games.
