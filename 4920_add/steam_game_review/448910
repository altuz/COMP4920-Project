You build a little town, making your build choices differently based on variations in the layout of the terrain and the victory point conditions that vary in each play-through. It is consistent enough to appeal to (former) chess player in me, but random enough to be exciting and new each time. Random cards and \"dice\" (types of \"people\" you can use each turn to take various actions) keep it exciting, forcing tactical adjustments every turn, but largely without upsetting your larger strategy.\n\nIt has its limits. Once you have really mastered it (I am 5th on the leaderboards) it is pretty much done. You cannot play it 20 totally different ways for 10 years like the best Civ-type games of all time. But the subtleties of tactics and strategy are absolutely fantastic to figure out along the way despite what look like incredibly simple mechanics. So it is an wonderful puzzle game wrapped in a tactical game that is wrapped in a builder game. While I am pretty much done with it, it will stay in my memory as one of the best games I have ever played.\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509289", "timestamp_created": 1504398285, "recommendationid": "34698723", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 12164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 633, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561197972465191", "last_played": 1507152601, "num_games_owned": 312}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502668775, "review": "Well thought-out game. With simple mechanic like chess, yet tons of decisions to make. \n\nIt's single-player without opponent, so AI does not ruin the experience, you fight the environment to reach the goals. \nSure there's some RNG involved on dice but it just adds to the excitement (and makes the reroll 2 card more valueable ;)\n\nYou can watch the play on youtube or read the strategy guide if unsure before buy.\n\nSome of the negative comments were made on early version. By now it's at 1.06a, tutorial works fine, no glitches (maybe some undo not perfect) and there were two major rebalancing acts.
