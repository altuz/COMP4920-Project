SCIFI WALKSIM\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Had a good hook and a decent engine but the execution is severely botched with technical issues, bad map design, debatable choice of long foreign dialogue with subtitles. Game had good resolutions support, really liked the ambiant track. Too bad.\n\nNot much to say. The game starts abruptly but hooks you in quick. Russian voice over is unintelligible to my ears but I can still appreciate the inflexions and tone and the subtitles were doing decent enough a job. Liked that they did not try to make it pointlessly gritty. Early plot hook is having to evade a facility populated by a cowardly survivalist ex employee and a crazed expert systems in charge of the defense grid. I went through a few corridors populated by lasers. All the corridors led to dead ends. Eventually as I was backtracking trying to figure out whats wrong I clipped through areas of the floor I shouldnt have have been able to trapping me. The game seems to feature no save game option either. The audiovisuals were okay but there was a lot of motion blur. The same metal corridors get old quick and the interactivity was far and few between.
