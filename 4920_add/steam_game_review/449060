I know, these games aren't really good and you may don't like them, but the story who is behind of this game is amazing. Not anybody can come with a great ideea for a game, and not anybody can make it alive.\n\nAs you probably already know, on Steam you can find a lot of cheap games, but really bad games: without graphics, without gameplay, without ideeas.\nYes, this game may be called a \"phone game\", that kind of a game who are downloaded by kids from google play when they don't have something better to do, then they're finishing and uninstalling it, but the ideea is still great. As I said, I think there was some work, so the game deserves some appreciation.\n\nThe story is awesome, graphics are casual, but awesome for this price, and if you think the game is bad, compare it with other games at this price, you'll see the difference. And yes, the game is short, but you're not finishing it after first 50-100 fails.\n\nI would like say thank you for this game. :)", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1506805892, "recommendationid": "35354386", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198423649102", "last_played": 1506854491, "num_games_owned": 8}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 54, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 49, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
