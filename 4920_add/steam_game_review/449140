But it is an online game.You need to register and log in just for the singleplayer.This might not be an apparante fault,but consider once the server's closed, you can't play forever, and we'd have no way knowing when they will close it.And once that's happened your ships are lost forever.I can't play knowing my playability is in other's hand.\n\n             I used to host a private Minecraft Bukket server and i had to stop it. Those who played on it were very sad. I don't want it to all happen again.\n\n2.The game lacks long-term playability. When you've beaten all the ships you actually wins this game. I mean , for example ,look up Reassembly.It's the same genere but it is an open-world where you can get all kinds of encounters and play for domination. YOU ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING. But Istrolid simply lets you win/lose a game without much of the bigger picture.\n\n3.This game's players seems to utilize specially-crafted ships for purpose of defeating others.While i admire their creativity, I might also suggest that this approach forces others to develop counter approach vehicles that's equally massive. In the end itis a game of LET'S BUILD THE TITAN AND BE DONE WITH IT. This game's design deprives the players of the freedom to play their style\n\n4.Graphics.The battles are dull without much excitement(graphically). Like Starsector, when you have a Paragon(Tri-Tachyon BB)and fire everything at another BB IT LOOKS GORGEOUSE. Watch some vids and get an impression and you will see how these two games compare. Also see Reassemby. When you fight fights in Reassembly you get an impression of really in space----engines smoking,plasma flying,missiles shooting everywhere--which istrolid lacks in all respective.\n\n5.Plausiability.Why the HELL would anyone want to put two ships and destroy eachother? And how are they manufactued? IS there a way resource is collected? And do people really die in these battles? These are all questions that requires answering. in other words the game lacks in background.Other games lets you fill in the blanks(ie,Reassembly)but i feel hard-pressed to fill in the blanks when i have so cartoonic starships flying around.\n\n6.Physics. How are those ships turned without an RCS and what does those damn wings do and why are there no repulse when i fire those damn cannons?why does my bullet lacks stopping power? amd why am i slowing down in mid space?\n\n(Okay i have to admit that except point 1 i could have got along with all those problems.)\n\nSo in all my advice is look around and see if there's other games in this genere you like and compare before you start serious playing. BECAUSE THIS ISN'T THE BEST GAME OF this GENERE IMHO.Unless the devs give us the server files.InThatCase i will certainly reconsider my review.\n\nEDIT:Oh FOGOT ABOUT THE DAMN PAID DLC.DAMN EXPENSIVE AND WHAT, JUST FOR ROTATING BLOCKS?MIGHT AS WELL BUY REASSEMBLY.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480228", "timestamp_created": 1486640754, "recommendationid": "29799661", "language": "english", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198177797231", "last_played": 1486558506, "num_games_owned": 14}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 26}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1488140849, "review": "very good game, but needs a better tutorial so people know what they are doing", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1488140849, "recommendationid": "30205471", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 17694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198122644078", "last_played": 1503676623, "num_games_owned": 3}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1467269477, "review": "Amazing game.
