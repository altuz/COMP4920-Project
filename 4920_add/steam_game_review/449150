Unfortunately, this game isn't one of those unless you love similes. Most of the game is spent trying to figure out how to use which similes in the descriptions of the locations and action. \"A cigarette burns in an ashtray like an ember in the campfire. Take the ember, give it to the mysterious man to melt his demeanor.\" I know noir loves similes and metaphors but while it's a novel concept to make them a part of the gameplay, it just isn't well-executed enough to have a game full of them.\n\n Now there is a walkthrough that takes you through the game that's accessible from the main menu but I feel that is the developers admitting that the gameplay is confusing at best. \n\nIn short, this game feels like something schoolkids in the 90's would play in the computer lab to help them understand similes but would turn them off to both PC games and word play.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512677", "timestamp_created": 1464974466, "recommendationid": "23365072", "language": "english", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198042406940", "last_played": 1464973849, "num_games_owned": 77}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1478557406, "review": "This is an extremely playable modern day text adventure with an extremely slick UI.
