You stumble upon wasted money and time most of the time, but you encounter small gems sometimes. It is my version of gambling, if you may call. This time, it's a puzzle game, wrapped in a 3rd rate high schooler story with worse rated anime humor. Nope, we definitely don't have a winner this time. As you can get the clue from my description, [i]Calcu-Late[/i] wasn't among the best of my experiences within the genre. Sure it is cheap, but for a one dollar puzzle game, you can get something better here around.\n\nOur protagonist is a boy named James, looking forward to the start of his summer vacation. Unfortunately, he has finals to deal with first. On his way out, he convinces a suicidal girl (?) that life is worth living and goes on with his life. As he crams for the finals, he falls asleep and meets the Goddess of Mathematics, Seshat - who is no other than the nameless suicidal girl from school. From there on, he is to enter the Godly Olympics of Science as the Champion of Seshat. He is to overcome challenges, compete against champions of other deities and snatch the winning prize. What would be the prize? Something, anything he can wish for...\n\nWell, the story seems curious enough, but there is a truckload that would declare this game simply unsatisfactory in a moment. To begin with, the game is exceedingly short. You have 2 trials + 3 competitions against other participates, and that's it. You are at the end of the game. Considering its length, there is no room for either decent story progression or character development. It's all cheesy, superficial and dry in all departments. The dialogue feels completely artificial, social interactions are synthetic like public service ads and the narrative is riddled with typos. Display qualities couldn't be considered amongst the best either, with simplistic soundtrack and amateur artwork.\n\nThe game? Well, from all puzzles that you'll encounter, only the first one is a mathematics puzzle. Next is a card matching memory game, then \"lighting pillars in the proper order\" game - repeated twice, only change for the second time is you gotta do it while running away from an opponent - and pulling stones from bags, so you gotta be the one to pull the last stone for the last challenge. I must say that final \"puzzle\" is completely luck related rather than being brain-scratching. You lose, you lose, you lose and huh? You win? How? Yeah, that kinda thing. Only the first puzzle is even remotely challenging which would ask for you to \"calculate\" anything. The rest? Garbage if you ask me.\n\nYou can play the game in 4 different difficulties, in which only the numbers involved will augment to raise the frustration, not the challenge. If you complete the game in either hard or expert difficulty, you are allowed to watch an epilogue - which is the sorriest, nearly the most clich\u00e9 gag ever. That's it.\n\nCan I recommend it? Maybe if you have stumbled upon it free, but then again it is still more frustrating and cringe worthy rather than being entertaining. Sorry guys, nothing to do here.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590624", "timestamp_created": 1501252839, "recommendationid": "33857216", "language": "english", "votes_up": 42, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 210, "steamid": "76561198139328230", "last_played": 1501245997, "num_games_owned": 1770}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 23, "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 8, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 15}}
