It uses simple \"dating sim\" mechanics (resource management), but describing it us such or calling it a \"yuri\" game would be rather misleading. While there is some romance involved, it\u2019s very mild and tactful and some routes are rather about friendship than love. And above all, it focuses on the main character and her life and hardships.[/b]\n\nWhat make this VN especially unique is the setting \u2013 it\u2019s a loose adaptation of an English novel [i]A Little Princess[/i] and the story is deeply connected to the context of Victorian-era London. The writing and art-style do a very good job of creating appropriate climate and representing the strict social divisions of XIX century\u2019s England, which are crucial to the story. Unlike many western VNs, that copy the formula of Japanese ones to the point of setting the story in Japan, this one is has a strong identity that makes it stand out from the crowd.\n\nThe storytelling itself is a bit slow and often painfully sad and cruel, but the climate and characters make it captivating most of the time. Especially the protagonist, Sara, is a wonderful character that it\u2019s hard not to fall in love with. Some might find her a bit too flawless, but she\u2019s definitely not a Mary Sue, having a lot of interesting traits and reacting in believable ways to the misfortunes that fall upon her. The rest of the cast is also rather interesting and they all show significant amount of depth in their respective routes. Every one of them have a different relationship with the main character and most of the time it\u2019s very interesting to see how their relations develop and change through the plot twists that the main storyline offers. I would describe only three of the character routes as explicitly \u201cromantic\u201d, but all of them had impact and a lot of charm (even with all the sad/unsettling elements in most of them).\n\nThe art and music are very good, with sprites, backgrounds and CGs being both nice to look at and characteristic. CGs are not that numerous for a game that can take around 15 hours for full playthrough, but their quality make the experience very pleasing to the eye.\n\n[b]Maybe the weakest part of the game is the resource management mechanic, which is very much dependent on RNG and doesn\u2019t by itself add any real challenge to the game[/b], unless you strategize to unlock multiple routes in the first chapter. Also the choice of \u201cevents\u201d, that means choosing with what characters you\u2019ll interact, is the only thing influencing the story \u2013 there are no dialogue choices per se. The UI can be a bit confusing at first, but the whole gameplay, while extremely limited, is at least very thematic and adds to the mood of the game.\n\n[b]In summary, while its not without some faults and limitation, I think A Little Lily Princess is a great and exceptional game - a true must-buy for any VN fan.[/b] The yuri romantic themes are a bonus, but the game doesn\u2019t rely on them that much and can prove a great experience even if you\u2019re not a fan of the genre. Even at full price it\u2019s a good value proposition and when on sale it\u2019s hard for me to not recommend it not just to fans of visual novels, but anyone who\u2019s interesting in reading a touching, memorable story.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "timestamp_created": 1506861146, "recommendationid": "35379911", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 807, "num_reviews": 30, "steamid": "76561197970898913", "last_played": 1506858250, "num_games_owned": 236}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 95, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 89, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
