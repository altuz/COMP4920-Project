Reminds me of some of the good stuff that came out of Newgrounds back in the day, but smoother and with better production values. I've only beaten the first world so far but the challenge is already ramping up with new obstacles and mechanics. Levels are short with collectibles for replayability and there looks to be quite a lot of levels.
