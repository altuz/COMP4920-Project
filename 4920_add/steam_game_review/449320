Wow.\n\nStumbled into this game while I was looking for something else entirely.  Ended up abandoning the search for that something else the instant this caught my eye as I definitely could not resist acquiring this.\n\nThose who grew up in the early 80's will probably remember playing the original game here.  I've played this very, very often and these days I have to use a Commodore Emulator to do so.  The original was a challenge and continues to be such even today.\n\nAcquiring the achievements for the Emerald Dinosaurs has been pretty easy.  One thing I definitely noticed with the Emerald Parasaur is that it has the added difficulty of being able to break out of its cage after 10 - 20 seconds.  That was a nice surprise and it even comes with a sound effect that is opposite of the one used when the cage is created.\n\nWant to let all your eggs hatch all in one go?  No problem!  You can do just that if you desired it...as long as you're not doing the Classic Game Mode.  You will want to make sure to be very patient and avoid Dino Mom during all of this, too.  You can even hatch eggs on the same platform level as others.  I have had somewhere around 10 dinos on one platform in cages.  Just beware you don't accidentally run into one that is not caged as sometimes it will be very difficult to see them amongst the pack even though the uncaptured ones stand out in that they are not darkened.\n\nOther than the added difficulty as well as the extended storyline that is incorporated into even the multiple tutorial levels the game plays true to the original.  Instead of a percentage guage counting down toward Devolution you get a meter appearing right beside you when you are hit.  Only the final 10% of the countdown will show any numbers, which should make that one achievement regarding that quite easy to obtain.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512712", "timestamp_created": 1465542092, "recommendationid": "23480298", "language": "english", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561197985581635", "last_played": 1504216253, "num_games_owned": 448}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 6}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1473559014, "review": "The original early 80's Dino Eggs was one of the best games every made, then and it holds up now (the original). I spent countless hours on the C-64 playing that beautiful game.\n\nThis remake (or rebirth) is quite poor when compared to the original. The graphics, sound effects and music are just goofy. The original has that feeling to it of an amazing game that was ahead of it's time. This new version is just not even worth it in my opinion.\n\nI was excited to see this, but it just doesn't do justice to the original - Sorry for the poor review.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509305", "timestamp_created": 1473559014, "recommendationid": "25454290", "language": "english", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198007982638", "last_played": 1473558761, "num_games_owned": 475}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 4}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1476651451, "review": "I'm kind of a sucker for new versions of the C64 games of my youth. I downloaded two different \"Telengard for PC\" games. I mourned when Jumpman - Under Construction quietly vanished from the internet. So when I saw this game newly released, it wasn't even a question.\n\nGameplay is mostly the same, barring new features and the fact that (for some reason) dino capturing takes two button presses. The graphics are good, though it took a little doing to figure everything out.\n\nMy big gripe with this updated game is the sound. A lot of the sound effects chosen simply DO NOT FIT. I know it's hard to think about immersion with a 2D single-screen platformer, but some of the sounds kicked me out, and hard. Those audio footprints HURT, dammit.\n\nOverall, can I recommend this renewal of a classic? Reluctantly, yes. If they could get the OK to use the C64 sounds (and maybe graphics too), I'd feel a lot better about it.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1476651451, "recommendationid": "26077561", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197996832320", "last_played": 1477278068, "num_games_owned": 337}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1468592440, "review": "Having played the original since I was 7, I was quite intrigued by this reboot.

If you played the old C64 or Apple version back in the 80's, it is based off of that with a few tweaks.  The story and puzzle mode give it a nice breath of fresh air.   It is definetly a game for a niche audience, mostly the older players who grew up on these type of siimple and casual platform games.    \n\nThe game mechanics are quite easy to master, with some new elements on how to spelunk around.  IE jumping onto the spider threads.  Can easily be played with a keyboard or controller.   You can even set it up to work off of a simple directional controller and one button if you like, as in the original  ( I think you can )\n\nI did have an issue with the game not wanting to initiate my Nvidia graphics card on my laptop, as the generic Intel Graphics chip doesn't seem to be able to handle it.  However, this is easily remedied by just going to the Nvidia control panel and assigning the game to run on high performan graphics.  Many laptops tend to use both systems and sometimes the Nvidia setup doesn't recognize that a game needs to use it, when it is set to auto detect which is best.\n\n4.2 / 5    For the nostalgia alone, it is worth the price.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500499", "timestamp_created": 1468748466, "recommendationid": "24368921", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198043875069", "last_played": 1505092346, "num_games_owned": 3190}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1471114318, "review": "You can get the C64 version free online and it's more fun that this.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488408", "timestamp_created": 1471114318, "recommendationid": "24892536", "language": "english", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 170, "steamid": "76561197970482328", "last_played": 1471114209, "num_games_owned": 286}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 14}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1465610221, "review": "Ah, memories!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460859", "timestamp_created": 1465610221, "recommendationid": "23494221", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198012162430", "last_played": 1465610179, "num_games_owned": 376}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 18}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 8, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
