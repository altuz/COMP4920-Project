While nominally associated with that game, Serafina is not the protagonist in this title. Instead, she is one of the possible future rulers of Darzia. And may well have ended up that way, except for the little matter of the death of the previous queen, and suspicions that land on each of the claimants, leaving the protagonist Odell Perin as regent. Now you have to figure out how to rule while trying to find the true killer.4\n\nPerhaps you yourself will take the crown.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1493274150, "recommendationid": "31388402", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 362, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "last_played": 1493310310, "num_games_owned": 445}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 6, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
