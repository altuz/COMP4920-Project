Repeated, tedious cutscenes you cannot skip. Annoying way of moving in a HO scene (you have to pan but it really turns into frustrated click and drags that move your vision a milimeter at a time), plus when you screw up in a minigame you can't just restart it, you're forced to go through the entire process before it will let you retry.\n\nI really wanted to give indie HO games a try but damn. This was bad. I even got it on sale and it wasn't worth it. \n\nIt's just not a good game, story wise or functionally.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501992", "timestamp_created": 1505982700, "recommendationid": "35100069", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198141635216", "last_played": 1505982357, "num_games_owned": 184}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 7, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 5, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
