I ummed and ahhd about upgrading because the price even with the voucher was quite a lot for me and now I can't even use the new features of substance designer 6 because it's not supported in either my game engine (unity) or my 3d modeler (modo indie).\n\nUnreal Engine got an updated plugin on feb 17, 3 days after launch, unity sitting here 3 months after launch with nothing (just the old plugin that supports sd5).  Modo got an updated plugin but it doesn't work in modo indie. I don't think that will ever come because The Foundry put Modo Indie on the backburner for now.\n\nedit: update: 28 August (!) now - 6.5 months' after release and SD6 STILL not supported in Unity. I NEVER would have bought it if I knew I'd be waiting this long. I really think someone has let us down here and I will not be jumping on upgrades for this software again.
