COMMANDS AND COLORS: GREAT WAR puts you in the driver's seat for tactical-operational level combat in the trenches of the Western Front during World War I, playing as either British/Commonwealth or Germans, from the Battle of Loos in Autumn 1915 through the Somme in Summer 1916 and Vimy Ridge in April 1917.  The turn-based action takes place on a hex-grid map with unique terrain for each scenario, using an unspecified game scale -- probably platoon/section -- in which both ranged and close combat occurs, including off-map artillery and four unit types:  infantry, bombers, machine guns and mortars.  Navigate barbed wire, occupy craters blown by your artillery and miners, and claw at enemy trenches as you \"bite and hold.\"  Win by acquiring Objective Medals for occupying enemy terrain, destroying enemy units, exiting units off the enemy's edge of the map, or using the right cards.  Play by utilizing HQ Tokens, Command Cards and Combat Cards, which limit your choices while providing unique capabilities to your units.  Success depends on the luck of the draw and combat dice throws, but more importantly, your ability to construct a winning strategy for the battle at hand using your available resources.   Mindlessly charging the enemy quickly results in defeat.  Victory requires identifying your strengths and executing your battle plan step-by-step in response to your enemy's maneuvers and the HQ tokens and cards you acquire.  The result is a game in which you must think and re-think your plan as the battle develops, often frustrated by your inability to use all the resources theoretically at your disposal.\n\nAs an amateur Great War historian, I like this game a lot, especially because it puts you at the infantry battalion level of decision-making, dynamically responding to an ever-changing battle front using a range of options limited by factors beyond your control.  In every scenario you occupy the front trenches, facing enough unknowns that you will have to forge a bespoke method in order to accomplish your objectives.  Re-playability is high and there are variable AI controls.
