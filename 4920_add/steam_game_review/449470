Because my cousin was in an accident and is now a paraplegic. Stuck in a bed 24/7 with only movement in his right arm (but unable to open/use his hands) we bought him an eye tracker for a computer so he can \"click\" with his eyes. This game will finally give him a chance to play something, and we can play together too!\n\nThe only thing I would ask from the developers if that they could add a way to auto log-in every time he opens the game, as well as a way to exit the game without using the escape key, so he doesn't have to ask a nurse when I or another family member isn't there.\n\nAgain, a huge thank you to the developers. You have no idea how much a simple game like this means to him, and me as well.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535957", "timestamp_created": 1486180248, "recommendationid": "29683834", "language": "english", "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198003999306", "last_played": 1486246752, "num_games_owned": 22}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486948325, "review": "This game is a grind, but other than that, there is other stuff to do like; Wars ( Semi-free-for-all), chat with other players, and do quests.
