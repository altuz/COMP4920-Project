I've only played a few hours yet but what I've saw in this time already made me think that it's worth every penny that it costs. Good ambience, good story and good voice acting. The music is awesome (You can buy it separately if you wish, I'm thinking about doing so since I got stuck one of the tracks in my head for two days and that means a lot for me since I usually don't pay attention to videogame's music) and will make you feel like you are in Crowswood.\n\nFor what I've saw the game's durations is around 6 - 8 hours of exploring, crafting and learning about the mysteries of the university.\n\nIt has some minor bugs, but you won't find any big problem since the developers are seem to care a lot about that and they're constantly updating the game to fix those minor problems. \n\nBesides that, they're are putting new content for free, and that's always a good thing. \n\nSo, in overall, I really recommend this game for its price.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1498154824, "recommendationid": "32647758", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561197999456054", "last_played": 1492890344, "num_games_owned": 402}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496746357, "review": "Great platform and puzzles.
