In this game you will fight Adolf Gutler,The Illuminati, and other creatures.\n\n[u]Release Date: 25 Mar, 2016[/u]\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\nThe games difficulty lies in the fact that movement is relatively sensitive, and touching an enemy will cause death. There are no lives in the game so it is an instant restart upon death. The bullets shoot out of the front of the plane in the center, so you cannot just sit on one side and shoot, because you risk getting your plane clipped.\n\nThe bosses in the game are relatively easy. Shooting the boss 10 times will cause it to recede and fall back. It is not as gratifying as seeing a big explosion, but it works the best with the 8 bit graphics due to the constant gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are styled in an 8-bit fashion. It is all very blocky, and simplistic. The colors palate is limited with most levels using three colors in general.\n\nAll in All [u]SAMOLIOTIK[/u] is a really nice Casual Game!\n\n8/10 From Me\n[i]Sweep[/i]", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522415", "timestamp_created": 1503229203, "recommendationid": "34371541", "language": "english", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 166, "steamid": "76561198147052088", "last_played": 1503137305, "num_games_owned": 159}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500428666, "review": "This game is fucking aids", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504838", "timestamp_created": 1500428666, "recommendationid": "33642052", "language": "english", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198173228318", "last_played": 1500429718, "num_games_owned": 70}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 7}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503271540, "review": "I like vodka", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500294", "timestamp_created": 1503271540, "recommendationid": "34384310", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198062137252", "last_played": 1498590064, "num_games_owned": 69}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500586810, "review": "headache.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503476", "timestamp_created": 1500586697, "recommendationid": "33682095", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198271684032", "last_played": 1500588647, "num_games_owned": 24}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1501728330, "review": "A great game if you need an excuse to break your keyboard.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501969", "timestamp_created": 1501728330, "recommendationid": "33983802", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "steamid": "76561198268051184", "last_played": 1502148153, "num_games_owned": 301}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 171, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 138, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 33}}
