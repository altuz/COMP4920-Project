The system is somewhat vague at first but once you get used to it you'll soon find yourself browsing the internet (the Waking World as it is called in-game)  to connect items, symbols, events and places.

[/h1]\n\nThis game is not for the faint hearted or the superstitious. It is an ARG that blends fiction with reality so well I sometimes had to step back to reassess what is real and what is not. There are fake websites to explore, passwords to find, and even blogs to read. Which organisations are real and which ones are made up? Are any of the things mentioned have a real life basis? What is supernatural and what is more grounded? Because of the whole disorienting nature of the game I would recommend playing it late at night when your mind is more susceptible to mind screws. The game's creepy nature is at its strongest then.\n\nBut that I admit is not the focal point of the game. The point is to research. Lots of it. Working out what the clue is telling you, researching for the keyword, and inputting it. It is like an intense version of crosswords except the words are esoteric and you have some help with the spelling. Some of the puzzles link up with previous answers being clues to the next ones. Other times you have to divine (yes, that is a verb, fight me) the answer from reading fictional documents. The puzzles are not just limited to the game itself. As said before you need to find passwords for the fake websites linked to the game. They not only provide clues to the puzzles but also the plot itself.\n\nAh yes, the plot. Easily the hardest puzzle of the game. What on Earth is going on? I was left with more questions than answers but I think it is not necessarily the game's fault. For one this game is a spinoff of another game The Black Watchman, which I have not played yet. For another like all good puzzle games this one never did give up its secrets so easily. I might understand more in a few day's time after some musing. All I know is that sleep clinics are creepy.\n\nThe presentation of the game itself is gorgeous, The well-polished steampunk aesthetic is bolstered by vintage photographs and nice colour schemes. The voice acting is beautiful. The symbols are a nice touch and I like how responsive the game is. Every action has a reaction and you know what is going on.\n\nOverall, this puzzle game got me to question reality and amazed me in how immesive it was. I think the game has also made me smarter, considering I now know waaayyyy more about spiritualism, ghosts, and death than your average person.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1499472970, "recommendationid": "33358402", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "steamid": "76561198298749789", "last_played": 1499470264, "num_games_owned": 44}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499598271, "review": "Impressive [b]ARG[/b].
