Also, since there is no penalty for mistakes or reward for accuracy (e.g. new puzzles are only unlocked when previous stages are cleared perfectly), there is no reason to not resort to trial and error when the logic needed to solve a puzzle becomes more complicated.\n\nPuzzle Quality:  Several puzzles had (and some may still have) multiple solutions, which was not the developer's intention.  I'm sure that designing good logic puzzles with only one solution is no easy matter, but it's not very difficult to find these alternative solutions, so I'd say that this game needed a bit more attention before release.  Additionally, with the exception of the occasional larger puzzle, the game doesn't seem to become much harder as the player progresses.  With neither difficulty scaling nor new gameplay elements, Tenrow simply isn't engaging.\n\nThe developer is already talking about a sequel with another 40-50 levels and an algorithm for autogeneration.  Such an algorithm might justify its own game, but the 40-50 handcrafted levels would be better added to this one instead.\n\nIf every $3 puzzle game like this were of similar quality and length, I might have had a different opinion because my expectations would have been different.

Unfortunately, the difficulty never really ramps up from the intro how-to-play example level and it only introduces one extra mechanic fairly early on that actually makes the puzzles easier, rather than more challenging.\n\nThe music is quite nice and I have said really positive things about colour palette options in the past (Lyne, for example), but although palettes unlocked at certain levels, the game doesn't tell you when new colours are available.  And for some buggy reason, you can't actually return to the main menu from the options, so you have to quit and re-open the game to change anything.\n\nOverall, the concept is cute but it completely lacks challenge - I finished the game in less than an hour and you can 100% the achievements within about 30 minutes, which makes 0% sense to me.
