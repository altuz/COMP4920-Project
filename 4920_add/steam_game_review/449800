{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1505941168, "review": "This game is based on the extremely popular anime and manga of the same name. As such, the basic premise of the game is fighting giant naked dickless monsters while also being steampunk Spiderman with swords. The game also follows the story of the anime very closely, most of the cutscenes being practically 1:1. I will do my best to write an unbiased review, but I really REALLY love the anime and this game, so it'll be kinda hard.\n\nPROS\n-The visuals are somewhat appealing. They managed to create an environment and characters that remain accurate to the anime, but in 3D animation.\n-The gameplay is interesting and unique. Being able to fly through the air in a hack-and-slash game is very cool and definitely is worth a try.\n-Long story. The game's story is based slightly loosely on Season 1 of the anime, but manages to condense it while also adding extra stuff to keep you enamored.\n-Easy to grasp. The control scheme (at least with a controller) is easy to get the hang of and play around with.\n\nCONS\n-The Titans are too easy. Even on hard difficulty, the enemies are very easy to kill if you can do it right, which makes fighting them boring sometimes.\n-Repetitive gameplay. This isn't so much a problem for me, as I don't mind repetitive gameplay, but it can be a problem for other people. The levels are almost all the same. Kill the Titans, kill the boss, next level.\n-Lack of character diversity. This may seem like I'm whining more than an actual problem with the game, but here we go. The game has 10 playble characters:\n     -Eren Jaeger \n     -Armin Arlert (weak as hell. Seriously. Don't play him unless you have a death wish.)\n     -Mikasa Ackermann (strong as hell, but not as strong as you-know-who.)\n     -Sasha Brause\n     -Connie Springer (deals way more damage than Levi if he's leveled up.)\n     -Christa Lenz (even weaker than Armin. Seriously.)\n     -Jean Kirstein\n     -Levi Ackermann (best character n/a       12/10 would rek femel titan again)\n     -Hange Zo\u00eb (no one plays her, sadly \ud83d\ude22)\n     -Erwin Smith (SHINZOUUUUUUUU WO SASAGEYOOOOOOOOOO)\n\nBut even with these characters, the roster still feels empty without Reiner, Bertholdt, Annie, and Ymir.\n-No one plays the multiplayer. If you have 3+ friends who like the game and will play with you, then that's good for you.\nBut trying to find a public match to join is damn near impossible during the week. The weekend is when some turn up, but not many.\n-Requires quite a lot of farming. The game uses a gear leveling up system and this gear requires lots of materials and lots of money to do it, meaning more farming.\n-No mouse support. This game suffers from what I like to call \"Console Port Syndrome,\" during which a game that is ported from console to PC is given little to no mouse support. However, it is not impossible to play this game without a controller, as I have rebound my controls to give it the best playability possible, which will be listed below.\n\nW,A,S,D=                  Move forward, left, backward, right (respectively)\nLeft Shift=                Fire Anchor\nSpace=                     Jump/Boost\nF=                             Attack\nQ=                           Decisive Battle Signal\nR=                             Toggle Combat Mode\nE=                           Interact\n1=                          Cycle Items Left\n3=                            Cycle Items Right\n2=                            Use Item\nP=                            Change Team Objective\nO=                           Provoke Titan\nLeft Arrow Key=     Rotate Camera Left\nRight Arrow Key=    Rotate Camera Right\nT=                         Rotate Camera Up\nDown Arrow Key=  Rotate Camera Down\nEsc=                         Pause\n\n(I recommend that you change the controls before you start, as it can be hard to pause and change them once you get into the game. Personal experience.)\n\nOverall, the game is very good, but could use some improvement. However, I enjoyed the game enough that I will be purchasing the sequel to this game, Attack on Titan 2, when it is released in early 2018. Definitely get this game if you like the anime, but you should wait until it is on at least a 50% sale, as it is certainly not worth sixty bucks.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556072", "timestamp_created": 1505940740, "recommendationid": "35091960", "language": "english", "votes_up": 27, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 11240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 515, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198206092171", "last_played": 1507159963, "num_games_owned": 17}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505266813, "review": "Make sure you have a ps4 or xbox controller hookup, keyboard is not viable to play with.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513004", "timestamp_created": 1505266813, "recommendationid": "34911519", "language": "english", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198065358350", "last_played": 1505354863, "num_games_owned": 136}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505526753, "review": "It's surprisingly really fun and pretty authentic to the anime.

But I say differently - a true fan will berate the product if it's not to their liking, because it doesn't capture the essence of what it should be - in other words, it doesn't stand up to the franchise. And, having been following the anime series and been reading the manga - and if you haven't, I suggest you do so -, I like to think it's in the last category I would find myself in. In other words, I will not spare this game, just like a Titan would not spare a human.\n\nThat been said...\n\nAfter I've played this game for a few hours, I have to say that I'm positively satisfied with what I see. The game matches the environment within the Walls to a near-perfection, matching the hardships that the members of the Survey Corps have to go through to defeat the Titans.\n\nThe game follows the premise of the story, with some clever liberties taken to have you feel like you're part of not only the game, but also the setting. One of the examples I can recall, is when the Colossal Titan starts busting the wall to get the Titans to go in, you have to shoot the Titan in order to weaken it, so it doesn't bust it from top to bottom. In the anime and manga, there's no such thing, as Eren impulsively charges at the Titan, at which point this one as disappears as quickly as it appeared.\n\nFor the story to progress, you have to carry out the main assignments given to you, with the optional side-quests to save your fellow men and add a few more Titan kills to your count. You can lose yourself to these side-quests, but don't go and forget what your main assignment is. Some of such assigments are time-based, and failing to complete them will cause you to lose the game.\n\nWhen I said that you go through the hardships of the Survey Corps, I wasn't lying. You need to check the state of your gear and resupply every now and then; luckily, there are usually ressupliers in the area - provided that the Titans haven't eaten them, though I'm not sure they don't do so in the game, or at least drive them away when the zone becomes too hot -, and if there are not, you can always restock on items from your fallen comrades.\n\nOn the note of a zone becoming too hot, believe me when I tell you it's possible for that to happen. You can find yourself surrounded by Titans, have your line paths blocked by the moving Titans, have them counter-attack you - watch your six on that one -; it's not impossible for them to grab you, at which point you'll have to fight your way to freedom, otherwise you'll go down a Titan's throat as food, and in history as a Survey Corps statistic.\n\nNow, the playability. It took me a bit to master the controller - yes, controler; I found the game having too many movement variables for a keyboard, and therefore virtually unplayable in that fashion - into having just the right timing to go in for the kill. And I'm still learning; although, I will admit that my controller is an old model (maybe some 10 years, if not more), which would fit more into the category of compatible rather than adequate. (With the instructions on the screen saying 'A', 'B', 'X' or 'Y', when those buttons are numbered 1 through 4, I sometimes mess it up. My fault, not really the game's; the search for a new controller will begin soon.\n\nNot having addressed this earlier, the visuals are a perfect match for the anime counterparts, from the characters' likenesses to their movements as you jump and swing across the rooftops and alleyways. Add to the fact that the game is no short on action, this is a must have I doubt you'll feel disappointed with, wether you're a fan or not.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1506176660, "recommendationid": "35154894", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1281, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198003482564", "last_played": 1506738117, "num_games_owned": 131}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1504629380, "review": "Germans: \"WE WUZ TITAN KILLERZ N SHEEEITT\"", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485800", "timestamp_created": 1504629380, "recommendationid": "34760086", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198138190332", "last_played": 1496258885, "num_games_owned": 97}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 10}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506442729, "review": "Controlls make it almost unplayable.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477212", "timestamp_created": 1506442729, "recommendationid": "35225041", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198066402466", "last_played": 1506442702, "num_games_owned": 571}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 12}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505982549, "review": "is bad game\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.421623", "timestamp_created": 1505982549, "recommendationid": "35100047", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198167807347", "last_played": 1505685259, "num_games_owned": 38}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 41}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 1483, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 8, "total_positive": 1198, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 285}}
