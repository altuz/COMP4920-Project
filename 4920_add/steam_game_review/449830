You complete Extra 100% and get to know everyone you will thank me later when you play unlimited later on. there are these \"emotional\" moments that you will understand if you complete Extra fully all routes. I won't say anymore so trust me when I say this do every single route on Extra and you will understand Unlimited for most of the parts and it will bring a sudden emotional moments.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "timestamp_created": 1506317126, "recommendationid": "35196779", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 3237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3237, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198014389865", "last_played": 1506571215, "num_games_owned": 255}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 154, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 147, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
