This game completely erases the tones set up in the previous two games in the series, Muv Luv and Muv Luv Extra. The original Muv Luv, as you should know by now, was more like your typical dating sim visual novel, where a good majority of the girls are attracted to you and you have the choice of dating whichever one you choose. Extra took this a bit further, and added a more deep tone to it, while having that dating sim aspect still present. But then you have this game. Muv Luv Alternative. They took the design of the other two novels and literally threw them out of the TSF straight into the mouths of a Fort-class BETA. The carefree attitude of the MC Shirogane Takeru is annihilated, as he suffers similarly to Okabe Rintarou in Steins;Gate. The suffering never ends, and you get dragged through the mud and blood right along with Takeru as he stumbles and falls, but also while he learns to accept reality and face what he's been running away from this whole time. Of course, this is already along the lines of being spoiler, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nThis game in particular completely threw me off. I was expecting to be able to have some fun and lighthearted adventures as Takeru comes back for his 3rd installment in the series. Of course, if you read the store description, you immediately know that something went very wrong this time around. You have to watch the suffering, watch the pain and despair, and you can't do anything to help as you are merely the observer. It's painful. It may give you borderline PTSD for a while. Every happy moment seems like it could very well break any moment, it's actually rather stressful as well. You get enveloped in the chaotic world of humans being at war with the aliens known as BETA and it pulls your attention even stronger the deeper you dive into it. The science is real, the reality is actually rather realistic. There's no magical powers, no plot armor. Every threat is real, nobody is safe. That's war. The tech is more advanced sure, but you get explanations for nearly everything that is used, and it all makes sense. This visual novel is Legendary. Truly God-tier. You do need to walk through the first two games to get that deeper connection with the characters, but it's worth it. Play this game, you seriously need to experience this story.

As far as VNs go, MLA is just, well, really really long. It's about as long as all 3 F/SN routes combined for comparison to other visual novels - it will probably take the average user around 60 hours minimum to read it. So why invest all that time in it? Because it's worth it. MLA is [b]the best[/b] visual novel I have read to date. Somehow against all odds, a crappy generic school harem spun off into an amazing apocalyptic sci-fi story.  It's a story filled with violence, despair, and sacrifice but the core theme of not giving up no matter how dark it looks for the hope of a better tomorrow is stong throughout, and to see the character's journey to completion is an experience I will never forget. \n\nHowever not every diamond is without its flaws. Alternative's comes in the form of its predecessors, Extra and Unlimited. These... aren't great. Extra is a generic school harem as previously mentioned, and while Unlimited is the source of the spinoff that Alternative follows up, it was kind of mediocre. If MLA is a 10, E and U would be a 5 and 6 repsectively. Now, as much as I'd like to say \"you can just skip them\", for a story like this you can't. The main routes of E and just one playthrough of U are required - I would in no way suggest just reading a synopsis for it. So that's probably 10-15 hours of time you'll have to invest into something not really that good to get to something amazing. It's definitely worth it in the end, so don't let it throw you off and just power thorugh to get to Alternative.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512609", "timestamp_created": 1506019519, "recommendationid": "35111222", "language": "english", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197998032482", "last_played": 1506019508, "num_games_owned": 171}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505792091, "review": "truly satisfying story from the highly acclaimed visual novel of all time.\nreally glad i found these back in around 2009.\n\n\nThankfully, the game worked flawlessly, no glitches whatsoever until i finished it, translation was good, the all new english voices was also neat.\n\nbut i want the original english can eat shit as well lol.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505376", "timestamp_created": 1505792091, "recommendationid": "35057275", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 1155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1155, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198084810376", "last_played": 1506186012, "num_games_owned": 9}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506336567, "review": "First of all, first thing I will say about this game is:\n\nThis review is spoiler free and DONT READ ANYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME, OR MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE ANYTHING YOU READ IS SPOILER FREE. If you think \"Naaah, it can't that bad, I've been spoiled before, im used to it\" Let me you tell you this, if you screw this up, you WILL regret it so much when the moment comes. My friend almost murdered me for spoiling it for him after I experienced that scene and had to tell others about it. I've regretted it ever since. This game is a shining gold nugget that you DO NOT WANT TO DIM\n\nThere is one scene which will give you an experience which you will never experience again in your life time and if you ruin it, you WILL regret it so much that you honestly want to go back in time and hit yourself for not being careful in the internet.\n\nNow onto the review.\n\nIt's the best of the english translated Visual novels right now and I mean THE BEST. It's been at the top of VNDB most rated and popular visual novels since... I started reading visual novels ten years ago? Anyway, a long time\n\nHow to say it shortly... This game delves into the original Muv Luv's Unlimited story ark world, so it's huge plus if you've read the previous title, as you will understand more about the world you're plunged into. Visual novel is centered around alternative telling of our world and its post apocalyptic world and the problems that rise from it. If you've read the previous title Unlimited story ark you can probably surmise that this is a far cry from the love comedy genre that original Muv Luv was.\n\nIm not going to tell you anything more than that, because well... You really have to experience it yourself.\n\nNow then this story has incredible soundtrack, story, characters, drama, character development, lore, voice actors, world politics. I honestly cannot think any \"bad\" things about this game. It's just so good that you just either don't notice them or that there isn't any.\n\nOnly \"bad\" thing about this game is that it's LONG and I mean LOOOOONG. It took me a WEEK (probably longer, I can't remember) to read the damn thing (I can't remember clearly but I think I read atleast 4-8 hours a day, give or take some breaks doing something else) and during that week, I felt like I was in HIIIIGH heaven. Probably exaggeration but one thing is for sure, this visual novel will break your mind.\n\nFor me, a visual novel being long is a good thing if the reading is exciting and captivating. For some people it's bad a thing, they probably want to do something else than spend whole day reading a book you cannot stop reading. This visual novel is one of the rare visual novel's that keep surprising you with \"It didn't end here? It's still going on? HELL YEAH\" and when you're finally at the end you feel drained and depressed that the thing you've read has ended.\n\nSo to close this all up.\n\nMake absolutely sure not to spoil yourself about this game and prepare a LOT of time to read this, preferable alone at some summer cottage during weekends in middle of nowhere where noone can disturb you.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502918", "timestamp_created": 1506335765, "recommendationid": "35200150", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 160, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561197976543691", "last_played": 1506346261, "num_games_owned": 244}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505936285, "review": "Greatest story ever told.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505376", "timestamp_created": 1505936285, "recommendationid": "35090831", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 8252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8053, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561197984577537", "last_played": 1507142961, "num_games_owned": 453}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505805213, "review": "When I first read Muv-Luv Alternative a few years back, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. Coming off of Extra/Unliminted (the prequels), the series didn\u2019t seem to have gotten off to a good start. But after indulging in it for nearly 100 hours over 2 weeks, I was so engaged in this visual novel that I can firmly say that it is my favorite of all time. \n\nAlternative completely deviates from the atmosphere and tone set in Extra/Unlimited and takes a more serious, gritty approach to sci-fi worlds. It takes the characters established in Extra and the setting introduced in Unlimited, then pushed them to their maximum potential. \n\nMuv Luv Alternative is an epic in the full sense of the word. It is a long journey that takes you and the characters through many trials and tribulations. This novel manages to fill every crossroad with meaning and growth. It invests so much into its characters to make every loss painful and every victory as heartfelt as possible. \n\nI have no good way to relay all the emotions and respect I have for this title. Alternative is truly one of the best sequels to exist being much better Extra/Unlimited. In fact, I\u2019d even go venture to say that it is one of the best sci-fi adventures I have ever read. But more than that, the story has left such a great impression on me that I can\u2019t forget any of the moments in it. I became so invested into the world and the characters struggling through it. Everything they felt, I felt as well. \n\nOf course, Muv Luv Alternative is not without its flaws, but I\u2019ll let other reviews sift through those fine points. It\u2019s not something for the faint of heart as for how dark and gruesome it can get. But, I wanted to share a bit of my own feelings and experiences with this work to hopefully inspire others to witness this masterpiece. Muv Luv Alternative is an experience like no other, and as such, I highly recommend it to anyone with even the slightest bit of interest. . \n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500434", "timestamp_created": 1505805213, "recommendationid": "35059474", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198047187058", "last_played": 1506060530, "num_games_owned": 79}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505806434, "review": "An experience quite unlike any other. \n\nNever have I been so emotionally manipulated by any other sort of media. When things began turning for the worse I had a difficult time coping with and accepting what was happening.\n\nIt's not a perfect story by any means. It has some pacing issues, a ton of exposition at certain points and personally while the main character's development is exceptional some of his irritating personality traits from the original persist throughout the novel. Yet, if there was any experience in any media I could convey to others, Alternative would be it.\n\nPossibly both Alternative's biggest boon and sin is the necessity of its predecessor. While the original Muv Luv had many cringe-worthy absurdities the player had to trek through, it was imperative to really see what the main character is fighting for and how that influences the actions he takes, along with how the world affects him. Above all I feel, is that it really helps immerse the player into the MC's role and mindset. This particular element is what makes some of Alternative's best and infamous scenes so emotionally compelling. I have never been sent into such a state of disarray by one certain scene and most people who have read MLA will know what scene I'm referring to.\n\nThe writer supposedly sold his ancestral home to fund this game(which originally released in 2006) and it really shows with the production values far exceeding that of most modern VNs. The in-game sprites are all lip-synced and blink, the sound-design is top notch, there's a dedicated UI for when you're in a mech, a ridiculous amount of CGs, a ton of sprites including minor characters and a ton of sprite animations for both the characters and mechs.\n\nIf anyone has any shred of interest in this, I implore them to go in as blind as possible. I wish the in-game menus and promotional material didn't spoil a bunch of elements but even so I can whole-heartedly recommend this. I can't guarantee it'll be your favorite VN or anything(there are many who would refer to Alternative as such) it's something that will certainly stand out among its peers and present you with an experience only it can offer.\n\n\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500434", "timestamp_created": 1505806434, "recommendationid": "35059674", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 732, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198077098317", "last_played": 1506662859, "num_games_owned": 85}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505914776, "review": "Best VN of all time, now with a superior new translation.

Before I begin my review I'd just like to say; on the off chance any developers or translators read this review, thank you for this series.\n\nOk so in to my review.\n\n1st. If you have not played both Muv-Luv & Extra you WILL miss out on a great deal of the emotion this game has to offer. Both Muv-Luv & Extra are tiad very heavily to this game. Be aware however that Muv-Luv is very different from Extra & Alternative, yet it's story is intertwined with both.\n\n2nd. The story in this game is amazing! I'm not going to go into detail because I truly believe it's best to go into this game with only the knowledge of the previous 2 games. I will say that the story is very long but doesn't feel slow. Many things happen and the story isn't afraid to move forward. \n\n3rd. As a VN (Visual Novil) your choices seem more contained then in the last two games, but I don't think that's a bad thing here. This game contains a lot of action scenes and pulls them off perfectly in my opinion. That's a difficult thing to do with a VN.\n\nI don't really have anything else to say with out getting into story specifics, so I'll simply end by saying that I absolutely recommend this game.

The story covers so many different topics that I don't think it's possible to really put it into a genre. As much as people will tell you that you need to read the first ones, I've already lost so many potential readers to the monotony of the first two games. But as almost every person that has gone through the journey of the three games will tell you, the payoff is insanely worth it. It's got more action, strategic tension, and plot twists than Code Geass. The characters and the world that you're thrust into contain personality, grit, and lore that simply can't be found in anime with time and dialogue constraints. But the visual novel also never forgets to make you laugh and make connections with the people struggling with you. At the risk of sounding like a complete tool, I think Muv Luv Alternative has the best story that any Japanese medium has to offer. \n\nThe new translation is an improvement off the fan translation overall, and many of the physics concepts that are explained throughout the novel are easier to understand as a result. Sex scenes still exist in this version, with the images zoomed in and edited to avoid showing any nudity. I do not imagine that this will impact the experience of many readers. Only the most explicit of dialogue is cut, and Sekai Project clearly made an effort to stay faithful to the original as much as possible with the limitations of Steam. Also, English vocals are thankfully much improved from the original. As such, I don't think it's necessary to go through the trouble of patching the game to 18+. \n\nThe production values on this visual novel are incredible in some aspects, and mediocre in others. Many people do not like the art style of the characters, but the animation quality of the action sequences and the broad set of facial expressions that come with the art style more than make up for it for me.\n\nI'm going to be one of the dissenting opinions and tell you that if you have a history of dropping shows after the first few episodes bore you, then maybe you should just skip straight to Muv-Luv Unlimited. This will severely degrade the experience, but even this degraded experience is amazing by itself, and most of the foreshadowing and flashbacks in Alternative refer to Muv-Luv Unlimited. Though Muv-Luv Extra and Unlimited combined are shorter than Alternative, this doesn't change the fact that Extra by itself can take 15-20 hours of your time, and is notoriously generic and boring for those seeking a strong story and tension. \n\nI'm bad at conclusions.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1506332273, "recommendationid": "35199457", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 2052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1314, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198001239809", "last_played": 1506233399, "num_games_owned": 219}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506201349, "review": "A month ago I was convinced that visual novels were a waste of time.\n\nBut then I discovered that Muv-Luv had been released on Steam.  I'd been interested in trying this series for a long time because I'd seen figures of the mecha and they were really cool so I thought I'd give it a shot.\n\nMuv-Luv was an epic awakening that there was value to this medium.  I laughed.  I sobbed uncontrollably.  And I eagerly awaited this sequel.\n\nMuv-Luv Alternative loops time again after the end of Ultimate bringing closure to the events in the Ultimate time-line and answering many of the things that were left unexplained and mysterious:  Where is Sumika?  What's the deal with Alternative IV?  Who is and what is the deal with Kasumi?  Will Takeru ever grow up?  How can you have so little mecha action in a story about mecha?\n\nThis visual novel is considerably more linear than even Ultimate which might put you off if you are expecting gameplay, but that is not the point of a visual novel.  The story is long, satisfying, profoundly upsetting and occasionally horrifying.  If you like mecha, there's a heck of a lot of mecha.  By the end you will feel the wear and the strain of the campaign.  You will mourn friends lost.  You may still... hate Takeru, but trust me you will love everyone else.\n\nThis visual novel has been a truly incredible use of 29 hours of my life.  I'm so glad that there's been a western release so I could experience it.\n\nTime to buy a truly astounding number of mech figures!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500866", "timestamp_created": 1506201199, "recommendationid": "35164035", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1015, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198166967397", "last_played": 1506200360, "num_games_owned": 58}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506144553, "review": "I don't remember the last time I cried like a bitch while playing a game.
