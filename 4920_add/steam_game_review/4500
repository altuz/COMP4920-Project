Simply an amazing game.\n\nStory & Atmosphere:\nSTALKER games are known for being very atmospheric shooters, and quite tough ones too. But they are also pretty unstable. The first game, Shadow of Chernobyl (SoC), kicks off the series with your character \"Marked One\" waking up from a roadcrash. He was found at the crashsite of a so called \"deathtruck\". A fellow stalker (a scavenger) was surprised to find Marked One alive among the dead bodies that are usually in those trucks. Marked One has amnesia, but apart from being alive among the dead ones at the truck, he also has a very curious PDA on him. A PDA with a single task description: Kill Strelok. With the \"mutual\" help of the local trader Sidorovich, Marked One starts his journey to find out about himself and the many mysteries within The Zone. But the real showstealer here is The Zone itself, consisting of the ghastly exclusion zone around the Chernobyl NPP, dripping with an amazing atmoshpere. The sounds and the music, the creatures roaming the area, its all real good. Stalkers gathered up around a campfire, playing their guitars and telling jokes in russian, the group of howling dogs in the distance that are munching away on their recently caught prey... Everybody does their own thing, their AI is impressive at times, and it feels pretty alive to me. The grim look of the terrain, the spooky underground sections... the unique atmosphere is simply amazing and very few games do this as well as Stalker does.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game itself plays as a semi-open-world FPS shooter with RPG elements. The shooting is challenging and quite satisfying. The starting weapons like the makarov pistol can be really bad, but i think that it adds to the survival aspect of the game. However, later weapons are more accurate and deadly. The bulletarcs actually drop abit over distance, making longer ranged weapons like the Vintorez difficult but fun to use. The game can be pretty punishing, with deadly creatures (humans and mutants alike) and many dangerous areas. Like the radiation pockets for example: Radiation can slowly build up when you stroll through it and it can kill you later if you dont deal with it. Your gear keeps deteriorating depending on use, so make sure to check and loot enemies, check stashes and search the area whenever you get the chance. Not everyone is your enemy though, so theres no need to go guns blazing at every moment. There are neutral stalkers and different factions with their own standing towards you. If you scratch one of them off, you count on the others to act agressive to you aswell. But being nice to other stalkers might even give you discounts when you trade items with them. The game has several fairly large areas with loadingzones to connect them with, and the mission sequence is fairly lineair. But you're free to travel between practically every area, though some areas require some sort of progress to access. This could be a specific mission item, or simply better gear to survive. \n\nRPG?:\nThe further you go up north, the more dangerous the Zone becomes. This shows the RPGesque parts of the game. Marked One doesnt level up or gain exp, but gathers up better gear little by little. STALKER has alot of items too. Not just different guns, but suits, ammotypes, medkits, vodka etc etc. Some items are better geared for some situations then others. Hazmat suits for example provide better protection against radiation and extreme heat while Spetznaz suits mostly offer better bullet and explosive protection and even the lower tiered bandit suits can be useful for being very cheap etc etc... Marked One can also make use of the valuable \"Artifacts\": these are strange items found in the Zone, attracting the flock of stalkers for the value these items have in the outside world. Artifacts can offer the user various status effects, but their effects are balanced out by side-effects. For example, there is an artifact that regenerates health easier, but causes the user to be weaker against certain other kinds of damage. Or an artifact that boosts endurance but decreases electric protection, or radiation reduction vs weaker to bleeding etc etc. So the benefits of these artifacts depend on how well you manage them.\n\nBuggy & mods:\nI think the worst part of this game is how unstable it can be, with all sorts of crashes and glitches. Alot bugs are patched by now, and the community does a good job of fixing alot too with mods, but some are still there and can still be frustrating (and even amusing) at times. The community brings me to another point, and that is the ridiculously huge amount of content it creates. Some files are easy to edit, (you can make some easy tweaks yourself in no time) so this leads to lots of content and a large games series with a near infinite amount of modcontent out there. AMK adds more to the vanilla SoC experience, ZRP focuses on bugfixes, and thats just for SoC alone. Lost Alpha is a (very buggy but very interesting) reimaging of how SoC should have been, and Call of Chernobyl adds all the areas from the 3 games combined into 1 massive modular sandbox. \n\nTheres so much to say about this game, but heres the gist of it:\n\nPro's:\n+ Truly amazing atmosphere\n+ Freedom to wander in the Zone\n+ Challenging\n+ Item managing\n+ Lot's of different mechanics\n+ Impressive AI\n+ Near infinite amount of content by community\n\nCons:\n- Notoriously unstable\n- some mechanics unrefined/tough to get into\n\nIf you're not afraid to get your hands dirty on it's learning curve, ageing graphics and some of it's trouble shooting, then you should definitely try this gem and the rest of the series... Even if they can feel uncut at times."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505108230, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509853", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34877224", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198041639081", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1501883924, "num_games_owned": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3556}, "timestamp_updated": 1505108230, "received_for_free": false, "review": "S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

WAIT, WHAT?\nYes, you heard right. \nFirstly, SHADOW OF CHERNOBYL is the most atmospheric game I've playerd since the original SYSTEM SHOCK. It features a real post-apocalyptic world that is the most immersive I've ever seen, unlike Bethesda's FALLOUT series it takes itself fairly serious which works to its benefit. While the Bethesda games are quite good in there own way, they are nowhere near as captivating. Their over-the-top humor feels completely out of place, here it is not present.\nThe enemies are tough, and unlike DOOM or other fps you are not a bullet sponge. Most enemies can one or two shot you. A simple bandit with a sawed-off shotgun blasting you from close distance will kill you with one shot even with a full health bar.\nI felt reminded of the good old days when I was a teen crawling through space station Citadel, carefully peeking around the corner in fear of bumping into a very powerful enemy. Unseen dangers, be it invisible mutants or traps (anormalies) also await the careless stalkers.\nThere is an interesting backstory and lore to satisfy RPG/adventure fans as well. Tons of loot. You need to eat/sleep/rest. There is no fast travel here, it's an open world to explore on foot and you WALK - no poppin' up the map and \"teleport\" to section A.\nCreatures have a decent AI and behave realatively natural. Some mutants are extremly creepy and powerful, requiring a bit of tactics to take out, goin' Rambo on most foes is simply not an option here. Several factions can be joined, and this requires some planning as well, unlike FALLOUT you cannot be everybody's darling.\nNOTE: SHADOW OF CHERNOBYL has its flaws. In its vanilla state it is an unpolished gem. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND one of two mods (from www.moddb.com): either Autumn Aurora (2.x) or Complete (2009), which eliminate several flaws and bugs of the game and upgrade the graphics.\nSecondly this game is quite difficult and I recommend playing this on one of the more difficult settings for the full effect of adrenaline and fear.\nSHADOW OF CHERNOBYL also spawned two inferior sequels, CLEAR SKIES (avoid) and CALL OF PRIPYAT (good, not great, but only with mods).\nI am very hard to satisfy when it comes to games, so far this is only the 3rd game that has been able to draw me in for several hours and keep me interested, the other two being SYSTEM SHOCK 1 and DARKEST DUNGEON."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505776785, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505144", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35054580", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197987175590", "num_reviews": 79, "last_played": 1506115285, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 393, "playtime_forever": 5895}, "timestamp_updated": 1505827961, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1]!!Important note!![/h1] \n\nI strongly recommend you download the stalker complete 2009 mod (link below). This mod will improve many things; like A.I, The Hud, Weather, Textures, Graphics, and it will also introduce some new features; like a sleeping bag, repair kits, ragdoll effects, Faction reset, and freeplay (After completion of main story). I couldn't play the game without it, due to wonky character movement.    \n\n\n[u]What I liked about the game[/u]\n[list]\n[*]\tOutstanding level design. Tons of exploration. You can explore the radioactive ruins of Pripyat and Chernobyl. I've always enjoyed post-apocalyptic games; this is one of the best. \n\n[*]\tLarge selection of weapons, especially assault rifles. You can also modify your weapons, with a scope or silencer. The game also has a massive selection of armour, from a stalker suit to an exoskeleton suit. \n\n[*]\tA large variety of side quests; like assassin, finding quests (Artefacts, weapons, and samples of mutated animals), and my favourite arena. \n\n[*]\tBrilliant story. I will definitely consider reading the book that inspired the game, If anybody else is interested, the book is called Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. \n\n[*]\tAddictive gameplay. The weapons have a real kick to them. You are constantly saving in-game money to buy bigger and better weapons and armour.\n\n[*]\tThe PDA provides all the information you need; like maps, diary entries and tasks. One of the cool features of the PDA is that it provides a list of all the top stalkers in the zone; you start off at the bottom and work your way up to the top; you can view you stats at any time while you progress.  \n\n[*]\t The zone holds many dangers; like anomalies, mutated animals, bandits, hostile factions (Monolith and Mercenaries). \n\n[*]\tImprove your stats by equipping artefacts.[*]\tSome unnerving sections. \n\n[*]\tMultiple endings. The good ending is quite powerful and emotional.   \n\n[*]\tGood quality cut-scenes when shown.        \n\n[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]\n\n[*]\tShame there isn't a quicker way to get around, especially when you are wearing an exoskeleton suit.\n\n[*]\tShame most of the NPCS aren't voice act\n\n[*]\tMore items; like more types of food and medicine. Although the game has a large selection of Assault rifles and pistols, it would have been nice to see a larger selection of over types of weapons; like submachine guns, Shotguns, and exotic weapons like the Gauss rifle. \n\n[*]\tBugs/Glitches; like enemies shooting through walls and enemies being unaware that they are being attack.\n\n[*]\tBuildings could have done with more furnishings.\n\n[*]\tCan be quite frustrating sometimes, especially at the start. \n\n[*]\tMore dialogue options with NPCS.      \n\n[*]    I wish secret stashes didn't show up on the map. \n\n[*]   I don't like the idea of side quests repeating; I rather them just end. \n\n[/list]\n\n\n\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u] \n\nA fantastic game. I will definitely be playing Call of Pripyat and Clear sky.  The game is very atmospheric; you actually feel like you are in a nuclear waste land. If you enjoy games like fallout or any of the Metro games, then I highly recommend you buy this game. \n\n[h1]9/10 Modded [/h1] \n\n[u]Link[/u] \n\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-complete-2009"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505377301, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34944429", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198105688881", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505377207, "num_games_owned": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1547}, "timestamp_updated": 1505377301, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Fun gameplay in an eerie atmosphere but wow that was the dumbest ending ive ever seen"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504925826, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502664", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34827736", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198121771885", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1505580586, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 254}, "timestamp_updated": 1504925826, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Always hear about it, never tried it.

I've gone through the game in vanilla almost 10 times, so surely there has to be something in it that pulls one in.\nPros:\n\n- How can I not mention the atmosphere. The game has gotten famous for it's glum, sullen and hostile mood with no intrusive humor for humor's sake every 2 minutes. The only humor are the various pretty amusing jokes told by Stalkers at the campfires. And no le traditional/orchestral music during gameplay. Just great gloomy and dark ambient music. Other people, often even the fellow neutral Stalkers are jaded and hostile to you in basic conversations. Maybe only the Barkeep really has some level of actual care for you since you are an (in)famous figure in the Zone. Rest of the cast is pretty much bitter, desperate bastards. I can understand it though since life in the zone is highly brutal, demanding and unforgiving. I think the difficult but fair and gut wrenching combat only helps to further make for the desperate survival atmosphere, I mean what if the game had standard irl gun military shooter balance, wouldn't surely be quite the same.\n\n- Anomalies. Spots in random places where laws of physics have been corrupted in various manner and if you step into the area of effect of an anomaly, for example you can get crushed by gravitational force to red mist and giblets, you can be electrocuted, burnt, get chemically burnt by abnormal acid goo and what is there.\n\n- Artifacts. Items spawned by aforementioned anomalies, these give you various powers such as extra stamina, bulletproofing etc. But the lower level artifacts tend to have inconvenient side effects such as constantly emitting radiation which you must counter balance with a fitting other artifact. But the rare artifacts don't really have negative effects.\n\nCons:\n\n- Game is badly optimized vanilla..I know the reason for why it is so, so don't talk shit to me.\n\n- So much cool stuff was cut.\n\n(kinda tired as I'm writing this, will surely revise later)\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505208769, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499706", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34897738", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198239320230", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1473635773, "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3445}, "timestamp_updated": 1505208769, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Best open world ever if you like action horror RPG and most importantly \nAH NU CHEEKI BREEKI I V DAMKE !"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506766782, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502194", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35331415", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198106834723", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1504547417, "num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 11769}, "timestamp_updated": 1506766782, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Cheeki breeki"}]}
