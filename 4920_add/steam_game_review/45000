It's a tower defense. I like them, and find the mass-killing of enemy units pretty darn euphoric. It's an alright tower defense. For me, it's just \"okay,\" though. With stuff like Sanctum 2, Kingdom Rush, and the many other tower defense games available on Steam, Sol Survivor doesn't feel like an entertaining use of my free time when I could play any of those other titles or some of the ones I haven't even tried instead.\n\nIf I had to try to pinpoint why I didn't like Sol Survivor, I suppose I would say that nothing was very interesting or memorable, except for some somewhat amusing letters from a commanding officer who begrudgingly admits you did a good job after each mission, which was fun. There weren't any other characters you interact with, no cool-looking enemy force, no cause to get behind, no great music, no cool art style, no humor (other than that officer), and it just felt really bland due to these things. I completed one-third of the game, and have no interest in continuing it. I bought the game for about $2.49, and still woudln't recommend it at that price, unless you watched gameplay on Youtube and thought it looked amazing."}]}
