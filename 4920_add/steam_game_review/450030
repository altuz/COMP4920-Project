It crashes nearly every time a new area is loaded, and the gameplay is tedious, holding your hand so hard as to force you to physically hide from nothing in two separate ways just to teach you how to hide. In addition, the opening section alone has you backtrack at least twice. That's twice in less than 15 minutes. Audio is poor, too. Just generic stuff that adds nothing to the atmosphere. Voice acting is horrendous as well, and the intro video is literally a terrible, 5-minute long meme, with 30 seconds devoted to the player character dancing the Gangnam Style dance to what I'm assuming is generic free music. There's no way the developer took this game seriously. It's Youtube fodder and nothing more.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625738", "timestamp_created": 1460752587, "recommendationid": "22436481", "language": "english", "votes_up": 129, "comment_count": "5", "author": {"playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198067580475", "last_played": 1460752958, "num_games_owned": 2052}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 16}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1467062129, "review": "This game has to be one of the worst, buggiest, low-qualitiest \"horror\" game I've ever played. Everything feels like a chore to do and it's just not fun, scary or interesting. \n\nHere are just some of the things that make the game unbearable... These can simply be passed as poor dev choices.\n\n-Crouch button is set to only be usable under \"exceptional circumstances\".\n-Jump is buggy and makes your character have a stroke if you hold it.\n-There is NO WAY to look at your objectives AFAIK unless you run up to a specific point in the map/game that tells you what your tasks are. Many times I'm greeted with the text \"You need to finish your tasks first\". It is SOOOO confusing to know what you're supposed to do especially after you get \"outside\".\n-Graphics are from 2001.\n-Sound effects are nerve-wrecking. Your character keeps coughing and sneezing all the time even when you're wearing a GAS MASK... with a \"normal\" voice.\n-There are no texts setup for notes etc. It's all just screen rolled where the subtitles making text overlap.\n-ALT+Tabbing causes game to f*cking BREAK from time to time. There's also random crashing with loading screens. \n\nBasically all you do is just run around in the same areas over and over and over and over again. I've seen Early-Access games that work better and have better content than this game.

Maybe am looser but i am refuse to play that 4th level anymore. Game is not soo cool and interesting to force me to do that. I am too bored here already.
