It's a creative and thematic idea.\n\nUnfortunately, it's not so great for puzzle gameplay.  Normally step 1 in solving a puzzle is examining all the parts of the puzzle so you understand the rules and can formulate a solution.  If you do that here, you've just nuked the entire level and left your next iteration no safe place to stand.  I don't see how you're supposed to do anything without intentionally wasting your first try on scouting and then starting over--which might be OK, except that you don't just restart the current puzzle, you go ALL the way back to the beginning.\n\nTo make matters worse, the boundary where you trigger a paradox is unforgiving and unclear:  the \"sight\" range of your past self doesn't seem to correspond exactly to what you actually saw while playing them, and there is no visual aid for your future self to see where is safe to be or warning when you start to get close.  You can be standing somewhere that seems safe and then just suddenly die.  This takes a difficult mechanic and greatly ramps up the frustration for no apparent reason.\n\nAnd--at least near the start of the game, where I played--the puzzles you're asked to solve do not inspire much hope for clever level design.  Towers of hanoi?  Jigsaw puzzles?  Maybe these are just intended to teach you the UI, but if so, asking the player to redo them on every death is pretty dumb.\n\nFinally, the game lacks pretty basic options.  You can't rebind the controls or change mouse sensitivity.  Tedium from waiting for the next time warp could have been greatly reduced by including a simple \"fast foward\" button, but I couldn't find one.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501154", "timestamp_created": 1499552055, "recommendationid": "33387389", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561197987014920", "last_played": 1498342349, "num_games_owned": 277}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 22, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 11, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 11}}
