The first friendly face in this game that can be bothered to talk to you tells you \"LOLLIPOP COMPASS\" and then twists her head around at inhuman angles as you back away slowly down the corridor.\n\nHonestly, that really sums this impenetrable madness up for me. You walk around, you find objects. Sometimes you can pick them up, sometimes they just mysteriously vanish when you go near them. You're never entirely sure whether you're progressing or just dying as the game seems to randomly regenerate the level each time you're killed by a tentacle or zombie hall monitor or jackass in a rabbit mask. \n\nI'm aware that me being unsure of what in the name of god this game is trying to accomplish is not much of a valid reason to vote it down but I walked into a door, the game froze for about a minute and then reloaded the same area with the Lollipop Compass madwoman standing mere feet in front of me and I'm having a hard time believing that any of that was intentional.

Strange.\n\n- The teaser trailers (not the one on the store page) show better graphics and have a lot more in them than at least the first hour of the game. Very misleading.\n\n- The key rebinding in the game's launcher is largely irrelevant, only the \"jump\" entry is actually used for item interaction in game. Confusing.\n\n- The mouse sensitivity is extremely high with no game setting available, so you have to adjust your own mouse dpi. Annoying.\n\n- I did run into a couple of bugs. One was an npc was stuck running into a wall; I could even put a barrel under him.
