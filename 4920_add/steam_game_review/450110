{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1471257181, "review": "While waiting for regular priced HTC Vives arriving in Austria, I bought myself a VR Headset for my mobile phone and accidently stumbled upon Riftcat, which enables you to stream Vive and Oculus VR games from your PC to your mobile phone. As far as I can tell this works really great (I am using an LG G3) and costed me less than 50 Euros!\nRiftcat contains a demo version of Amigdala and that's how I found this game. Now I bought it on Steam and after solving two problems (first I was floating a few meter above the floor and after fixing this I could see a blue horizontal line from Vive's chaperone system, which I could also get rid of) it works perfectly with Riftcat. By the way, my system is an i7-2600K / GTX-970 and the game runs smoothly with less than 50% GPU load using default Riftcat settings (i.e. 1920x1080 with 60 FPS).\n\nI have read a lot of negative reviews about this game, like the slow walking speed, the poor voice acting, and a few bugs. Although this is all true I do not care at all, because this game offers an outstanding atmosphere with good graphics and very good sound effects. Playing it in the night with earphones will give you a good number of really scary moments.\nImho Amigdala is not only an excellent demonstration for the \"power\" of VR, it's also a decent computer game. The level design is good and diversified, the distance between two save points is okay, the (few) controls are easy to learn and work very well. The \"puzzles\" in the game (like finding a crowbar to open a jammed door or checking a security camera to see the code for a locked door on a wall) are fun and not very hard. The slow walking speed is also no problem for me because usually you want to proceed with caution, and the levels are not that large. Not to forget that you can run if you want, but only for about 10 seconds, then you will have to wait that your stamina meter fills up again.\nSo far there is only one thing that could have been solved better, namely that the display for the remaining battery of your flashlight is projected directly into the middle of your view, which disturbs the immersion a little bit. Imho it should have been placed on a less prominent location.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you can play this game in VR it's definitely worth its price, even if you should only use it as interactive demo. But actually this would be a waste since it's a good game as well, and it's sole developer really deserves some recognition for it!\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502670", "timestamp_created": 1471257181, "recommendationid": "24931329", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198018129527", "last_played": 1482059338, "num_games_owned": 139}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1464205617, "review": "Great VR game...
