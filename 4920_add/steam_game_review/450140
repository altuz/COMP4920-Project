Sue the game has a few niggles like the colours can fuck up sometimes and the AI isn't all that smart as every faction that you play against will no matter what always do the same thing but overall this game is still a solid RTS that unlike RTS's of today don't contain the usual orcs vs humans thing. This game is still a great game and still holds up well for its age but i wond not reccomend buying it on Steam as it's an open source game and can be downloaded for fee on the 7KAA website. Either way just get this game and you won't be dissapointed.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1501274951, "recommendationid": "33865229", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198140923850", "last_played": 1506202444, "num_games_owned": 60}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 16, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 15, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
