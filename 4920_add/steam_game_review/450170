I randomly found the game and tried it without any expectation but i got pleasently surprised.\n\nYou control a character with the ability to create clone of herself and have to go through various rooms in order to defeat an AI that has gone rogue. At the exception of some of the latest rooms that can be pretty frustrating, the puzzles are easy enough and the platforming is of average difficulty (i don't think it's too \"casual\" though as the tags suggest. If it's one of your first platformer game you may struggle a lot towards the end). The game is a short experience since it takes about 2~3 hours to complete and not much more to get all the achievements. There are also hidden collectibles to get but most of them are hidden in walls without any hint so it's not really interesting to do.\n\nThe best part of the game for me was the very nice art style and the boss fights which are more creative than most of the platformers i played.\n\nOverall, if you're searching for a short and pretty puzzle-platformer with simple enough puzzles, i would definitely recommand this game for you.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511156", "timestamp_created": 1499990256, "recommendationid": "33524617", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "steamid": "76561198033808029", "last_played": 1499378301, "num_games_owned": 876}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 17, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 17, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0}}
