Sublevel Zero, a love letter to the Descent franchise as a whole, did a pretty good job at filling that void. But now I'm excited to see what the original guys behind it all have in store for a fully-fledged revival of the genre.\n\nIf I had one major complaint, it's that controlling with the mouse feels absolutely dreadful. Both axises just refuse to work together, and moving in a diagonal angle is a nightmare. Even Sublevel Zero managed to nail mouse look down to a tee, so I'm not sure what's going on here. Too much focus on joystick maybe?\n\nOh, and the FOV really needs to allow a wider angle than that, 72 just isn't nearly enough.\n\nOther than that, amazing job for a prototype.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514742", "timestamp_created": 1487074466, "recommendationid": "29919384", "language": "english", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198001505069", "last_played": 1488591443, "num_games_owned": 152}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485329347, "review": "This has been a great demo. I have not had this much fun or been challenged so desperately to survive in a very long time. Overload is the next True Six-Degrees of Freedom shooter. Made by the original developers of Decent (the 90's 6-DOF shooter), this new \"Revival\" of their once great gameplay mechanics and intense level designs has made me giddier than a schoolgirl. The demo is well designed and showcases their classic style of movement and solid gunplay in highly revitalized and gorgeous graphical tech. Some people may be skeptical of flying though tightly designed levels with little more to do then destroy, destroy, destroy. Sure, the aged style of gameplay and lack of miscellaneous objectives that will be present will not engage all audiences; However- with that being said, Doom 2016 is the classic style of Doom gunplay and level design that has once again captured the fun and challenge of the original arena style shooters. So it is with Overload. This game will ensare the visual and auditory senses and create a level of suspense and thrill through complex movement, tight gunplay, and well constructed levels that enhance and challenge both the movement and gunplay in a way that is not present in most modern shooters. While I obviously am a sucker for the classics, I feel I can safely say this game will please most audiences looking for a new tight knit shooter. I encourage all reading this review to try the demo and stick with it for an hour to get comfortable with the controls and have a blast in challenge mode.
