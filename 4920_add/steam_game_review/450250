Also, somehow the game won't even detect left and right trigger button for Xbox One controller.\n\nNo mouse support, playing with keyboard only is a chore for this game. Don't even bother to buy this game if you don't have or don't want to play with controller only.\n\nFrequent crash to desktop on Windows 10, I don't know for the other Windows version.\nI play it like 5 minutes, it's already crash.\n\nI found the temporary solution for the crash. You have to disable or end task any \"monitor/keyboard touch application or software\" (like TipTap some ppl called them),\n\nGameplay wise, let's just called it RPGTD. Tower defense like game, with some RPG element of progression. \nGame is kind of interesting and fun to play because of the RPG elements on it and bring some fresh elements to TD game. It's introduce dynamic city defense system, your city has 4 zone layers which each of them can be turn 360 degree. Kind of cool concept there.\n\nOh, do yourself a favor, use Japanese Voice.

But it's actually a really good Tower Defence game with a lot of heart and personality. Oh dear. This one is going to be tricky.[/H1]\n\nIf it were not for the fact that this game has been ported in such a way that it makes No Man's Sky look competent (and that's a really low bar to set), this would be getting praise from me as possibly the sleeper Tower Defence hit of 2016, it's really \"that\" good. There's a genuinely brilliant twist on the TD genre that makes it well worth a look, combined with a lot of personality and heart that brings the game to life and actually makes it feel like you're fighting in some kind of \"Attack on Titan\" anime of sorts. Where your job is to protect a city by maneuvering giant guns on rotating city rings to face off against huge kaijus that are bent on destroying the last vestiges of humanity.\n\nBut the programmers clearly decided that pressing Unity \"Output to PC\" *BLAP* was good enough, dumped it out on the PC and walked away. The game doesn't even have an exit button. I... wat.\n\n[H1]Wait for it... Waaaaait for iiiiit.... Tiger's gonna break any second now...[/H1]\n\nWAI U DO DIS TO ME.

THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SOLID GOLD IF ONLY YOU HAD PAID A LITTLE BIT MORE ATTENTION. Instead you absolutely need an xbox controller to make the game work properly (gods help you poor souls on mouse and keyboard, you have my sympathies), and even then the game lacks so many basic features that I'm sat here rocking back and forth on my chair going \"HOW DID THIS MAKE IT ONTO STEAM WITHOUT QA GOING NOPE.JPG\"\n\n... and yet I love it to bits, because it's on the same token this wonderful slice of anime TD that has over the top voice acting, terrible Engrish dubbing (seriously, it's so cheesy it should be labelled \"Extra Mature\"), but it does manage somehow to convey a perfect sense of atmosphere and the game, once you get your head around it, is genuinely good. It's great -fun-, I've played non stop and I've had a grin on my face all the way along.\n\n[H1]Come on Hobbes, channel your inner Captain Capslock, we're all waiting for it![/H1]\n\nBUT IT'S A HORRIBLE PIECE OF PROGRAMMING THAT DESERVES TO DIE IN A FIRE.

Crimes against code.

No button inside menu nor a dialogue box. So the only way to end the game is to save it first in the 'setting' menu then press alt+f4. It's pretty a new eastern method even for me, a Chinese.\n\nBut still a good game, especially the designing, which combines the TD strategy with the reaction-test elements(you have to rotate the different circle of towers in time to complete you defence). And since when you have more than one tower in a single line with  the same type, those towers will merge into a bigger and more powerful one, it's also very important to make a whole plan at first time.\n\nAnd the RPG elements are also well planted into the game. Each character(more specific, operator of the defence system) has his own personality and skill set while all those skills have different usage when combined with some of others.\n\nI won't recommand it if you could accept a not well implanted game.
