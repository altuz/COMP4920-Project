This is the same operation that the book and film A Bridge Too Far is about, and this little game reminds me of a paper-and-dice game published by SPI in their magazine Fire & Movement in the early 1980s.  So far the AI at medium has been fairly easy for me to defeat, playing both Axis and Allies, but this can be played with up to four people and several AI levels.  Very good playability, with the full campaign lasting 4-6 hours in single player mode.  I only wish the AI came in crazy aggressive mode because so far it has been a competent but sedate opponent.
