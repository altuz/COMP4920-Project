Shooting ranges need licenses and permits let alone that they are hard to come by. Not only that but using anything above a bolt action rifle is highly illegal unless you pay a god awful amount at some indoor bunker government range to fire 8 bullets from a glock then go home with the target...\n\n...This soothes my gun fantasies.\n\nIf you like guns and have VR get this game. thats pretty much it.\n\nBut note the word \"game\". Its pretty subjective considering the whole game is a glorified demo and mini game collection. this isnt a a statement against H3VR rahter just pointing it out what it is. The minigames are reasonably varied and the range choices are plenty but aside from the amount of guns to choose from, gameplay is pretty basic with target shooting and relatively dumb AI hotdog roll targets. However, the physics on the weapons, damage system of material based objects and detail of everything overall is quite a spectacle including real weapon mechanics employed. It is also early access, meaning more is to come.\n\nIf youre expecting a tactical combat shooter with weapon customization you are in the wrong place. If you are expecting simulated ranges, with targets of plenty and weapon customization and excellent physics then look no further.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511922", "timestamp_created": 1505378517, "recommendationid": "34944692", "language": "english", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198041715709", "last_played": 1505295927, "num_games_owned": 73}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505071347, "review": "A great game for the gun nut in your life.

If you are money conscious like me, I'd tell you that this is not for a hardcore gamer as much as it is for someone who wants an outlet for casual (but realistic) gun mechanics and ranges.  \n\n[h1]Development[/h1]\nH3VR is stable and updates and new content are regular.  The developer is experienced and passionate about his work, and I'm very happy to see he smartly weighs development priorities.  The one real caveat\u2014but well within his right\u2014is that he is protective of how H3VR is used.  In recent times, he's been vocal on his limits for H3VR being used as a vehicle for objectionable content in the public space (or used to promote a product without permission).  From my analysis, his interpretation of \"objectionable\" is already in Twitch/Youtube TOS, so it's not anything outside the norm.\n\nI'd tell you to sign on to the beta branch because that seems to be the route to go for the \"bleeding edge\" in terms of content.  Don't get too flustered if your favorite gun isn't already in there.  From my observation, the limit is available VR-ready models.  I also think he's got his priorities right making the overall improvements to modes and bugfixes.  As a modeler of 11 years, I can tell you modeling is a time-intensive operation, and that time is better served making the platform for your favorite gun as great as it can possibly be.  I personally have two guns I want in the game, but I'm probably going to end up modeling them myself because there's just so many others that could possibly be added (and PDWs is getting kinda dense).\n\nAnton also seems to optimize well because even my R9 390 can handle the top settings and not chug under a metric ton of spawned guns and mags.  Only in the beta branch have I gotten some stutters in one area, but that's why its called the \"beta branch\".\n\n[h1]Virtual Experience[/h1]\nWithin the scope of the game (not VR in general), I'd tell you that it's almost fully convincing.  I like how well thought out the use of the controllers are in terms of replicating the feel of manipulating an actual firearm.  It's clearly optimized for the Vive because some of the actions using the thumbsticks take a little practice.  You really want to consider a third of fourth camera.  That's smart in general, but also because the best locomotion is \"Arm swinging mode\", and in that mode, you can move (but not turn) by swinging your arms around.\n\nI can sit down and just putz around in H3VR for 4-5hr intervals.  It's not lacking in engagement into the environment.\n\n[h1]How I use It[/h1]\nPersonally, I use it like I would use a range in real life.  I've kinda given it more purpose than a casual sim.  Where I would normally spend $20-50+ on a range trip to get some serious practice in (I'm licensed to carry and keep my skills sharp), I can just fire up H3VR and do the same and more (hurray full auto, suppressors, and metal targets).  I by no means attempt to be some Gun-fu master or whatever, but I do want to make sure I have the muscle memory to react in seconds like I would in a real incident.  H3VR saves me money, and it may even save someone's life one day if I (god forbid) have to defend my/others/bystanders/etc lives.\n\nAlso, Anton's weekly devblogs brighten my week, so there's that too...", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506829", "timestamp_created": 1505948814, "recommendationid": "35093545", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561197974317278", "last_played": 1507081216, "num_games_owned": 89}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504634180, "review": "Amazing game.
