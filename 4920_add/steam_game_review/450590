This game is GREAT driving simulator despite how sh`tty everything is made:\n\n-Visuals: straight outta 95, everything looks horrible, edgy circles and empty environments, at the same time the game loads sh`t ton time, I wonder why.\n-Sound: Horrible engine sound, seriously it's TOO loud and not even close to the real engine sound. Very scary crash sound.\n+Gameplay: You have A LOT of things to set, a lot of buttons for your car controls, you can adjust various car parameters, you can pick different cars and tracks, day and night, you can even load yourself with different amounts of drugs and booze, and pretend that you are the main character of the DRIVE movie. There is also a point system with actual driving rules, if you break too much of them you lose your driving license, sadly it's not GTA so no cops involved.\n+Hud: Despite the horrible overall look, this game still has very informative car hud, this game is nice for those who is learning to drive as a simulator, seriously.\n-No steam cards\n-No achievements for safe driving =3=\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=732793997\n\nOverall this game is great as a sale buy or as a gift for a friend :)", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518784", "timestamp_created": 1469665742, "recommendationid": "24565913", "language": "english", "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 320, "steamid": "76561198028673669", "last_played": 1469665197, "num_games_owned": 5466}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 6}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1466832068, "review": "No any key hints in tutorial.

To me, a guy who is in the process of actually learning how to drive, playing this game gives me an insight of what driving can and cannot be like. Obviously this game, being an indie game, will have its flaws and bugs and errors etc. (I only experience a \"space driving\" glitch where I flew from one hill to another unhurt during the free ride.) But in the end, for $5 USD it is a nice buy. If you are interested in a game that gives you a smooth, enjoyable, educative, and mildly hectic driving simulation, then \"Safety Driving Simulator: Car\" is the game for you.
