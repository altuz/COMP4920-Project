I cannot recommend it at the $9.99 suggested price, however, I recommend it on sale at $4.99.  It may be worth $9.99 in the future, but it isn't right now.\n\nThere is only one map.  There is only 1 type of gun.  There are really only 3 enemy types (although there's like stronger versions of each one) which is basically regular soldier, sniper, and tank robot.  I think there may be 7 or 8 teleportation targets that you can shoot to move away from heavy fire or to get the drop on enemies.\n\nThere's several cover barriers and you can dodge bullets.  This game has a lot of polish as the gunplay is very responsive and the shoot a target to teleport is very quick and strategic to do.  \n\nHowever, you will get bored after about 20 minutes of playing.  Going past waves just seem like more enemies versus new tactics or gameplay.  This game needs to add a lot more maps, guns, and enemy types to really be worth the target price.  \n\nI am only recommending this game if the dev keeps updating it.  So basically buy this game if you like the idea and want to take a chance on the dev supporting this game to make it have value.\n\nRate 5/10 very tepid recommendation at the moment, being hopeful that this game will be supported", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1503550276, "recommendationid": "34452649", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 210, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1503547215, "num_games_owned": 846}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
