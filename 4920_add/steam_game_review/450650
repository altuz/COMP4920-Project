Lots of different modes, even though it manages to stay minimalistic and have its own unicity. Overall, there aren't so many \"block pusher\" puzzles that shine over the others.. many of them are just copies or too easy, while this one is long and quite challenging. Very recommended for puzzle lovers!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521559", "timestamp_created": 1505649618, "recommendationid": "35021742", "language": "english", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 114, "steamid": "76561198356141989", "last_played": 1505746878, "num_games_owned": 223}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 6, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
