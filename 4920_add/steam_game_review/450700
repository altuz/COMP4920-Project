Of all the games I have played like this, it is my favorite.\n\nI like the graphics. I love how the little beings dance as they work. Some random friends show up to help, that's always exciting to me! You can really customize the spaces/buildings. Lots of options for flooring and walls. Lots of decorations. There is a lot of research to do to unlock more. \n\nThis game starts out at a great pace, slow enough to figure everything out. It quickly speeds up to a place of slightly overwhelming. When you get so much going on, it is hard to keep track of everything. So if you like a challenge for organizing things, perfect game. Building so far has been straight foward. Compared to a game like Oxygen Not Included where you have to also learn how to use the research you unlock (like electic/plumbing). It is also forgiving when you do make a mistake. Low frustration game.\n\nFor an early access game, this is fantastic. I haven't found any problematic bugs so far in about 9 hours of play. \n\nGreat price for a lovely gem of a game.. if you like this type of game, It is one of the best in its class!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504384", "timestamp_created": 1506455465, "recommendationid": "35229068", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 4131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4007, "num_reviews": 27, "steamid": "76561198392696249", "last_played": 1507176783, "num_games_owned": 154}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505240874, "review": "Where the original game is a decent casual experience where you build a spacebase and attempt to keep it stocked with food, drinks, and crafting materials to keep your tourists happy, this game has recently diverted from that premise.\nThe Spatials: Galactology moved away from the original games' asteroid (with no option to build on an asteroid anyway), adds in wear and tear to the base so your already limited resources must now also be used to keep your base from falling apart around you, and is slowly moving to a hardcore survival mode without giving players the option to return to the casual building sim it started out as.\n\nI have lost interest in the game thanks to the above.

I know this game is in early access, but considering it's a sequel, I do expect the basics to work, especially in the first hour of gameplay. I got misled by the amount of positive reviews.
