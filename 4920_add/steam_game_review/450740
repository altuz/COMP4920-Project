They say it is in \u201cBETA\u201d for Vive and should be fixed shortly. The height control is off to the point it is impossible to aim below you because your head is in the ceiling. I have tried out about 40 games for the vive and this was probably tied for first on the nausea factor due to: simultaneous head movement and mouse movement, as well as the 45-degree jerk left/right with q/e (especially when trying to turn around on an enemy. The alarms in-between waves are also a bit loud and I could understand a lot of people being deterred by the pitch and volume of the alarm warning.\n\nOn the bright side before I had to exit the game in the second wave due to nausea the game did seem to have some redeeming qualities with the jetpack and ammo replenishing that requires you to keep moving around finding enemies. I wish I could have gotten to try out some of the harder waves and the other two classes, but it was too much for me. Headset aiming was very responsive and accurate I think I would like this shooting style if I hadn't gotten nauseous.

You shouldn't encounter the heigh issue again.\n\n2) It's highly reccomended to play with a gamepad while playing Mind Unleashed in VR. Playing with a mouse is HIGHLY more nauseating and should be avoided. We've leaved it as an option but i think we'll remove it since in VR playing with the mouse gives just give to the player motion sickness.\n\n3) The rotation of 45\u00b0 are \"Comfort rotation\" and are kinda a standard VR comfort mode. Basically you rotate without the needed of slowly move the view with your mouse/gamepad so you can rotate more comfortably. \n\n4) We'll reduce the alarm volume\n\nI'm really really sorry that you have gotten nauseated.

However is uncorrect saying that the game support just Keyboard and mouse since it supports also the Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers,which are slitghly more adequate (in my opinion) to mouse and keyboard while playing in VR.\n\nThat said,the game completely support headphones. You just need to plug them and it should work. I think it's a bad configuration on your side but i can't think any reason why the game shouldn't support headphones.\n\nI'm sorry about the poor interface,but we've done it kinda simple since the player isn't gonna use the interface that much. You just play Start,wait for the loading and you're in the game,no more interface-actions required.\n\nAnd what to say about motion sickness? First of all,have you tried playing using Q and E on the keyboard (Right and left bumpers on the gamepad) to use VR comfort rotation?

This is by all means a small budget-game shooter, with the added value of running in VR. All in all it's an ok experience.\n\nPros\n1) Has potential to be a simple straight up shooter.\n2) Cool hover mechanic\n3) Simple way to introduce yourself to first person VR\n\nCons\n1) Shields and screens and effects 3 inches from your face that result you in not seeing the gameplay at all\n2) Out of ammo simulator; the game should most definitely give incentive on finding guns not by running out of ammo but rather by having more strength desparity in some rarer weapons.\n3) Incredibly basic AI; they come for you. Sometimes too quickly and they bunch up. Lots of behind-the-player sneaking.\n4) Some frame dips on higher quality levels\n\nThis game is said to be developed specifically for VR.

I agree that in VR is far from being comfortable,but usually the best input device (other than motion controllers) for VR is definitely the gamepad and this is how it should be played. It's a common and standard thing that VR games should be played with gamepad. However i understand that mouse control could be confusing so we'll block the up/down rotations to prevent nausea if people will chose to use it\n\n2) The shield is close but not as much as shouldn't be,at least in theory. We could easly move it away from your view if it's too much uncomfortable. We'll look into it. The UI has been placed here to be easly seen. Moving it away from there it will result in impossibility to read all the informations. But we'll see if it's improvable as well.\n\n3) The ammo finish kinda quick because there are a lot of pick ups to pick. This should encourage to move and explore the map entirely looking for new weapons and locations and this should encourage to use the class skills more often\n\n4) The AI is fairly simple but we have some mechanics that push enemies to start searching the player. Also we have recently noticed this is a much worse problem especially the first waves since we were trying to set them as the most easier to give time to the player to get used to the game. However i think we'll increase a bit the aggresivity of the enemies of the first wave in order to avoid situation like your.\nHowever if you go further in enemy waves this issue is reduced dramatically..especially in the next Areas.\n\nMind Unleashed has been specifically designed for VR,if we wanted to develop it for Desktop monitors we would have probably increased a lot the speed with much more fast actions and movements. We probably would have different kind of menu and HUD.\n\nInstead we decided with more slow mechanics,with costant velocity both flying and walking on the ground,with enemy robots not to fast to destroy since you're aiming with your head.. And with the UI close enough to give you more comfort and avoid motion-sickness. We also used the Comfort VR rotation on the gampad/Keyboard to avoid artificial nauseating rotations.\n\nWe could definitely do a lot more and improve a lot the game,and we'll definitely do it.\n\nSorry to have disappointed you,it's always incredibly sad to see a disappointed constumer.\n\nThanks for the feedbacks\n\n- Andrea", "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486229803, "review": "Kill-the-waves based gamplay.
