Perhaps with more content this 'con' may change.\n\u2716 I found I am required to set up my own bindings with the steam controller and it isn't programmed to pair with it straight away. If this game picked up the steam controller (or any controller for that matter) it would be a huge plus.\n\nIf you're after something simple to play with a mate or to pass your time between larger titles Graverun is a great game to pick up. A simple system for selecting your arsenal to unleash upon the zombie menace and even better if you have a friend to join you. If you don't have friends, the game has a high score system so you can 'nut it out' against others that have no friends and competitively fight for the number 1 spot.\n\nThe game has had two updates since I have purchased it which potentially means that there is an active developer in our midst. Shock horror? I know, but if you're looking to help support an indie russian developer then this game is a solid choice to add to your library.
