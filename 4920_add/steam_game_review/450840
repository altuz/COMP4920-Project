There are too many problems with the gameplay. Not worth the price of admission... fix it up and resubmit. Personally, I am requesting a refund - maybe I'll look at it again when you fix the problems.\n\nSo I have been chastised for not listing the things wrong with the game... There are too many things wrong to list. How much time do you have? Let's just start with a few. \n\n1. There is no intro/back story. Who am I? Why am I wearing Abe Lincoln's hat and brandishing a flamethrower? What kind of parent is my Dad that I have to go to Hell and save him? Where is my Mom, and why doesn't she stop this insanity?!\n2. You can't walk and fire at the same time.\n3. Aiming at an angle is nigh impossible.\n4. The camera gets blocked and you are fighting blind.\n5. The enemies get stuck on various things (I used this to my advantage and killed Shaab easily.)\n6. How do I heal poor Timmy?!\n7. If the portal is going to open in 10 minutes, shouldn't the timer count down?\n8. THERE IS NO RESTART! You have no choice but to QUIT the game if you die.\n9. Why is there a SPEECH volume control... WHEN THERE IS NO SPEECH?\n10. I'm just exhausted now... can't continue listing things...\n\nGOOD THINGS ABOUT THE GAME\n1. Music by Kevin MacLeod\n2.
