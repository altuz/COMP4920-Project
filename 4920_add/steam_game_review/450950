If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505570", "timestamp_created": 1492327015, "recommendationid": "31172466", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 3327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 131, "num_reviews": 22, "steamid": "76561197998717797", "last_played": 1506921988, "num_games_owned": 146}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1492846973, "review": "If you'd sat me down in the days when I was only playing Touhou and Ikaruga, long before I ever saw a Donpachi or MAME or anything, and told me to design a shmup, I think something very like Danmaku Unlimited 3 would have come out.  That's not a bad thing.  DU3 oozes style, with a crisp, heavily-saturated palette and a pounding, grinding, kickass OST that's head and shoulders above just about everything else on the market, for my money.\n\nThe game feel is well done in general, though enemy explosions are just a touch underwhelming for some reason.  Gone is the weird, self-obsoleting upgrade system from Danmaku Unlimited 2, replaced with shot and laser types linked to in-game achievements, a very welcome change.  You've got two modes of play, here, both centered around grazing enemy shots.  Killing enemies in Spirit Mode cancels their bullets into ghost bullets that you can still graze to raise your Trance meter (essentially a Hyper).  Graze Mode locks you out of raising the Trance meter until you first max out your Graze High, basically just making you graze more.  It also doesn't cancel most bullets on enemy deaths, and makes Hard the minimum selectable difficulty.\n\nThe style of patterns on offer here is very much a combination of Ikaruga's waves of numerous popcorn enemies that don't actually fire at you and stationary, nigh-indestructible laser barriers, coupled with Touhou-style generally-slow-moving patterns with nice chunky gaps, creating a maze-like experience that's visually intimidating but often less difficult than it looks.  Bosses last just a touch longer than is comfortable, though this is a very minor complaint.\n\nOverall, this is a very solid 7 or 8 out of 10, which for $10 is well worth the money.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502311", "timestamp_created": 1492846973, "recommendationid": "31291264", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 77, "steamid": "76561197971645460", "last_played": 1501570080, "num_games_owned": 185}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499211315, "review": "It's insanely good, I loved it!

Graphics are good, sound is good, soundtrack is excellent although it gets old fast, hit boxes are accurate and gameplay is smooth, and bullet patterns are good but a little unbalanced at some difficulties. The game is also well optimized and runs without any hitches, and menues are well designed and easy to use. The game also gives plenty of gameplay options and shot types.\n\nThe only problem that brings the game down and ruins the whole experience is the gimmick mechanic. Get super close to bullets even when it's unnecessary to build up the boost mode meter. When the meter fills, you clear the screen of bullets and get a massive power boost to your shots and a bit wider shot range for a limited time. The idea of giving the player an incentive to get near bullets is not good when you are learning how to play these games. It's actually counterintuitive. The way to learn these games is to gradually and incrementally improve your strategies and instincts as you continue to play. The way this mechanic works does not allow for that type of learning curve to exist. When the game incentivises to get close to bullets, it breaks your process of improvement through survival instincts and reflexes. It teaches you to be reckless and mindless, which is counterintuitive.\n\nThis is made even worse in the more casual mode called \"spirit mode\". Whenever you kill an enemy, their bullet paths stay on screen, but their bullets become harmless. This allows the player to build the boost meter without harming themselves in the process. This causes its own problems as you tend to throw yourself straight into bullet paths you anticipate becoming nullified, but don't. It also becomes a confusing clutter of bullets that are real and fake. It even made me nauseous a few times.\n\nThere's no doubt that the idea of challenging yourself by playing dangerously sounds like a cool, hardcore idea on paper, and it might actually be for those who have already played bullet hell games for years and gotten to that point. For anyone who wants to improve rather than just show off, stay the fuck away.\n\nEdit: I should add that I have played these games outside of steam, so the hours played is not accurate.
