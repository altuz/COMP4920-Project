The world is beautiful, and the story is worthwhile. The combat animations are some of the best I've seen, and the hits carry weight. There are tons of unlockables and progression feels good. You can choose the difficulty level of the dungeons and alter the payout. Yes, that's been done before but it works well here. [b]Also, the fishing is fun![/b]\n\n[i]Essentially, to me, this is a modernized version of the good old [/i]Final Fantasy[i] games from long ago.[/i] The core exploration and fantasy story is there, along with a slew of modern bells-and-whistles such as the unlockables. While this is probably the most AAA game I've played this year, it doesn't feel too gross in that department. But yeah, there is a ton of polish. The sound effects and music are great, and the world is just so *beautiful*.\n\nMost people that read my reviews are into indie games at indie prices. [b]Is this worth the high-ish asking price? Yeah, it is.[/b]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+The artwork is obviously stunning with animations to match\n+I'm not a story kind of guy, but this is delightful\n+Everything feels balanced so far, progression is satisfying \n+Lots of cool unlockables\n+The crafting system is fantastic!\n+The fishing is fun for sure\n+Great game to play from the couch\n+The characters have depth and I'm interested in them\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Why is there no option to speed up battle animations? I'm not complaining just yet, but after a dozen hours I would think people would want that\n-Yes, the overworld map is open like a sandbox, but progression is still kind of linear; this was true of the older JRPGs as well, but it's all about how you hide that\n\n[b]If you are in the mood for a great modern JRPG - then [i]Battle Chasers: Nightwar[/i] is what you are looking for.[/b] Totally worth full price.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533059", "timestamp_created": 1507122988, "recommendationid": "35471075", "language": "english", "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 421, "num_reviews": 618, "steamid": "76561198040884867", "last_played": 1507155341, "num_games_owned": 1196}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1507173595, "review": "Cool enemies, nice variation.

The story seems really bland, and it isn't told in an interesting way (first red flag was the game opening with a big expository wall of text introducing you to all the characters unnaturally--honestly, if you had just completely cut that, the game would have been fine and I would have been more intrigued about these characters with the intro cutscene as the first introduction). \n\nCombat works, but doesn't have an interesting enough twist on tired JRPG tropes to make me want to explore it further. The overcharging is a nice addition, but isn't enough to make combat truly interestly; Bravely Default's system of sacrificing and taking an advance on turns is an example of a twist that's interesting enough to carry the game. \n\nThis is probably personal prefence, but I also think that the overcharging-type mechanic has already been done better in Persona Q, in which every character [i]starts[/i] every fight with an \"overcharge\" of mana to use. In that scenario, it encourages using your fun abilities from the getgo, even in short fights, which makes the combat more interesting in the early game while still maintaining the long-term resource management of a permanent mana store.\n\nI understand that I've played less than two hours and can't expect the game to show me its full hand in that time, but--especially in such a saturated genre and ESPECIALLY on a platform that only lets you return games that you've played for less than a couple hours--it really shouldn't take that long for the game to get interesting. In 90 minutes, I rarely used anything other than basic attacks in combat, and I'm not willing to risk missing the refund window in hopes of it getting more interesting. If the narrative (or even just the premise) were interesting, maybe I'd push through. But right now, it's just the art. And I can look at pictures of the art without having to mash A through a bunch of slow, uninteresting fights.\n\nAlso, this is minor, I suppose, but for a game with such pretty visuals, I'd expect those same levels of quality to carry over into the UI/menus (especially for a genre in which navigating menus is the primary gameplay interaction), but the menus were really bland and borderline ugly. We're living in a post-Persona 5 world; bare minimum for JRPG menus is not gonna cut it. \n\nOverall, I could see myself coming back to this when I'm out of games to play, but with all the amazing stuff coming out, that may be a while.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491714", "timestamp_created": 1507094500, "recommendationid": "35463641", "language": "english", "votes_up": 53, "comment_count": "16", "author": {"playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 97, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561197980545719", "last_played": 1507091534, "num_games_owned": 381}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 56}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507060113, "review": "Great animations, Great art, Awesome characters, ONLY 30 Dollars??
