The art style is beautiful, the soundtrack is beautiful and the voice acting was well-done, which is rare in this genre. The puzzles require some patience and thinking in some cases, and that is a plus for me. My only complaint at all is that it seemed a little short to me, but at the end, offers bonus content, as well as achievements and trading cards. \n\nWhen it was first released on Steam, there was an issue with a very game-breaking bug... I was shocked to see support on Steam's end was on the ball and quite helpful. They replied to our complaints and within a very short time a fix was released. Problem solved and no more bugs. \n\nOverall, this is a dreamy and artistic story and I look forward to the 3rd game arriving on Steam.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519280", "timestamp_created": 1466990475, "recommendationid": "23847623", "language": "english", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561198001850566", "last_played": 1466981456, "num_games_owned": 260}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1482702330, "review": "It's already updated, totally playable!
