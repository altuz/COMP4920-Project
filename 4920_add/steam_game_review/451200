This game is very entertaining. If I had to describe it to something I've played before I would have to say a modern day Pitfall with a candle. The graphics are well put together. Some graphics are blocky like minecraft while other graphics are wispery like the clouds. The lighting is fantastic blend to the game. I can see great effort was put into the graphics unlike most dev games you see. The play is fun, I had a great time playing the game. I then turned it up a notch and played through going as fast as I could with out dying in the level/(next land). By doing this this made the game totally different an easy level became not so easy. I also could then understand how the developer created the level and how the level flowed which gave me even more respect for the game. The game has many lands and themes to the land. I really enjoyed the Raiders of the Lost Ark theme and Alice and Wonderland theme blew me away. I definately thought I got my money's worth, I payed full price on both platforms, ps4 and steam. I highly recommend this game, and if you do buy it then for each land go for the score that matters, 9900+ means you went balls fast and didn't die! get it!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500915", "timestamp_created": 1471835044, "recommendationid": "25065728", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198309848279", "last_played": 1468900837, "num_games_owned": 5}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1482970843, "review": "very nice platformer with great sound and graphics.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495690", "timestamp_created": 1482970843, "recommendationid": "28771895", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198114483688", "last_played": 1491173245, "num_games_owned": 61}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 6, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
