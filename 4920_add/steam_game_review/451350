The graphics are suitabily bright and cheerful, and the music easy enough to mute which is how I play all my games.  One thing I do like is that this title does have a relaxed mode that turns off the the timer, which is nice if you just want to do some low stess clicking.  The hidden object levels aren't particularily difficult, and even the puzzles, which I tend to be very, very bad at, didn't stump me.  But, they are skippable if a player does have a problem with them.  \n\nThe tropical fish store isn't really a sim, so much as a place to spend money that you get for for doing the game levels.  There are several objects that one can purchase, and three different styles of each to choose,  but the game decides where objects go, not the player.  If you're looking for  a tycoon style game, this is not going to be for you.\n\nOne funny/odd thing that's come up for me.  I typed my name in as \"Annie\", and yet my store manager keeps calling me \"Annabelle\".  Sorta makes me want to start a profile with the name \"Jennifer\" and see if it gets changed to \"Jennibell\" or something.\n\nAll in all this is a pretty good game, if you like this sort of game.  There are no obvious flaws, and the nautical theme is lively enough, and I doubt anyone will be pulling thier hair out in frustration, unless they are very sensitve to unauthorized name changes.    \n\nWell worth the $3.99 entrance fee.\n\n7/10", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510596", "timestamp_created": 1457787656, "recommendationid": "21788678", "language": "english", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198027196898", "last_played": 1458123983, "num_games_owned": 221}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
