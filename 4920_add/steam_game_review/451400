It has elements that, if tweaked, I feel the game would be so much more enjoyable.  \n\nPro's:\n1) Decent story, although there is a slight pause between each dialogue startup.  \n2) The way the resource gathering is designed is very similar to Starcraft, one of my favorite RTS games.  \n3) The levels have a very nice looking design and they make the attempt to be different from the previous map.\n\nCon's: \n1) Not nearly enough units can be produced.  Starcraft and C&C 3 Tiberium Wars were so much more enjoyable to me because they allowed for a huge amount of units to be on the map at once.  This game requires you to basically expand to another mineral patch before being able to build more units.  \n2) The maps do not let you place buildings anywhere you want.  No matter where I try to build the building space always seems to be red.  The same applies for where units can explore.  Sometimes it looks like explorable terrain but your units can't really go anywhere.\n3) A lot of the maps just feel like you're defending against nonstop waves of enemies that keep appearing from off the map.  It gets repetitive very fast.\n\nAll in all to me some of these con's outweighed the pro's and I got bored real fast.  As such, I can't give my full recommendation that this is an enjoyable game.

By standard I mean, you build a base, train units, blow up the enemy base\u2026 or! Do a story mission controlling your unique characters.  You have food limits so you can\u2019t just swamp the map, microing your units makes you extra powerful in this.  You can make unit compositions that work well together too.\nAir units are fragile but easily the best unit once you get a swarm going but cost more food than infantry.  Vehicles are slow and get blown up easy.\n\nThe main story made sense and the game play was enjoyable however only about 6-7 hours long if you can micro units well. \nOne thing that I found jarring is you cannot repair your base with another means but the main single method of repairing and keeping units alive- a command skill that is cast in an area.  This means base defences are not ideal unless you\u2019re food capped since you need to use your heal on them instead of your army.\nIn the last mission the AI got \u2018stuck\u2019 and was clustering units before reaching my base which let me make easy work of them (ah well).  Also the actual map for the last mission could use some work.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of RTS games give this a shot, I enjoyed it more than Gray Goo even though the play time is much less.  \nNow that I\u2019ve finished the campaign I\u2019ll be trying some of the challenge maps.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506545", "timestamp_created": 1471706050, "recommendationid": "25034402", "language": "english", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "steamid": "76561197974113872", "last_played": 1471872429, "num_games_owned": 215}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1471855581, "review": "The A.I. of your units is not the best and sometimes not even good.\nIn the campaign for every episode you have to do tech-research almost from the beginning every time.

The AI has prebuilt bases, and instant-spawning cheats apparently. So the campaign is garbage. Your only artillery is seaborne. Oh, you need to crack some turrets without naval support? Tough fucking luck. Your planes are the old wooden-canvas types. Not by technology level, by sturdiness. I know that even modern aircraft could be taken down by a single bullet, but keep in mind that hitting something that goes MACH 2 is the main defence against bullets in the aircrafts case, and if it is being stationery to be shot at (like in this game) it will be garbage (like in this game).\n\nUpdate:\n\nAlso, would like to point out the complete and utter moronic logic behind \"short range anti-tank long range anti-infantry\" derpism. And the fact you cannot see the range of the units, until you try them out in actual combat. Or the retardness of the research system, where you have to go around and collect stuff on the map from canisters of knowledge. Like, the actual fuck is that supposed to represent? Also I'm pretty fairly sure the AI-s exact carbon copy of units has either a range-buffs on them, armor buff (which you cannot see either. what a fucking coincidence) or both, because they reguraly outshoot my exacty same army composition with higher health research (which is 10 whopping percentage) for some reason. It does attempt some stuff like StarCraft, where you can set the mineral node as the rally point of your workers, but it doesn't span the workers out like in SC so they won't get in each others way, no they'll happily que in front of the single mineral node, so you'll need to manually set them up anyway. You can hotkey ONE and ONLY ONE building to a hotkey, meaning if you want multiple factories, get ready to put a fucking piano artist to shame. Also another attemt at SC stuff is the fact you can rally your factories to a fighter unit, but if you move the unit before the reinfocements arrive, the reinfocements will go the last location, will not follow the unit set as rally, as in SC, which can lead to an army scrattered across the map. And since there is no \"select all fighter units\" like in SC, you'll have to look around the map, manually send them to an RVP if you want a coherent force.\n\nLast note: I've removed this clusterfuck from my steam library.
