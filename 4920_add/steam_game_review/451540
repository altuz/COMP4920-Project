The gameplay is fun and is a addicting to try to go back and beat your score.  The biggest challenge for me is not the game per-say, but for us that are not so graceful on our feet in roomscale with cords, it poses a bit of a hazard. :)  After a few games I have to remove the headset and unravel the vive cord if I'm not wrapped up in it myself.  Once HMD's become wireless the game will certainly be easier for me personally to play. :)  However I still think the game is worth the cost and a fun quick pickup and play VR game when in a time crunch and need a VR fix.  I posted a quick video of gameplay with the issues I had with the cord. :)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zUFfeNjJi0\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1481099718, "recommendationid": "28232694", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198060369064", "last_played": 1481035329, "num_games_owned": 211}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1482806073, "review": "Worth the $3.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1482806073, "recommendationid": "28695974", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198096206545", "last_played": 1481422881, "num_games_owned": 141}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
