Thought id like to share a opinion on this game. Graphics wise its on par, nothing special but good enough for 2017 and in competion to others in the same category they all look cartoony in comparison.  Gameplay wise it shines.. so much replayability, unlocks and just one more go is said often. The local multi player is great... we often play 3 players all on xb1 controllers. The customisability is so wide, playing 3 players we are all set up differently with different characters and in a way can compliment each other. I would say easily best shmup on steam by far and its still in pre release.

It is early access so it still has the potential to improve. But given my current feelings about it, I can't recommend it.\nThough Never updates it on a regular basis the game hasn't really improved so far beyond cosmetics and endless ship attachements that all appear to be redundent in the campaign, but perhaps I'm missing something as I don't play Survival Mode which seems to be what the dev plays mostly..\nBut rather than go into an essay I'll just list the pros and cons of this version 0.18\nAll of my points are subject to change of course since this is Early Access.\n\nPros-\n\nOnline Co-op play\nColourful graphics\nGood control\nHasn't been abandoned by the Dev\n\nCons-\n\nTerrible, terrible music, which is a major fopar for a SHMUP\nLack of enemy variety throughout the campaign\nAwful up scrolling level, its far too slow with a nasty background\nTo few power up icons and since it takes way too long to power up your ship, especially in co-op, the full potential of your ship is never realised\nPointless AOE pick ups\nSeemingly pointless Player Character variety as Biff is the only charcater worth using in the Campaign\nBoring level design\n\nThe main problem with this game is that has no punch like SHMUPS 20 years older than it.\nBut I still hold out hope that the game will find it's feet eventually...\n\n\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497177", "timestamp_created": 1500588694, "recommendationid": "33682690", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "8", "author": {"playtime_forever": 2215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198096391842", "last_played": 1507056557, "num_games_owned": 88}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 4}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 41, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 38, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
