Not so diverse with race, though.\n\nThe routes are all really sweet, the humor is fun, and it's very lighthearted - a nice game to play when you just want to zone out and feel good. My only complaint is the price is pretty high for the content it offers - I'd grab it on sale.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516746", "timestamp_created": 1494972410, "recommendationid": "31795264", "language": "english", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "steamid": "76561197960860345", "last_played": 1494971991, "num_games_owned": 635}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498688574, "review": "I really fell in love with this game. The characters are all unique and likeable. The story is not deep, but to be honest I think that's a nice change from visual novels/dating sims that spend too much time with overdone drama. It's also so much more realistic that way. Love the diversity and the humor.\nAt times I got a little frustrated with the lab minigame, but I think it's nice to have them in the game istead of \"only\" having choice options. (And you can turn the minigames off!)\nIf you're looking for a light-hearted, sweet dating game that's just a little different, this might just be the game for you!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499567", "timestamp_created": 1498688574, "recommendationid": "32961570", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198151755605", "last_played": 1500845015, "num_games_owned": 77}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498892611, "review": "So far I've done 3/5 routes and I would recommend in a heart beat, the puzzles get a bit frustrating and I admit on my replays I started skipping the really long ones, but the stories were excellent I felt fulfilled at the end of the routes they were appropriate per each story, I like how a lot of the characters have a 'disability' it makes it more relatable and opens it up for more people to undertsand and relate to the characters, I will say Hendriks twist [spoiler] asexual [/spoiler]  through me for a loop its the 2nd time in a game that I've ran into it and I dont really lke it, but I guess it just adds more diversity and people can relate to it,  Im not hating on it ust always leaves me uneasy maybe because I can't undertand it.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1498892611, "recommendationid": "33071489", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198355644933", "last_played": 1498892708, "num_games_owned": 42}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 23, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 22, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
