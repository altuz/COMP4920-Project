I am really happy that I have found it because Whirligig is without a doubt a solid video player in the first place :)\n\nThe best feature is that it has built in libVLC framework so you can basically watch any type of media even with embedded subtitle tracks. This (VideoLAN path) is my recommended mode for everyone to use because default one (I think it is a DirectShow path) requires external codecs... which are kinda PITA to use. \n\nSo what are you waiting for? You should definitely give it a try!  :)", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1499736426, "recommendationid": "33445079", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198031533829", "last_played": 1507148977, "num_games_owned": 141}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 190, "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 146, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 44}}
