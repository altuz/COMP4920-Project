But for some reason this one spoke to me. Maybe it was the art style, or the music, or perhaps the fact that it didn't feel the need to shove fanservice in my face in an attempt to get me to buy it. So, I parted with some money to check this story out.\n\nAnd what a story it is.\n\nThe pacing of this story is perfect, and written so well. The characters are easy to fall in love with; Amber's wit and partial cyncism, Marina's optimism and at-times air-headedness. Even the near emotionless Tess is enjoyable in her own special way. As for the plot itself? It really knows how to absorb you into the tale. I had to know what happened next in the story, so by the time I finished it (in one sitting), it was well past 2 in the morning.\n\nThe character art is exceptionally good, and I do enjoy how the characters actualy move around the screen when they're being described as moving. The background art is stunning as well, and I love that, with one or two exceptions, each location in the game has it's own specific background. The music is also a big part of the game and I did enjoy just taking a break from the story now and then to enjoy it. If I wasn't trying to save money at the monent, I'd definitely buy the soundtrack as well.\n\nOverall:\nWhile this might not look as flashy or interesting as some other VNs on steam, I promise you'll enjoy hopping onto this emtional and well told ride of a story. Plus, with the devs soon to add FULL voice acting later in the year, it'll defintely add more to this already great VN.\n9/10", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1505397626, "recommendationid": "34949022", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198033250948", "last_played": 1507028955, "num_games_owned": 34}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505754721, "review": "Very touching story.
