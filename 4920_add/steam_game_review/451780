You'll end up screwed in your first playtrough because of it.\nThe level design and world building is so poor, like, whenever you get a chance to spar with other character, you'll fight in the same area as the dungeon instead of the Training ground or something.\nEvery playable character have the same damn skill, it would be nice to add 1 or 2 special skill for each character.\nTrillion is just too OP, there's no way you could withstand it's attack once your affection point dropped to zero, affection point is really hard to build too. Even though the main idea is to avoid it's attack but it's just sucks when you took just 1 wrong move and you're dead. As for the normal mobs, it'll 90% die 1 hit by your basic attack.\n\nI still love this game nonetheless, it tries a lot of new things. Some people like it, the others don't. I really love the unique mix of SRPG, Raising simulator, and Visual Novel. It turns out really good. Also i feel nostalgic with the Action Oriented & Dual-Turn battle system, it reminds me a lot of Chocobo Dungeon in PSX [spoiler]i feel so old, yay.[/spoiler]\nIgnore those negative reviews that says there's too much text in this game, this is what you get if you play anime themed game, also they made a fast forward / skip feature for a reason.\nAnyway, i really recommend this game, it's been too long since i've played a lovely game like this.\n9/10.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517740", "timestamp_created": 1501414036, "recommendationid": "33902618", "language": "english", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 2747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "steamid": "76561198258996268", "last_played": 1501927417, "num_games_owned": 278}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500692827, "review": "I've played 35 hours and seen all the content including the true ending; It wasn't worth it.\n\nThis game has some charm, and the overall theme is interesting, but it doesn't stay charming 20+ hours in. I would have been able to forgive a lot more if they had put some effort into the dialogue, but it is painfully mediocre.  Only about 3-4 lines had any real impact, the rest were lukewarm at best. \n\nThe combat seems difficult at first with the 1 trillion hp super boss staring you down from the start, but exploiting a couple of the poorly balanced passive skills and the experiance farming miniboss make everything a joke.  You can literally kill the only manditory enemy in the game with 7 attacks, and if you get a little lucky you can do this on your first run with your first overlord (though save scumming valley of swords for the right seals is super tedious.)\n\nI would only reccomend this game when on sale 75% off, and even then don't bother trying for the true ending, it doesnt pay off when compaired to the time investment.  Also turn off training cutscenes and skill animations right away, you'll lose nothing and save a lot of time.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509009", "timestamp_created": 1500692827, "recommendationid": "33711208", "language": "english", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 2314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198054365658", "last_played": 1500940831, "num_games_owned": 186}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501225516, "review": "The only thing that make this game not recommended by me is the bug.
