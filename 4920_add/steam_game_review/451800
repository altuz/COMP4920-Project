I met some of the guys on this project and had to get this once it released!\n\nI should say out of the gate, as someone with a degree in animation, the cutscene animation is great! Not Disney-quality but definitely well done for a 2D game.\n\nFirst complaint: long load times. Just a matter of optimization that I expect with future updates.\n\nGameplay is super fun and easy to control (I'm using a 360 controller). Very reminiscent of Super Metroid with a comical twist.\n\nSecond complaint: In-game animation is stiff and the pickaxe actually swings backwards.\nand Third complaint: Game crashed loading level two. (migh've been my fault running too much stuff)\n\nAll in all, I see the possiblities.
