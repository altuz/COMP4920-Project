Get it if you want something simple you can beat in 25-30 minutes without too much hassle. I will recommend it, because it is a well made game, it just lacks content right now.\n\nPros:\n- Nice, simplistic design\n- Calm background loops that don't get annoying\n\nCons:\n- Difficulty of the first 25 levels is all over the place, there seems to be no linear increase in difficulty\n- 25 levels is too short for a title like this. I played through it in 25 minutes, I am sure you can do it faster\n\nSuggestions:\n- More levels\n- Increased difficulty\n- Difficulty modes that increase game speed / modifiers\n- Highscores for levels", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522715", "timestamp_created": 1457902391, "recommendationid": "21823154", "language": "english", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "steamid": "76561197996001283", "last_played": 1457902409, "num_games_owned": 1277}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1483244493, "review": "Game is not that bad but at the time I'm writing this it has only 25 stages which can be completed in 30 mins.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503670", "timestamp_created": 1483214708, "recommendationid": "28880452", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "steamid": "76561198271711524", "last_played": 1483217212, "num_games_owned": 31}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1457990927, "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkKSmFRCczA\n\nPros:\n-25 levels\n-New mechanics that other similar games don't have like the flying asteroids\n-No time limit\n-Cheap\n-Challenging\n\nCons:\n-Low replay-ability \n-No Multiplayer\n-No Options Menu\n-No Workshop\n-Mp Randomization\n\nSmall, cheap $3 game with Cons which are expected at that price label. I would recommend this game if you like this genre although once finished don't expect to come back and play more because the levels are set in stone, there is no randomization. Maybe the developer will add more levels in the future, although a suggestion to the developer would be to include a workshop with community made levels and think about multiplayer.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496192", "timestamp_created": 1457990815, "recommendationid": "21841979", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "steamid": "76561198086018347", "last_played": 1457964171, "num_games_owned": 115}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 4}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497566647, "review": "Epic", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "timestamp_created": 1497566647, "recommendationid": "32455677", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198114828854", "last_played": 1497641531, "num_games_owned": 15}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1457902077, "review": "Good Music..
