{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501001165, "review": "Yet another trading card money farming game that the devs put basically no effort at all. Looks and plays like your average 10+ year old flash player game except that... it manages to be a much weaker game than those somehow. It has incredibly dull and badly thought out mechanics, shitty mobile-looking interface, unity engine, only one level (which is an infinite/survival level), power ups that more disrupt your gameplay than help, only allowed to use ONE bought power up per run (as if they being almost useless wasn't already enough), which in turn makes money completely useless after you buy the extra star slots (you can buy backgrounds and skins for your star-catching platform, but that is just cosmetic)\n\nThe gameplay is pretty basic. You have a Breakout-style moveable platform (no balls tho) that you use to catch the falling stars and additional items that spawn at random positions at the top of the screen and fall gradually in a direction determined by the current wind value. The stars are the only essential items that you need to always collect, failing to do so resulting in the loss of one of the the 3 lives you start with (you can store up to 5 lives at once by getting the 1+ life power-ups). The other items that spawn are ice droplets (which are negative and slow you down if you grab any), 6 power-ups that can be either positive or negative gameplay modifiers, and coins that provide extra score. \nYou have an upgradable limited \"inventory\" in which you store the stars and ice. Whenever the inventory reaches its full capacity you won't be able to get any ice/stars and will need to deposit your items by moving your platform in one of the extremes of the screen (this is when your points are finally accounted for). Every time that you reach the max capacity of the inventory the game slows down for a few seconds to allow you to have time to empty your inventory. The extreme of the screen that you were farther away from when you captured the item that reached the max capacity of your inventory will be the side that provides the 2x multiplier to your points when you make your deposit. Funnily enough, despite the game telling you in one of the tips that \"Going for the 2x multiplier is not always the best choice!\", it IS always the best choice because there is always time to travel to the other side and still have enough time to catch the next star wherever it spawns from. In the end of each run you get to see your score and given the option to submit it to the global scoreboard, + you get an amount of money based on your score, which you can use to buy one time use per run power-ups (the same shit ones that drop throughout the game), increase your max inventory size, and buy cosmetic items (backgrounds + skins for your platform).\n\nThere are 6 types of pick-up items that modify the game, each (besides one) having 2 variations: one intented to negatively affect your game and one intended to positively affect your game. Sadly, they are not very well thought out.\n\nThe 6 power-ups: \n\n- Bubble power-up cooldown decreaser: this lowers the amount of time you need to wait to re-use the bubble special ability that you buy from the store.\n\n- Ice amount modifier (more than default/less than default): hardly matters at all because it is still extremely easy to dodge the ice even at the max amount\n\n- Wind modifier (no wind at all/max wind): higher wind barely affects your ability to predict where the stars will fall, in fact the stronger the wind the better, because that way there is less risk of missing the stars that spawn near the corners as they will be thrown by the wind to the star capturing wall, which automatically captures the stars and does not make you lose any lives.\n\n-Star fall speed modifier (slower/faster): this is the worst of all. You would assume that slower falling stars would make everything much easier, right??? it is actually almost a straight-up negative because they didn't implement it properly. Yes, the stars do fall slower, but the spawn time of the stars remains unchanged (or not changed adequately), so you often end up with 2 stars falling at once (which normally never happens). Then when your power-up expires, both stars that are on screen will start falling at the normal speed again and basically 100% make you lose a life, especially in the later stages of the run. There is no reason at all to use this power-up, the normal falling speed is completely fine and it reaches a cap by 8000 points or so (not sure about this) which is still very very easy to deal with, so there is absolutely no reason to get this \"upgrade\" as it will just fuck you up.\n\n- Platform speed modifier (slower/faster): well at least this one actually does something useful. The extra moving speed does help a bit, although it can also make it harder to control and make you fuck up close dodges. If you ever played Osu! catch the beat, this is basically like having shift held on all the time at an easy map. In this game you don't really need the extra speed to get all the stars, so the function of it is just allowing a larger error window in your reaction time; basically another unecessary power-up. (a legit use of it is to get more of the extra items, but all items besides the extra life are pretty shit anyway)\n\n- Extra life/life remover: self-explanatory. the +1 life spawns much less than the -1 life modifier, which is ok, otherwise the game would be even easier. \n\nSo in conclusion, the power-ups do not help much at all, they are all basically negative or not worth the risk. \n\nAlso, the way you are rewarded money is kinda weird. It keeps doubling your money reward after certain score milestones in a run, which is fine up until a certain number, but after you cross an amount of points (which isn't even that high) it basically gives you infinite money and you can buy everything in the game with no effort. \n\n\nDoes it have any positives, though?\nThe soundtrack is alright, some backgrounds are beautiful and the gameplay can be fun/relaxing for 30mins or so while you enjoy all the tracks available and take your time to realize that the game is nothing but a very mediocre browser/mobile game. If you don't mind the fact that it is a bad and extremely easy game and you just want to zone out and waste your time with something without thinking much, i guess it is an okay game. Also very easy to get 100% achievements if that is your thing.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505814", "timestamp_created": 1501001165, "recommendationid": "33790100", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198116735808", "last_played": 1500991564, "num_games_owned": 472}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": true, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 88, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 71, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 17}}
