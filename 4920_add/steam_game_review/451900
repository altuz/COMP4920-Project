Love RTS games, this one just has such a nice vibe to it! \n\nSo the game is pretty well designed, most of the resource gathering is automated with a percentage based system used to distribute the 'workload' between wood cutters and gatherers.\n\nThe Game runs at a smooth 60 fps, no frame rate drops at all, very impressive!\n\nIt reminds me of age of empires to some degree but it includes elements of Warcraft, with the cannons reminding me of Nod from C&C haha :)\n\nHere's me playing the first mission: https://youtu.be/DU8A2trD3rM", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518679", "timestamp_created": 1458044798, "recommendationid": "21851130", "language": "english", "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 6619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198034412089", "last_played": 1459721705, "num_games_owned": 151}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 4}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1464991521, "review": "As a person who grew up with old classic games like Starcraft, Warcraft, Age of Empires and the settlers I was very happy when I saw, that WizardCraft steps into the direction of these games and combines some of their game mechanics in a good way.\n\nIn WizardCraft you have to build up a simple economy to be able to train military units and create defences to defend your base against spiders, CPU\u00b4s, dark dragons and even against the undead.\n\nThe game offers it\u00b4s Players 40 missions (Patch 1.04 right now) in which you can choose between the difficulty \"casual\" and \"normal\". In the first two missions you have a small tutorial in the back which helps you getting started with the game.\n\nThe game also has a skirmish mode and a map editor, where the Players can build their own maps. On top of it you can send your own created maps to the developer who then can include your map into the \"Community maps\" tab in the skirmish mode. This makes your map available to all Players, which is extremely cool in my opinion (note: Only 100 community maps can get included and only 2 maps per map creator).\n\nThe war system is simple: build up your army and destroy your enemies Castle. You have a variety of units, which you can throw at your enemy (for example 4 types of wizards; dragons; archers and swordsmen on horses; portable cannons; etc.).\n\nWizardCraft is a singleplayer game, but it is possible that multiplayer will be build in in the future. The developer said that he is looking into it, however Mulitplayer mode for this game can not be confirmed 100%.\n\n[u]My thoughts[/u]\n\nWizardCraft is a great game and has huge potential to become a competitive game once Multiplayer is there (if it is going to be build in of course).\n\nThe developer supports his game and reacts to his community very fast. You can also see him commenting on youtube videos. This is someting you don\u00b4t see very often from other developers.\n\nThe game is more than worth the $ 11.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504030", "timestamp_created": 1464991521, "recommendationid": "23369099", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 2494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198008364405", "last_played": 1480178888, "num_games_owned": 34}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1464481057, "review": "So wizards are fun, and crafting is also fun. but can wizards craft? or are we crafting wizards? Even more important than this however: Is this a good game? read below to find out instead of reading through this nonsense and you'll see what I think.\n\n\nPros:\n-The gameplay is quite fun and can be enjoyable watching your peasants running around doing their jobs.\n-Automation is indeed a thing. tear through resources and march out troops all without pressing a single button once it's finally set up. you still have to control the troops, so don't get lazy.\n-The graphics look fairly nice. I'm not a graphics whore, but it fits the gameplay style.\n\nOk, this section is a little empty in comparison, but honestly there's not much to say. It's got good points, but the bad points are a bit bigger and it's currently 1:13 for me. give me a break.\n\nCons:\n-Controls are a bit messed up and not what you'd expect. For example the hotkey responses for the stone and iron mine are switched around. Also the champion comes prepared with a portable cannon for some reason. How he turns swords, shields and gold into a god damn cannon I will never know. Maybe he's a wizard.\n-Not much information is given about this game at all. it throws you in and says \"have fun!\". This can be enjoyable for games like dark souls however this is an rts, and I'd expect a bit more of a tutorial for hotkeys, controls etc. Even if it's just a side bar.\n-Difficulty is off the scale! Again, it works perfectly well for dark souls, however I can't get past mission 1 on casual. I'm figuring out how to train knights and bowmen, and at 20 minutes or so the enemy is engaging me with dragons, magicians and mounted archers. I tried it again just to check on normal difficulty, and they do the same stuff. practically zero difference.\n\n\nScore: 7/10\nReason:\nLike I said above, the game is fun. However I do believe a little more refinement and testing should go into this game before being sold like this. Hotkeys, Difficulty, Tutorial etc. should all be in a game such as this.\nI will point something out I've noticed recently however. What is it with developers using unity to code real time strategy recently? I mean it works but for a 2d game, there are a few programs out there that could make the game a bit better.

Third your peasants do not work in an organized fashion. \n\n I would love this game more if the peasants at least worked in a organized fashion.

Well.... get dragons, harass, invade with swordsmen and towers, then gg. Truth of the mater is, dragons are easeir and better to get than swordsman. So why not just get them? Get gold going before iron and bam win! Then iron to finis the game.\n\nIssues:\n-Asside from above, the AI is crap. My dragons are being attacked by the 1 archer. What do they do? Keep going on about thier buisness and don't attack the one attacking them. This makes you have to micro manage every squad all the time.\n-ultimate strategy above. Too long to get anything else and you cannot get simple easy units out quick. You cannot just build a barracks, you need armor AND weapons. It is quicker to get out dragons. So why get other units unless you plan to swarm and win?\n-bad design. No point in getting lower units is a major flaw.\n-too much to get started. You need a massive economy to do anything and basically need to have endgame stuff before you can play. Will have to spend about 15 min building/preping before you can build your first military unit if you wana win...\n-No controll over peasants. Building walls is worthless since they will just cut the trees and no, you cannot stop them.\n\nPros:\n\n-It has a good theme and a good idea, too bad the implimentation is not so good.\n-it is interesting for the first bit until you realize your two options, and if you cannot do them then you cannot win.\n-there can be different strategies if you involve wizards.... but dragon harass is still great.
