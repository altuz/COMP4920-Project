I am a native English speaker and right off the bat, the instuctions could do with someone with a better understanding of English. I guess the dev's are German and while the menus are ok to understand they could be a lot easier for us non Germans.\n\nI am enjoying the tutorials I have played so far. Though I seem to have missed the keyboard commands for the main engine controls.\n\nI have had no issues with the game not starting, the lastest build for me, has been easy to setup and play. One thing I am unsure about is the editor, when I click the button in the main menu, it takes me to the EEP 13 shop, so I am guessing to edit you will need a copy of EEP. I have EEP 12 which I hope you can use that editor.\n\nA bargain for \u00a34.99 and the dev's updating regularly, I would recommend to anyone with a train interest and some time to learn the controls.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505031", "timestamp_created": 1483275175, "recommendationid": "28901431", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561197970690486", "last_played": 1499711982, "num_games_owned": 238}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1476771941, "review": "Even if you install the body of eep12, error\nIt does not work with just.
