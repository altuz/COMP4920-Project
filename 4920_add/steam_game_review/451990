In fact, you will probably crash into every one of the walls, and quit the game in a fiery rage. However, once you begin to appreciate that this was what it was probably like racing in the 1920's, and that maybe, just maybe you should try slowing down instead of using your handbrake to drift around every corner, the beauty of this game will hit you. The sound design is excellent, the aesthetics are amazing, and each car even has its own personality. My only two gripes are that, I wish that I could see a tad further in front of the car, and that there were different tones that played at the end of the races when you lose, because I found myself hearing the \u201cyou lose tone\u201d a lot.

After my purchase I realized how wrong I was thinking.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game looks simple at the beginning. Indeed, there is almost no learning curve, but after your first race it hits you hard that the game is not like your average racing game. It is difficult to win a race and it is also not easy to get used to the viewing angle. Although there are some comments about how bad the viewing angle is, I personally liked it. The cars with different speeds and different handling ratios are well balanced and shows how difficult those cars were handled in 20\u2019s. It is definitely not a simulation, and I don\u2019t think this was the developer\u2019s intention, but they managed to program the physics of the game remarkably good.\n\nLong story short: It takes a while to master but the game is very enjoyable. \n\nGraphics and Sound:\n\nThe polygon graphics are funny and gives a great atmosphere to the game. It is a mixture of a comic book and art concept.\u00a0\nThere are some graphical glitches occasionally but nothing which will distract or annoy.\n\nThe music is beautiful and doesn\u2019t disturb if you play long. I\u2019m not a fan of this era in terms of music, but when you hear it, you will be in the mood.\n\nI\u2019ve played this game on my 15\u201d Macbook Pro from 2011 on both macOS and Windows 10, and the performance was very good.\n\nOverall surprising great game which I recommend to everyone. A little bit patience for mastering the game is recommended. :)", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504249", "timestamp_created": 1492241353, "recommendationid": "31150859", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198027316124", "last_played": 1495563280, "num_games_owned": 28}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497853375, "review": "..it's like super sprint and super skidmarks had a baby, and that baby was raised in a time before air bags and seat belts.\n\n9/10, due to one camera angle.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491100", "timestamp_created": 1494426845, "recommendationid": "31666188", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 90, "steamid": "76561198091229125", "last_played": 1491094212, "num_games_owned": 48}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492684297, "review": "I loved it.
