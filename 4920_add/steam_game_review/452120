There's just too little substance for the price tag, even half off.  There's practically only a dozen scenes with only a handful of interactions.  The whole thing is completely beatable within half an hour, getting the happy ending without doing anything more than logically following the clues presented by each interactable item.  There's no challenge, and there's very little exposition about the actual folklore, and I wasn't sold on the art work.
