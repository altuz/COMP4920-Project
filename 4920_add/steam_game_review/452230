When all things are even though, there is a lot of He-who-goes-1st-wins though and thats my bigest quip with this game. In the arena you always go 1st so its fairly easy to get a good rank there, but in live head to head, not so much. Most decks are prety evenly matched so 1st move is huge! Other than that, matches are fun and quick. there are a few OP cards runnning around, but there are good stratgies to defeat most of them. All in all a solid CCG.\n\nAny game that has in ap purchases always makes me cringe, but for some reason I gave this one a try anyway. Lets get this out of the way: There is indeed an P2W slant to this game, I have spent exactly $0.00 on this game and have done pretty well. Initially it seems pretty easy to move along until about a hour into it, then the breaks catch and things slow down. but getting into a active clan made a huge difference. Mid to high level cards are passed out to each member so I have some pretty nice cards. Can I beat the cashers.....sometimes. And when I do it feels pretty good.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499829", "timestamp_created": 1485125742, "recommendationid": "29432803", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 41436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1172, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198066115528", "last_played": 1506919138, "num_games_owned": 55}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1490502463, "review": "The more you play Spellstone, the more you begin to understand it for what it is. It's not something you can speedrun or play in one sitting. It's not the kind of game that you sit down to spend a weekend grinding. This game is an investment, a marathon, a way of life. Once you start to take this game seriously, you've got the app on your phone and your checking on it every couple of hours, joining alliances of the strongest guilds and competing in every clash and guild war.\n\nBut the game actually has a very low barrier of entry. The total simplicity of the card crafting, upgrading, and fighting  makes for a really easy-to-play casual game. It has a decent storyline with solid rewards and a convincing difficulty curve, and the cards themselves are well-drawn, easy to understand, and feature an exciting evolution-esque upgrade system.\n\nI have never found another CCG with such simplicity. The other games in this genre are saturated with over-complication and such absurd strategy that even after finishing the tutorial, you still don't know how the game works. But Spellstone's simplicity made me fall in love with it at first sight.\n\nSpellstone's a free-to-play CCG, so it's obviously pay-to-win; that just comes with the genre. An energy system also restricts the amount you can play in a single session, but there are so many things to do that you can play the game for hours at a time without waiting for recharges. You can compete for rewards constantly, in both PvP and PvE, earning premium cards for the performance of both you and your guild.\n\nObviously, like all games, this one has its issues, but it's free-to-play and full of features.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1487048019, "recommendationid": "29914298", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 46591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198073483854", "last_played": 1494587319, "num_games_owned": 108}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
