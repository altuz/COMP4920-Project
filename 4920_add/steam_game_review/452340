The controls are awkward like when you play as a dog you can't bark and move quickly to dodge the enemy.\n\nI could ignore the bad voice acting and the bad story, but man... the enemies.\nThe enemies are unpredictable in unfair annoying way, like you can't tell whos that enemy that stand still or the one that stand still also but will attack you without a warning when you get close to him and not avoidable. Or enemy that patrols and ignores you if you walk by him or the enemy that patrols and suddenly chases you once you're close to him which it is not aviodable after. And sometimes when you use the dogs to check them out they wouldn't chase it, but when you move fucking Ian they suddenly attack him then.\n\nOh yeah, not to mention the enemies that works as a wall but you can't tell because they look like the others who would attack you. Because they all use random models and not giving them any unique appearance.\n\n\nThey expected you to die alot that they even bothered to make death counter for it.\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508882", "timestamp_created": 1499991567, "recommendationid": "33524876", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "steamid": "76561198001963942", "last_played": 1499989658, "num_games_owned": 562}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 11, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 5}}
