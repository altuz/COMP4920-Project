It offers up a combination of buxom young women and ancient Chinese literature that I'm certain would have never been made in the west. However, content is light and as such, the characters don't shine as much as they could without prior knowledge of their personality and mannerisms. Koihime Enbu is a fun purchase if you're a big time fighting game fanatic, but it's hard to recommend it to the average consumer.\n\nFeaturing 13 fighters and 7 assist characters, I quickly got a strong vibe of Nitro + Blasterz as soon as I booted the game up. The visual flare is also strikingly similar. In a world where new fighting games are dropping left and right, it takes something to truly stand out in the genre. Koihime seems to want their bullet point to be simplicity. The game features a four-button setup, with three attacks: light, medium, and heavy, and one dedicated throw button.\n\nThere is no tutorial, something most fighting games these days seem to be lacking, but once I started digging I found out why. Every character in the game has exactly the same moveset. Every special move is pulled off with the same combination of moves, and even the finishing attacks are all the same layout. It is designed so that players can jump back and forth between characters without worrying about memorizing a long string of inputs. It\u2019s brilliant, but sadly never advertised, and being only on PC in the states doesn\u2019t help either.\n\nCons of this game\nThe game features three playable modes: Arcade Mode, Versus Mode, and Training Mode. This brings up another portion of the game that I found frustrating, though. Some of the modes that are supposed to be multiplayer did not allow my friend and I to play together locally. I was trying to play on my Xbox controller while she played on the keyboard, but there was something strange happening that did not allow for us to play that way. Perhaps for certain modes you can only play with two controllers or both on keyboard, but either way this seemed strange to me and the game provided no indication either way. We were only able to play on versus mode in the end.\n\nOne other thing that Koihime shakes up is that pretty much all characters have the exact same super move and desperation inputs, and many of the specials also adhere to these same principles. They won\u2019t result in the same attacks, of course, but the command inputs are standard across the board, so it\u2019s less likely for players dabbling with multiple characters to suddenly forget how to pull off super moves at inopportune moments. Even so, the characters all feel reasonably unique\u2014a similar control scheme doesn\u2019t lead to everyone feeling the same.\n\nConclusion\nKoihime Enbu\u2019s a decent little brawler, though it doesn\u2019t do enough to stand out from the crowd apart from its all-female cast. As such, it comes moderately recommended for fighting game enthusiasts who want to jump into something new, but it\u2019s a much harder sell to a more casual demographic. \n\nPros:\n-Unique Art Style\n-Unique premise\n\nCons: \n -Rough art style and animations give the impression of an amateur passion project\n -Lacking in content\n - Asking price is rather hefty for what is offered\n\n\nMy Verdict 2.5/5\nThe whole situation has me at war with myself; I want to love it because the world it creates seems so fun, but the end results of the negatives adding up make it feel like an amateur overcharging for their passion project.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546110", "timestamp_created": 1494505420, "recommendationid": "31681994", "language": "english", "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 164, "steamid": "76561198276383313", "last_played": 1494504470, "num_games_owned": 1974}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1491938080, "review": "Core combat is fun, core game is overpriced and not fun.\n\nFor 40$ you want to have at least a competent fighting game. Enbu gives you about 80% of that and to it's credit, that is a pretty good percentage from a relatively no-name series/dev team.\n\nThe problem with Koihime Enbu is that last 20% is the biggest problem in the game: the AI.\n\nThe AI of this game is terrible. It's input-reading laziness that you can either trick or get countered depending on trial and error. Without fail, I have triggered an AI to jump for a single attack 100 times. Without fail, I used a certain attack and got hard countered 100 times.\n\nThere is no variance. There is simply the programming of \"do this move and win, do this move and lose\".\n\nThat makes for an ultimately boring game.\n\nSo this game is indeed overpriced and underperforming. \n\n\n\nI would talk on the balance issues and how there are just clearly better options for characters and assist-characters, but that's all redundant to simple things like input-reading AI.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493144", "timestamp_created": 1491938079, "recommendationid": "31084126", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198007539779", "last_played": 1491622178, "num_games_owned": 207}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 10}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 57, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 47, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 10}}
