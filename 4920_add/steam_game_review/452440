{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505949799, "review": "[b]Flowers -Le volume sur printemps-[/b] is the first game in a 4-part series of VNs (the final entry is just now having its Japanese release, second one already have an English one planned). It\u2019s a pretty expansive ([i]circa[/i] 15 hours for full playthrough) [i]Shoujo Ai[/i], that is a female/female romance without explicit sexual content (it never goes further than a kiss). It tells a story of a shy, insecure girl who enters an all-female boarding school to find friends and change her previously solitary life, but also comes to terms with her attraction to women and finds love.\n\n[b]To address the most obvious thing first, the game is visually stunning[/b], with beautiful sprites, backgrounds and CGs. From this point of view, it was definitely the most pleasing VN I\u2019ve read to date. The music, while maybe lacks variety appropriate for such a long story, is very good and voice acting is most of the time phenomenal (and while protagonist\u2019s VA maybe overdid the \u201cshy girl\u201d thing a bit, it\u2019s really a somewhat minor complain). Even the menus and user interface are very aesthetic and thematically fitting.\n\n[b]The story is a bit more complicated issue, but still very much comes out as a positive[/b]. The characters are really good, being (apart maybe from the protagonist) hard to easily identify with typical amine clich\u00e9s and having a lot of depth and backstory underneath their obvious characteristics. Most of them can\u2019t really be criticised as one-dimensional or boring, they show both positive and negative traits and can surprise you, especially when strong emotion and romance is involved, while also never feeling inconsistent.\n\nWhat people might dislike about this VN is that the pacing is pretty slow and some sections of the story goes on for much longer then you would expect. It\u2019s hard to say it has any filler content or boring dialogues, everything in there adds something meaningful to the world and details that seems unimportant at first may prove crucial later. The plot itself isn\u2019t super-original, but also have enough twists and good ideas to keep you interested and emotionally engaged. More impatient people might get bored, but I was really enthralled for much of my playtime and didn\u2019t mind the slower moments either. The romance itself is also pretty slow and timid, but feels deep and realistic enough to be satisfying. It also fits the characters, who are young and often unsure about their sexuality.\n\n[b]Two bigger complains I actually have are connected to the cryptic game mechanics and the game\u2019s ending(s)[/b]. While the game suggests that you have two separate romance options, only one of them is actually available from the start. Without a walkthrough, it\u2019s really not that easy to understand what the game expects from you and what the UI is trying to communicate when reacting to your choices. There is also a few \u201cpuzzles\u201d in the game, that asks you to deduce explanations of certain mysterious events at the school, but with some of them I\u2019m not sure that the game gives you enough information to actually find the ansers yourself \u2013 if I didn\u2019t use a walkthrough, I would probably have to do it through trial-and-error.\n\nAlso, apart from a few \u201cyou screwed up\u201d bad endings (from failing said \u201cpuzzle\u201d sections), the game have a canon \u201ctrue ending\u201d and an alternative ending that requires a second playthrough. And while the alternative ending is very sweet and IMO fits the protagonist\u2019s character best, the \u201cofficial\u201d one, that is continued in the sequels, is a depressing cliff-hanger with some dodgy writing added to the mix. It wasn\u2019t off-putting for me mostly because I knew there was an alternative path to explore and there\u2019s most likely a happy ending coming with the fourth, final game (although we\u2019ll most likely wait a few years for English release, if it ever happens).\n\nOther minor things I have to mention are some editing and grammar mistakes in the game\u2019s text, probably connected to the localization. At one time a bit of japanese text apprearing on the screen even lacked any subtitles. For the most part, the translation seemed very solid though.\n\n[b]Still, while I had a few gripes with this game, I can\u2019t recommend it strong enough. If you\u2019re into romance VNs, it should be an absolute blast to you, thanks to its (for the most part) very well thought out story, coupled with some memorable characters (those not always being the main ones though \u2013 supporting cast is pretty amazing, maybe even the best part here), gorgeous artstyle and unique atmosphere. Just don\u2019t feel shy to use the walkthrough available on the Steam community pages, it doesn\u2019t spoil much, but might save you from some disappointments and confusion.[/b]", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507297", "timestamp_created": 1504973976, "recommendationid": "34841097", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "steamid": "76561197970898913", "last_played": 1504970344, "num_games_owned": 236}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 82, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 79, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
