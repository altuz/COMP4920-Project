Good time killer until better version UNIST arrives in NA within this year. Buy on sale and play with friends for a good time.\n\nI got this game on a whim and while riding a hype train with some friends. Ignored it for about a year anf came back to it and loved it. The community discord is fantastic, with channels for every character and people always willing to help. You'll find the link to it on the discussion page.\n\nNow the best way to describe this game (I've used this comparison multiple times and people like it) is that it's Streetfighter, but faster, anime, and has a reward for not being overly defensive. It's kind of Unbalanced though. But it's still a really fun game to play with friends, and with it's sequel UNIST coming to North America within the year (already out in Japan) and being the actually really well balanced version of this game, UNIEL is a good way to dip your toes in to see if you like the overall style. It's a little confusing at first, but look up some tutorials on Youtube and you'll understand it all.

Simple controls and inputs make crossing the initial execution barrier fairly easy. Even a new player should be able to get the basics down in one to two training sessions. There's even a built-in \"smart-steer\" combo (pushing the A-button repeatedly), but it is wise to graduate from that ASAP if your plan is to play this game competitively as without option-selecting, your offense will be completely ineffective. \nFor any gameplay past beginner-level, learning about spacing and mix-ups is crutial. Damage is generally dealt in combos, so that would be the next game element in the priority order. The execution barrier for them differs from character to character, but effort is far more often than not rewarded. \n\nVisually, the game is pretty to look at. The visual aspect is rooted in the anime style, reflected in the vibrant colours, smooth animation and pleasant sprite-art. It's definitely not breathtaking but should appease anyone who doesn't have exquisite standards.\n\nThe soundtrack doesn't fall behind. The themes are composed to fit the characters, and they do a pretty good job.\n\nA few warnings... The lack of a tutorial makes the entry a bit harder than it should. In order to learn all the uses of the D button, one has to either go through trial and error or consult an external source. If nothing else, the game already has a wiki in english, containing sufficient information on the gameplay basics so the player won't feel completely lost at the start. \nMuch like many other games in the 2D fighting genre, Under Night in-Birth is easy to learn but hard to master. If you want to be any good at it, you'll need to put in some effort.\nFInal verdict: 8.7/10", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1500808189, "recommendationid": "33741658", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 2561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 118, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198046483845", "last_played": 1507156178, "num_games_owned": 74}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500420243, "review": "god I hate nanase so much but the combo game ridiculous", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "timestamp_created": 1500420243, "recommendationid": "33640230", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 5819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198064509248", "last_played": 1505417237, "num_games_owned": 160}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1500560282, "review": "Unreal BLACK things", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1500560282, "recommendationid": "33673217", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561197994777898", "last_played": 1492927246, "num_games_owned": 339}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500249771, "review": "Love it.
