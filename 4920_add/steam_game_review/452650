This is no such game. It's worse.\n\nFirst of all, you'll get that introduction video. At this moment I thought: \"Hey, at least it has a good story. Maybe this isn't that bad\". I was so wrong.\nThen comes the main menu and the loading screen. You can take a little walk outside meantime. Or a long hike. After a few hours of waiting, I had enough, and asked the Steam Support for refund. I tried again later on another computer, and voila, the game actually loads.\nIn the first level, you spawn in a forest. A giant dinosaur is running after you. Don't ask me why. There is nothing to do, you can shoot at it, but nothing will happen.\nSecond level. You're inside some sort of building, this time with human (?) enemies. Which are by the way transparent. You can try to shoot at them, but the game is lagging so bad, you can't really aim. Or move. Or whatever.\nThird level. You're on a street with some buildings. And as in the first level, you ain't got nothing to do. But the graphics are from hell. The surface is flashing all the time, probably because of bad rendered shadows or something like that. I don't really know. But this also reflects on the buildings, which means that it flashes everywhere. If you're an epileptic, run. Run as fast as you can. (Oh, and if not: run too.)\n\nWhat the games says you get for 5 bucks:\n- a shooter\n- fun\n- nice graphics\n\nWhat you really get for five bucks:\n- a boring loading screen\n- an invulnerable dinosaur\n- transparent enemies\nand lots of shitty graphics.\n\nI'm serious. Don't buy this game. This isn't kinda funny. Just don't buy it.\nAnd: did you took a look on the developer's website?", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533723", "timestamp_created": 1472934537, "recommendationid": "25332677", "language": "english", "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198228374496", "last_played": 1472933185, "num_games_owned": 15}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 21, "timestamp_updated": 1468653180, "review": "This game falls pretty squarely into the \"So Bad it's Good\" category of games.  The animations are insane and often non-existent, your shadow is a floating pair of arms with pants, you fight T-Rexes and robots in the same level, often at the same time, enemies are literally transparent, the sound effects cut out at random, and yet, I really enjoyed playing through it.  It's absolutely bonkers, and if you're someone who enjoys watching bad sci-fi movies with friends, get a friend or two and play through this together, it's quite an experience.  I definitely got eight bucks worth of enjoyment out of it.  It definitely needs one or two graphics updates, the glitchy shadows, non-existent border between land and water, and blinding reflections are less endearing then the other things I've mentioned.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.278234", "timestamp_created": 1468653180, "recommendationid": "24348451", "language": "english", "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": "12", "author": {"playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198042767409", "last_played": 1468652787, "num_games_owned": 253}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 261}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 56, "timestamp_updated": 1468663186, "review": "a game so great that you can jump out of a space station by clipping through the ceiling. after you do that, you can explore the vast expanse of space by.. falling forever.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.263570", "timestamp_created": 1468663186, "recommendationid": "24350373", "language": "english", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "15", "author": {"playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 161, "steamid": "76561197971261412", "last_played": 1468663135, "num_games_owned": 1539}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 269}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500476961, "review": "it's just bad.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1469103513, "recommendationid": "24440984", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198090741242", "last_played": 1478721590, "num_games_owned": 109}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 6, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
