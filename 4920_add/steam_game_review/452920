There's different characters - they vary from slow with lots of health to very fast with no health, and outfit additions like medallion (protect you from a hit) and in-game powerups (slow down time, suck lasers in), and firing modes (long, slow laser burst, lots of fast laser bursts).\n\nThe game basically runs on anything (my system is quite overkill - AMD FX-8320E 8-Core, 16GB, 480GB SSD and RX480 8GB) - the only things I'd like to see in future updates are a passcode system or the ability to skip to later levels once they've been played once (at the cost of a point handicap, or something similar) and maybe split-screen multiplayer. One on keyboard + Mouse, one on controller, or both players on controller. Could be intersting.\n\nEndless replayability, a funky soundtrack, and a combination of being both infuriating and \"just one more go\" for under \u00a37.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501982", "timestamp_created": 1475784972, "recommendationid": "25891188", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198005667452", "last_played": 1477769253, "num_games_owned": 271}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1481753321, "review": "Lasers with a defender of the disco. Okay, so I literally just re-worded the name of the game - But it's very much a self-explanatory title. Laser Disco Defenders is a game where you take up a laser gun and go into a world in which an alien with some terrible musical sense tries to deny the universe of all taste. Stop the evil Lord Monotone from being so tone deaf and be careful with the mechanics!\n\nThe game is well crafted, with a clever and pretty unique mechanic. It's a bullet-hell, but I'd rather call it an \"anti-bullet hell\". You are the reason you might be in trouble, if you're trigger happy! Each time you fire a laser, that laser stays in the level until you complete it. This means you have to be careful, plan your movements exactly and take out the baddies! Oh, did I mention the enemies lasers stay in the level too?\n\nYou move by using your rocket-boot like mechanics - When you let go of the up button, you'll slowly fall back down. Use this and the lasers to your advantage, pick one of four characters who have different movement speeds and varying health and boom! You've got yourself a very smart bullet-hell.\n\nGraphically, the game is gorgeous too. It's cartoony with an amazing sense of style.\n\nI'd highly recommend you get this game - Please do, it's excellent!\n\nIf you want to know a bit more, I wrote a review with in-game images over on my website: https://geekoutsw.com/2016/12/11/video-game-reivew-laser-disco-defenders/", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1481753321, "recommendationid": "28367579", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198013195672", "last_played": 1481240304, "num_games_owned": 235}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
