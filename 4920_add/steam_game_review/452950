Extremely poor video quality that actually hinders you rather than help. I seriously cannot recommend this title at all (screenshots included at bottom as proof).[/b][/h1]\n\nThe program itself is decent enough and easy to navigate. Not attractive, but gets the job done. However, you're not here to scroll through menus, you're here to observe educational videos to prepare yourself for your driving hazard test and by god, the video quality is absolutely atrocious. Horrendous. Abysmal. Fuckin' shit if you're from the south or fookin' shite if you're from up north. (PS: thanks Steam for being able to detect regional swear words).\n\nGranted, the videos by themselves aren't actually that terrible (720p with a bitrate of around 2400kbs if you really want to know the geeky details), but since you're learning an extremely crucial lesson in life that can potential prevent disaster, injury and death in the real world, I think it's pretty damn important that a product like this should provide high quality videos as a bare minimum.\n\nMy critique on the video quality isn't just a subjective opinion: I've failed some of the tests because I genuinely COULD NOT see any hazards coming up until it was too late, thanks to them just appearing as a bunch of pixels lost in the video. \n\nI've uploaded screenshots as proof: can you spot the hazards yourself? You be the judge.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=682041727\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=682041764\n\nThe depressing thing to note is that there is MUCH higher quality videos to watch on Youtube, like this for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdQRkmdhwJs For an even better comparison, change the quality from 1080p right down to 480p. Yes, 480p, that is the video quality you will be experiencing with this product, I kid you not. (note: The clip demonstrated is CGI and despite not appearing in this product, there are other CGI videos included)\n\nI've already opted for a refund, which is fairly dissapointing. If it's anything to go by, their previous product \"UK Hazard Perception 2015/16 Edition\" has already garnered up mostly negative reviews relating to the video quality.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522811", "timestamp_created": 1462907699, "recommendationid": "22900291", "language": "english", "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "steamid": "76561197970571898", "last_played": 1462904618, "num_games_owned": 446}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1465414603, "review": "[h1]DO NOT BUY[/h1]\n\nbuy the older version for cheaper it uses the same videos or buy somthing else which will be much better\n\nthey did not update the videos from the previous version and the quality is still bad\n\nI passed my test on the first attempt but this did not help me", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509700", "timestamp_created": 1465414438, "recommendationid": "23457081", "language": "english", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "steamid": "76561197983371717", "last_played": 1464877845, "num_games_owned": 271}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1470259967, "review": "[h1]Not worth with changes to hazard perception test[/h1]\n\nThe hazard perception test is now [url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hazard-perception-clips-get-a-modern-makeover]completely animated[/url] and nothing like the examples given in this product.\n\nPicture quality is fairly terrible and some of these videos feel like somebody put a cheap camera on their dashboard and drove around until they found something that they could barely call a developing hazard.
