There are a few add ons. You can have your rifleman and TL sharpshoot to hit an enemy behind cover. With your m4/203 you can aim it by selecting him and holding R. And with your SAW you an hold R and lay down suppression on a certain enemy with just that one man. What else is nice too is you can split your team into \"buddy teams\" or teams of two, you can take one squad adn make the G and R go together and have your TL and SAW go together. This is a nice addon for flanking and getting close for a frag. You can also control Bradleys which is nice because you can use it for cover and taking out enemy cover. You can also use the cannon and the MG to supress enemies or take out technicals. What else is nice is that you can have two members of your sqauds taken out and still play on unlike the original where only one can be taken out"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1497806651, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510022", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32543967", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198043081412", "num_reviews": 54, "last_played": 1497785155, "num_games_owned": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1125}, "timestamp_updated": 1497819881, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A sequel to the original Full Spectrum Warrior, Ten Hammers ups the ante significantly, in just about every way imaginable. More enviroments, more options, noticeably more challenging enemies and scenarios, this is a superb example of a follow-up done right. It also improves on a number of the technical issues from the original (i.e. HD/widescreen resolutions are now supported natively).\n\nIf you are looking for a challenging third-person tactical squad game/shooter, look no further. While it has not aged particularly well, the founding principles of the game remain as relevant as ever today. Be warned however - mistakes are punished and it will require patience, and likely many attempts, to get through to the end.\n\nHighly recommended to fans of the original game, and for those looking for something strategic.\n\nPlayed on Windows 10 Pro x64 without any issues.\n\nEDIT: The basis for this game was used as a training tool/exercise for the US Army - it is not hard to see why."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1491670827, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503946", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31021761", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198041166952", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1491670778, "num_games_owned": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 42}, "timestamp_updated": 1491670827, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I first played this game on the original xbox and it was amazing.
