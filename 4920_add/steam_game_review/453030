The performance is good and I did not notice any major bugs so far. Of course there is still a lot to do for the developers, but you can get an impression of what the final game will be like. Currently you can play the on randomly generated maps in the \"endless descend\" mode, a campaign mode is scheduled to be released during EA. There is already a variety of traps and hazardous objects that make it quite difficult to get you team out alive.
