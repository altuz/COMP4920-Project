The only way to win is to try and try again until you have found the perfect build order. There is a lot of humour and the devs obviously put some time into the storyline. The campaign really helps you learn the game so that a tedious tutorial is not needed (it is within the campaign and is not tedious).\n\nThe multiplayer has potential. Currently, there are only 1 v 1 battles, but the devs have stated that more options are being worked on. 1 v 1 battles are fun; my friend and I have probably played 10 matches since we bought the game. We have both observed that if we could have a lot more fun, however, once there can be 4 player free for alls and 2 v 2 matches.\n\nOverall, this game is great, and has potential to be even greater. Currently, if you want to play multiplayer, you need a friend with the game, but the community is growing, so that may not last very long.\n\nEDIT: They also added trading cards, soooooo", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502144", "timestamp_created": 1476920147, "recommendationid": "26122632", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198204842401", "last_played": 1498256085, "num_games_owned": 117}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1477812279, "review": "Not your typical dime in a dozen, everyday laidback puzzle game.\n- Easy to learn, hard to conquer.\n- Simple controls. \n- Humble but fun graphics. \n- Challenging AI and addictive gameplay: Don\u2019t be surprised to fail the first time, or the second, or the third\u2026.
