No AI here.\nYou tether with whoever you can and clotheline the hell out of your mates. The person or persons to reach 3 kills first is the winner.\n\nThe game definitely gets more competitive more often than not. I guarantee unholy alliances will be formed, tears will be shed, controllers will be broken. it's all worth it though.\nBramblelash is a must have in any local multiplayer connoisseur's library.\n\n\n\n-The best soy latte that you ever had, and me", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515192", "timestamp_created": 1505317734, "recommendationid": "34922039", "language": "english", "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198145476634", "last_played": 1505487046, "num_games_owned": 80}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505652365, "review": "Awesome game with great betrayal mechanics!
