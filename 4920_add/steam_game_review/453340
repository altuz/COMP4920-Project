Quirky, cuddly and witty, Hustle Cat is really worth the time for any otome fan and a great starting point for those curious about them. It's not perfect but it's a charming game for sure. \n\nThe game is a joy to look at with a cartoonish art style and colourful palette. The soundtrack contains some catchy music - my personal highlight is the opening song, which I had in my head for several days. The characters are all likeable and there's a route for everyone here.  In all it took me about 10 to 11 hours to complete the game 100% and it was well worth the price I paid.\n\nHighlights:\n- Avery is a great protagonist. They have some very witty writing behind them and they ended up being my favourite character.\n- The inclusion of allowing players to choose how Avery looks and their pronouns was such a welcome addition. \n- The story is short but intriguing, Each route offers something a little different and there's a bigger mystery to solve throughout them all. \n- This game can be hilarious. There's some very funny writing here which had me laughing a lot. \n- Good selection of romance routes that contain some nice character development and relatable moments.\n- I'll mention it again but the art style is so good! The cats look adorable, the characters are all unique in design and the backgrounds  help to cleary set each scene.\n\nImprovements:\nThe only thing I felt was that a few of the routes could of been a little longer. Some seemed to end rather abruptly after a point. Either a slightly longer epilogue for each route or a little more time before it gets to the climatic point would of helped flesh out the romances just that tad it needed.\n\nOverall Hustle Cat is the type of game which is great to just chill out and take your time with. Its short length won't demand too much of your time and if you're looking for your romance fix without the 30+ hour investment of some bigger titles, you really should look no further. Its an enjoyable read with very cute cats and characters. Avery will continue to be one of my favourite protagonists in a visual novel for quite some time (I love their dry humour) and the setting is one I wish to re-visit on more replays. \n\nIt's not without fault, but if you're looking for something sweet, filled with cats and a little magic, seriously give this a go.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520719", "timestamp_created": 1504997035, "recommendationid": "34848372", "language": "english", "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198248242264", "last_played": 1485788747, "num_games_owned": 23}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506566273, "review": "Well this was okay.
