The beginning is extremely slow and boring, the controls even on a 360 controller with the duck and cover and aim system all mushed together make you have to hold the most awkward controller positions together. All the enemies look the same, the plot doesn't really make sense or feel believable, and to top it all of there's this menacing stereotypical bad guy all \"grrr my evil plans to mess with the city\" crap while in a samurai suit of armor... in Spain... in the 1930s...

The music is awesoem. I love the way it changes when youre in combat.  The environments are really nice and just pleasant to be in.  The story didn't do much for me but it was above average for a videogame I suppose.  The graphics are really pretty.  I love the way the plants sway back and forth.  Little touches like that are great.  Unfortunately what brought the game down was the combat.  A lot of my attacks didn't connect even though my weapon was right on the guy.  Gunplay was slightly better but it seems like it was designed for a controller instead of a gamepad.  It also felt like the bad guys barely reacted to being shot which was kindof lame.

As far as 2.5D games go, this one's unique design is one of its highlights. The 8 bit / pixelated look of the characters and some of the environment provide an interesting juxtaposition between the colorful graphics and the more abrasive thematic content of navigating a war-torn city while scoring headshots or knife stabs against enemy infantry. As a fan of For Whom the Bell Tolls, I find the game to be an interesting parallel to that universe somewhat. Full controller support including aiming with the analog sticks to score headshots as you dash between cover to evade enemy fire (think Alien Hominid style..) is practically applied, while the music and sound effects are both well done. \n\nThe game could use more abilities or unlockables to take it to the next level, and backtracking through previously tread areas can become cumbersome and disorienting (especially when you don't realize there is a path you can press \"UP\" on to move through the 2D space on a Z axis to traverse a separate X plane, for example..) however what is present is enjoyable if you are into either retro style graphics OR unique military storylines in games, and I would recommend it primarily to fans of either of those tropes. I would suggest looking up unedited gameplay footage of the game as well before pulling the trigger on a purchase, as that should give a quick indication of what to expect. The gameplay is not very complex, but if you find the setting and graphical style appealing, I think you may enjoy your time with it.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1489458744, "recommendationid": "30500801", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "last_played": 1475129465, "num_games_owned": 799}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 8, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 6}}
