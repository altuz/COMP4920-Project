Great art, beautiful music and some seriously difficult objects to find make this game a winner.  On the other hand, the mini-game puzzles became repetitive and stale.  I am not a fan of those.  \n\nPick it up on a Steam sale; the title will not disappoint.\n\nYou can clear it in under 10 hours of play.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "timestamp_created": 1492963530, "recommendationid": "31323149", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198009232590", "last_played": 1492963189, "num_games_owned": 1111}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 10, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 10, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0}}
