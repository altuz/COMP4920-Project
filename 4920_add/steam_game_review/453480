I've now played enough of the game to see that the balance is very heavily skewed toward high-end-combo play. Most games between competitive decks are just a race to see who can get the big legendary combo off first, or to see if you can play your combo before the other guy draws the counter. All other turns are rendered trivial, so in a lot of cases it just boils down to a coin toss.\n\nI'm not going to take back my positive review because I really do admire the foundation.

The gameplay was fun, they showered me with free packs, and I was really getting into it. The graphics and sounds are quite lovely for a CCG, making each card feel especially powerful or wimpy as appropriate. \n\nAt first the card balance felt spot on. I had a good bit of fun playing decks of my own design not even resorting to net decks (decks that are competitive and posted online). Early game cards didn't feel as though they just rocked the game, and end game cards felt sufficiently powerful to merit having them.\n\nThen as I moved up in experience and power, I started engaging more experienced players, I ran into the same issue I have in most other online CCGs. The net decks start taking over. People with multiple copies of especially powerful mid to late game cards become more abundant. The freedom to experience the card game, to experiment with the cards, and to make a deck which feels as though it was truly mine diminished greatly. With recent expansions they even added extremely obnoxious and powerful end game cards which can be seen in almost every deck you play against. They are truly so powerful that not using them puts you at a significant disadvantage, and you must always be prepared to counter them, especially if you don't have them yourself.\n\nAs a passing Hearthstone player, I took up this game based on word of mouth hoping that it could scratch the CCG itch that Hearthstone was seriously lacking as of late, a similar CCG with stagnant gameplay.\n\nThe new player experience is awesome. I can't deny that I had fun playing this game initially; However, down the road, bear in mind that the players who play to win will overwhelm experimental gameplay, and how well you're doing as a new player won't reflect on your performance once you start encountering said players. Sadly, my joy for this game has passed.\n\nIf you are a player who enjoys experimenting with cards with a reasonable degree of success, I wouldn't recommend this game. But, if you don't mind taking the time and effort to acquire said extremely powerful cards to get an edge on people who don't have them, then feel free to give it a try. Such is the nature of CCGs, and I personally don't even know why I even bother trying them anymore.\n\nFor players of my expectations, this game is not recommended.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523377", "timestamp_created": 1486385269, "recommendationid": "29740404", "language": "english", "votes_up": 54, "comment_count": "18", "author": {"playtime_forever": 3430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561197984961040", "last_played": 1486383957, "num_games_owned": 142}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 45}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486017477, "review": "It's following the same steps as hearthstone, basically every expansion it becomes more and more dumb to play but at least more people play hs, so why would you lose your time playing this card game.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500277", "timestamp_created": 1486017477, "recommendationid": "29643225", "language": "english", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198061053787", "last_played": 1498958708, "num_games_owned": 62}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 4}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1486125237, "review": "If you're coming here from HS to avoid the aggro meta, don't bother.

I personally don't mind the revealing art whatsoever, but be warned. This game most likely isn't for children 13 and under.\n\nGameplay 9/10 - Generally follows 3 main ideas similar to another card game Hearthstone. You want to control your card advantage, board presence, and tempo. By itself the game would be pretty mediocre (one of the reasons why I quit HS), but Shadowverse introduces the evolve mechanic. Evolving creatures generally boosts stats and lets them instantly attack into another creature. I personally love the huge tempo swings experienced from evolves and that keeps me invested into the game.\n\nDevelopers 9/10 - Some games often dump progression into a strict meta (Such as HS pushing the aggro meta). Despite the undesirable and often unfair games, the problem isn't the meta, its the developers' responsiveness to the desires of the community. I personally feel that the developers of Shadowverse (actual players of other card games) understand what is happening to the ladder and are making a step which will benefit the most. One thing we don't need is sudden, rash decisions in designing such a large game. Shadowverses' developers have not gone to balance too many cards yet so that aspect is uncertain. What is certain, however, is that Shadowverses' developers are one of the most F2P friendly card game developers. They often give out free packs making it super easy to F2P, something I will capitalize next.\n\nFree To Play-ability 10/10 -  Starting the game gets you 30-40 packs for free, which can almost always provide you with enough vials to craft a competitive deck for ladder. Free packs from promotions and tons of quick rewards only speed up the growth of your collection. As of now, Shadowverse is the most f2p friendly card game (Out of HearthStone and Magic [Haven't tried Evoker yet]). \n\nIs there any pay to win BS?\nShadowverse also offers the sale of crystals, which can be used to purchase more packs and pre-built decks. Despite the initial view that spending money leads to a greater advantage, skill and knowledge often play a greater factor in determining the outcome of games than solid card quality. Therefore I would say this game is almost completely free of pay-to-win because you can still lose running a deck with terrible card quality but if you have a decently competitive deck a lot of the games come down to skill.\nEdit: With the new expansions coming out and releasing cards on a new level of power, I would have to modify my original statement. Card quality does matter now. \n\nIs it worth it for a new player to spend money?\nShadowverse is excellent for new players as they offer the magic of pre-built decks. Pre-built decks are great because they offer a solid selection of cards and guarantee necessary legendaries for a craft. They cost 500 crystals for the first purchase (increasing to 750 for ever subsequent purchase), which is literally only 5$ during a crystal sale. I feel like they carry their value as they bring in critical legendaries (which of course can be crafted if you don't have spare change) while introducing how crafts should be played. Currently, the most valuable pre-builts are the Bloodcraft prebuilt (control blood), Forestcraft prebuilt (almost every forestcraft deck uses cards from this pre-built), and Shadowcraft prebuilt.\n\nI would definitely rate Shadowverse a solid 9/10 overall due to its defining characteristics, solid gameplay, and f2p aspects. I hope you have the same enjoyment I did while playing this game, and don't be too competitive while playing.

While it's fun and all when you're the one accomplishing it, it feels really uninteractive when you're on the recieving end. Still, the devs are really generous with free packs. Does it make up for the repetitive and uninteractive gameplay? YMMV.\n\nIf you know Hearthstone, the digital collectible card game by Blizzard, then it's simple : while being fundamentally a japanese copy of Hearthstone, Shadowverse improves the formula in many quite important ways : more complex, less reliant on RNG, more generous in F2P content, and less greedy for the paid-content. However, in the competitive end of the game, you'll run into the same \"problems\" with a specific metagame and over-represented decks that tend towards short \"aggro\" games (but less aggravating than in Hearthstone).\n\nIf you don't, then let me elaborate a little : Shadowverse is a digital Collectible Card Game. CCG are a peculiar kind of games. They not only function as games, with rules, goals, a winner and a looser, but also as collection, where the goal is to \"collect them all\". As such, before considering investing time, and maybe money, into said game, you should be perfectly aware of one thing : collectible games are expensive. They're designed to make you pay to complete a collection, and what you pay is the feeling to make progress in that collection.\n\nNot that it's impossible to play as a F2P! In fact, Shadowverse, in comparison to other CGG, is quite generous with its free content, and you can reasonnably expect to open roughly three free packs every two days. In comparison, Hearthstone is more like three packs in four days.\n\nImo, the best way to handle this kind of game is to manage your expectations : what is your goal? \n- complete the collection? This game is kinda cheap for the collection aspect, investing roughly 90 dollars every three months should be enough to get one exemplary of each card (and yes, this is cheap...for this kind of game)\n- be competitive? Because you get quite a lot of free stuff, you can reasonably make a free competitive deck by destroying all your useless cards and crafting the ones you will use.\n- have fun by making weird decks? Shadowverse offer a \"random\" mode with rewards, Take two, which is quite cool and balanced.\n\nJust note that doing everything at once will be really difficult.\n\nThat being said, Shadowverse is probably your best bet, because of how beginner-friendly it is. Good luck!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1485779307, "recommendationid": "29584272", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_forever": 21195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198060932732", "last_played": 1506627752, "num_games_owned": 101}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485928446, "review": "Shadowverse, for awhile seemed like an optimal replacement for Hearthstone or just a nice card game for newcomers.\n\nPOSITIVES:\n\nThe game is a refreshing card game that you'll likely enjoy if you've enjoyed games like Hearthstone or Magic the Gathering. There are many different ways to build decks and the classes are pretty diverse in how they play.\n\nGetting wins early on with a custom deck feels very rewarding, and the game can be very addictive!\n\nI also need to give the game props for being quite generous! The game gives you 45 packs if I recall correctly to start out, which is pretty dang good. That combined with the fact that you earn gold just via logging in and completing single player and what not is pretty nice. It would be nice if you could earn gold just by playing and/or winning games without having to adhere to the daily missions.\n\nSo, Shadowverse is certainly a great game. However, if you don't have someone to play with like me, you'll find that the more you play, the more the game falls into the same pitfalls as Hearthstone unfortunately. Which caused me to gradually lose interest.\n\nWith that said...\n\n\nNEGATIVES:\n\nShadowverse certainly does have a lot of neat strategies and deck types, but it suffers from a similar problem of the developers not balancing cards that are clearly way too good.\n\n(The higher you make it ranked play, the more you'll see less variety and the more you'll see the same decks. The biggies I see the most often are that are pretty infamous: Runecraft Daria and Bloodcraft Aggro)\n\nSome specifics that you may want to skip: There are cards that have mathematical objective improvements and I can't fathom how the cards were designed and considered to be okay (if you get high in ranked not playing Runecraft, you'll learn to hate one card: Daria, as virtually every runecraft deck is built around that card or dimensional shift). Aggro decks sometimes are impossible to win against due to the nature of essentially needing to draw certain cards quickly to deal with the insane damage output, you can lose as soon as turn 5 against an aggro deck. \n\nIt's funny in a way, because the Bloodcraft classes's mechanic is that certain Bloodcraft cards will have unique effects if your hero is below 10 defense (which is health). However, aggro is so insanely effective and quick that you'll never see bloodcraft decks that actually utilize that mechanic.\n\n(There are of course, other decks you'll encounter in your ranked adventures, Havencraft control, Swordcraft aggro, shadowcraft control/aggro. There's certainly more variety than I encountered in Heathstone, so that's to be noted.)\n\nSo, most of my complaints with the game are similar to my complaints to Hearthstone: Aggro is very effective and not very skill-based (in most cases, mostly Bloodcraft) to play well and win quickly. And there's some cards that very clearly need fine-tuning but never get altered.\n\nThe game provided me fair amount of hours of entertainment, and I'd probably have more fun if I had a friend (single tear) to play gimmick decks with as even in unranked I mostly encounter meta decks. I should note I'm A3 rank, I'm fairly \"experienced\" so I'd like to think I'm somewhat knowledgeable, but I'm no pro by any means!]\n\nCouple things to add, there's a \"Take Two\" mode which is equivilent to the arena mode in Hearthstone, so there's also that. And there's a short campaign for each class with a neat lil story, also nice!\n\nCONCLUSION (finally): \n\nThe game is good. It's just a shame because the problems it suffers from could be be lessened greatly by some simple fine-tuning I would think. BUT if you have someone to battle against that's a big bonus, and the game still has a great deal to offer so I do still reccomend it.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "timestamp_created": 1485928332, "recommendationid": "29621391", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 4491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "steamid": "76561198041765678", "last_played": 1490921088, "num_games_owned": 399}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500199047, "review": "What's Shadowverse\n\nSV is an anime card battle game where you select 7 unique heros to use. in heartstone you choose 9 but SV does have \"hero powers\"... here i'm going to tell you why SV is a really nice game since i've played 1000+ hours of the game and im only ranked about 2700. \n\nedit: SV lets you make a deck out of 40 cards just likes ygo, but unlike ygo the \"legendary\" cards cannot be limited to 1 and you can only have 3 cards of the same kind in a deck..SV has a mana system just like in heartstone and mtg, where each turn you get +1 more mana points. for example on turn 1 you can only play 1 mana cards, but on turn 10 you can play any number of mana cards that add's up to 10\n\n[/spoiler]( if you are confused about sv's playerbase in numbers i can roughly estimate using this simple equation: 12000* + (12000 x 9**). an estimated total of 120000 million. )\n\n*average No. of SV players on steam\n**No. of actual downloads divided by shown downlaods on google play (which is 9mil/1mil)[/spoiler]\n\npros:\n\n-quest: in this game SV has types of 3 quests to me at least, 1st is the game quest which is like daily missions etc, 2nd it's crafting OP cards and make a powererful combo deck, and 3rd which not many people realise is searching for pros irl asking them for their decklist online. im not sure if you know what i mean by that but it's more realiable than making a deck by yourself. \n\ngameplay: it's really balanced since the newest expansion\"wonderland dreams\" came out and i think even though all card game have some sort of RNG, SV tries extremely hard to minimize, which they're doing pretty well. this game is pay to win but here's the catch, the packs are extremely expensive and Cygames prefers to give you free packs to start buidling your own deck. i've spent almost close to nothing and i already have $500 worth of cards. \n\n*edit: i dont see the reason why some people downvote this game JUST because cygames says it will NEVER ever nerf OP legendaries but other cards that ASSISTS those legendaries. THIS is because cygames want shadowverse to be a quniue game than heartstone to be a short battle that usually decides who win and who loses by the end of turn 10 (usually). just remeber that is the game shadowverse it's unique and how they balance decks is that they will buff/nerf cards. that is all.\n\ncons:\n\n-it's a new game which means there'll be buggs everywhere, but the devs are REALLY REALLY concerned about that and they try to fix it ASAP, the amount of downloads of SV is already 9 million in less than a year. imagine in 3 years at this rate it'll be 30 million (jokes)\n\n-the storyline: just a bit of character developement (idk) however i like the rewards that they give and unique boss battles at the end of every chapter :P\n\nconclusion:\n\n-what i wished Shadowverse can implement: SV a game being very similar to HS can have really straightforward gameplay. Somes i wonder if devs can impliment things like tag team battles, where it isn't 1v1 anymore but can rather have a 2v2 pvp, because this way SV wouldn't be able to have massive winstreaks using a tier S meta deck (which is happening right now atm) just like in league of legends. so the more gameplay machanics ther better? that's what i think.. to me at least... and SV would be more fun than it is now!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506418", "timestamp_created": 1485328153, "recommendationid": "29477581", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 57067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 64, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198133756040", "last_played": 1506580369, "num_games_owned": 27}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1490545666, "review": "Great game, I can certainly see how it can be fun and all.

It felt like a perfect mix of balance, lack of RNG, and fair progression, but somewhere along the lines it quickly did a 360. For those of you coming from Hearthstone seeking something new, I will start by saying that even at its worse this game is better than Hearthstone, but don't expect to be impressed after you've spent some time getting familiar with it. If you are looking for a CCG with balance, a minimal amount of RNG that has no overbearing effect on gameplay, and a decent amount of progression within reasonable time as mentioned above, Shadowverse fails to deliver.\n\n[b] Balance/Meta: [/b]\nContrary to first impressions, the imbalance within Shadowverse derive from many reasons, with one reason being its blatantly overpowered legendary cards. The meta boasts cards such as Seraph (a card that if not answered using a specific spell within a certain amount of turns automatically wins its user the game), Prince of Darkness/a.k.a Satan (a card that guarantees victory, assuming the user is not near death, by replacing the users hand with blatantly broken spells and minions), Daria ( a card that promotes reckless play by not only giving its user a whole new hand full of cards when needed, but also significantly lowering the cost of the cards aquired. Daria can also have her cost reduced, which makes it easier to play her on an early turn), and much more. Another reason are the types of decks that are standard to the meta. The main four types of decks you will come across (unless you are in the beginner ranks) are braindead agrro face decks, control decks that aim to stall the game until they can drop a game winning legendary, one turn kill cheese decks, and snowball decks aiming to constantly flood the board with minions until you finally run out of answers. I've recently made it to B0, and although not a super high rank, I have only come into contact with those four types of decks for majority of my time playing this game. It's gotten so repetitive and nervre wrecking that I hesitate to start the game now. If all of what I have said sounds bad so far, don't even get me started on the RNG. If you draw a bad hand and don't get anything playable pass turn 3, you may as well surrender. It gets even worse if you draw bad AND get matched up against a face aggro deck. You have to sit there with your thumb in your mouth while being whacked in the face as you watch them flood the board on perfect curve.\n\n[b] Progression: [/b] \nNot much to say here except for it's infinitely better than the amount of time it takes to progress in Hearthstone. Where the progression falls short within Shadowverse is that you usually need multiple amounts of different lengendary and gold cards within the same deck to make it viable. It can be quite expensive is terms of vials (similar to dust in Hearthstone). The way to get around this is by usually making a cheap face aggro deck, but this is a horrible option for anyone who doesn't like to spend all of their game time mindlessly rushing face. \n\n[b] Summary: [/b]\nIn general, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone looking to play it competitively and advance in rank. This is the type of game that would best be played logging in to complete daily missions, maybe having a couple of unranked games, and then logging out. If you still wish to play it competitively, just be prepared to be met with a wall of cancerous decks (which you will be eventually forced to play as well if you ever plan on standing a chance) and games completely depending on RNG as you move through the ranks. \n\nAlthough it has no pc version in the US, a game I would recommend sticking to is Mabinogi Duel. You'd most likely have a better time with that than both Shadowverse and Hearthstone.
