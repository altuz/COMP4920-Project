Feels like a newgrounds flashgame, worth the money (kinda). Something's missing.\n\nI think this game needs improvement, seeing that there's only five enemy types. The health seems perfectly balanced, though. So I don't really care about the hordes upon hordes of enemies.\n\n\nAll in all, I think this game deserves a sequel. It's worth the four bucks for its unique style and gameplay, but rewards aren't exactly something that will keep driving everyone back to play more and more of this game.\n\nWhat I'd say is, if that there's more things. Maybe more enemy types, more classes, more areas, maybe skills. I don't know. I don't make games.\n\nAll in all, I'd say it's (kind of) worth the money, if it's at a huge discount. (E.G PAST %25 OFF), I'd reccomend it. And if you have some spare change lying around, I'd say go for it. But alone, as it is. It feels like there's something missing. I even beat the game in one go, not going past %50 HP. \n\nI rate it 6/10 Kevin Bacons. It's not even close to being 'meh', but it's not close to being fantastic or bad. Indie games have done way better, and have been way bigger. Reach for the stars, and you'll make a better game. And I'll be there to buy it.\n\n\n(Jim F. Ing.
