You honestly ether like these or you don't for the most part.\n\nI guess I'll give a few more details than that, the marble controls have a bit of learning curve, the marble itself has weight and you can't stop on a complete dime, for better or for worse. you can unlock anything including stages by earning orbs, meaning you can still progress if stuck on an annoying stage, the game is pretty for a marble game though most games of this type are simple graphics so thats not saying alot.\n\nEither way if you are a marble game enthusiast theres nothing bad about this one.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505706", "timestamp_created": 1460502955, "recommendationid": "22385150", "language": "english", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 55, "steamid": "76561197998180632", "last_played": 1477479212, "num_games_owned": 1022}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1460490503, "review": "[h1]Introduction[/h1]\nYou might be asking yourself? Marble Blast Ultra, where art thou? Maybe not in those exact words, but if you are... GET OUTTA HERE SHAKESPEARE! Anyways, Marble Void is a game inspired by Marble Blast Ultra (yep, that Xbox Live Arcade title on the Xbox 360) and another title called Marble Madness (that I never played). The game adds more to the formula of the Marble genre of game, but takes away from some things too (which isn't a bad thing).\n\n[h1]The Experience So Far[/h1]\nI've managed to beat the Easy Difficulty levels after doing some exploration with the game. It took me about 30 minutes, but that's only if you're going about figuring out the game itself. There's a ton of potential for speed running like the past Marble titles. There's also these things called \"orbs\" that grant you unlocks if you \"bank\" a certain amount. Banking orbs just happens after collecting and clearing a level, and each level has a certain amount of orbs to collect. The unlocks you are granted after banking are new modes, and I believe even new marbles (I have yet to see that yet though).\n\nThe reason I purchased Marble Void was to finally get my Marble Blast Ultra fix, and let me say it delivered 'marbleously' (get it?). At the beginning it had me thinking, \"well, it's not Marble Blast Ultra\", but eventually I had mixed thoughts of, \"it might as well be\" and \"it's not trying to be\". The game teaches you how to play the game and what the game has to offer right at the beginning of the levels. During these points of being taught the game's level design and physics you'll compare the games you've played before, and think \"This isn't Marble Blast Ultra or Marble Madness - this is Marble Void!\"\n\nThe game has a few things that obviously need to be addressed such as:\n[list]\n[*]Game speed. It feels very slow compared to the other games... However, the game speed also makes sense considering you're a marble in a void.\n[*]Moving platforms can feel slow. It's not my graphic settings either that makes this seem slow, I've dabbled into the \"toaster\" graphic setting, and the moving platforms make me anxious when waiting on them.\n[*]The menu's aren't controller enabled. Although I like how you can bind your own controls, it's only effective in-game. I'm a lazy gamer, and I don't like having to press start, and then use my mouse to navigate menu's.\n[*]A respawn button would be nice instead of pressing start and clicking respawn. Again, it's more a nitpick for fast gameplay.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Conclusion[/h1]\nThis is Marble Void, a game where you'll be saying things like, \"what about Marble Blast Ultra?\" in a 'who cares' manner? Marble Void does a lot better with the Marble genre, but although it has it's weaknesses on pacing, it's still a game where you can't deny having fun with.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502084", "timestamp_created": 1460490503, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1464026031, "recommendationid": "22382168", "language": "english", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198018071521", "last_played": 1460488930, "num_games_owned": 318}, "developer_response": "Thank you for your kind words!
