I'm wondering how to be tactical in this game if its not that fast and quick on killing the enemy. the enemy AI isnt that great either.\n\nThe High:\n- Cheap price especially on sale (the developer lower the base price from previous price)\n- good level design\n- steam cards\n\nThe low:\n- Not enough settings & Options. \n- No Graphic resolution setting\n- no controller support features\n- cheap AI \n- No keyboard remapping\n- Not that much replayability\n\n\nAt this state im not recommending on buying, hopefully the developer fix this on next updates, not abandoning the game and add more features then i will change my review.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536611", "timestamp_created": 1493793779, "recommendationid": "31519218", "language": "english", "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": "25", "author": {"playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "steamid": "76561198304693771", "last_played": 1493892219, "num_games_owned": 1100}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505639479, "review": "its fun but gets boring really quickly. shoud add more stuff. everything happens to fast and its confusing. the bot can spot you really easy and thats boring. as soon as you go out of spawn everything charges at you with explosions and bullets.\n+ you should try to add multiplayer and make the game easier to stealth. \n\nthanks :)", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493311", "timestamp_created": 1497540291, "recommendationid": "32440277", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198122567957", "last_played": 1497540007, "num_games_owned": 90}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
