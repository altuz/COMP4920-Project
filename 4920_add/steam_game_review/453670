Now I had mixed opinions of White Mirror, it had some generally good things going for it but it was ruined by terrible grammar and cheap jump scares. However, you would have thought that with some time, the developer GDNomad would have improved from his past creations, however, from my personal experience, I believe that The Lost Souls is actually worse than White Mirror.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nGameplay in The Lost Souls is strikingly similar to White Mirror, you walk around 4 separate linear environments, complete the objectives in your diary, solve some puzzles and dodge the odd monster.\n\nThe main issue that The Lost Souls suffers from is with its horror elements, the horror elements here are terribly implemented, I even found myself laughing at the attempted horror elements, with cheap jump scares, lazy attempts at establishing horror from the environment and relying on making models appear and then disappear as their main idea of horror.\n\nThe game also has puzzles throughout, however, the puzzles in The Lost Souls are some of the worst puzzles I've ever seen, in terms of difficulty, these things are incredibly easy a toddler could probably solve them (I'm not even joking when I say that.) The puzzles literally have the answers, but the answers are spelled backward. For example, if the answer to one of the puzzles is \"salad\" it will display the puzzle as \"dalas\" and all you need to do is type in \"salad\" which is the word read backwards and that's about 70% of the puzzles in the game, the other 30% consist of walking through the linear and small map finding levers to pull to open the next door, which you can imagine how easy that is.\n\nWith both elements that the game relies on falling flat, there really isn't anything to enjoy too much when playing this.\n\n[h1]Graphics/Sound[/h1]\n\nLike The White Mirror, the graphics in The Lost Souls is one of the few redeeming factors of the game and for the most part are pretty good, they're consistent, the lighting is great and at times to be marvelled at, however in The Lost Souls that lighting isn't used too frequently, it's really only used in the opening act. But the game overall looks consistently good besides the monsters that are used in the game that looks like they have very little and low amounts of detail put into them.\n\nThe sound design is a mixed bag, the sound design it's self, not focusing on how they're used is pretty good, however, if you do incorporate the uses of these then they're below average. There was one moment at the start where the sound was out of sync and played the big thudding sound of a jump scare before it actually happened, ruining a usually tacky horror attempt even more. But to be honest the sound design was one of the few things that were really of minor good horror quality and if they were used a bit more effectively, then they might have had a better impact.\n\n[h1]Play Time/Replayability[/h1]\n\nThe game consists of 4 chapters, each of which can be completed in around 10 minutes, and possibly 5 on a speedrun and possibly even less, meaning play times to complete the game can range between 20-40 minutes.\n\nDue to this being a linear horror game, there really is little to no replayability factor of the game, the game gives you no reason to go through it again, no collectibles, nothing.\n\n[h1]Final Recommendation[/h1]\n\nThe Lost Souls is bad. I'm not too sure of a better way to display that. It's gameplay elements fall flat at almost every turn, it has sorry excuses for horror, it's puzzles are laughably easy, and it's sound design, while having a good sound overall, is misused in a way for it to have no effect.\n\nPros\n+ Pretty good graphics\n+ Good sound\n\nCons\n- Bad horror\n- Laughably easy puzzles\n- Misuse of sound for an overall bad sound design\n- No replayability\n- Short\n- Bad grammar\n\nFinal verdict: 3/10\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews]My Steam Curator[/url]", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525820", "timestamp_created": 1491832174, "recommendationid": "31060173", "language": "english", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "steamid": "76561198018006511", "last_played": 1491826799, "num_games_owned": 1011}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 20, "review_score": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "Negative", "total_negative": 18}}
