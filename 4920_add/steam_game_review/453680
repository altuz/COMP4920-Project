Overall this game is amazing, and it's only $2.99, so almost anyone can buy it! If you have the money and you like minigolf you should get it, even if there are not many holes in the game at the time you buy it. So get this game and play some minigolf!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1499474962, "recommendationid": "33358968", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198199281165", "last_played": 1506995858, "num_games_owned": 23}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499914635, "review": "Pros:\n-Pretty graphics\n-Good physics\n-Decent controls\n-Good price for what it is\n\nCons:\n-Not enough levels\n-Some of the levels are extremely unfair if you don't follow the gimmick (like the one you need to jump in the wall then stop before you fall off). I think if you essentially MUST trickshot to get a par at the most, that's just overkill, which goes into my next con:\n-No practice mode (Whenever I make a silly mistake I have to restart all over)\n-Ball color keeps changing to a random color\n-Course creator is ultra buggy. Things will disappear, things will refuse to delete/be selected, so I constantly have to restart.\n-CC has no essential tools, like standard walls? Copypasting the generic cube prop isn't very user friendly\n\nPrice is reasonable for the game as a whole, but there are plenty of better things i can do with that cash. I'd like to enjoy multiplayer in this too, but I feel the same irritations will occur when playing with a buddy. If anyone is searching for a straight-forward, forgiving, and chill golf/putt game, I can't say this is it.\n\nEdit: Appreciate the response. I would like to see this play a lot better, the fact it's still currently being updated is good.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "timestamp_created": 1499831502, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1499874643, "recommendationid": "33471061", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198000737174", "last_played": 1499830839, "num_games_owned": 186}, "developer_response": "Hi squeezit,\n\nWe're sorry that our game didn't meet your expectations, but we are constantly working to improve it. We just want to reassure you that we take all comments and criticisms to heart and use them to improve our game.\n\nRegarding some of your points:\n\nWe are aware that we don't offer the same quantity of built in courses as other games. We have chosen to focus our efforts on modding and the Workshop to help differentiate our game from the rest. That being said, we are currently working on a 9-hole Pirate course that will be available once we leave Beta.\n\nFor the Course Creator, we will be publishing some tutorials for the Course Creator very soon that will hopefully provide helpful information on how to use it. But you can add walls to the edges of greens by selecting an edge, right-clicking and checking \"Outside Wall\" or \"Inside Wall\". We will also be adding a significant amount of content to the Course Creator once we leave Beta.\n\nThanks for your review!\n\nRoad Turtle Games Team", "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 36, "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 27, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 9}}
