By far, this game's greatest strength is its co-op campaign. My friends and I took to this game almost instantly for its fantasy setting, turn-based combat, and online co-op. VERY few games fall into that category.\n\nSo, selling points on the game:\n- online co-op campaign, easy to use invites through steam.\n- very huge improvement from the first Dark Quest, I mean you can really appreciate the game so much more if you play or even look at the first one.\n- very well done art, making for a very visually pleasing experience. \n- great tactical combat, but think more \"board game\" than actual D&D\n- interesting characters, 7 total at this time...looks like there might be room for 3 more?\n- persistency between maps, you keep equipment, potions, gold and whatnot, interact with the village. \n- great replayability, the maps increase in difficulty after you beat them, so replaying actually does provide a challenge.\n- super cheap for the hours of playtime you'll get!\n- simple but effective story. Bad sorceror in giant castle torments the town, and he has an army of goblins, orcs, and undead. What more do you need here?\n\nCons:\n- there are a few bugs here and there, it's Early Access\n- sometimes, you'll find yourself wishing for more (like, dang I wish there were more characters, dang I wish we could further customize these characters, or dang I wish my equipment showed up on my character) but remember, it's Early Access\n- you have to start with only the Barbarian and the Mage, then beat the first 5 levels if you wanted a specific other character (Devs if you're reading this, can we pick our starting heroes please?) but once again, Early Access!\n\nIn summary, all of the (admittedly minor) faults I found in this game, I was able to forgive because it is absolutely charming, super fun to play with 2 more of your friends, and if something didn't work for whatever reason...I just found myself saying \"Oh well it's Early Access\".\nI'll be creating an account on their forums soon to list the few bugs we found, and maybe highlight some areas where the game could easily gain some free points with players. But overall, I absolutely recommend this game. It's a real winner, and I love supporting hard-working indie devs just like this.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492233", "timestamp_created": 1504538276, "recommendationid": "34737020", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198022318021", "last_played": 1505187017, "num_games_owned": 306}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502119965, "review": "Gamers like Bullfrog and Brilyn don't seem to get what early access means. This game is being updated and built upon on a roughly bi-weekly basis. The last update unlocked more levels, patched errors and the developers asked for feedback on making new quests and balance issues.\n\nAs for price and gameplay, for the first the game may have only had 12-14 accessable levels a month or two ago from the time of this review, but its growing now. Read the description of the game.  And the gameplay, if you don't see gameplay footage on the store page go to youtube to check the game out to see if it's for you.\n\n\nBeen playing games since the mid 80's, and this is one of the funnest I have ever played. Its simple, addictive, a little flawed - but getting better each and every week with great updates. I've finished all the levels but there are another 8 levels they are still working on that I am looking forward to playing. Each class has 7 ability/spells that you can claim and then upgrade and you can craft gear to better prepare yourself in different levels. Having a shield will protect you from arrows, important when those goblin archers have you in their sites.
