The levels quite quickly get to the point where they are pretty large. Normally this is a good thing in platformers, but I was sometimes left wandering about in this maze of platforms that vanished behind me, wondering if this lower path I kept trying to get past would eventually get me to the door, or if all of my attempts at getting past these obstacles were meaningless. All the while, platform vanishing kept me at a pace I didn't feel comfortable with leaving little to no room for error, and forcing me to preform tasks with the controls I was not yet comfortable with. Not to mention that so little of the story is gone through between levels that you forget what is even going on.\n\nToo be fair though, the mechanics are nice, 'boss' levels are put in, and secrets are hidden to reward you for exploring the levels, but unfortunately, the disappearing platform mechanic makes it a pain to explore levels because more than half of the platforms you jump on end up disappearing by the time your are halfway to the next one, effectively punishing exploration.\n\nAnd the global cycles just add on to the punishment. Vanishing platforms are fine, but when a third of the platforms you want to jump onto will kill you if you don't wait for it to turn off, vanishing platforms become the bane of your existence.\n\nNow, maybe I'm just terrible at platforming, but to me all these things added up to be an experience that I didn't really enjoy, being too fast-paced and punishing.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1499274828, "recommendationid": "33283837", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198118930093", "last_played": 1484180085, "num_games_owned": 19}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
