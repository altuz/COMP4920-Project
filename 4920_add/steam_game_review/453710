I haven't sampled the multiplayer yet but the solo is amazing fun. If you can convince a few friends to drop the miniscule price (77p) then you will have hours of fun.\n\nMy only problems are the lack of customization and a basic solo mode. Adding a league system is something that would keep me coming back and even something as simple as being able to select hair colour would be enough to please me.\n\nAs it is though this is a solid game for the price and an amazing first game from the developer.\n\nBravo Sir, Bravo.\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498180", "timestamp_created": 1501780640, "recommendationid": "33997493", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198039061533", "last_played": 1501876921, "num_games_owned": 85}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 37, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 30, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
