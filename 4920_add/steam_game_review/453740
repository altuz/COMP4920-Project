This game isn't just a messy colour-chaos. It's actually a quite challenging game. It's a collection of almost dark-souls-like bossfights that require very tactical gameplay, especially considering you can only be hit 3 times before you have to start over. I'm only in my third bossfight so far but up until now i had to use well timed blocks to deflect orbs shot at me and even a giant space-ghost that was trying to ram me. The more bosses you defeat, the more abilities you seem to unlock which you definitely will need for your next bossfights.\nIn my opinion for 5\u20ac definitly a game worth trying out.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525178", "timestamp_created": 1458564447, "recommendationid": "21963037", "language": "english", "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198043300723", "last_played": 1458644862, "num_games_owned": 502}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 4}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1459903988, "review": "I can already tell I am going to enjoy this as much as spaceman sparkles 2.\n\nThanks for making this!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500373", "timestamp_created": 1459903988, "recommendationid": "22261622", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561197986187249", "last_played": 1496370154, "num_games_owned": 149}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1479973264, "review": "Its a very interesting game. It has little to no story but I think that is a strength of the game that it is good without one, and would be best without it. Its a hard game. If you would like to challenge yourself with a hard game, this would be one to check out. The weapons are given to the player in stages, which I think is a good way to get used to the controls and to introduce how to use it (even if it seems hard to find out what it does for the first few attempts). My only gripe with the game is that the way to get to the bosses is extremely difficult for a few, specifically the ones on the sides of a floating platform. It looks amazing and I absolutely love the music, but there were only a few tracks so it got annoying after it looped for the 20th time. This game was a lot of fun and I would recomend it to my friends and anyone looking for a game to play for a few hours, or a lot of hours depending on how well you get used to how gravity works in the game.\n\nNow editing this, I nominated the game for one of the steam awards (small game before it gained award one, cant remember off the top of my head) It wont get the award tbh, but this is a neat game that most people probably don't know about and thought this fit that category perfectly.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502645", "timestamp_created": 1460850285, "recommendationid": "22465114", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198081757172", "last_played": 1460909916, "num_games_owned": 45}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1463618488, "review": "My initial thoughts were; \"Okay, A Kind Ale War kinda made me wanna check out this game.\"\n\nMy reaction upon playing game; \"Okay, tight controls, chill vibes\"\n\nMy reaction upon seeing first boss; \"HOLY MOTHER OF CTHULHU THIS IS AMAZING\"\n\nPROS: DANK BEATS, SWEET CONTROLS, LASERS AND RAINBOWS\n\nCONS: YOU THINK THERE'S CONS?

A transition to 3D was a bad idea. VERY BAD.\n\nThe game consists of 10% Getting to the bosses and 90% Fighting the bosses. And I assure you that you'll either be raging or bored as fuck for 95% of the time you play this game. It revolves around you... Well, revolving around a center point of gravity. Some times what surround that point is material you can stand on. Some times it's surrounded by two balls of water on opposite sides of each other. Or just water. You have many different ways of moving around this terrain. How well do these mechanics function? Pretty damn poorly. I'm a frequent player of Team Fortress 2, so I came into this game biased and used to a certain form of aerial movement. Though a good game will know how to get you associated with its movement system. Anyways, the quality of the game is Sonic the Hedgehog levels of transitions to 3D. There's not much good to say about it, excpet that it has good music. But that doesn't give you an excuse for making a shitty game. Now, onto the bad things.\n\nThe first three inch thorn stuck in my big toe is getting to the bosses. Dear god is it tedious. Some platforms are so difficult to get to, it comes down to spinning around the panet that you revolve around and hoping to god you somehow land on one. Though this isn't that bad, since the game puts you straight back into the action when you die, but it's still so annoying. It can take 15 Minutes to get to the boss. Not going through an action packed level or being taken through an intriguing story. Just looping around a planet, trying to get onto a foot long platform while at Mach 4. An when you finally get to it, you're treated to a hardcore BDSM room, Who's on top? That depends on the boss.\n\nYes, the bosses. The footlong porcupine quill stuck into your chest. Some lay on the table and strap themselves in, crying for punishment. Others shove you onto it and make a lamp post come out the other side of you like a rotisserie chicken. The prior kind of bosses are so easy, it comes down to holding down three buttons for about 5 minutes. No need to prepare this scenario. It's that simple. The latter bosses are fucking insane, They either keep you in an cramped space or have attacks that are so fucking annoying to dodge, and may I add you can only get hit three times. And even after five minutes of arbotrary button holding or hours of trying to dodge those attacks that literally made a hole in your wall, directly or not, You have to deal with something else. A boss after that boss.\n\nYes, the heart shaped vortex. The dog that's finished eating your reproductive organs and is going to your brain for some dessert. This thing shot the chance of a good game in the leg. This thing rapid fires large green orbs I can only identify as sea urchins and makes rods come out of the terrain. May I also mention that it seems to have a lot more health than the actual boss. Just imagine it. It's taken you so long to defeat a boss. You finally take away its last heart, only for the game to say \"Nope, fuck you. You have to fight another one. Oh, you failed? Well do it all again.\" I never finished the game. Because I am not a masochist. I am a sadist, but definitely not a masochist. Even Dark Souls veterans wouldn't and shouldn't beat this game. It is a pile of crap that does nothing but make a mockery of what Spaceman Sparkles 3 could have been.\n\n\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506841", "timestamp_created": 1464724743, "recommendationid": "23315019", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198081284061", "last_played": 1487569135, "num_games_owned": 111}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 4}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1484818279, "review": "As a person who stumbled upon this, I really enjoyed the older version rather than the 3.5 updated version.
