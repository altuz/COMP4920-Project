That's why recommending this is hard, because though I quite enjoy it, I can completely see why someone else would think it's bad. The bottom line is, if you're the type that get's bored easily and can't enjoy slower paced games, this probably won't appeal to you, this isn't action packed and generally the satisfaction you'll get from it is from watching the flora/fauna interactions and watching a biome succeed. However, conversely if you like antfarms and played around with bugs like I did as a kid, this will be a real treat, it's fun adding more and more plants and animals and seeing how they affect the overall ecosystem and diagnosing the problems as they come. If that sounds boring to you, it may just be, and perhaps this game may not be for you. \nI really like this game, but being honest, it's a niche product and like I said, not for everyone. However, if you think this game is for you, I'll say this, it's good, really good in fact, and may be the only game that has ever quite scratched this itch. The graphics and animations are simple, but they're never illegible and serve their purpose nicely. Their is good variety and I quite like the progression systems. The community is also really cool, it's filled with a bunch of other nerds, who are really knowledgeable about this stuff, the devolopers are also incredibly involved with the community, if you ask them a question, you are almost guarenteed a reply from them. All in all, it's really fun and I enjoy it, but buyers beware, research the product before purchase, or you may just end up with a game that fundamentally doesn't appeal to you.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510791", "timestamp_created": 1502969788, "recommendationid": "34305371", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198124758693", "last_played": 1506710164, "num_games_owned": 261}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501188050, "review": "Very glitchy .

Things just either get eaten up too fast or things spead over the whole landscape. Maybe I need to read up stuff outside of the game, but I have no motivation to do that. It's not a game you simply play and be successful.
