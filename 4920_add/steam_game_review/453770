Last 15 lvls can be a little grindy, which I didn't mind as it gave me a reason to use the nice power-ups and think ahead. Also I was wrong in my original review...or playing with my volume down, I really enjoyed the soundtrack, the cards I still don't really like but the backgrounds are nice.\n\nOriginal review with some amendments in brackets\nCards are not random, am I going to win, yes I am, every level, [strike]always.[/strike] (except the last 15 levels) Last card on the board is a 2, I draw a 6, I'm actually surprised but I know without a doubt the next card is an Ace or a 3. Next card is a 3, yay go me. This is true of every round by the way. The only game like this I've played where I end a turn and there was a shot left that I missed but I don't bother using the undo button because I don't have to, I'm going to win anyway. (except the last 15 levels) I just shrug and carry on. All power ups are subsequently rendered useless. (till the last 15 levels XD)\nIt's a shame, because it really could have been interesting and fun and it should have been, but it's not, it's dull and it's repetitive and it's pointless. (till lvl 40 odd)\nIf there's a reason for the pointless level design, like another reviewer, who was also disappointed, suggested, it's not good enough, they should have got rid of the reason it needed to be designed that way so they could have made an actual game.\nWill I finish it because achievements, yes I will. Will I hate myself for it yes I will (but not as much as I thought I would). Do I recommend it [strike]no I don't.[/strike] (meh, if you absolutely love this type of game and really want a new one, go for it.)\nThere's loads of good ones in this genre including Avalon 2 with city building and resource collecting and a really nice soundtrack and art work. Solitairica with class decks, mobs and an end boss to fight each card drawn and played is useful to you, nice humour, great difficulty curve. Regency with a nice story and nice power-ups and great artwork to name a few (You can pick all 3 of those up in a bundle with this one btw). All of these have good card and impact and combo sounds and nice animations. Day of the dead has none of these and the card artwork is so in your face the only difficulty is trying to see by it so you can take in all the cards.\n[strike]I can't comment on it's soundtrack since I honestly can't remember what it sounds like, which may be comment enough I guess.[/strike]\nWhy is this tutorial to counting the same price as the games I mentioned above. (If they reduced the price to a couple of pounds below others of this type, I'd probably give it a thumbs up. It's not quite as awful as the first 40 levels would have you believe.)", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496358", "timestamp_created": 1483890629, "recommendationid": "29119342", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561198056978538", "last_played": 1505871036, "num_games_owned": 416}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1466086350, "review": "Although I'm not a huge Solitaire fan, I really do like this game.\n\nA big part of that for me though is the Day of the Dead theme - here it has been done so well - and has included a great deal of authentic imagery and mythology that it's a must get for anybody who appreciates the culture surrounding this holiday.\n\nBeyond the look - and - feel of the game the gameplay itself is mostly fun. As I said I'm not a huge Solitaire fan but this game has done a nice job of adding in enough variety to keep things interesting.

Forgotten?  Someone remembered.  Enough to tell the tale in this game anyway.\n\nWhat we have here is the higher/lower type of solitaire you'll find in several other games such as Regency Solitaire, Chef Solitaire, Faerie Solitaire, Legends of Solitaire, Goat Solitaire, and FarCry 4.  As always, I want to know one thing.  What does this particular solitaire game do to distinguish itself?  From the other solitaire game I mean.  Not like distinguish itself from the field of presidential candidates or anything.  Having written jokingly about that before, and seeing what we have wound up with as the choice for the next president, I'm not going anywhere near that subject.\n\nConsidering that what we are playing is the same as many times before, Forgotten Tales spices things up with a story about a guy trying to get his wife back from the land of the dead, which really resonates with me because it reminds me of making love to my ex.  What really makes Forgotten Tales stand out for me though are the variety of power-ups and special cards.\n\nThere are several special powers you can use, from revealing hidden cards, to crushing your enemies. Seeing them driven before you. Hearing the lamentations of their women. This is what is best in life.  There are also cards that act as bombs, or rockets destroying everything in their path.  Sometimes it's not so much solitaire as global thermonuclear war.  Shall we play a game?  No fighting though.  Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room! Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends.\n\nOk, that's a lot of movies so getting back to the game at hand, if you like solitaire games, and I know you do, Forgotten Tales will help fill that dark void in your soul that yearns to devour the world.  At least for a little while.
