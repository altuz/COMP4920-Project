Not much to the story, but more than most Match 3 games have, and suitable for *most* children.\n\n!00 levels, and 2 difficulties (Casual and Challenge). Casual has no limiton moves, Challenge gives you a set number of moves, with the ability to spend coins earned in-game to buy 10 extra moves. \n\nPower ups are interesting and fun to use, and if used well, can make a seemingly impossible level complete with ease. \n\nRan well on my toaster, only a few minor issues with slight hitches and audio \"feedback BUZZZZZZ\", during really active screens (tons of potions and power-ups all active at once, with squares popping and dropping icons at high speed). Only happned a few times, and it could have been caused by a background program like Windows Update activating while I was playing. AV updating a could also have been a cause, so not blaming the game for it. Unkown for sure what the cause was, and it was not gamebreaking.\n\nRecommended for Match 3 enthusiasts, though I would recommend waiting for a sale. It was a fun game, but not sure if I would have been so happy if I had paid full price.

An endearing Match 3 game that's very anxiety/ASMR friendly and suitable for any age.\n\nSmooth gameplay, well-composed music that's neither distracting nor aggravating, bright and coloring graphics with nice backgrounds and a clean UI, and sound and graphic effects that aren't jarring or flashy. \n\nNothing that really breaks the Match-3 mold, but the game has so much personality it doesn't need to. Each level has objectives, either tile-collection or \"bring the jars to the bottom\", with the usual roadblocks of webbed tiles, wood and stone tiles, etc. Powerups are actually useful, are earned through progression, and recharge through matching tiles and making combos. Coins picked up in each level can be spent to upgrade powerups and aren't difficult to obtain. Each level is scored on a 3-star system and can be replayed to pick up missed stars or coins.\n\n100 levels with two difficulties - Casual (with unlimited moves per level) and Challenge (with set moves per level). All Steam achievements but one can be completed on Casual (the last is to finish the game on challenge mode).\n\nAs a Match-3 enthusiast, I really enjoyed the thoughtfully-planned levels and the colorful and fun graphics. As an adult I thought the dialogue was a little shallow, but it's still cute and better than most stories I've seen in this sort of game. Munchkins may get frustrated at higher levels with the more challenging roadblocks. Still, I would have no objection to letting my 6 year old niece play - she would probably really like Victoria and all the dialogue about fairies and unicorns, or being scared of spiders.\n\nScoring can be a little oddball sometimes - 3 stars in-level may equal only 1 on star on map, or 2 in-level is 3 on map. Nothing game-breaking, though for someone as 3-star obsessive as myself it was a bit of an annoyance. \n\nPicked this little gem up at 50% off and would say that's a fair pricepoint for it - I don't think it has enough modes or replayability to justify the regular price. That said, I'm looking forward to the sequel. :)\n\n9/10", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498985", "timestamp_created": 1492548910, "recommendationid": "31225972", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198049507672", "last_played": 1492459598, "num_games_owned": 1254}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 7, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
