Unfortunately, the random crashes ruined this game (see the community hub -> discussions for more details). The developer claims the game is OK but the annoying crashes still happen for me and some other players, and make it unplayable for us. So if you feel lucky, then buy this game and give it a chance. Maybe you could finish it and get 100% completion without encountering any crash.\n\nI will edit this review and write a full positive review if the developer fixes this game. Because I like this game and I think retrogamers should try it. BUT with the current technical issues, it's not recommendable.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1504683611, "recommendationid": "34771148", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198372497852", "last_played": 1499087671, "num_games_owned": 42}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 12, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 7, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 5}}
