I have only tried it out for about 10-15 minutes but clearing the first few levels in all modes was fun! controls are solid (have to see if I can enable WASD, Haven't checked yet) and the levels seems to be straightforward at the beginning but still challenging when you just start. I'll update as I get further along but the one thing that I do appreciate is that in the settings you can toggle on/off the music you like or dislike in the playlist. Also, you can slide the music volume around if you prefer slight background noise or full 100% volume!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494675", "timestamp_created": 1463275372, "recommendationid": "22989372", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198162374990", "last_played": 1479264093, "num_games_owned": 75}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1463750440, "review": "I bought this on a whim, and I'm glad I did! It's a great little platformer, chock full of content and variety. It has 175 levels, each of which can be played in numerous play modes. Even with several hours of playtime, I'm far from exhausting the game's content. It's worth noting that there are essentially two sets of levels: Levels 1-100 are the \"Innoquous 5\" levels, while levels 101-175 are based on levels from the developer's prior game \"Innoquous 4.\" As levels 1-100 began to get quite difficult, I welcomed the ability to play additinonal easy and medium difficulty levels in the Innoquous 4 set.\n\nThe game also includes a level editor and steam workshop functionality. I'm really looking forward to playing around with the gravity rotation gameplay to build custom levels.\n\nMy one criticism: as the levels became more difficult, I began to feel that the controls are just a bit too sensitive--the speed of your ball is quite fast, so it can be difficult to nail subtle left/right movements (at least with a keyboard). The game is certainly fully playable and enjoyable as it is, but I'd love to see how the game would play with a slight adjustment to the control sensitivity.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975155", "timestamp_created": 1463749478, "recommendationid": "23097197", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198005160344", "last_played": 1496262278, "num_games_owned": 215}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
