However, this game turned out to have so much more to it than i initially thought, and without trying to praise it too much here, i really have say that for such a free little horror game it really did it's job at scaring the everliving crap out of me. It kept me feeling uncomfortable and on edge thoughout the entire experience, just wanting to get out and get to the end, yet only to keep finding that there was more to do.. \n\nSir Bedlam Productions really knew what he was doing when he made this game, and i think he did a great job on it.\n\n\nNow the game itself is fairly short, with about maybe 4 hours or so of playtime, more or less depending on how many times you  die, and how quickly your able to figure things out.\nthe story that is there is short and simple, but its easy to get into and does the job nonetheless, and It doesnt take long for the game to pick up before you imediately start to feel uncomfortable and filled with an unyeilding sense of Dread and panic.\n\nAs you progress through the game you'll discover more and more of the story and the places history, all the while things get increasingly more creepy, terrifying, and intense as you anxiously try to figure out what to do and where to go next..\n\nnow.. yes this is a free indie horror game, made by a single developer, and i know that there are probably plenty of them in existance already, don't get me wrong, if your a horror veteran or just somebody who likes really good horror, i'm not trying to set you up with super high expectations here, because this is another Free Indie Horror game, but...for everything that it is and everything that the dev put into it, i'd say that its probably one of the better ones that are out there, it gave me a few good scares, and it was able to keep the tension up throught the whole thing, never  letting me feel safe, i'd say that for the few hours of playtime that it is worth, it did a pretty decent job as a horror game, especially for a free one, which more than i can probably say for alot of others. So for everything that this game is i'll give it an 8.5/10 and maybe thats a bit genrous but  i think it's pretty good and I'd highly recommend it if your a horror enthusiast.\n\n\nP.S: I really liked that creepy poetry bit in that one scene, it was a real nice touch, just the way it was spoken and delivered, super unsettling. Sends chills down my spine every time i think of it, and also that Finale was Probably the most stress inducing thing i ever tried to play through in a game.\n\n\n\n\n\nTL:DR Stop being so damn Lazy and actually Read things. oh and yeah for a free game it's actually pretty scary/creepy.\n \n8/10 get me the hell out of here!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507712", "timestamp_created": 1486282575, "recommendationid": "29712889", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198125022241", "last_played": 1486269528, "num_games_owned": 111}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487731074, "review": "For a free game, it surpassed my expectations.\n\nDark, horror game where you must investigate a haunted abandoned funeral home.\nSearch throughout the house to find the clues you will need to solve the mysteries and secrets this old house is keeping inside it's eerie walls.\n\nThe video and audio matches the dark atmosphere, and creates an ambiance that keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n\nJust watch out for Myrtle, who wants your heart, and your soul.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out, and the free price of admission.\n\nDon't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq2MNcDO7TM&list=PLGCO4EfbVB6XXoAnQMUJjoEh3c2BLfHx8&index=41", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1487731074, "recommendationid": "30091422", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "steamid": "76561198281484746", "last_played": 1477193849, "num_games_owned": 52}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487446363, "review": "very good scare game, put the shits up me and my mrs!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1487446363, "recommendationid": "30016907", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198003517668", "last_played": 1487447431, "num_games_owned": 85}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487617158, "review": "THIS IS A  REALLY SCARY GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
