Graphically its not terrible, and the sounds are fairly sparse but what is there does a decent enough job. Also the rogue like elements are pretty appealing. \n\nHowever I still find it hard to give this game a positive review thanks to the balance issues and poor combat that plague the experience as a whole. Combat is very clunky and selecting team members in the heat of battle  can be incredibly frustrating. \n\nYou can also build traps, barriers and weapons to help but again the balance issues hurt the game. The cost of most items you can build means you will never have enough resources to actually build many of them. Also some of them are so useless when you do build them you have just wasted valuable resources. \n\nI found the overall experience just too frustrating to say I was having fun. For a bit more polish and balance this could have been a damn fine game.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512141", "timestamp_created": 1491859370, "recommendationid": "31067801", "language": "english", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 108, "steamid": "76561197989290281", "last_played": 1491088444, "num_games_owned": 1203}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492922698, "review": "(First Impression) \nThis game got a very potential to be a great android game, i guess its more suited as android game rather than PC game.\nIts a time click-and-recheck later game.\n\nBut if its im plemented on PC game, that needs to run onscreen all the time to make a progress, while all we gotta saw is a static screen, with only  some progress bar's for item collecting status and  3 main interaction button with dead animation behind it, it rather frustating and stupid.\n\nIt'll make more sense if we just do some stuff a bit check it one time , then after we cant make a move ( because our character is badly injured, and theres no medicine left )   , we just let them stay safe and assign em to search stuff without us having to keeping the screen and the game running and wait for some hours for them complete the searching.\n\nTHATS why this game more suitable on android platform, so we can close it  and still  get notification if our player is hungry or if the items are collected without us having open the game all the time.\n\n\nThe game concept is quite enjoyable really, the game zombies or humans encounter battle is good , but need more tweaks and rework, and in the next updates add some animation if the character taking behind some cover is a very good  addition .\n\n\nAt the current state, this game is still a mess. Devs might wanna consider adding some PC gameplay into the game to make the game relatable for a PC.  Because all i see is Android game material .\n\n\nRATE: 2.5 / 5 stars", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500414", "timestamp_created": 1492922698, "recommendationid": "31311990", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198123663114", "last_played": 1492966880, "num_games_owned": 8}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 41, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 23, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 18}}
