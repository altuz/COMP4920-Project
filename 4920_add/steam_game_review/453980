How many people would play Counter Strike if the weapons were designed like that?\n\nEach time after you do a fly-over of the buildings, you drop down a notch, so that if you don't destroy all of the buildings you will crash into them when you have dropped down to their level.\nHowever, because you can't drop bombs as fast as you want, that means that if you miss a target (because the game doesn't allow proper aiming) you end up crashing into a building.\n\nQuite frankly, not being able to aim your bombs, in a bombing game, is ridiculous.\nThat major design flaw was enough to put me off.\n\nIn case you can't tell already, my recommendation is that you don't buy this game.\nDon't waste your time on this piece of rubbish.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491904", "timestamp_created": 1487803762, "recommendationid": "30108601", "language": "english", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 130, "steamid": "76561197996890045", "last_played": 1487803041, "num_games_owned": 2079}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1465093761, "review": "Good fun great remake of a classic game.buy it", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1465093761, "recommendationid": "23391848", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "steamid": "76561198032208542", "last_played": 1465315761, "num_games_owned": 60}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
