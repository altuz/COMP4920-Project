Pretty much these two guys wanna kill each other and the world sucks for some reason.\"\n\nThis game is unlike any other game I have played, and is easily one of my most memorable experiences in gaming.\n\nThe gameplay is butt-bustingly hard yet fair, the graphics are well-crafted, the music is superb and there's plenty of content in the game to keep you playing for a while. It's a shame how obscure it is, and that's why I've been telling friends about it. Ryan Melmoth has made a truly wonderful (and very weird) game here, and it deserves far more recognition. \n\nThere are a couple of flaws, such as not having a pause button/menu, no volume controls and no controller support, but they're very easy to overlook.\n\nI easily give this game a 9/10, and hope to see more great games from the developer!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516908", "timestamp_created": 1497935760, "recommendationid": "32583967", "language": "english", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_forever": 4388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198062781434", "last_played": 1506289385, "num_games_owned": 79}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497484367, "review": "Fun little game that reminds me of space funeral, has a great sense of humor", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1497484367, "recommendationid": "32420439", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198110449520", "last_played": 1503278251, "num_games_owned": 172}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 22, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 21, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
