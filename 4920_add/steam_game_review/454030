Each turn, you choose an action for each crew member, you can: create a room in the base or craft something (weapon, armor), or help a character with low stats  to stay alive, giving him (her) food, heat or health in the appropriate room, or pick a mission and send one or more characters outside to find resources (there are also other types of missions). During a mission, the characters explore a map and fight enemies in turn-based combat. It's cold, so they can't stay outside for too long.  \n\nYou have to manage the characters and the scarce resources, with the lurking menace of a base invasion that will happen in a determined number of turns. There are various strategies to try and things to learn, with rooms that can be upgraded and the characters who gain useful skills with experience. I like the retro pixel graphics. The interface reminds in some aspects a board game:  in the base, to do an action, you slide a character token on a room and then make a choice in a menu. I appreciate this style and all works well so far. The tutorial teaches well the basics. In normal mode, you pick three goals (with various difficulty levels) and you succeed when you reach them. A successful run gives points to unlock more characters. So far, I played a few runs and I reached the easier goals. I will play more.  \n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550771", "timestamp_created": 1459458096, "recommendationid": "22167489", "language": "english", "votes_up": 36, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 1223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198099639387", "last_played": 1460685395, "num_games_owned": 1178}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 7}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1462536327, "review": "TL;DR It's a cheaper small 'This War of Mine' with potentially deeper combat which in reality is not very interesting.\n\nI'll start with a deal breaker - it's unplayable due to screen resolution.

Victory rules might include:\n\n-Killing a ringleader\n-Surving 15 rounds\n-Caching 20 units of fuel\netc.\n\nThis adds a lot of variability to the game once you understand the core mechanics as your strategy to achieving all of the three victory rules (and ensure rescue) will determine your strategy. \n\nEvery game is a race against the clock. With each passing round your survivors will lose energy and heat and the increase threat of a base attack means that will have to be proactive with your strategy from the get-go. Do you hunker down, reasearch weapon tech and arm your survivors for a full on base attack? Or do you brave the surface of the alien planet to hunt down the native inhabitants in order to put off the inevitabilty of an invasion for a few more rounds? \n\nThis is an early access game and as such still has many bugs and glitches that crop up from time to time. For the most part it has not been too devastating or game breaking. Further, this game is very very difficult for the first five or ten rounds until you start to become more efficient with your round managament. In about 15 games I may win 4 or 5, depending on victory rules of course.\n\nFurther, won games grant you requistion points used to buy heros that have their own special abilities that bring a further layer of variability to your initial strategy. Heros may be robotics experts, commandos, leaders, rangers or mechanics- all with a unqiue skill set to offer. \n\nThere are many other features included like rescue missions, resource scavenging, reasearch and technology etc- more than I am willing to list for the sake of this mere thumbs up.\n\nAll in all I reccomend Link.

The neat thing is though, at the start of each playthrough you get to set your own objectives from a list.  The game ends when you meet the objectives, so you can design your own level of difficulty.\n\nIn the base-building section you construct buildings.  You have to worry about production, adjacency bonuses, and the balance between teching up and using what you have to produce items useful in the short term.  Fun and interesting system with a couple little quirks, what gives it replayability is that you pick a crew of 3 people from a list of 20ish, and each has a special bonus.  a number of the bonuses give a different room type which changes up optimal layouts, and presents interesting new design choices.\n\nIn the exploration/combat portion of the game you move around and fight hostile aliens.  The system uses action points.  Moving a square, attacking, and using a skill all simply cost 1 AP (although one or two skills cost 2 AP).  The interesting wrinkle here is that you regenerate AP equal to your leftover AP from last turn (minimum 1)  For example a starting character has a standard 5 AP.  He can use two, and then refill to full.  if he has to do something important he can use 3 (down to 2), and then refill back to 4.  from there it is easy for him to just take one the next turn, or keep using 2 a turn at 4 instead of 5, so that first extra was just kinda borrowing.  if something really bad happens and you need to use all 5, then you end up spending 3 turns recovering before you can do anything.

Or perhaps survivor spawned with a sniper rifle, in which case it may be the only character to survive, whereas your rescue crew will be ganbanged by 3 spiders.\n\nSeriously, there is no difficulty progression. Base attacks, the very first one, will pitch your tiny group of soldiers against a horde of 8-12 aliens, many of which will be top tier units capable of killing your soldier with ONE hit. \n\nHonestly? What was supposed to be a challenging fun, was revealed to be frustrating RNG hell. \n\nWhat else? Generic loot, limited skill choice and upgrades (for example you can only research one of four techs per branch, characters are limited to like 5 skills).\nConstantly growing threat level, even if all you do is just farming for food. \nConstantly dropping heat and stamina levels, heat drops even when a soldier sleeps (wtf?).\n\nThis crap is really not worth playing.
