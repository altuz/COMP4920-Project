A Hitman type game where you have to figure out stuff about your target so you can kill them quietly interested me and I was sure I would like, even though the game has a lot of negative reviews.\n\nStory wise this game is light on it. You play as a man who has no money and is in debt and he is sick of being poor and takes up a hitman job to get the money he needs. \n\nThe game has 6 stages including the tutorial and you can finish everything in around 30 minutes and maybe even quicker. This game is so short it's a joke. Every level takes around 5 to 8 minutes to finish everything, but since the game is so broken it's gonna take way longer than that.\n\nI'll divide this next review part into two problems, game breaking bugs and the game itself, so let's start with the game.\n\nThe game in itself is not bad. The idea behind it is interesting and some of the puzzles are great. I had fun in the first stage casing out the targets apartment and figuring out how to kill him. But after a while things got more infuriating, as the game doesn't teach you the core mechanics very well. Like in the tutorial you learn the ability to Answer your phone, but the game doesn't say anything about using to call numbers you find around the levels. \n\nEach level has a few things you need to do. First you need to find the weakness of the target, find a weapon, exploit the weakness and finish the target off. Each level is the same and the formula never changes.\n\nThe next problem is the bugs and holy hell this game has so many bugs it's unbelievable. First of all it crashes all the time. You crash after every level load, sometimes even mid level. The NPC's are incredibly hard to avoid. They block your path constantly and sometimes even get you caught. \n\nThere's also a bug in the second target mission where you have to pick up money from the counter and I still have no idea how to actually do it, cause no matter what I do, I get caught trying to pick it up. \n\nOverall Jackal is a terrible game and it's not worth your money or your time. It's a wasted potential and for the price all you get is a broken and a short game. Just skip this trash.\n\nPros:\nN/A\n\nCons:\n- Broken Beyond Belief \n- Tutorial doesn't teach the game mechanics well\n- AI is horrible\n\nFinal Rating:\n1/10", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527611", "timestamp_created": 1471217927, "recommendationid": "24923067", "language": "english", "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 360, "steamid": "76561198043609914", "last_played": 1470768727, "num_games_owned": 1813}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1461371926, "review": "Game crashes randomly - sometimes when you first start, sometimes when you play part of a level.
