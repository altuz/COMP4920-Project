Once you reach a certain size all the mechanics randomly switch on and off.  Upgraded units degrade themselves, the budget projector has no bearing on how much money you make.  I literally deactivated some factories to get my budget to +650 then let it sit for one cycle to build up some cash and I got -29000 the next day.  I made no changes so It should have been the same two days in a row, I had plenty of supplies to deliver.  The worst part was the projector said I should be getting +1200 the whole time.  This unpredictability breaks all of the games fun as your success depends on RNJ bugs turning out in your favor.\n\nThere also doesn't seem to be any purpose to using the blueprint function.
