A combat-centric game that works to your own music. The bundled metalstep really works well, and I've found electro does the same. The game overall is a bundle of nice ideas, but the game lacks polish. I understand the minimalist style it aims for, but...graphical details? Backgrounds? In-game sound effects? Particles? Hello?\n\nAgain, the gameplay is unique. Each method of fighting back serves a purpose, but most enemies either shoot projectiles at you or run straight at you. Things only stop being a cakewalk around 70, at 100 I'm either dying in 2 hits or running into a pitfall. The fact that you can even accidentally veer off into a pitfall and have to end the stage is irritating, and the comments putting your low score to shame don't help either.\n\nEarning points don't feel like they have any meaning; you're always more concerned about making it through a song entirely. If there was more to unlock with points other than actually interesting gameplay past the first 30 minutes, then I'd be pleased to use what downtime I have for colouring the board for extra points. This would've been a great place to include cosmetics or weapon upgrades, but it just lacks content. Most devs have the process backwards where they have a terrible idea ripped from a successful game and then expand on it too much, but Burst has the opposite problem.\n\nOne last thing is the requirement for .ogg files. I don't mind using them if it didn't mean having to pre-determine what songs you want to play before playing the game. This is definetly what sets Burst back over other games where you can blow through your music library in one sitting if you like.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500180", "timestamp_created": 1463847509, "recommendationid": "23119647", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "steamid": "76561198025627521", "last_played": 1490829208, "num_games_owned": 117}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1458055965, "review": "doesnt even work, just crashes my steam, dont know if they are going to fix but really it was a waste of money. - 1/10", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478923", "timestamp_created": 1458055965, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1458062830, "recommendationid": "21853700", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "steamid": "76561198095242831", "last_played": 1458056320, "num_games_owned": 131}, "developer_response": "Hi, sorry to hear about your troubles, can you please tell me when exactly the game crashes?", "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 10}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1458249381, "review": "It's pretty gud\n\nEdit: I'm glad to see that so many people find my review to be helpful!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430990", "timestamp_created": 1458008220, "recommendationid": "21845417", "language": "english", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198042627887", "last_played": 1458008157, "num_games_owned": 107}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 37}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 8, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 5}}
