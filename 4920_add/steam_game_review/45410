If you're into arcade-style racing games this is pretty fun, but be warned that there are some major flaws in the game design.\n\n1. The unlocking system is hopelessly illogical. You'll unlock events that you'll need a race car to have a reasonable chance at winning before you ever have an opportunity to unlock a race car.\n\n2. The game does not react to nor restrict your car selection. As such, most of the events cease to be challenging at all once you've unlocked a better car.\n\n3. Rubber-band AI that reacts to your score. This may sound neat in principle, but in practice it means that racking up several thousand points to earn a larger time bonus will result in the computer-controlled cars getting impossible speed increases and streaking off into the distance. This becomes even more ridiculous if you're driving a fast car with a setting that gives you a lot of extra points: You can be boosting constantly and still never catch up to people on the track, even though you'll \"pass\" them by several seconds after accounting for your time bonus.\n\n4. Broken bonus mechanics for certain cars. If your car gives you a 50% point bonus for doing something, you'll have those points added to the score as you do the trick, then ANOTHER 50% of that already inflated value after the trick is completed. With some end-game vehicles that offer 150% bonuses for drafting, it's possible to rack up 8000 points before the first corner, which will result in the AI overreacting to your score in the way I described above.\n\n5. There is *ZERO* online community for this game. As such, unless you can convince several friends to get the game and set up a server, you're not going to get those achievements or be able ot mess around online.\n\n6. Controller issues. The XBOX controller is treated in a generic fashion, resulting in semi-unhelpful tooltips telling you to press \"JOYBUTTON0\" to boost or \"JOYBUTTON4\" to match another car's speed. It also seems you have to explicitly go into the menu and tell the game that you intend on using a controller before it will respond to that input at all. Bizarrely, pause is permanently bound to the controllect's \"Back\" button.\n\n7. Engrish. A minor nit-pick, but still worth mentioning. It doesn't look like they had anyone proofread the tutorial"}, {"votes_down": 17, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1391524478, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525995", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "8973272", "votes_up": 33, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046676880", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1357200000, "num_games_owned": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 11}, "timestamp_updated": 1391524478, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Bought it because developers promised Linux/Mac OS X version.
