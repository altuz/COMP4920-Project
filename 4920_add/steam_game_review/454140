With the most recent update to this game (just a couple days ago), I find it to be a really enjoyable and convincing re-creation of tennis in VR. Prior to this most recent update, serving in simulation mode was quite difficult, and the swing power vs. ball energy felt a bit off, but after the latest patch serving now feels really good, and the overall physics are greatly improved. I find myself making the same specific errors in this game as I do in real life. There still aren't that many VR sports sims available, and of the ones I've tried, this definitely ranks near the top of the list for enjoyment and giving the feeling of actually playing its real-world equivalent.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1505464372, "recommendationid": "34966956", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198003850875", "last_played": 1505288106, "num_games_owned": 43}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 41, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 39, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
