Not the 5$ full price, 50 cents. There are multiple bugs along with little to no multiplayer servers. There is also a lack of features that bring life to most games. These features are things like sound, animation, or effects when you hit a target( there is none of these things whether you hit something or something hits you). A few of the guns get stuck in the reload animation. The shop from the NPC is also lacking in features not giving any indication if you have successfully purchased an item and what not. Overall a poor game that needs quality of life features to improve it.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "timestamp_created": 1506501133, "recommendationid": "35237909", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198099611405", "last_played": 1506381382, "num_games_owned": 80}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505598726, "review": "I mean, better than CS:GO ...\n\nRating: 6.9/10", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497537", "timestamp_created": 1505598726, "recommendationid": "35008113", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198277657639", "last_played": 1505599561, "num_games_owned": 39}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 69, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 32, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 37}}
