Very simple, straightforward game, kinda feels like a mix between a point and click with some mild rpg elements like combat, money, inventory and such. And don't worry, you can totally grind for money in this game. Instead of xp, you buy upgrades to your weapons and armor. You will never come to a point in the game that makes it impossible to beat it.\n\nIt's nice and easy and I found it very relaxing. There were a couple jump scares here and there.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1500790316, "recommendationid": "33737217", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "steamid": "76561197998141809", "last_played": 1473120081, "num_games_owned": 1051}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 38, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 36, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
