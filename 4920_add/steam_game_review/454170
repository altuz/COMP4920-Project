I'm not really fond of how the melodies sound. The editing is a bit awkward, too.\n- Not enough choices. The story is trying to give you multiple choices for each situation to make it more interactive but it's limited only to random conversations that don't have any affect on the plot.\n\nVERDICT: The novel's okay so far. Not as good as I thought it was in my head, though-- but hey, I'm still on the second chapter when I made this review. My opinion might change. Just make sure you have the volume off so you don't have to listen to the music.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526716", "timestamp_created": 1460674093, "recommendationid": "22418078", "language": "english", "votes_up": 30, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "steamid": "76561198021122126", "last_played": 1460780726, "num_games_owned": 85}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 23}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1482968596, "review": "Ok, I'll start by saying that if you expect a 6+ hour game, yeah no. It's quite short. 2-4 hours long. But even if it is short. It still keeps you wondering \"what will happen at the end of this?\".\n\nThe art isn't the best. As you might have seen on the screenshots. The music is correct for the situation, but can get a bit... Boring after a while. (You'd be better off just listening to Nyan Cat the whole time)\n\nBut I personally enjoyed it. And I suppose that's what counts. If your looking for a simple, not-so-long visual novel, you might like this.\n\nI will give this a 6.5/10. Not the best.
