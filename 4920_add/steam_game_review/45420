The gameplay is dull at best and more feels like a flash game than something on steam. The only input to the game is the left click mouse button so you don't really feel engaged. To sum up I wouldn't buy this game because there are similar games on mobile / flash.\n\nTLDR : Mobile port with no special gameplay."}]}
