But right now (as of the time of this writing) as it is, I feel like it's a not a product ready to be rolled out to the public.\nI think it has a great visual style, it brings me right back to old 90s DOS top-down shooters, this is what appealed to me the most. This is the games most redeeming feature at the moment. The game does need a ton of small tweaks and fixes.\n\nThere is very bad feedback, visually or aurally, when it comes to the UI. When you click on something in the menu, it doesn't highlight or make any significant sound when you click, it feels very cheap and whipped together this way. If you click on the wrong item, like \"New Game\" instead of \"Continue,\" you can't go back at all. You're doomed to start over (which I did). You can't adjust the volume, controls, or anything else once you're in the game. You have to exit to the main menu first. In the stats at the end of each level, the words \"Bullets\" in \"Bullets Fired\" is spelled wrong (\"Bullits\"). Overall, the UI needs some serious quality of life adjustments.\nThe flow of the game is not very intuitive. I was playing the first level, then at the end you can choose to go 1 of 2 ways. I chose way #1, ended up fighting a boss, beat him, then went back to the beginning of level 1 (??). So then I chose way #2, fought a boss, beat him, and went back to the beginning of level 1 (??). At the end of each level, you lose all of your weapons for some reason and go back to just having a pistol which, like all ot her weapons, is very unfun to use. There is no dialogue, no subtitles, no story to speak of, so I don't why I'm doing anything.\nIn the game itself, the graphics are 90's sylistically, and so is the music. But sound effects are straight from the 70's, as if they were from the Atari 2600. In my opinion, all of the sound effects need to be scrapped. It makes combat extremely unsatisfying. The shotgun, for example, doesn't feel chunky and heavy and it isn't satisfying to fire because it just let's out such a pathetic little sound. This goes for all weaponry, including the enemies'. There is no sound for reloading and very little feedback when you take damage. Your character moves very slowly, but  the movement animation is very fast, it's a little awkward and stange. Some of the bosses and mini-bosses shoot projectiles that just move too quickly, it makes trying to time the rhythm and finding a pattern very clunky and awkward. When you die, there is nothing. One frame you are alive, then when you take the last hit, the very next frame you're at the last checkpoint. And for some reason, often times when you die, you will continue AHEAD of where you died. Again, it feels very cheap and patched together. Enemies don't have a death animation, the just turn into a blood splatter on the ground, again, within the span of 1 frame. It just makes everything feel low quality. Finally, after about 20 minutes of gameplay, I had more than enough money to completely max out all of the upgrades for all 3 characters.\n\nAs you can see, the game just needs a lot of small things. I think the devs need to put more time into details (death animations, weapon feedback, sound effects, menu feedback etc), not take shortcuts and put some more focus into quality of life for the user, because right now it's very frustrating to play. Keep up the good work devs, ignore the naysayers, work hard, don't be afraid to fail, trust your vision, I'll be happy to turn this into a positive review when the game gets polished.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511884", "timestamp_created": 1465000658, "recommendationid": "23370914", "language": "english", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561197979929402", "last_played": 1465000713, "num_games_owned": 1159}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1468844814, "review": "I'm copying most part of this review from my [b]Flesh Eaters[/b] review. If devs aren't bothering with making a unique game, why would I bother writing a unique review?\n\nAh, another encounter with the Back to Basics publisher. A publisher that's not really known to players, cause he keeps his doings shady, but some of the more observant people may know him, them, it, whatever you call it. This establishment keeps pumping out cheap games, each made in a few weeks, with the very same textures, no significant gameplay, no storyline, no unique sounds even. How they keep these similar games and not breaking any Steam rules is beyond me, but okay, let's move on to the game.\n\nWhat do we have here? Another unfinished game, with the very same art as their other titles:\n\n[list][*][b]Kivi, Toilet and Shotgun.[/b]Check the characters, textures, sounds, particles, weapons and the overall feel of the game.\n[*][b]Flesh Eaters[/b] Yet again, check characters, textures, weapons, particles, camera, sounds and overall feel.\n[/list]\n\nThis game has bugged mechanics, top-down perspective and a feel of a product that has been made during a day off by a lazy programmer, using some stolen art from some other project (I won't be surprised, if that's the exact case here).\n\nThere is a single player campaign, yet it's so insignificant (and unfinished), that there's nothing to actually play with.

He is also the game designer and project lead at 16bit Nights. How you can say that these are the same games is beyond me, they are absolutely not. \n\nThe reason we can continue to publish games, is because we're not breaking any of Steams terms. They are NOT the same games or the same textures. Similarities can and will often apply when the same art style is used across multiple titles. Maybe the developer wants to put their mark on these games, maybe they want to establish a recognised art style?\n\n\n\nAs for the comment \"Back To Basics Gaming, not known because they're shady\"\nWe're quite well known as an indie publisher actually. Maybe not in the main stream AAA game communities here on Steam. But certainly in the indie scene.
