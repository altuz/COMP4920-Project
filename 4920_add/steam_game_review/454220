This game is only half-finished and was sold without any notice on that point. And it's not in early access either ! I don't get this policy. I feel mislead since I've just experienced a great deception : at some point (half-way) the game tells you \"yeah you're on the right path but be patient, we'll come back.. blabla\".. and from what I've just read it's been like that for ages (well, several months at least). A plague for achievements hunters.. \nThe background storyline feels unrealistic and is fuelled by conspiracy theories to a certain extent. I don't know if it's  some propaganda or if the writers are just making fun of these craps :?\nBesides, each riddle of the game is a real challenge and is quite fun to solve. You really have to look everywhere. It sometimes feels a bit repetitive and sometimes too tedious (exact spelling is really important whereas the game's grammar isn't always correct). It lacks some tools to be really enjoyable (like an intern search engine for example and a more reactive and interactive intern mailing software).\nAbove all it lacks its second half !! \nI'd say the whole underlying idea is very good but the production could be better. For the time being I can't say I recommand this, unless on sales. The innovative gaming concept was very promising, and still is, but some progress must be done.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1504112153, "recommendationid": "34612872", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "steamid": "76561198015324296", "last_played": 1504112178, "num_games_owned": 465}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 46, "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 36, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 10}}
