But, there is some lack, and i know it's alpha.\nSo here are the bad points, Duty for the dev to correct them :\n- UI is all but easy to use. It's far better to use mousewheel to scroll between tools and weapons rather than open menu by clicking on it, select one weapon and go back to fight. During this time we are hit by mobs.\n- Dialogs : please pause game during dialog or allow us to use escape key to avoid and close it when mobs attack us (again...) rather than open main menu.\n- Music : ok we can stop it, but it's so... the same 3 tone again and again and again.\n- graphisms : try to have coherence in your world rather than mix of styles. simplified giant insects, cartoon animals, unidentified ugly dark bubble mob. And all of this explode in numerous big pieces that there are more than the original creature.\n- Windows : toooooo big. inventory or dialogs, these windows are too big and too many node\n\nHowever, i recommand This game because of its potential and because it is already well advanced :)", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496883", "timestamp_created": 1464466292, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1464481830, "recommendationid": "23259588", "language": "english", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "steamid": "76561198028190311", "last_played": 1466167215, "num_games_owned": 239}, "developer_response": "I appreciate the detailed feedback on what to improve!
