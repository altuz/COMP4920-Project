Very programming-like.\n\nContent: The modules cover all of the bases: moving in a line, rotating, turning on and off, changing directions... I wouldn't be surprised if this was a complete enough language to simulate a computer given enough modules and a big enough playing field.\n\nInterface Design: It's a little cumbersome to drag things into place, then click on them to configure them, then click on buttons to rotate or change the polarity. I also found a bug where if you press Esc during a simulation and come back to the level, the level stays as it was during the simulation instead of resetting to how you placed them. I also found there wasn't enough difference between the three simulation speeds.\n\nSounds: Pretty simple atmospheric music and subtle, not too tiring SFX.\n\nVisuals: Nice clean minimalistic look, the module symbols are pretty good at visually representing what they do.\n\nStyle: What I love about this game is that it teaches you to use modules in a \"dirty hack\" kind of way, creating delays in order to make everything work together in synchronicity. There are also times when you have to use synergy between two modules placed a certain way. Made me have quite a few \"Ah-ha!\" moments and I felt pretty clever!\n\nAnnoyances: All the things I mentionned in Interface Design, probably a syndrome of being a mobile port. Nothing deal-breaking though.\n\nValue: Very fairly priced game, though there's a limit to the premade puzzles it's a very well put together programmy puzzler!\n\nReplayability: A little bit with the Sandbox mode but it's a fairly short game (I'm halfway through as of writing this)... unless you get stuck I suppose, which could still happen to me!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430961", "timestamp_created": 1496411575, "recommendationid": "32129566", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198018477304", "last_played": 1497088779, "num_games_owned": 286}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498775442, "review": "Great puzzles, fair interface.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504563", "timestamp_created": 1498775442, "recommendationid": "33013014", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "steamid": "76561198054106167", "last_played": 1499008902, "num_games_owned": 238}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 55, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 51, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
