After freeing himself and exploring a strange world he can only make assumptions of how he got got there.  In conversation with the residents such as a priest or the wife of a gold washer he learns about a mysterious figure, the \"fog wanderer\", which seems to be threatening the inhabitants and maybe even striving to extinguish the whole world. The permanent presence of an abstract threat as well as the setting in general has elements of lovecraftian horror and E.A. Poe stories. \nThe combination of pixel art style and surreal story create an absolutely genuine atmosphere which makes the game's greatest feature.\n\nThe game features a variety of  puzzles  from easy to challenging, logic-based to intuitive and often innovative. In addition there are short little action sequences as well as a minimalist combat system. Sometimes there is more than one solution to a specific issue!\n\nThe game has multiple endings, and when I needed to consult the hints in the community hub for the safe puzzle in chapter 5, I caught a glimpse of a dialogue that there might be another possible character constellation in the end - which explains why in my longplay/walkthrough you can only see  5 of possibly 10 alternate endings.   \n\nThe only point of criticism for me was the challenge of  controlling the character in a pixelated  2.5D environment. I was grateful for the hint system which highlights paths to follow and objects to click by using the right mouse button.\n\nA Room Beyond is a wonderful one-man project by the German developer Ren\u00e9 B\u00fchling. For me composition, atmosphere,  design and maybe even the title seem to be influenced by the Last Door. If you liked The Last Door you should definitetly give this one a try! With A Room Beyond you get a lot of content, puzzles and pixels for a real good price!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXt9LMYXcBo", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "timestamp_created": 1503008780, "recommendationid": "34316389", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198014341803", "last_played": 1503008365, "num_games_owned": 203}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
