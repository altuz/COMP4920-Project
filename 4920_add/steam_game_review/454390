(i preferred the steam controller, personally the right touch pad work fantastic for direction changes, dives, etc)\n\nit's very arcadey and pays no mind to things like collective, cyclic, etc. so don't go into this expecting rc or sim like controls of your helicopter. the controls are nice and responsive, however, which is good given the nature if the game, which has you flying through increasingly cramped and obstacle filled courses, trying to hit all the checkpoints and goals as fast as possible.\n\nsimple, straight forward and fun.\n\ngraphics are simple but very workable, and have a very tronesque vibe.  i dig it.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510296", "timestamp_created": 1470942990, "recommendationid": "24830957", "language": "english", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "steamid": "76561198024440722", "last_played": 1470992034, "num_games_owned": 2142}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1471390115, "review": "This is a nice, responsive, fun physics based copter-game.
