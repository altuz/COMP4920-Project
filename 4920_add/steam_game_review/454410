The vast majority of the game is straightforward enough in regards to figuring out the solutions, and there was only ever one time I became stuck.\n\nWhile there's nothing overly complex about this game, it plays well, the platforming is quite solid (although perhaps a bit too reliant on the instant death spikes towards the end) and the bosses while were fun and distinct.\n\nThe story and characters are a bit on the flat side unfortunately, and there are a lot of odd localization choices for the translation, which leaves some bits reading awkwardly (but understandably). It's fun for what it is, and honestly the aesthetics of everything carry it through where the story and characters fail. Game is gorgeous, can't argue that.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1506936278, "recommendationid": "35409805", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 699, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198004660544", "last_played": 1506933274, "num_games_owned": 465}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506218742, "review": "An oddly enticing puzzle game, it has very good game feel and suprisingly unique puzzles. The only downside is that you can screw yourself out of puzzles, which is why there's a rewind mechanic. And even that's a streach since by designing them were they can have fail states gives it the ability to have unique puzzles and combat senarios.
