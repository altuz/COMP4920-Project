The images are great and the entire theme is just lovely with loads of puzzles to assemble (again unlike Pixel Puzzles or Animated Puzzles). It even has a great price! However, this game has major drawbacks, one of which is you cannot track which puzzles you have completed as well as too small of a puzzle \"field\". Doing the hardest difficulty puzzles is way too difficult because of how small the pieces are. The achievements are underdeveloped and difficult to reach. I also experience some bugs such as every other puzzle I open in the easiest mode is welcomes me with the completed congratulations screen. I can only recommend this game for people who are looking to play in the easy mode (1/3 of the game) and not reach all the achievements.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525058", "timestamp_created": 1494180092, "recommendationid": "31609829", "language": "english", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "steamid": "76561198032900102", "last_played": 1494232850, "num_games_owned": 212}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 12, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 8, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 4}}
