It being one of the cheapest games on steam with trading cards I bought it thinking I would just get the cards and uninstall it into the deep unkown realms of my game library.  \n\nHowever out of boredem (and a lack of internet connection or power) I gave it a shot and I must say this truly a fun game. At first I was like DA FUQ ARE THESE CONTROLS, AINT NO ONE GOT TIME FO DAT. But then I switched the controls to keyboard and it was much better and I reccomend anyone who plays this to use the keyboard instead of mouse.  \n\nAs soon as I got the hang of it I was hooked. Yes the graphics are 2D and not anything worth mentioning but it played very smooth and the controls were very responsive. \n\nThe goal of the game is like a reverse tower defense; you hae to destroy turrents and capture land by creating squares of land until you reach the turrets. Along the way (higher levels) things such as dragons and bats are introduced which invoke a feeling of \"Fuck I thought I was good at a game for once\" or \"Damn nigga I JUST ATE\". But let me tell you that as annoying as these fuckers are (particulary bats), they add alot more dynamic gameplay to the game. \n\n1st hour of playing I liked it. \n2nd hour of playing I loved it \n3rd hour my dick was out and hard \n4th hour Cops called, I left my shades up while masturbating vigoriously.  \n5th hour I got raped by some black dude named Truck\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1408134988, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553012", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "11719783", "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197973389214", "num_reviews": 59, "last_played": 1410677351, "num_games_owned": 796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 304}, "timestamp_updated": 1408135062, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The painting of this game as \"reverse tower defense\" demonstrates an utter lack of understanding firstly of what tower defense means, and secondly, of the long and storied history of Qix and it's many many clones. \n\nMake no mistake, this game has nothing to do with the tower defense genre, and everything to do with being a shameless re-imagining of the classic 8-bit game Qix. That sounds like it would be a bad thing, but the truth is that Qix was a rad game when it released in 1981, and Fortix 2 truly feels like what would happen if the developers of Qix had time-traveled 30 years into the future at the start of development. \n\nQix featured a simple mechanic, slickly implemented, with a presentation that was unremarkable but serviceable for its day. The exact same thing is true for Fortix 2. This is not a complicated game, but it is a great implementation of a simple mechanic. The difficulty curve is pitch-perfect, making finishing a level without losing any lives achievable but challenging. \n\nFortix 2 isn't going to blow anyone away, but it does an excellent job of filling that spot in your Steam library for a game that doesn't ask for much in the way of investment, and can be consumed in 5-minute increments while still feeling rewarding, and for $2 or less, you can't really ask for more."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1385613104, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523507", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "7799557", "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198026478273", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1406844560, "num_games_owned": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 525}, "timestamp_updated": 1385613104, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is sooo enjoyable! its also srsly a good choice if you dont want to use your mouse!
