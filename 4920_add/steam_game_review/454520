Especially a game where you need to be in absoutely full control of your perfect double jumps and reactions. I play with a Razer Wildcat and never had any problem with other platformers (except the bad designed ones).\nNot with this game: Double Jumps are 100% random - and when your first jump turns out to be accidentally \"double\" and you jump into dangerous vines this is simply not fun. \nThese frustrating experiences have a really bad taste. If I manage to finish a level it's not like I think I played good - but just had some luck in a series when the controls did not suck that much. \nIt's more like a relief to hope when this game finally ends since I paid for it and did not want to quit quite early.\nThen another thing: this is obviously not a Rogue-like game, because it has several checkpoints. Why the hell you need to start from the beginning of the entire level when you exit and restart the game? I mean if I need to leave and want to come back at a later time\nI don't intend to play the entire level, but eventually just the boss where I stopped at the SAVE-mark. \nSo the solution would be to pause the game, don't shut down computer and play the next day? Don't tell me this is intended. All those things made me stop this game at Behemoth-boss. I will surely never continue and delete it.\nThat's why I would not recommend. Too many great games here on Steam to bother with something like that.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505903", "timestamp_created": 1472395853, "recommendationid": "25207698", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "steamid": "76561198047382628", "last_played": 1472394987, "num_games_owned": 90}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1483042042, "review": "Really bad game, I don't get why good run and gun games are so hard to find.  The premise is cool, you are an ant fighting in a war against other bug species, but there are massive flaws that hold this game back from being fun.\n\n-Controls are unresponsive, you must have good controls in a game like this and this one does not.  The controls feel slippery, jumping is incredibly imprecise, and the combat in general feels unresponsive.  To me this is a fatal flaw and completely inexcusable.  2d controls were perfected 30 years ago, I can't see how trashy controls like this are still a thing.\n\n-Bad control scheme, the firing in this game is weird.  It is like a twin stick in that the right analog stick aims, but unlike other games in this genre you don't have to constantly aim, instead you have to point the stick at an enemy and your character locks on to that enemy.  While useful in fighting bosses it makes the regular combat feel clunky and awkward, a lock on button would have done the job far better.  Also the lock on randomnly breaks during boss battles which means you have to re aim randomnly during the fight, so the one time the mechanic is actually useful, it barely works.\n\n-Broken/boring game mechanics.  The melee attacks reflect bullets back at enemies, but most of the time the reflecting bullets miss the enemy you are reflecting back at, even when the enemy is just standing there.  This problem is compounded by the fact that refelcting bullets back is necessary to beat some of the bosses which turn these battles into incredibly boring luckfests.\n\n-overheating guns, this goes with the topic  of boring game mechanics.  You have to guns which are switched with a button press, these guns overheat quickly and need to be switched when they do.  So you shot like 6 shots then have to press y, shot 6 more, repeat.  It is not needed and just adds to the clunkiness of the combat.  Imagine playing contra and needing to reload every 2 seconds, sound like fun?   Of course not and it adds absolutely nothing to the game play\n\nOverall this is one of the worst run and guns I have ever played, other than the aesthetics I can't think of a single positive thing to say about this piece of trash, avoid no matter how much it goes on sale for.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498601", "timestamp_created": 1483042042, "recommendationid": "28802922", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "steamid": "76561198116707297", "last_played": 1483041090, "num_games_owned": 1298}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1480031527, "review": "Excelent game!
