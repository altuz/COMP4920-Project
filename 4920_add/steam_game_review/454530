{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506274900, "review": "I bought this game not realising how magnificent this game is and I hope you have the same experience. I like to complete a game before writing a review but 90 hours in and with my game hours the third highest of all of my games (next to Motorsport Manager as 2 and Pike and Shot Campaigns as 1), I feel happy in making this review. Simply: If there was an award for the \u201cBest Ever wargame made for PC\u201d, I think this would win it hands down.  This is the best WW2 strategy and tactics simulator you will get your hands on (and yes, even looking at you Gary Grigsby).  I don\u2019t choose my words lightly but when you have a wargame that gets 100% positive reviews it makes you sit up and take notice of why it\u2019s so good. Everything is as near to perfect a you will find in a wargame:\n1 \u2013 The roleplaying element is perfect, unique for this type of game and what sets it apart from Gary Grigsby games. Instead of shoving counters around a map, I actually AM the general in command, I have my superiors to keep happy, colleagues of similar rank and subordinates. In this game you don\u2019t just push around counters but you have to care about people (or not). Decisions can include whether to help with propaganda efforts, whether to join the Fuhrer\u2019s party (I didn\u2019t realise until now that most officers are Antis).  You can turn off \u201cmoral\u201d decisions, but if not, you\u2019ll have to choose whether to help or hinder the SS completing \u201cspecial tasks\u201d and you will be considered for war crime trials at the end.  Overall, there\u2019s about 10<15 people to interact with and keep happy.  Making them unhappy will give significant penalties e.g. Artillery won\u2019t show up, maintenance is more \u201cexpensive\u201d, Air Support less effective, etc. etc.\n2 \u2013 The Grand Campaign simulation for WW2 has finally been simplified without losing detail (again, looking at Gary Grigsby here \u2013 you are FAR better starting with this game or transitioning into this system from Gary Grigsby, as I did).  Tutorial is via video in game and you will need to watch them twice to understand the game (perhaps an hour+ effort).  You\u2019ll also panic when first seeing the interface \u2013 \u201cwhy can\u2019t I move my army\u201d \u201chow do I make basic decisions\u201d. Before you realise: The first turn is a decision turn only and all troops have 0 Action Points turn one, and each decision does indeed have around 5 screens per decision (1 to make the decision, 1 to provide a historical background (how many games provide this historical backround?), the rest being view points from affected parties to help you decide a decision).  Although a lot of screen shots show NATO symbols you can play with a more graphical interface (which I do) to instantly see if a Regiment is Infantry or Panzer. Movement and Attacking is so simple \u2013 click a hot key and move, or choose troops to attack.  Don\u2019t over-stack hexes and keep watch on a units Morale and Cohesion.  If it gets too low you can play a \u201ccard\u201d to rest them.\n3 \u2013 The card system is a fantastic idea.  Cards are used to control which units have \u201ccommand focus\u201d (i.e. leaders bonus), how to use air support (very happy air support is represented by cards in this game, and you simply choose where Army Group North/Centre/South airfields are based), to rest units, to deploy artillery or where to deploy reinforcements, etc.  Each card has a Political Point (PP) cost and you need to spend PP on either cards or the roleplaying decisions (of which there could be perhaps 6<15 per turn). You get extra PP for each decision you have to deal with and each city you take.  Your relations dictate how expensive an action is to take in PP cost \u2013 if you have poor relations with a front leader, don\u2019t expect decisions on that front to be \u201ccheap\u201d.  I love the tutorial where the designer says \u201cplay and forget\u201d.  i.e. simply play the cards once and that bonus will continue to be provided until an event means it cannot or you choose to change which unit receives the bonus. \n4 \u2013 The AI is very good and a big challenge (you can change difficultly settings to suit).  It will form defensive lines, complete counter-attacks, withdraw at some points. It\u2019s never easy to get towards the objectives, but highly worth spending your time pondering over things.  Luckily, you do have intelligence reports (should you choose to read them) that will help in gauging a threat in a certain area by giving limited oversight into the fog of war.  In fact, you get a LOT of great reporting in this game (but you DON\u2019T have to be a bean counter and read it all to play this game).\n5 \u2013 The logistics and weather are simulated VERY well. Logistics is via Train and Truck and you have a limited number of both that will automatically move around (don\u2019t permanently lose trucks/trains \u2013 else you\u2019re in BIG trouble!!! Keep them well MAINTAINED).  The player can affect efficiency and wear/tear \u2013 don\u2019t make your trucks run more than 10 hex to a Panzer HQ else they will wear out and spend more oil than the oil being delivered.  In this respect, oil is a HUGE and critical problem.  Your supplies are extremely tight and running a Panzer Group in \u201cBlitzkrieg\u201d posture (gaining attacking bonuses) uses A LOT of fuel. Often my North and South groups ran out of fuel.  If you are out of fuel, you simply cannot move mechanized vehicles \u2013 Panzers, etc.    It gets very hard and restricted to say the least (and when you move your \u201cForward Supply Base\u201d supplies of oil are NOT delivered at all for one turn \u2013 you must use stored oil, that\u2019s IF you have it). Trains will get supplies to your \u201cForward Supply Base\u201d but your engineering staff will need to convert the track to German gauge first (again, an automatic element which depends on the decision cards you take, relationships and whether it is physically possible to extend the track \u2013 is it in enemy territory or not). I have seen mud represented which slows movement up, terrain has an effect on battles by operating troop types at x% effectiveness (shown in the clear display screen if you hover over the terrarin type in the top centre).\n6 \u2013 The graphics/charts are clean and neat, not cluttered at all.  There\u2019s a HUGE number of statistics in this game for people who like to see detail, but you don\u2019t need to read it all.  You can see amount of kills, equipment in use, very detailed battle reports for each engagement, detailed Order of Battle, Daily Reports, reports on most tired units, lowest morale, etc.  \n7 \u2013 The game measures you /5 in all areas such as Strategy/Tactics/Relationships/Ethics, etc. \u2013 all are important.  Tactics are hugely important in this game, you really do want to make sure you attack at the right time with the right units else poor planning will be punished harshly (you make end up with units being disciplined and receiving permanent negative bonuses rather than awards for a great performance).\n8 \u2013 Supplies and replacements are challenging to manage.  You need supplies at the divisional level (e.g. Ammo, etc.) to mount offensive battles, but resources are very limited. So, you can accept the default distribution of supplies, or, toggle supplies to be received by each unit (micromanagement). The same is true of \u201creplacements\u201d to reinforce the units.  You CAN micromanage, or choose to ignore that aspect without a \u201chuge\u201d effect. \nThere\u2019s just \u201ca lot\u201d in this game, but it\u2019s presented in a clean and simple way.  If you fancy getting this game because you are interested in WW2 grand strategy and tactical games (on a huge scale) I would 100% say get this today, give it a go for 2 hours, and once you \u201cget it\u201d and its mechanics, you won\u2019t look back (you will need to re-start the campaign a few times to get the hang of this).  The designer is not just any designer but a master of his genre, very much like Sid Meier is a master of business and strategy games.  When you get a passionate master who works on something, you know the end result is going to be very special indeed.
