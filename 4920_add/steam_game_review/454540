Once you have a base running, the real uphill battle begins, with limited (and already settled) resources to share around and a dwindling population of deserted bases.  It is hard to enjoy when to do a simple resource transfer from one base to another can not be accomplished remotely, and while you are in the air, you have no control over what is being produced in other bases.  \n\nMarket griefers buy up masses of fairly priced goods to sell back to the market at unfair markups, but since the markets are so sparce the goods likely get snatched up at inflated prices by someone who, too frustrated to wait for a better offer, will buy game money with IRL money (which is deceptively cheap, leading to a real nickle-dime you FTP model) to fill their hold and go power their mighty lumber mills for half their running capacity.\n\nSo far as flight enjoyment or simulation, with a 15 minute flight time to the CLOSEST ports and clunky hands-on control (which means you spend most time on auto-pilot), the game becomes a very hands-off experience for the most part, and becomes mind-numbing and repetative.  The dragons represent almost no threat and can be felled with a single early-game round auto-fired by your vessel while you're off cleaning the kitchen or orgranizing your sock drawer.\n\nI do not recommend this game for anyone looking for a trading sim (I highly recommend Elite: Dangerous for that craving), or a base building sim (from what I've seen Factorio looks much more rewarding), or a steam-punk RPG (the only role you play is that of a confused, bored airship captain).\n\nUnfortunately most of Alexey Pehov's works are not translated to English, but the series that has been, \"The Chronicles of Sialia\" (which is a fantastic series by the way) bares no resemblance to the game world in any shape or form.\n\nAll in all, colour me disappointed.
