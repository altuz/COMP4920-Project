Hopefully things change, but in the state it's in, I wouldn't waste the money, especially considering the price was just raised for seemingly no reason, they just didn't like a $10 pricepoint.   I got it on sale for $7.50 and I don't feel it was worth the price in its current state.   I'll hang on to it in hopes that this changes and update this review if that ever happens, but as of now, I wouldn't buy this title, it just doesn't feel like it'll ever turn into anything more than it currently is, which is very little.\n\nThe 4 legs in the middle of the spider don't even move, they just bounce a little, so walking around doesn't feel as good as one would hope.  Devs need to rig the spider skeleton to a proper model of how a spider walks.  Making webs is fun, but you don't coccoon your prey, so it's all very arcade feeling.   \n\nIt's just a really expensive \"Meh\" atm, and it's supposed to be releasing in just over a year, and has already had 3 put in to it?   Not exactly promising.   Oh, and a glance at the update page shows them far more worried about marketing an unfinished product to people than they are actually finishing it so it's WORTH marketing...\n\n~EDIT~  Yikes, after doing some research into this company and seeing their indygogo campaign, I no longer feel like this project has any hope of becoming more than it is.  It very much looks like a starforge situation.  If you can get to their greenlight page, you'll see a whole different game than what is actually presented now, and it looks far better than what I played.   This will be the first game ever that I get a steam refund on, because the more I look into this game, the worse things look for it ever releasing, or even being updated with more content.  \n\nIf you think $15 is worth it to sit around in an arcade environment and build a web, this IS the title for you.  If you want ANYTHING more out of your games, avoid this title at all cost....  Even at $7.50, I spent this much time researching this title, because it just had the feeling of abandonware.\n\nDevs, if you're truly doing what you say and are just a couple guys working hard to make what you feel is a great game, don't let this review dishearten you.   If you make a product worth the $15 in the future, I'll happily come back, but something just isn't sitting right with all this...", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1505065830, "recommendationid": "34867602", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "5", "author": {"playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "steamid": "76561198026980942", "last_played": 1504981562, "num_games_owned": 250}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 7, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 4, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
