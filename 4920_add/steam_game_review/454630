For example, I played Frenzy Mode, the main mode of the game where you press button sequences fast (the other mode, Recall Mode, is like Simon Says with controller buttons), and messed up and got a really low score on my first try. It uploaded the score to the online leaderboards, but, when I did a second try, when I got a score that would have gotten me #1 on the Frenzy Mode Easy leaderboards, the game never, and I say [u]never[/u] uploaded the score to the online leaderboard. Instead, it made me save my score locally but never submitted the score online. This is the first reason why I was angry at the game, because I believed the game thought I was a cheater, when I wasn't. I could have beaten everyone on the leaderboard, but couldn't.\n\nSecond of all, the achievements. Some of them wouldn't unlock when I got them, like the Frenzy Mode 100x Chain achievement. I actually did it in game and the achievement never unlocked. See the percentage of the achievement? 0.4%. Even though it's an easy achievement, if you have skill like me, It never unlocks. It should unlock but it's because the dev probably doesn't care.\n\nGameplay is good. But the problems with the leaderboard and achievements are horrendous.\n\nOther than that, if you are an achievement hunter, good luck trying to complete this game. Because some of the achievements never unlocked when I was supposed to recieve them.\n\nRating 6/10", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503627", "timestamp_created": 1498868457, "recommendationid": "33061601", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198147378030", "last_played": 1498867164, "num_games_owned": 163}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 8, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 7, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
