Though I hope they just announce this and don't change as I imagine the community would be happy with this.\n\n\nKinda long rant so for TLDR: You can't play offline with mods and it saddens me.\n\nI loved DBXV2 when it first came out, but after a while I started to fade off it a bit because I'd played the first Xenoverse so much (over 100 hours is alot to me okay?) and the games were pretty similar. I never really played the online as well as it just wasn't for me for this type of game. Though I love doing CPU matches and the PQ quests\n\nBut what got me back into the game heaps was the mods, I absolutely loved being able to play as characters that fans of the game had put so much time and effort in to creating like Caulifla, Kale (that one is really impressive, voice acting and everything), Jiren and yes... Kermit the Frog. As well as starting the CPU matches off with Super Saiyans (So I could do something like Goku v Vegeta and wouldn't have to hope they decided to transform)\n\nBut now this updates basically taken so much of the fun away from the game to me, that I don't really want to play it as much anymore which really sucks because I was getting so much back into this game and loving it.\n\nI don't know much about how this mods online thing works. But surely if you can stop people from not being able to play the game because some files are different, you could instead just make it so they can't use the online. I think most of the community would be completely happy with that.\n\nI also don't know what other people are doing with mods if there is a huge amount using it to cheat online, but all I wanted so some cool features and an up to date roster of DragonBall Characters to make the game much more fun. Because seriously look at those DragonBall Heroes clips and imagine how insane and fun it would be to play as those characters. Well, with these amazing modders it was possible but now not so much...\n\nMight be wrong but I heard Rockstar decided to pull a 180 on not allowing mods and now it seems alot of the negative reviews are gone, so I'd be more than happy to change this to a positive review if they start allowing mods again or just let you not go online (Seriously I'll take a permanent ban from online Bandai if you just let me mod mah singleplayer please) Though this game isn't a popular as GTA V so there probably won't be as much uproar about this and thus, they might not change this decision\n\nSorry if I repeated myself or spelt stuff wrong don't normally rant this much but it's just because I really like this game.

It is easily the closest to experiencing the anime, at least since the Budokai Tenkaichi series. However, the reason I'm giving this a thumbsdown is because Rockstar here does not know anything about its players or community. I understand wanting to prevent online cheating. It makes sense. I'm not going to fault Bandai for wanting to keep people from cheating. However, in doing so, they KNOWINGLY effectively killed off the modding scene. Why should people be punished for buying this game and wanting more for it? Sure, there's DLC, but that's just not enough. Modding keeps games alive even years after they originally came out. So we should not be punished just for wanting more characters, costumes, and moves. And we shouldn't be punished for using those exact mods online with FRIENDS who also have those same mods. However, if you're using them against random players, then fine. Yeah, that makes sense. But to completely ban them from offline and playing online with friends who also have them is unacceptable.\n\nSo until we're allowed to use mods again... until only actual cheaters are effected by this... my review will stand. As will every other angered modder. You messed up, Bandai. You messed up just like Rockstar and Bethesda. But hopefully you will actually learn from your mistake. If you do, then this review will come down.\n\nEdit: Oh, I completely forgot to mention and this is an issue that has existed before this horrible new anti-cheat nonsense was implemented. For some reason, some of the characters who I tried to unlock just wouldn't, despite meeting the requirements to do so. I did what was asked of me to unlock Mr. Satan, Saiyaman 1, and Saiyaman 2 as playable characters but yet, they never unlocked.

Character creation is back from the original and even better than ever. With the ability to transfer your character, their moves, and their equipment (with a very few exceptions) you can start the game with a decent and familiar moveset for your custom character. The races all return from Xenoverse 1 with slightly altered stats. If you check out the Steam Guides you can find the Big Numbes Guide for this game by the same person who made the one for the first DBXV, and the first thing you notice is that the racial multipliers are drastically reduced. This means that you can pick basically any race you'd like and play basically any playstyle and at least in the story and co-op modes succeed (mostly, I will touch on this again when I get to the cons). \n\nThere are new customization options, including new hair, voices, accessories, clothing, and a new addition in QQ Bangs, which are accessable very early on in your playthrough and are made from other pieces of clothing, miscellaneous items, and a small fee of the in-game currency, Zenni. This means you can wear whatever you want and the QQ Bang will overwrite the stats, meaning you can give your custom character a look that is all their own without sacrificing stat bonuses.\n\nSpeaking of stat bonuses, every race now has its own unique transformation which you get by doing side quests in various areas within the hub world. Each race gets a unique benifit, as well as the universal Kaioken and Unlock Potential transformations. Not only this, but they have their own slot on the move wheel, allowing you to have a transformation AND two Ultimate Techniques. \n\nAs for the Skills themselves, Super Skills are mostly returning from DBXV1 with a handful of new ones added. Some of them have been altered slightly or rebalanced, but most are the same. Ultimate Skills are similar, with some balance changes made.\n\nCombat is basically the same as the first game, except each race gets its own unique combo chains which is nice. This lets you pick your playstyle (again I will touch on this later). \n\nStory is very similar to the first game with some twists and new bosses and story segments, this time drawing from Dragonball Super's first two arcs instead of movie plots for the last few story missions. It takes between 3-4 hours to finish completely, sans DLC of course (I will not be talking about the DLC content in this review other than here to reccomend getting it for the additional content and additional moves). \n\nParallel Quests are also largely the same, with some basically being copied straight from DBXV1. This is both a strength and a weakness, because the only changes made are win conditions generally, and they were in the first game.\n\nThere is a new type of mission added for this game: Expert Missions. These missions consist of fights of varying difficulty where you and 4 other people team up to fight either a superpowered normal enemy with new abilities, a large enemy with those same powers, or a normal enemy with tons of HP. These vary wildly from cakewalks to brutal marathons that will require teamwork and skill and your most powerful moves.\n\nThe shops in-game have been left largely alone, aside from the addition of TP medals and the TP medal shop (open Friday-Sunday every week). While you can use TP medals (which you earn from Expert Missions, doing new Parallel Quests for the first time, or get as gifts from the devs from time to time) to purchase regular items, moves, and equipment, you're much better off saving them up in the literal hundreds to purchase moves from the TP Medal Shop. Moves here cannot be acquired any other way except maybe from your DBXV 1 create-a-character's import process. These include powerful moves like Goku Black's Black KameHameHa Ultimate and Final Shine from GT. You can also get exclusive gear here, which may or may not be to your taste but the option is there. \n\nNow for the bad stuff.\n\nFirst of all, Combat has become a mirror of what it was in DBXV1. In the first game, beamspam was dominant in PVP and PVE and a female saiyan with Super Vegeta and beam spam was basically unstoppable. This game outright will punish you for using energy attacks in 1v1 scenarios. There is a new mechanic added called Stamina Break, which immediately depletes all stamina your opponent has and leaves them wide open to attack. They can't block, they can't dodge, they can't boost dash, they can only float around helplessly as you pummel them in a combo or knock them to the ground before dropping a huge ultimate on their head. This means that Stamina management and melee combat are the two most important things, especially for PVP. If you go into a PVP match with a Ki-based character, expect to be chewed up and spit out, unless you're doing 2v2 or 3v3 and your teammates can for sure keep the enemy off of you while you wind up that flashy super or ultimate move. Not only that, but many energy ball Ultimates have had their tracking nerfed and all attacks can be blocked so long as you have stamina save for a select few like Destructo Disk and Special Beam Cannon. Basically, if your'e going to do PVP, avoid making an energy-based character at all costs because you will be destroyed. This isn't even to mention the pathetic anti-cheat in place; it is rare, but i have encounted the same players using trainers or some other cheat tool in PVP more than once. \n\nFinally, the issue of connectivity with the servers is also there. You need to set your Steam download region to the one you want to play in. This is how the game determines your location. \n\nSo, remember that Stamina break thing? Yeah guess what, the bots abuse the shit out of it. With their perfect reaction times it is incredibly difficult to land any sort of attack with a windup as they'll simply dash behind you and break your stamina, leaving you open to an AI-perfect beating. The bots are brutally hard.\n\n Also, every time you make a new character you have to unlock all the PQ's again and beat the story... again. \n\nOverall I'd reccomend this game most if you plan on getting the DLC/Season pass but it's still fun without those things, so give it a chance if you have the money and the time.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544190", "timestamp_created": 1505332498, "recommendationid": "34926251", "language": "english", "votes_up": 25, "comment_count": "7", "author": {"playtime_forever": 5545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198040765030", "last_played": 1501891379, "num_games_owned": 87}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 12}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507167522, "review": "EDIT: This anti cheat not only fails to stop the most basic of hacks but it also logs data, keylogs inputs, and does not prevent the most basic of hacks like dll injections and Cheat Engine.\n\n0/10 indefinitely will never buy a Bandai Namco game again\n\nKinda long rant so for TLDR: You can't play offline with mods and I will not be purchasing any more Bandai Namco games because of this from this point forward.\n\nI loved DBXV2 when it first came out, but after a while I started to fade off it a bit because I'd played the first Xenoverse so much (over 100 hours is alot to me okay?) and the games were pretty similar.
