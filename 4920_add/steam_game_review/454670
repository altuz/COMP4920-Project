Piggy Princess is one of the better ones. Perfectly servicable entry to the chuck-a-random-animal-at-a-goal-of-somesort genre. The sound effects and music are annoying and there's an irritating zoom in when placing items, but apart from that it's a decent game. It's unlikely to blow your mind, but it's a fun little way to spend the odd five minutes or so.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495661", "timestamp_created": 1458577685, "recommendationid": "21966217", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561197970170056", "last_played": 1458577311, "num_games_owned": 284}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 6}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1468092640, "review": "If you like the Angry Birds sets of games then this is a game which can relate very similarly to the Angry Birds genre. I really enjoy this game because you can strategise the launching/flinging move of the Piggy Princess herself. Another nice feature that makes it different from Angry Birds is the use of objects; it's a but like animism, only you can use the objects to strategise your moves. For example, in one level you have to startegise with levers, boulders and magic all at the same time.\nIf you would like a game that works very similarly to Angry Birds but still has its differences, then I would recommend this game to all gamers. It's an interesting title that's worth the purchase.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "timestamp_created": 1468092640, "recommendationid": "24214772", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198069210107", "last_played": 1475322207, "num_games_owned": 108}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
