It reminds me about a very old game played on my first computer, a 486, on windows 3.1 - Chips. A game from Wingames bundle. This time, well we have 3D, nice music and graphics and ingenious level designs.\n\nAwesome!\n\nI do recommend it.\n\nNotes: \n1) Pay attention to the Tip screens - you may find out useful tips.\n2) The game may require some updates. I had to use my Enter key from the numeric keypad, instead of the \"Return\" one.\n\nQuestion for develpers: can you please decrease the animation time on PC? The animation takes too long.. Sometimes I have the feeling that the animations are slowing me down and I feel like I loose precious seconds... Thank you!\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507614", "timestamp_created": 1459809891, "recommendationid": "22243978", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198111854910", "last_played": 1486501201, "num_games_owned": 5}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1467357699, "review": "Cute puzzle game with nice animations and music.
