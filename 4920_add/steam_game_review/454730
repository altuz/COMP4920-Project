Its basically a Unity Asset Horde Mode.\nWave Survival, with Tower Defence Mechanics. Shooting feels just terrible, Graphic quality is horrid, and the sound is worse.\nControls for Keyboard and Mouse aren't even really there. All the UI uses Xbox Controller buttons, and the Sensitivity slider for PC doesn't even work.\n\nPros\n- It allows us to see that people will put ANYTHING on Steam.\n\nCons\n- $30.00 for a Piss Poor game( Bought on Sale for !6.00 CAD/ Refunding)\n- Controls are terrible\n- Shooting is Ass\n- Sound Design is basically non existant\n- Level Design is trash\n- Unity Assets look unpolished and Old\n\nFirst Impressions Video Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqF1NYPMG8E", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549431", "timestamp_created": 1469308180, "recommendationid": "24486861", "language": "english", "votes_up": 41, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "steamid": "76561198006070839", "last_played": 1469247642, "num_games_owned": 314}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 11}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1469267613, "review": "Refund pending,\n\nThis is the first game I have ever refunded on Steam, so I am not a serial refunder. I tend only to play coop games or TD games nowadays, so this game seemed to tick all the boxes. I was ready to buy another 3 copies for my regular weekend LAN session but after trying out single player I realised it would not be acceptable to my buddies. This game needs serious work before release.\n\nI'm not going into gameplay issues here because I didn't try it long enough to become qualified to talk about gameplay. The game needs interface work before it is release-worthy.\n\nFirst off, the mouse cursor disappeared at the screen where you need to check your screen brightness. I tried it windowed and full-screen, same result: no mouse. Unless you click the proceed button you can't proceed. There IS a mouse, you just can't see it, so you have to move the invisible mouse around like a palsied drunk hailing a cab, clicking all the time before you can move to the next screen. \n\nThen comes a brief terrifying introduction which reminded me a little of a fistful of dollars, where 64 peeps got offed in the opening credits. Except this time it is YOU being offed. After this mouthwatering little tidbit, I proceeded to try the first mission.\n\nNo key bind options. Unless they are carefully hidden out of sight. So you have to guess which keys are used for movement etc, fortunately for some they are the default WASD. I say for some, I am dyslexic and cannot use those keys. Plus no reverse mouse. So no game for me.\n\nIn conclusion, a promising looking game which NEEDS crucial interface work before it is released. The author has spent all his time on the gameplay and graphics, and none on the interface. This is essential before you can seriously put this out into the real world. I'm hoping that this game receives further work on keybindings, mouse and interface. I would most definitely like to repurchase and re-review.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552962", "timestamp_created": 1469267517, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1469275552, "recommendationid": "24476354", "language": "english", "votes_up": 37, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197974329039", "last_played": 1471684320, "num_games_owned": 265}, "developer_response": "We are sorry that you had this problems with the game.\n\n\nYour are right with screen brightness.
