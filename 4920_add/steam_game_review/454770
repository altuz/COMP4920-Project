If relevance is something you care about, I would call this a fun hybrid of Super Meat Boy, Shovel Knight, and Duck Game.  The writing is hilarious with just enough story to not be distracting from the gameplay.\n\nThis is a challenging platformer through and through, but it doesn't suffer from the typical tropes associated with the genre.  It's very generous and diversified with it's abilities.  For perfectionists, there are also tons of opportunities to try to get to the top of each stage's leaderboards outside of multiplayer, but doesn't obligate you to perform at your best.  Just going at my own pace made it fun for me.\n\nCharacter movements feel like they have weight but various movement options allow for some crazy stunts that the excellent level design capitulates on.\n\nDon't expect a reinvention of the wheel, but for its price point and value, I absolutely recommend this one!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498218", "timestamp_created": 1505951571, "recommendationid": "35094113", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198056586505", "last_played": 1505952635, "num_games_owned": 293}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506505532, "review": "if u dont like gams that mak u angerous dont git dis", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "timestamp_created": 1506505532, "recommendationid": "35238662", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 125, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198220154235", "last_played": 1506801070, "num_games_owned": 109}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
