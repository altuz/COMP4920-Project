Mouse control of the ship was very responsive, the auto-fire feature much appreciated, and the randomized level design meant even when I replayed a stage I might see a dramatically different experience. I found it pretty challenging (though admittedly I failed to realize that pumping excess energy into weapon slots gave me more DPS, so I may have given myself a bigger challenge than intended). I played through and won twice (normally and then on the Legend mode).\n\nOnly complaint is the music. I like it, just a pity that the looping aspect is so obvious. A very minor issue; overall this is definitely worth playing if you like horizontally scrolling shooters!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497130", "timestamp_created": 1500314085, "recommendationid": "33612885", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561197980006490", "last_played": 1500297413, "num_games_owned": 78}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 21, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 17, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
