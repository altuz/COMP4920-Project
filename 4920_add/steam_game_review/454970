There are a few small things I would change to make this game a little less punishing.\n\n1. Let the arrow keys move the character a bit while falling. I'm aware that gravity changes allow you to change your course, however it'd be nice to be able to rely on falling to do things and to counteract the intertia you invariably have when coming off a ledge.\n\n2. Give a bit of leeway on the outside of the map for falling or whatever. It'd be nioce if you could extend the buffer to about 3 or 4 tiles so that going off the map isn't insta-death. If something is insta-death then use spikes instead.\n\n3. A windowed mode?\n\nHowever, it is a challenging game and I can see the fun in it.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522262", "timestamp_created": 1460777662, "recommendationid": "22443223", "language": "english", "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561197978695374", "last_played": 1460770876, "num_games_owned": 388}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1466806670, "review": "The game is pretty hard, but the controls are decent. The pixel style is sometimes a bit off (you really see it when certain sprites are scaled and the character sprite has larger pixels than the power ups, buts thats really nit-picking here).
