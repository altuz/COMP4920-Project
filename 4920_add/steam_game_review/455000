I have came across multiple bugs where I had to restart in order to continue. Some of these may also lead players to think what they're trying to do is wrong and look elsewhere while in fact it was correct but the game is not acting right. Chapter 3 I was stuck for quite long because the game failed to show me all the controls, I had to test out random keys on the keyboard 1 by 1 in chapter 3 to use umbrella. I played through the whole thing in English and there are times information were given in Chinese. I can only say that this game at its current state is unacceptable as an official release game.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630135", "timestamp_created": 1471665929, "recommendationid": "25025479", "language": "english", "votes_up": 69, "comment_count": "9", "author": {"playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198116841324", "last_played": 1471656495, "num_games_owned": 106}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
