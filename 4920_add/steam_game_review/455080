So, you bet that I added it instantly in my wishlist and that I've waited for a discount to buy it. Not that I wanted to buy it full price but I'm used to prices under 10 euros.\n\nAwakening is a series with Princess, then Queen, Sophia, discovering her lineage and deciding to take back what's hers and find a way to save her parents from an eternal sleep. The Redleaf Forest is the final chapter to that particular arc for Sophia's story.\n\nThe Redleaf Forest is the theater of a war between centaurs and dwarves, because of Dreadmyre, the main antagonist. However, Sophia needs to find a centaur that will forge the weapon that will defeat the evil entity. And while trying to find a way to stop the war (though you'll see that the twist in the end that will solve everything).\n\nIf the plot is well-written and can be played without any prior knowledge, I found it just disappointing not to have the whole story on Steam, even if Big Fish promised to release the beginning under the form of a bundle. You're missing all Sophia's background and journey to what she is now. \n\nThe gameplay is quite the standard one: find items to use after, solve puzzles and clear hidden objects scenes (whether in the form of objects to use, of a shaped list or a list of words). What is cool here is that these scenes can be incorporated into the story (for example, being searching for something for the healer). The puzzles are easy. However, I've a small complaint: sometimes, I couldn't really find what to do because I've missed an item somewhere.\n\nThe graphics are really good, colorful and sad in the same time. The soundtrack was good too.\n\nThe fact that is a collector's edition is also interesting: aside from the usual bonus, you have a garden where you can play minigames and where you can make plants grow!\n\nSo yeah, Awakening: The Redleaf Forest is a very good purchase. You would be crazy to miss it if you're a casual adventure gamer. And the full price is justified. Now, I'm just waiting for Big Fish to keep their promise to release the rest on Steam.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537960", "timestamp_created": 1467824983, "recommendationid": "24138491", "language": "english", "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 352, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "last_played": 1467740648, "num_games_owned": 2214}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1483201554, "review": "Nice scenes and BGM and it's story easy for non English speakers to understand", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1483201554, "recommendationid": "28874223", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198068980974", "last_played": 1483269885, "num_games_owned": 101}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1459253253, "review": "when i brought today i thought they had trading cards but in badges they don't have.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487129", "timestamp_created": 1459253253, "recommendationid": "22122500", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "11", "author": {"playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198123367153", "last_played": 1460208761, "num_games_owned": 151}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 6}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
