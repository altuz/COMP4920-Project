I've been playing tower defense games for years, seen many types, good-bad and everything in between.  Apps, flash games, custom maps in RTS games, etc.  This one is pretty good, but it leaves a lot to be desired that would make it really quite solid, and probably be easy enough to implement.\n\nTo be desired:\n-For starters, there is no tutorial.  It's not exactly rocket-science, but hey basic instructions would probably help.\n-You cannot move the table/map once in the game.  Coming from games like Smashbox Arena where you can fully move the arena around, spin and rotate it, zoom it in and out (all when dead), I was expecting as much here.  Instead it's static, and you have to basically move yourself in relation to the table.  Not the end of the world I suppose, but would be nice.\n-You cannot view enemy health, stats, information, weaknesses, attacks, nothing.  Not even a health bar.  I mean come on, a health bar would be REALLY nice.  Seeing a visible HP stat when selecting an enemy (something you cannot do) would be really nice to.  This seems almost basic and manditory, but is completely absent.  So you have to learn overtime which enemies do what, what towers hurt them more.  All types from what I could tell always do maximum damage, I didn't see any elemental resistances or weaknesses, or armour.  Random enemies would start attacking and destroying my towers, that was brutal to find out on the fly, and definitely would have changed my positioning.  One wave of two skeletal mages in particular nuked 3/4 of all my most expensive and best towers.  \n-A general information \"guide\" to view about towers, their upgrade costs and benefits, and especially of enemy types, health values, and what they do would be really nice.  Even if this guide wasn't accessible during a game, and only reviewable between matches.  Of course you can learn overtime what your towers cost for full upgrades, their stat values seen in real-time, and whatnot, but it would be nice to see in one place for reference.  There is absolutely no information on enemies which is disappointing.\n\nNow for the pros:\n-Many tower types and variety\n-Upgradeable, and at max level have options for elemental type damage, splash, multi, etc.\n-Interactable environment (for example you drop logs to block enemy paths)\n-Special moves that respawn overtime and don't cost anything (a blimp that shoots stuff)\n-You can adjust table position between matches\n-There are harder modes, faster modes, endless modes\n-Many levels\n-Weather\n-Can place towers directly in line of enemy paths, so you can make interesting mazes for the enemies to pass by\n-Can sell towers\n-Good graphics\n\nAs far as tower defense games go, this is easily a 7.  If this were not in VR and were a flash game, or an app, I would still say it's pretty good.  The BIGGEST single detriment if I had to name one, would be lack of enemy information, especially a health bar.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509403", "timestamp_created": 1494992413, "recommendationid": "31798474", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "steamid": "76561198001194174", "last_played": 1500867598, "num_games_owned": 140}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1494640326, "review": "If you enjoy tower defense you should give this a try. The developer has done a good job bringing this into VR. The table fits well in my roomspace area and it is pretty well designed. Everything is intuitive with motion controls.  The areas you play in have things going on around you and added touches like the weather changing when bosses come out help with the atmosphere. Graphics are nice and I havent had a single drop in performance even when the table is chaos with enemies and towers. There is a fair variety of towers and the placement areas are a lot more free for positioning than any of the other in VR tower defense games so far alowing you to create mazes. I am about 5 hours in so far and there is lots of life left in this game. Definitely worth the price in my opinion.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1494640325, "recommendationid": "31713782", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198256886525", "last_played": 1494791718, "num_games_owned": 219}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1494828306, "review": "(Played on Oculus Rift)\nThis is a solid \"God-view\" tower defense game.
