You need to be able to rotate all the way around in your seat (a swiveling desk chair is perfect).\n\nI played on a DK2 w/ GeForce 970. The game was fairly comfortable; I felt a bit motion sick after 20 minutes of playing and decided to stop, but most games that involve player-controlled movement make me severely motion sick much sooner so that's pretty good.\n\nNot particularly exciting or even fun, but there are not many VR experiences on the market right now, and I wanted a simple game I could show to my family, etc. without making them motion sick.

You ride a boat you can minimally control down canals in a distinct art-styled Mesopotamian city (the learned archaeologist in me smiles). Get items such as shields and bows to defeat traps which you can either pick up or purchase at the shopkeep. Keys, maps, the whole shebang. Limited inventory keeps you on your toes as you fight off crocodiles and starvation. Eat to stay alive! Live vicariously through your fictional self by indulging in Turkish Delight (terrible in real life, would not recommend).\n\nAim with your head in-game, but controller appears to be required by the main menus (not the gameplay ones). Would be nice if in a future update, the controller was not required to navigate these!\n\nOverall, a great little game. Not too expensive, some challenge to it.\n\nI don't know if I'd recommend the swivel chair like the other guy said, I got wrapped up so bad I had to yell for my roommate to help.

Definitely one of the better experiences ive had with VR. This is one of those games that you get into and are blown away by the art style. Well done. The only thing i'd change is when you turn on the magic carpet your character doesnt turn with it so I found myself spinning in my office chair and getting my cable tangled up. Small issue that would make a big difference. I disliked having to take my headset off to unwrap the cable.

It's got a wonderful color scheme and doesn't encounter (in my opinion) the problem of headaches and motion sickness that you can get from some VR games. It's easy to play if you just want to sit back and play some VR (not having to stand, swivel, etc.) as you control the game with your line of sight and can change your direction with the R1 and L1 buttons on the remote.
