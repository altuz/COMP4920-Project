I wanted to control the vast army of technically inferior troops and to use these troops to overwhelm entrenched imperial forces.\n\nIt doesn't work that way. The disparity in quality is addressed by giving you some looted tanks and beefed up infantry units. The imperial units, marines in particular get a debuffing. This means the developers rather lazily left you fighting mega hordes of low quality marines with a small army of uber-orks. \n\nAs an approach this just didn't sit right with me. The scenarios are ok. the gameplay is reasonable. But I was, and am left feeling this is just 40k armageddon's second best scenario pack with a rejigging of the sprites. It's a lazy game. I'd say buy 40k armageddon and look at the DLC there first. If you want a final fix then maybe buy this game.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582823", "timestamp_created": 1495343097, "recommendationid": "31875359", "language": "english", "votes_up": 41, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 4241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198020567305", "last_played": 1495296703, "num_games_owned": 209}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496988576, "review": "I really enjoyed this add on.
