And I own 20 out of 21 Digital Homicide titles.  And those are more competently made than this abomination.\n\nFor crying out loud ...\n\nSome guy took Gameguru, a software toy that is not at all suited to commercial game development, or indeed meant to be used for anything but building ultra-basic game concepts and sharing them with friends, and decided he would try running the same scam DH did:  copy and paste what amounts to little more than tutorial content and sell it on Steam.  (Heck, there are tutorial levels included with Gameguru that is more content-rich than what you're getting here.)\n\nIt's like the developer is playing some kind of horrible joke on the consumer:  A suburban front door is used as a city gate!  The same two buildings copied and pasted dozens of times!  The same character models copied and pasted!  Horrible animation!  No dynamic shadows!  The same dopey music they use in that medieval tutorial in Gameguru!  An assault rifle with magazines lying around a medieval town!  Stilted, broken writing!  Super low framerate (and yet it looks awful)!  There's nothing here to make you think this could be a RPG of any kind.  And there is certainly no indication that this will ever be a real game.\n\nRead the Gameguru store page.  Making commercial games is not what it is for.  (Note, I've seen another user try and push a copy and pasted tutorial map through Greenlight, though I don't believe he succeeded.)  As if Unity hasn't done enough damage to the reputation of the indie development scene, now things like this come along, ready to be abused by a plethora of greedy nitwits.\n\nI'll be reporting this \"game\" via the store page.

This game is a mish mash of several demos from the Game Guru software (I own the software and have messed around with the demos, so I know this for a fact). How this is permitted to be  available on Steam for purchase is beyond me. Even at such a low price, it's a ripoff. You can just buy the Game Guru software and play the demos seperately. There's not much else added into this \"Early Access\" title.\n\nWhat you should really do is invest a cool, crisp 10.99 dollar bill in Corona Motorsport, the revolutionary racing game constructed from the ground up by a mad genius young man known as Lucas Game. You will see no reused assets from Game Guru or 10 fps sound zones that repeat the same line. You will encounter holes upon holes, and wonderful varying weather patterns all to test if there is something fundamentally wrong with your computer.\n\nPlease do not buy this game, but purchase Corona Motorsport instead. You'll have a better time. Tell 'em Sneeze sent ya.\n\nGood luck and have fun, really looking forward to overwatch on the 24th so I can stop purchasing these bags of garbage from nobody developers who want to earn a quick buck. I can just got to Wendy's and get something from the value menu, which I will be doing in a couple of hours, FYI.\n\nGoodnight and have a great week.\n\nTell 'em Game Guru sent ya.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552375", "timestamp_created": 1463363826, "recommendationid": "23012651", "language": "english", "votes_up": 141, "comment_count": "14", "author": {"playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "steamid": "76561197987352433", "last_played": 1463363353, "num_games_owned": 1398}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 64}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1470934204, "review": "Please give me back my money....
