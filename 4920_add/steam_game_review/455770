It has 24 (at the moment game modes) which add a bit of diversity into what is going on. But in nearly every game mode (mostly with the exception of catching the falling pig) the objective can be completed just by running up and using the \"fat-suit\" button (which bumps away opposing players). After awhile it just becomes boring running around and fat-suiting all of the time (the random power-ups add slight diffusion).\n\nThe graphics look great, and the game is certainly fun for a time or two, but it hasn't been brought back into our weekly games night. Seeing that it is in early access, I hope to see that it swaps out the fatsuit for other abilities and maybe greater diversity in game objectives (8-Bit Fiesta is a great example). But until that time, I can't really recommend it for any long-term, couch-coop enjoyment.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502686", "timestamp_created": 1487126695, "recommendationid": "29933384", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561197984209355", "last_played": 1485871969, "num_games_owned": 633}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1480071971, "review": "I don't even know what inspired me to buy and play this game.

Each game puts an interesting twist on a familiar minigame, and controls are simple. YamaYama even has a kid friendly mode that removes environmental dangers on the playfields.\n\nFor a night of co-op couch gaming, YamaYama goes great with Thief Town, 8Bit Fiesta, Ultimate Chicken Horse, and the Jackbox Party Games.
