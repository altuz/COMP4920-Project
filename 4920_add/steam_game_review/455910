The ships do control like ass.\nThe graphics are terrible and even with 20 years of technology between it's realease on the Nintendo to being ported to PC, nothing has changed and the draw distance is still shit.\nThe ships will move erratically like flies, moving up and down at in instant that kills all immersion if there was any to begin with.\n\nIt's boring, it looks terrible, it handles like garbage, the AI is nonexsistent.\nHere's how every level works out, \nfind target, get on a straight path with target, hope target isn't aiming at you at that time, fire at target from save distance to ensure previous step, kill target, move on.\n\nThey didn't try when porting this game and it's just a grab for your cash and your nostalgia.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "timestamp_created": 1506099365, "recommendationid": "35132616", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 282, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198079195231", "last_played": 1506115701, "num_games_owned": 175}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 377, "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 284, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 93}}
