{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504767777, "review": "I'm a big simulation game person. It's all I've known, ever since my first game of SimAnt, or Rollercoaster tycoon. I also understand that they are non-linear games, and thus, programming non-linear games is a whole different beast than your FPS's and RPG's, where things can be easily scripted and predicted. \n\nRecently, I've fallen in love with Rimworld, Prison Architect, and (especially) factorio. These are the big guys in the simulation world today, and at this time I take that into consideration when judging other games of this genre. \n\nJudgement: Apocalypse has a good idea of what it wants to be. It wants to give the player options and freedom to play the game how they see fit. But to this idea, it is not executed in a good way. There are multiple branches of research, but with each limited by finding \"research items\", which are found randomly. By the time you generate enough points to research everything, you're just waiting to find that random find to continue. And the enemies scale horribly. I'm sure another reviewer can tell you what the scaling is based on, as I don't know. I just know that by the time you see multiple reapers and minor demons, you're barely still trying to get your people armed with shit tier weapons that won't leave a mark on them. You're left taking on impossible missions with shit gear, just waiting for those lucky drops that get you to the next tier of research. I've seen others claim that the game is brutal and unforgiving. They are right. But they are right in the wrong way. It is brutal, and from what I've seen, the key to success is very linear. You have to build everything the right way, and have luck on your side. It just doesn't leave much room for variation. \n\nAnd as a simulation/sandbox game, it leaves very little room for customization. You start off being able to build little \"cabins\" that are either 2X2 or 3X2, where you fit your little objects in. It upgrades to stone, but there is no drag/customize features. Everything is static. You build a garden or you don't. \n\nI suppose a lot of criticism comes from the fact that they stole from Rimworld with their \"priorities\" menu where you can sort the improtance of tasks for each person. This is a big mechanic in Judgement. Recently \"Oxygen Not Included\" did the same. I own that and I've played it, but it also leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Both of these games leave me feeling stale. Good ideas, but poor execution.\n\nI didn't want to refund Judgement, because I think there is potential. Also, and mainly, because I encourage development of the genre. This is likely a first for many of their staff, and should be a learning experience. You guys had a good idea. Just work on it and polish it and you're good to go. \n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541326", "timestamp_created": 1504767777, "recommendationid": "34789534", "language": "english", "votes_up": 36, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198000696057", "last_played": 1504766197, "num_games_owned": 75}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 16}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506658806, "review": "Fun game.

I just have a few issues with it. \n\nFirstly upgrades. When you get so far through the tech trees you need certain items from locations in the game to continue down a specific tech tree. Research Papers. The problem is, due to the RNG of the location of these research papers you are often left with only one or two options. Taking the wrong one leaves you utterly boned. \n\nSecond gripe I have with this game is combat. The demons are insanely powerful, especially the further you progress. While there is a cover system in the game it hardly feels impactful in any way, with limited options as to how you can defend yourself with base defenses. This results in the optimal play being just to wall things off, and when you get attacked, try to funnel the demons into a killing zone.\n\nAll in all it is a good game, which is why I will give it a thumbs up. There are a lot of options to adjust difficulty to your liking and set your own pace. If I gave it a rating, I'd give it a 5 out of 10.

Decent village building game with a nice twist. The combat is alright if unbalanced (range beats everything else). The magic system looks like it has potential, but winds up being unused and the scavenging is anemic. The game would benefit greatly from more rpg elements and non stat based character development. The way dead state did it with unique goals and sub-missions per character would be a great fit.   The map is a bit dull with nothing more than boring kill all missions. The lack of other human or specific demonic factions also reduces the stakes. Stealth could be, but isn't  interesting.  There are some pretty serious balancing issues as well. Creating walls with buildings instead of wall pieces and melee being completely useless might be the worst ones. The scavenging would be greatly improved by  adding loot to the maps. Reducing the number of maps and introducing a weight mechanic, again basically like dead state did it. \n\nThe steam workshop modding system is broken (for this game) and it seems random which mods become active, likely because they overwrite each other. Writing your own mods is straightforward and fun though. If you want to play more than one mod at once, just toss their files into meld with the original files and join that way instead. \n\nStill the game is reasonably challenging and you'll likely complete it before it becomes grating.  It also has the classic xcom feeling of oh shit we are so screwed. Base upgrading and getting better weapons you look forward to using in the next though fight. While spending the time in the fights looking forward to what you are going to spend the resources on.\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500055", "timestamp_created": 1506863242, "recommendationid": "35381014", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1569, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561198038668660", "last_played": 1506975321, "num_games_owned": 465}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505886227, "review": "TL/DR: Judgement simulator mixes Xcom's unforgiving struggle for survival while capturing alot of the base-building and character nuance of rimworld. It's intense and wild at first, but eventually becomes dull by not maintaining the level of challenge. Unforgiving, and not for the faint of heart.\n\n\nI'm reserving judgement on this one for now (no pun intended). It's a good skeleton of a game, but missing content in terms of story missions, and weak variety of enemies and gear. Awesome vision, but only good (read: above average, but not great) implementation. Sometimes I think I'm harder on good games with untapped potential, than on bad games; I may be leaning that way on this one. They say a full release is coming in the next few months with new enemies and story missions, along with a price increase, so I'll probably have to re-evaluate this review after I see what it looks like.\n\n\nThe overarching game captures the desperate feel of xcom. You're in charge of a ragtag bunch of survivors in a hellish landscape. There are endless hordes of demons ravaging the world, and they're getting stronger by the day. You're going to need better fighters and better gear to keep up with them. Of course that means you need people to research and build that new equipment, so you need to build workshops and research areas as well as farms and kitchens and beds to support them. \n\nThe game doesn't pull it's punches. If you make mistakes, survivors die, and they are not easy to replace. Too many mistakes, and your base will be overrun. Some games are a casual experience that you can't really lose, and other games are a challenge where it's you vs the game. This is definately the later of those two. \n\n\nThe start of the game was insanely engrossing. You're building, struggling to rescue other survivors, while fending off waves of demonic invaders. Each battle is nerve-wracking, each victory is sweet, each loss is heartbreaking. It's a great rush. \n\nBut somewhere along the way it looses its steam, getting more routine and eventually being a painful grindfest by the end. It's a flaw in alot of strategy games, whether xcom, rimwrold or this. Each battle, you gain some supplies, but risk some soldiers. If you're winning enough to outpace the demon's growth curve, then your team is getting stronger and each battle becomes easier, allowing you to get more loot and grow even faster so the game can become easier. On the other hand, if you aren't outpacing the curve, the game gets harder and harder until you get wiped out. But either way, before long one side is getting curbstomped. You know who's going to win, but it's a long path to get there, and the endgame research just takes forever.\n\n\n\nThe game has two main modes, although they use the same UI. The first is base-building. You assign people to build, farm, research and make new gear. The building options are much more limited than rimworld. Buildings are preset shapes and sizes, (you can't even move the doors), but much more nuanced than xcom in that people actually walk between them. You have to think about kitchen access and pathways when you build your research station. Farms must be tended, workshops must be manned. You have to consider different skillsets of survivors and how to utilize them well. This mode definately feels more like Rimworld than Xcom.\n\nThe second mode is a series of squad based missions. Your people go off to loot the store/mall/hospital, and you have to fight off whatever demons are squatting there. It looks like you might be able to sneak past them too, but I never had any luck with that. This mode runs in realtime like an RTS, but set up so you can pause and assign orders without being rushed. You can equip your characters with grenades or medkits, and some characters have traits or levelup-bonuses which make them better shots with one weapon than another, but characters don't get dozens of special attacks like they do in xcom.\n\nThe game does a good job of allowing you to send missions when you want, while still enticing you to visit more and more dangerous areas. Further areas have new biomes, with harder enemies, but offering new resources that you need for higher level stuff. Deserts offer copper that you need for railguns, haunted forests offer mystic vines for magic camo, and cities have universities with research tomes research and churchs with holy relics. It's exciting to break into a new biome and get parts for new gear. On the other hand, if you want to just stay home and focus on research and build for a while, it allows you to do that.\n\n\nTechnically, the game is pretty solid, although a few of the mechanics seem pretty poorly tuned. The game suffers from dwarf-fortress-esque nuances like \"only one person can craft the blessed pistol, but you can't assign him and he won't do it himself.\"Fewer than rimworldm but still annoying. Making meals, and making gear aren't seperate activities, so you may leave your engineers with orders to make some new guns, then come back to find they've spent all their time making salads in the kitchen (or worse: people are dying of starvation because your cooks are working on guns in the workshop). You can get around it with the crafting priority system that's behind each person's individual task priorities, but it's time consuming and non-intuitive, and mistakes tend to be costly. \n\nAlso the awareness mechanic doesn't seem stratified enough (although I'm not sure I've played enough to say for certain). I like the idea of having a pacing mechanism that knocks you back if you grow too fast, but this game doesn't really do that. The demons target survivors without damaging buildings during raids, plus they give you a few hours notice when they're coming, so i've always had my entire village waiting behind a barricade when they show up. They either kill everyone and end the game, or get shot up without hurting anyone. Thus, awareness becomes a kind of russian roulette. Too little risk and you find behind the arms race, but with a bad roll, even a moderate amount can be fatal. I think it would be better if they somehow damaged the base, putting you back, without ending the game (perhaps its intended to kill just a few survivors, but it just hasn't worked that way for me).\n\nThere are little annoyances too. Survivors tend to clump up in battle and it can be very difficult to click on the right person. The game gets laggy if you have even a medium sized population. And some big calculation happens about once a second, so at the end of the game I was getting probably 30 fps for a second, then about a 1/5 second freeze. Not unplayable, but annoying. \n\nFinally (and this is the biggest thing for me I think) the game doesn't seem dark. Your squad is taking cover behind a row of spikes with impaled corpses, trying to hold off endless waves of demons with crossbows while your drug-addled teammate desperately tries to pick a lock on a cage where another survivor is held. But all the spites all look relaxed, and all the menus look like clean, bright paper. After you get out of the mission, the forest on the overworld looks very healthy and you can even hear birds singing happily. Then if you get ambushed in the happy forest, suddenly a mission starts and you're back in a blasted hellscape, complete with piles of corpses, blasted schoolbuses and piles of rubble. I think a few little cosmetic change would go a long way to imrpove the mood, or at least make it more coherent. \n\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is surprisingly good. It doesn't have xcom's fancy graphics, but it really captures its strategic intensity. The city-building and squad missions compliment each other wonderfully, and decisions made in one affect the other so much more than in xcom, requiring a much deeper strategy. I just hope the new content can make the endgame less tedious and maybe balance the difficulty a bit better.
