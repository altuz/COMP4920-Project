It controls very similarly to an old Atari game and its very easy to pick up and play. For what you pay for, it's a cheap party game to play with your friends.\n\nCheck out my play through with my friends\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S35lWeEIb4c&lc=z133xfci4wv1xjsr504chv1o2preubsqlr00k\n\nSubscribe to Fox Plays on YouTube for more indie games and Let\u2019s Plays", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501625", "timestamp_created": 1466936292, "recommendationid": "23822609", "language": "english", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561198037499511", "last_played": 1466861690, "num_games_owned": 376}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1470038938, "review": "This game has become a standard for party style games in my library.  This game is surprisingly complex, and can be very competitive.  It's easy to play, and the ships have stats that differ slightly and lend themselves to different playstyles, whether you want to be the first to the finish, or destroy your opponents right off the starting line.  It also has catchy chiptune style music, if you're into that.\n\nIf you have multiple xbox controllers and friends, I highly recommend this game.
