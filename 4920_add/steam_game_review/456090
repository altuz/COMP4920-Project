I thought for 3.99 what could go wrong? A beta game I didn't expect much, what I did expect however, was a playable game. This game is terrible, to be fair and honest. The game has potential, as of right now there is no hope for your survival. Out of 100 clicks you will be lucky if you get a swing in with a bat. The guns are alright still really buggy but at least you can fire them. DO NOT try and use melee weapons it wont work and you will rage, trust me. I see games like this as a gamble! In the future it could take off in value, kind of like property gambaling. There is a chance this game could turn into something great! I'd pay a buck for it not 3.99, in its current state.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1500157034, "recommendationid": "33570883", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198068892563", "last_played": 1500156400, "num_games_owned": 90}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500759287, "review": "Not much to do in this game at present. You run around with a very weak starting character who is unable to kill a zombie with their weapon. So the backup plan is to just snag a vehicle and slowly hit all the zombies around town so you can safely scavenge the houses. \n\nSo its semi playable, but mostly not. Which leads me to wonder if this is made with a load of premade assets. Since all the pieces are clearly visible, but so much of it doesn't seem to even try to work.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/i6IFlYythFI", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495227", "timestamp_created": 1500759278, "recommendationid": "33730338", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "steamid": "76561198017246524", "last_played": 1500758859, "num_games_owned": 862}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 7, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 6}}
