Of course, the AI is not hindered by any of these issues. It may play better as a party game, but given these two issues in battle, it would be hard to recommend it even for that.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518537", "timestamp_created": 1461977899, "recommendationid": "22714006", "language": "english", "votes_up": 25, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198009338411", "last_played": 1461978294, "num_games_owned": 1043}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 8}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486866957, "review": "Imagine that your task is to describe a Commodore 64 game in an alternate reality where every single Commodore 64 game was purged from existence. Now imagine that, instead of spending an hour writing a bunch of words that people will willfully misinterpret, or filming a tedious hour-long Youtube vlog that nobody is going to watch, you get on your Steam client, navigate to Flag N Frag, and launch it.\n\nImagine your audience experiencing the incredible music, the blocky yet colorful and functional graphics, the gameplay that is vaguely similar to modern gaming yet at the same time odd and vestigial, and the fact that this game is not nearly as fun as you'd imagine, infer, or remember, as the case may be.\n\nCongratulations. You've done it. Because this game is the very archetype of a C-64 game. The music is absolutely incredible, it's just a pity that the game itself completely falls apart due to its reliance on a \"battle mode\" that's far too fast-paced and chaotic for a human to do well at, and far too simple for the computer AI. Imagine Pong played at ten times the speed, and you have to hit a button in order to actually deflect the ball. Even against another human it'd be more \"goofy button mashing\" than an out-and-out competition, but against a computer? Forget it, it's not even remotely fun.\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.357823", "timestamp_created": 1486866957, "recommendationid": "29862727", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 138, "steamid": "76561197970286203", "last_played": 1498349481, "num_games_owned": 951}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1470795106, "review": "This game includes but is not limited to:\n\n[list]\n[*] Fragging\n[*] Flagging\n[/list]\n\n[spoiler]Note: not necessarily in that order.[/spoiler]", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491945", "timestamp_created": 1470795106, "recommendationid": "24803332", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "steamid": "76561198071548134", "last_played": 1497762653, "num_games_owned": 288}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1462056709, "review": "K", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.399241", "timestamp_created": 1462056709, "recommendationid": "22732251", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "steamid": "76561198084268001", "last_played": 1462171775, "num_games_owned": 59}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 55}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
