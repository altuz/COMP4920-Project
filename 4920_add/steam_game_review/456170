Though sometimes this game can drive you to a button mashing madness which only leads you to a swift end. You must employ calculated strings of attacks and blocks, and dodges and retreats. Admittedly, it's not perfect, as there are patterns that the AI follows that you can take advantage of. But overall, I found the game pretty challenging, and I beat several levels with my heart pounding with only a shred of life left. The work and thought I had to put into beating the opponents made for very satisfying victories.\n\nThe art style for characters is very reminiscent of older classic games (Prince of Persia, Flashback) which I absolutely loved. The backgrounds were generally good, and I felt like the level designs were pretty good too. \n\nNot a huge fan of the gore and strange darkness of it, but I suppose you could argue that it wasn't any prettier for kingdoms back in that time. The story was engaging enough to keep me going. I liked the perspective that it placed you in and the questions of who and what you were really fighting for. \n\nI really appreciated the fairly linear nature of the game. I have several games that I have started but then abandoned because I'm just overwhelmed by all the little sidequests and adventures and I am left with no desire to do any of them.\nEncountered a couple of bugs where I rarely my blocking wasn't working, but I only recall that happening twice through gameplay.\n\nWell done for the combat system, nice story, and good amount of gameplay. Good job overall.\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511309", "timestamp_created": 1504579057, "recommendationid": "34748328", "language": "english", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198064573466", "last_played": 1505603185, "num_games_owned": 129}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504571718, "review": "I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Bannerman.

The battles \nare hard and unforgiving, even the weakest enemies can kill you, if you don't watch out. Still, when your timing is right, \nnothing can beat you.\nThe pixel art is so rough and dark, it perfectly fits the atmosphere.\nThe soundtrack is beautiful, altough the game is pretty silent at times (which still supports the atmosphere).\nThe story turns out to be more relevant than I expected at first, which is a nice suprise, but I haven't played that far, so I can't really judge it yet.\n\nOf course this game isn't flawless either. The levels are designed in a way that can be a little frustrating sometimes, because you are pretty slow and if you die, getting back to your destination can be quite annoying. I do like the difficulty, but it just feels a little wrong. The only other issue I'm having is that I'm playing on a gamepad and you go through doors using the analog stick (up). Obviously the analog stick is also used for walking left and right. The problem is that when walking past a door, a lot of the times I go in the door accidentally, because I'm pushing the analog stick a bit too high.\n\nAnyway, these issues are very minor and I just wanted to mention them as feedback.

I loved the combat and the music is fantastic. I found out about this game through the creators youtube videos of the process that went into making the game.\n\n\nPros\n--------\n-Combat\n\n     -The combat was difficult but very rewarding when you start to take out enemies with out taking damage and dodging arrows perfectly. One thing I love about the combat is that it can be very punishing if you try to rush through it or are frustrated from a couple deaths. If you take a breath and relax and focus on what you are doing then some fights become much easier. There are some a few upgrades you can find as you play and you have 2 options when you find them and you can only choose one which lets you sort of create your play style.\n\n-Music\n\n    -The music is very imersive and really sets the mood. I have actually got the version of the game that comes with the soundtrack and love it.\n\n-Art/Animation\n\n    -The pixel art and rotoscope animation were great. I really liked the look and feel the rotoscope animations gave the game(He has a tutorial on how he does his rotoscope animations if you are interested).\n\n-Story\n\n    -Some may feel the story itself is not that exciting but the way the story is presented and how the game transitions at certain points was really great.\n\nCon\n--------\n\nMy only con would be the checkpoint/shortcut loactions. There is only 1 per level and that is at the end of the level before the boss. You have to open a gate that once opened stays open even if you die. You then can go through the gate at the start of the level and skip straight to the end. I wish there would have been atleast one more mid way though the level at least for some of the longer levels.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502703", "timestamp_created": 1505536048, "recommendationid": "34987447", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197994785275", "last_played": 1505445193, "num_games_owned": 526}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505450877, "review": "If I was to describe Bannerman in two words... its would be [i][b]'skillful brutality'[/b][/i]\n\nand when I say skillful I mean more than just proficiency in the combat systems. Bannerman does a good job of teaching you the ropes, but the core combat loop requires a moderate level of skill through out as you will be repeatedly killed as you learn not necessarily enemy patterns, but more of how each enemy fights\n\nYou can easily be killed at a moments notice if you act without thought, as you are required to fight through multiple segments of single [i]to the death[/i] combat to progress through the various levels\n\nBannerman is an ode to retro pixel games and medieval sword combat both of which the developer[i] (who solo developed this btw!)[/i] is an enthusiast for, you can even check out his entire development cycle on his youtube channel in documentary series\n\nthe art direction and style is quite pleasing, every kill strike feels very satisfying, as your are rewarded with gushings of blood and a nice crunch sound. The music can be hit and miss, while the bgm itself is quite good... and the ambient sfx along with wildlife and lively animations help to create that alive world feel, some areas are severely lacking in both music and ambiance\n\nBannerman also features several huge set pieces involving huge battles with dozens of soldiers and mounted cavalry charges complete with the sounds of warfare and a trebuchet , an animated trebuchet! cause everyone loves a trebuchet\n\nas with anything in life Bannerman is not perfect, it has a shortcut system that on occasion can cause you to backtrack through several sets of enemies, but given the core combat mechanics, you probably should be more patient when fighting, as rushing or being overly aggressive will to lead to your continued demise. Along with some rigidity in some of the animations that artificially inflate time spent in game, the turn animation looks good but is frustrating on accidental press given its long run time\n\nBannerman is relatively short, with around a half dozen hours or so of gameplay. Consisting of brutal, highly skilled combat mechanics matched with an aesthetically pleasing design theme that throws back to the 16 bit era of rotoscoped graphics\n\nI personally believe it is worth  the price...plus I have it on good authority that future content patches will bring endless replayability on top of the current story mode and even the possibility of local multiplayer!

It's not perfect, some of the timing feels a bit weird to pick up so there's a bit more muscle memorization than I'd like, but I definitely recommend it if you liked Nidhogg and don't mind a slower pace.\n\nThe second is Bannerman: Knight's Errand edition, where you walk throughout the land on your quest as the Bannerman. At times, this feels like a glorified walking simulator, and even though the developer added some skipping mechanisms, you'll still find yourself walking, walking, and walking. I don't recommend this game, it's a bit unpolished with things like all the game actions (entering doors, grabbing items) forcing you to turn right before they start (it's only a few extra frames, but when you're doing things for the 99th time, it adds to the frustration). Some of the levels DO show promise, it has a good atmosphere, it's just cut short by its own repetition.\n\nSince you get both games with this bundle, I do recommend it, but as a meta criticism of the bundle as a whole, you're expected to play both games included, so you do feel the flaws of the second game when trying to enjoy the first.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1505628984, "recommendationid": "35015466", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561197996228583", "last_played": 1505631070, "num_games_owned": 418}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505083823, "review": "Slow, checkpoints faaaar inbetween if killed takes way too much time to play", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482406", "timestamp_created": 1505083823, "recommendationid": "34872733", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197985605577", "last_played": 1505693874, "num_games_owned": 30}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 13}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 30, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 10, "total_positive": 25, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
