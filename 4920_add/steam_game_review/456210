{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1464512389, "review": "[This review was written on the original release: quite a few fixes have now been put in place by the developers in the time since then, and they've been good enough to comment below. Always a good sign :) ]\n\nRichard Morgan's a talented writer when he's not having to string a plot around pretty lightshows like Crysis 2 & 3 or that empty-headed Syndicate FPS (his Black Widow stories are darn good), so I was intrigued when this appeared on the storefront and figured at the price it would be worth a go. Generally preferring his sci-fi novels like the 'Altered Carbon' trilogy or 'Thirteen', I had read 'The Steel Remains', his first fantasy book and found it actually pretty good, like it was written by a nihilistic Michael Moorcock, though didn't get around to reading the following ones.\n\nSo this game takes place in the same world as 'The Steel Remains', and is a choose-your-own-adventure gamebook with three characters you play in turn in their own parts of the story. It makes reference to TSR's hero Ringil, but you're not playing him so it doesn't mess up the canon. You can adjust their attributes and skills in a character creation screen before the game starts, interestingly picking their sexual orientation as either homosexual or heterosexual. I've not got far enough at this point to see how/if that affects gameplay. Doesn't seem to affect combat :)\n\nThe story starts intriguingly, and the prose is vivid. However, it's riddled with stupid mistakes. \"You father\", \"a children have gone missing\", \"you suspects they are all fake\", \"your unable to make up your mind\", \"making his presence a cold and hard\", \"you have a clear view on their lips\". This is pretty inexcusable for a game that lives and breathes by the text, but if you're willing to overlook it, the story flows well and the characters are better drawn than much of the multi-million polygon NPCs in some AAA games who still have the depth of cardboard cutouts. Some things are silly: the shop screen told me \"You have 499 money\". Really? Couldn't you have at least written 'Florins', the gameworld's currency? Lazy. \n\nOh, and the 'Exit' button doesn't let you exit. You just go straight back to the main menu. There's plenty of sloppily-left in clues that this was originally a mobile game too: prompts to \"tap\" and \"rotate your device to landscape orientation\". Ahh modern gaming, what are you doing to us?\n\nSo why recommend it? Because as shotgunned as it is with the kind of errors you have no right to make once you leave school, the text has a pull and interest that should keep fans of darker fantasy engaged. I already want to know where the plot is heading, and what repercussions my decisions may have. I can overlook subliterate developers for that.\n\n(there's... morally questionable material here, admittedly. But nothing that'll shock you if you've ever watched Game Of Thrones)", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573172", "timestamp_created": 1462384138, "recommendationid": "22797792", "language": "english", "votes_up": 49, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198003059604", "last_played": 1462393004, "num_games_owned": 476}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 10}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1472419848, "review": "It's just too goddamn buggy. I'm trying to lockpick a door but the button doesn't work, so I have to bash it down. Except when it does bash down, all the buttons go away and all I can do is stare at the screen and quit the game.\n\nAs another character, I mistakenly went to buy mules before I bought equipment, which automatically used all my gold, so I couldn't buy any weapons or armor (if you buy equipment first you can still get the mules even if you don't have enough money). You don't seem to ever earn any gold again as this character, so several chapters later I couldn't make it through fights without dying unless I savescummed. I eventually ran into an unwinnable situaion where to advance I had to take 4 hitpoints of damage in an unavoidable story event, which was exactly as many hitpoints as I had, which meant I had to restart the whole game.\n\nAll my saves disappeared, and the game refuses to take my login information despite several resets and trying multiple accounts so I can never cloud save again.\n\nThey recently added local saves but I used too many I guess because now when I try to save the game hangs forever and I have to task kill it. There's no button or anything I can find to delete my unneeded bookmarks \n\nThe combat doesn't really work either. I made the mistake of putting all my points into Dex on the thief character and then picking a feat that gives 99 defense, because that seemed cool. Except that feat is ludicrous overkill because it turns out a typical high defense is in the 20s-30s or so, and because I hadn't put any points in strength that character could barely hit anything and when they did it was for tiny amounts of damage. And by the time I realized what I had done fights with this character would be fifteen minutes of whiffs as I slowly chipped things down, completely invulnerable thanks to my ludicrous defense feat. And I had to seek out fights if I wanted to ever raise my stats to not be so terrible (never happened, that character didn't get into enough combat to level before the game bugged out bashing down a door). I tried to buy better weapons as this character actually had money but the only shop I ran into I'm assuming was bugged because all I could do was enter and leave again. I can't fix the character without restarting the whole game again.\n\n\nI'm sorry if this jumped around and rambled, it's an entertaining dark fantasy story (that gets a bit edgelord at times) but I can't do this anymore", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512578", "timestamp_created": 1472419848, "recommendationid": "25216000", "language": "english", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561197964896205", "last_played": 1472420089, "num_games_owned": 590}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1466008569, "review": "Took a chance with this and I am OK with the game itself, but you have to log into a site to save the game with a 'bookmark'.  If you don't, and then enter fail state you must start story from beginning.  There is a note that a 3rd party account is required, but I mistakenly thought that would be for mulitplayer only.   Quitting the game preserves progress so you don't have to complete it in one sitting, which is something, I guess.  \n\nThe combat is very thin; the only real value here is the story which is told in 3 alternating parts.  You complete chapter 1 for each character and then cycle back to the first character.  Eventually, you will get to use the entire party, but I did not make it that far.  \n\nEdit:\n\nI am changing this from no to yes based on the developer response.  The story is interesting and I will pick it back up from where I left it.
