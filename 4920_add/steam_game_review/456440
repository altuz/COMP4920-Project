It gets to the point of frustration replacing enjoyment. The puzzles are not difficult in a mindbending way but rather a hair pulling way in that they require exteme quickness with your mouse and memorizing the layout while being timed on a very short clock. They are all doable but it is not what I would call a thinking mans puzzle type of game. As a diehard lover of puzzle/adventure games I really did not like this game. It may appeal to others but for me it didn't hack it. Blind faith can be costly at times. luckily for me it was only 4 bucks.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511933", "timestamp_created": 1461786204, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1462478171, "recommendationid": "22667627", "language": "english", "votes_up": 34, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "steamid": "76561198013274120", "last_played": 1461870735, "num_games_owned": 361}, "developer_response": "Hello, as the developer I am sorry for your frustration.
