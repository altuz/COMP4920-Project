These games were ment to be played with a joy stick, I have one but the game doesn't register it. I took a look in the configuration options and it can be changed to work on the mouse, but the controls are still terrible, \n\nIn Rebel Assault 1 you start off in a flight sequince, and it feels like the T16 is fighting back while you try to fly, good luck lasting thirty seconds here.\n\nRebel Assault 2 starts with a gunnery mission, not to hard. Then goes to a in-and-out-of-cover shooting gallery mission, and finally, another flight segment like the first game, again good luck.\n\nBoth games feel like they were made for an arcade and while they were something way back in the day, I think it would have been better if these stayed forgotten. If you have a really old joy stick laying around or if you are just nuts about the oldies, I can't stop you.

Released in 1993 and '95 respectively, the first title was Lucasarts' first CD-only release and one of the earliest titles on PC to use FMV cutscenes, which allowed it to have far more sophsiticated visuals then PCs of that era could otherwise have rendered. A lot of effort went into the feel of the games, using music and sounds effects lifted directly from the classic trilogy, and in the second game, Stormtrooper armor taken straight from Lucasfilm's prop library. Fans of other classic Lucasarts titles will notice things like the X-Wing's interior display looking much like the one from the X-Wing games, and the E-11 Blaster Rifle's first-person sprite being identical to the one from Dark Forces, creating an internal consistency that is sadly lacking in the Star Wars of today. \n\nHowever, the games were oft-criticized for their janky controls and today, the visuals do not hold up at all well, with poor resolution and lots of fuzzy pixels. Today's \"gamer\" probably would not enjoy either title, but if you're me, this bundle is well worth its sale price for the nostalgia factor alone. Featuring the vehicles and campy style that made us love the original films, the Rebel Assault series tells an alternate version of the Galactic Civil War, staring a daring rebel pilot known only as Rookie One. The first title allowed you to set One's gender, a rarity in games of the time, though in the sequel the character was always male. The levels switched up perspectives where possible, with some levels putting you in the cockpit of a ship aiming at incoming Tie Fighters, or with a chase cam dodging walls and obstacles, others putting Rookie One on foot battling Stomtroopers. The second game introduced the rarely-seen Tie Phantom, a cloak-capable specialist assault fighter that would reappear in a handful of later Star Wars media, such as the Forces of Corruption expansion to the Empire At War RTS, an element I wished they had used more often, and the idea of a \"Bermuda Triangle\" esque region of the Star Wars Galaxy called the Dreighton Nebula, apparently famous for stories of ghost ships, creating the perfect backdrop for the Empire to develop cloaking fighters.\n\nIn terms of this Steam release of the games, they are perfectly functional given that they are emulated through DOSBox, which is included in the download. They are playable using a mouse, joystick, or even an Xbox 360 controller if you are so inclined. I actually recommend the mouse at least in the case of the second game, which allows you to account for the overly-sensitive movement of the chase-cam levels with small mouse movements, because of this I only screwed up in one level involving a speeder bike run through a swampy area, due to the tight confines of the trees making it very easy to pin-ball your bike all over the place before you can properly react.\n\nIf you enjoy classic Star Wars and/or rail shooter games, the Rebel Assault series might be worth a look. However, you might find the Dark Forces or X-Wing games more to your liking.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509585", "timestamp_created": 1493838116, "recommendationid": "31529547", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 338, "steamid": "76561197970739339", "last_played": 1493836887, "num_games_owned": 391}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1496287143, "review": "Rebel Assault I - This is about as sad of a star wars game as it gets.
