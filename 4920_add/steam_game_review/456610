I bought all football games made for every console going back to the playstation, xbox and nintendo. Never, ever have i been as let down as i am today - by the so called footbal games.\n\nI say, stop playing, supporting and most importantly buying this bullcrap of a series - be it Fifa or PES.\nThey both suck major beehive, and will probably never change it for the better.\nFaaaak you Dr. Coporate!!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498940", "timestamp_created": 1504756010, "recommendationid": "34787619", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 5504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561198026377317", "last_played": 1506194432, "num_games_owned": 192}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505822903, "review": "dont buy on PC ,no update !!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496195", "timestamp_created": 1505822903, "recommendationid": "35063070", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 94, "num_reviews": 16, "steamid": "76561198382172004", "last_played": 1507023433, "num_games_owned": 24}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504595949, "review": "Not bad", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497296", "timestamp_created": 1504595949, "recommendationid": "34751372", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 4322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 297, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198114326187", "last_played": 1506859568, "num_games_owned": 4}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 8}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 476, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 227, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 249}}
