The core gameplay is totally solid and fun; this game deserves way more attention than it seems to have gotten here on steam. Cleared all levels and achievements in 17 hours, and now I'm wishing there was more of it! So that's the only downside: replay value is a bit low, although it's still fun. You can work on improving your times, though your best time is sadly not tracked in-game. Also, getting a gold medal is usually a bit too easy, though some levels require you to plan carefully and try several times.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1476126917, "recommendationid": "25971214", "language": "english", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561198019920546", "last_played": 1476126696, "num_games_owned": 222}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
