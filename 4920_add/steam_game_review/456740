I've only got as far as the second zone so far and the puzzles are mind-bendingly great. The voice acting, music and style set the tone of a TV show and it works very well. I'd have loved to see an enslaved audience in the background forced to laugh and clap at the appropriate points to really complete the setting.\n\nIt's a unique concept and has me re-thinking some of the puzzle designs in my own games!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "timestamp_created": 1501447908, "recommendationid": "33913795", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198046072572", "last_played": 1501447515, "num_games_owned": 131}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
