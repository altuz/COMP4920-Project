I greatly like the sound of this game with online multiplayer as this is the only limiting factor of this game in my opinion. I personally have friends i have come over or i bring my laptop and plugin ps4 & xbox one controllers into the pc then hdmi it out to a big screen when i go to friends places, This game is fun dont get me wrong, just it currently in its state demands you take extra steps like i have to have a multiplayer experience.\n\nAs for the gameplay..\n\nPros:\n\n- Fun (for just $10? cant beat it)\n- Graphics are easy on the eyes, its a \"Unique\" mech genre (Remember that mech game on toonami on web browser called Lockdown? Greatly reminds me of this game minus the turn based and more real time this time)\n- Reminds me of bullet storm in its own respects\n- Has a unique and interesting storyline\n- Small install size (only 103-104mb =0 )\n- Upgrading system, and in solo game-mode you have a AI partner corby + bots you pickup in the 4th stage and onwards\n- Online based multiplayer on Steam build is out! (Its in beta though, will update review when more information about how stable it is is available, what is known though, is that multiplayer is story mode capable, draw backs are can't start a match in MP till after a player joins, and no drop in/drop out support in a game, \"Yet\")\n- Soundtrack is now purchaseable!! Check out the news! ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/456830/allnews/ )\n\nCons:\n\n- AI support bots you summon when they die they disappear, taking along with them the upgrade points you invested in\n- A tad bit of a hassle with out proper button mapping but its okay for on pc default button mapping (I personally switch between my dualshock 3, dualshock 4, xbox 360 and xbox one controller though to thwart this issue)", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530886", "timestamp_created": 1471555497, "recommendationid": "25000465", "language": "english", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561198004313383", "last_played": 1471797610, "num_games_owned": 291}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1467556414, "review": "I really enjoy this game.

My interest was in the single-player storyline. And I enjoyed playing it. I divided my skill points between me and my ai companion corby.\n\nThe only problem I had with the storyline was when I got to the last couple levels of the game. The game decided to have the enemies infinitely spawn in some areas. Up until that point I had enjoyed thoroughly clearing out the levels, collecting the crates, and reading the story messages. But when I got near the end, the enemies seemed to never stop spawning. I started to lose my desire to fight, and started just running past all the enemies. I looked this game up on youtube, and I discovered that I had actually quite playing on the last level.\n\nBut up until that point, I had fun. I'm sure there are people out there that enjoy being under non-stop assault.

Lovely hand crafted stylish art that all works together beautifully. The top-down look brings me back to the Amiga days but with a much more modern look that takes advantage of modern computers. Personally I don't have much experience with game play in the genre so I can't give too much helpful feedback on difficulty or progression. I first played arcade mode and it felt like the pace and increase in difficulty was well thought through not engaging the player in too long sessions so it's fun to chase new highscores. I only had time to quickly try story mode so I'm looking forward to play further into the story as soon as time allows. I was playing with mouse and keyboard but I think I'll have to bring back my controller that my friend has borrowed so I can test it out with dual stick =)", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506551", "timestamp_created": 1464547773, "recommendationid": "23278250", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197972575421", "last_played": 1464562619, "num_games_owned": 53}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1474212925, "review": "I think this game is a good local coop game not sure how it is online yet as that is still in beta. You can level up your bot by collecting the green gems also you can level up teammates also instead of just leveling up yourself. The game has a local versus mode and it also has a horde style arcade mode. The main reason I bought this game is becuase it has a demo and I tried the demo with my 6 year old and he seemed to like it.

However, Dual Core is just a really fun time.  Good story line attached to nearly continuous action, a bit of a puzzle here and there and a variety of challenges.   The graphics are exceptional.  At first, I found it a bit awkward to quickly shift in the various weapons using the hand controller, but I think that's a personal problem. A hardcore enthusiast might plow through much of this game in a few intense hours, but for the rest of us, Dual Core provides a lot of hours of just plain fun exploring the site while banging away at evil robots with lots of inventive weapons.
