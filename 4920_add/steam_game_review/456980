If anything, the puzzles are a little too easy if you're a veteran at minigames.\n\nThere is nothing that stands out about the sound quality, but there is no voice work which is a little bit of a turn-off with so many games nowadays having voice acting.\n\nPlot is formulaic but not terribly so.\n\nThe major thing I'd want people to know about this is that despite the screenshots looking like your basic HO genre game, there's a reason why it's not tagged that way.  There is not a HO aspect to this game at all.  Essentially it's a point-and-click game with puzzles, wearing the user interface of a hidden-object game.\n\nMy biggest complaint would be the playtime; I finished the entire game in about 90 minutes and there is no bonus content or achievements (or any other extras or frills) that would induce me to play it again.  It is definitely NOT worth the full price due to the short playtime and lack of complexity.\n\nHowever, if you can grab it on sale, it's not a terrible purchase if you take into account the things mentioned above,  You're not going to get a really top-of-the-line game, but there are certainly worse options, especially if you (like myself) have practically exhausted your supply of similar games.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526524", "timestamp_created": 1465690534, "recommendationid": "23511636", "language": "english", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "steamid": "76561198035785835", "last_played": 1465692815, "num_games_owned": 987}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 3}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1483164452, "review": "Honestly, I cannot recommend this game.\n\nThe puzzle mechanics are clunky, you don't even use one of the \"rooms\" to beat the game (it's like they forgot to finish adding in a puzzle), some of the grammar of the dialogue is off, and overall was not a particularly satisfying game. Not a particularly logic heavy puzzler.\nOne of the puzzles at the end of the game is straight up guess work. As far as I can tell, there isn't any real logic to it, you just have to guess. (Also, the pitch order of the xylophones is completely reversed, and kinda bothered the crud out of me.)\nOn top of it all, the game is short for the price. I took a dinner break while playing, so my actual play time is closer to 1.5 hours.\n\nThe graphics ARE really pretty, and they included a mechanic where the map will have a check mark for when you have completed that portion of the map (keeps you from needlessly revisiting locations). Nice features that I wish were in all puzzle games, but nothing that saves the game.\n\nThis game feels like the makers didn't polish or fine tune the game. If it is on a good sale and you have a craving for point and click that you need satisfied, sure, get this game.

It's dull, the pacing makes no sense (\"My son is missing! I know where he is! So let me just spend potentially HOURS solving this out-of-the-blue number sequence puzzle I have no reason to believe is in any way related to his mysterious disappearance rather than smashing in the window and chasing after my missing son!\"), the puzzles are EXTREMELY tedious, and for the first time EVER in any of their games I found myself skipping puzzles just to get through the dang thing.
