The game involves several innovations (for its time), such as:\n\nCover: infantry take less damage in these areas\nRequisition and strategic points: resource gathering does not involve mining, hooray!, and\nMorale: A squad with high morale can continue fighting at full health for ages, whilst a squad with low morale would \u2018break\u2019 and scatter\nI thought the Campaign was actually a real gem. The story was interesting and the characters surprisingly deep for a RTS game. I enjoyed the twists and the clever way in which the player could play against the three other races through the storyline. Props go to the voice actors for the Chaos Lord Bale (hilariously evil) and Sorcerer Sindri (devious and manipulating both friends and enemies). I also thought some of the missions were incredibly fulfilling.\n\nThe game itself was pretty much exactly how I imagined a Warhammer 40k game to be. The Space Marines were suitably heroic, the Chaos Space Marines were like dark reflections of their Loyalist Brothers, the Orks were brutal and all about numbers, and the Eldar were suitably mysterious and difficult to pin down.\n\nStandout units included:\n\nThe Dreadnought, which can smash infantry out of the way, or even impale them on its arm and execute it brutally by spinning them around and flinging them away.\nThe Whirlwind, which I used to hold a Control Point from multiple points of ingress. Their huge range and infantry-scattering abilities meant I could break enemy charges from afar.\nThe Chaos Obliterator, which trumps even the Terminator as the ultimate heavy infantry. Those lascannons!\n\nThis game is awesome in both Campaign and Skirmish mode. Play it!\n\nFirst posted: https://yshw40.quora.com/Warhammer-40-000-Dawn-of-War-Game-of-the-Year-Edition?srid=2XhG"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505173738, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34892207", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198365082128", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505177733, "num_games_owned": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 74}, "timestamp_updated": 1505173738, "received_for_free": false, "review": "i havnt had much experience with warhammer in general but as a rts fan i absolutely love this game and it it has quickly became one of my favourite rts games i have played only issue i have is the false labeling calling it game of the year editon when it doesn't come with any of its dlc just 8 multiplayer maps which i doubt i will even play would still recommend it though"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505587103, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35004208", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198271099681", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506112248, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "playtime_forever": 825}, "timestamp_updated": 1505587103, "received_for_free": false, "review": "No words are enough to describe the Glory of the Mother of all Games."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506353653, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35205073", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198042144975", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1480731827, "num_games_owned": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 762}, "timestamp_updated": 1506353653, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Still one of the best strategy game out there."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506379742, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35211931", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197983134780", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1503243882, "num_games_owned": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 499}, "timestamp_updated": 1506379742, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Excellent game and series.
