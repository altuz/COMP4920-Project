I'll make it short because much of it has already been said.  \nI'll add that the day night cycles suck.  Once it hits night you pretty much can't do anything because it's so dark.  Early in the game this means sitting around waiting for dawn.  \nAlso, you slowly die over time regardless of whether you eat/drink or not.  Not sure what's going on but it's just not fun at this point.  That's my two cents, buy at your own risk.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513898", "timestamp_created": 1501363312, "recommendationid": "33890480", "language": "english", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561197985869162", "last_played": 1501363001, "num_games_owned": 114}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501178958, "review": "What could've been some \"minecraft modpack standalone kinda game\" with farming, building, processing ressources, turned out to be a pathetic update lacking, \"bad russian dev\" stereotype kinda game. \nUpdates just aren't updates. Just look at the ducking patch notes (for real just look) and feel how professionally this game was made (sarcasm) . \nThey don't care, they're just in for the $$. Devs don't even answer poor guys in the forum or not accurately, because guess what, their english is worst than mine. (I'm french for god's sake)\nThis game kinda pissed me off, cuz i'm a simple survival game player, i don't need outsanding content on day one, i understrand what early access is all about, i need a stable solid base (Which the game kinda had on day one). \nEmpyrion did that for example. Unturned did that > For those saying that this may be some one man dev and that he may have a hard time. \nI liked the game on day one. But it ducking hasn't changed at all. It's still the same ducking experience you do. Having fun with 15 machines growing ducking bananas and you're done, no automation, no shit. Nothing whatsoever. Sure building is fun, go ducking buy minecraft okay? \nIf there's one thing i hate it's when devs actually don't give a fuck about people that enjoy their game. \"IllusoryWorldEntertainment\" Yeah, that's all in the name, Illusory updates, illusory bugfixes, illusory changes. It's all a ducking troll. This game shouldn't have \"Mostly Positive\" reviews, it should get a ton of sh*t in the face, because when these guys are actually getting unnoticed, some people actually struggle to make a game and are getting shit reviews. \nThis shouldn't exist, this shouldn't be, Steam shouldn't let such guys sell products they don't even update. I mean sure it's 10$ or 6$ on sale, but after a year of developpement we're pretty much on day one developpement stage. Shame on them. So please everyone, don't buy this game, don't rate it positively, just don't give a fuck until some update that's actually greater than 10mb comes out, with real content and not ducked up glitched content, where you get (rather try to get) to a dungeon and fall through the world and then your whole world is ducked and feels like you're in another dimension.\n I liked this game, i hoped it would've updated nicely even if it's kinda slow, i wouldn't have cared. I even thought to myself (on day one) that even if it looked a bit shitty, i'm sure they'll get new mechanics in, new machines, planets, stuff to actually DO in the game without it fucking glitching on you. But guess what, if i'm writing this today, you can understand all that didn't happen. So please, just let StarsOne die. \nIt's never gonna become anything, do not hope. The game is still a \"fun\" way to kill time if you don't pay for it, but yeah, you'll get 10-30 hours of gameplay like me and then you'll see how empty it is, and that the game never really changed in any way. \nEven with a multiplayer it would be empty since there's nothing to do besides farming and bulding, so if you want to build a map sized castle with a chest full of every type of ressources and 10km of banana trees then feel free to do it, but man, there's gotta be other games to do that same shit that are actually good. Hope this review will actually prevent some people from buying the game.
