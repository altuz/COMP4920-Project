The story is decent enough and the protagonist is played by famous South Korean actor Lee Byung-hun from the movies A bittersweet Life and The Magificent seven.\nThe controls are a little weird in the way that a lot of Japanese games tend to be but don't take long to get used to.\nI played the hell out of the multiplayer back on the Xbox 360 but i've never been able to find a match on this version which is a shame because it was a blast.\nThe sequel is great too but avoid Lost Planet 3, it's dog shit."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503189647, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501085", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34362354", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198003686440", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1503188495, "num_games_owned": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 343}, "timestamp_updated": 1503189647, "received_for_free": false, "review": "We'll get this out of the way first: this game is a shit port.  Cutscene audio desyncs like crazy, options are limited and silly, it has Games for Windows Live because they never bothered to strip it out, etc.\n\nThat having been said, it's a decent game.  It has a lot of warts from being an old game - objectives are sometimes unclear, you can get stunlocked to death, and enemies do stupid amounts of damage at times - but damn if there isn't something fun about fighting giant space bugs and mechas.  The game is short (5 hours is all I needed to clear it) but what's there is entertaining and I don't feel that I wasted my 5 dollars.  \n\nHas some replayability in the form of a medal hunt thing you can do.  The final boss is stupid and probably the worst one in the game given that it's little more than a tedious slog of waiting for an opening, getting a quick shot in, and waiting for the next one (all while dodging attacks that can kill you in a short time).  Story is nonsensical and underdeveloped but then again, it's an old game so I can forgive it somewhat.\n\nBuy when it's < 5 bucks, pass if not."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503198546, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34364163", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178877975", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1503252172, "num_games_owned": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 128}, "timestamp_updated": 1503198546, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Kaiju Busters in good.

Not because GFWL doesn't work but because people are too annoyed/lazy/uninformed on the fact that GFWL still works it just needs a little effort to get up and running. People still love and play this game, but not as much as I'd like. There is also the region locked gameplay. That isn't very fun (aside from not dealing with Chinese and Slavic hackers. I can deal with the South American ones cause they usually aren't very toxic about it they just want to win but the Chinese and Slavic ones go above and beyond to harrass and upset you).\n\nANYWAYS, I want more people to play with all over the world. I want this game to be rejuvanated by an influx of players due to the addition of Steamworks. The ONLY reason Capcom has not ported it over yet is due to the port taking time and effort to establish. Time and effort must be paid for and to them there is no good reason. Maybe if we review bomb this they'll fix it? I mean Namco Bandai fixed the GFWL issue with Dark Souls 1. People still love this game Capcom they want to play/purchase it but they don't want the hassle of getting GFWL to work properly. Maybe also release the source code like Raven Software did with the Jedi Knight series. They released enough source code to allow modders to have fun and make cool content but not enough that people would have the game without purchasing it. Imagine, a thriving modding scene pulling in more sales and attention to your company. We get player made maps and\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665while you get good publicity and money in your pockets.
