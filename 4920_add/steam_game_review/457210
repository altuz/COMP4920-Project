{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504626608, "review": "SEUM is one of those weird games where almost everything when horribly horribly right. Essentially Super Meatboy meets Metalocalypse, SEUM (briefly) tells the story of a Marty, a metal fan, who cut off Satan's hand, duct-taped it to his own arm, and descends into the depths of hell. \n\nThe game is just plain fun. That's what it is. It's fun. The game's description warns that you'll lean toward your screen as you play and its totally true. You'll tense up, feel the rush of hot air, and immerse yourself into the heavy metal landscape. \n\nSimilar to Super Meatboy, SEUM initially gives levels that show you the ropes before testing your skills. However, where Super Meatboy continued to introduce new concepts and challenges into the late game, SEUM has a comparatively limited toolbox.This makes the late game of SEUM into a puzzle platformer with an emphasis on speed. You solve the puzzles first, then come up with the fastest way to do it. While not especially unique (Quantum Conundrum did it), the game has a great simulated movement that puts you right in the moment. \n\nSpeaking of speed, I really appreciate how the game handles competitive speedrunning. Every run you make is logged into the system. Once you beat the \"Uber\" time, you can instantly see how the best people in the world run it. The great thing is that many levels have a second secertish way of solving puzzles, but the majority of levels can just barley be solved using the standard route if you have enough dexterity, training, and time. \n\nAs for art design, the soundtrack is complementary and makes the game seem faster than it really is. Satan and Marty talk to each other from level to level and have some fun quips. The devil hand looks awesome and has fingernails made of stone. The backgrounds of hell are kind of hit or miss. \nYou have 3 main regions: Generic lava landscape, dark green pit of bubbling acid with giant cheesy skeletons in cages hanging from the ceiling, and what I can only describe as Dethklok's wet dream. While the first and last areas are mostly fun to look at, the green pit isn't appealing to the eye and doesn't invoke images of hell. Additionally, there's really nothing to look at in the background. No tortured souls, no demons, etc. There's not a single full character model in the entire game. The last level in the story has you fighting Satan in one of the most anti-climactic ways possible. I really would have liked to see a Super Meatboy-esque race between Marty and Satan rather than another 90 second puzzle level. \n\nStill, that small gripe with art direction aside, I found SEUM to be an addictive and relaxing experience. An arcade game you can play for 5 minutes or 5 hours and hardly tell the difference.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515825", "timestamp_created": 1504626608, "recommendationid": "34759233", "language": "english", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "steamid": "76561198009079522", "last_played": 1504926211, "num_games_owned": 175}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507088604, "review": "So addicting, fun to grind levels, and the game is over amazing.
