This is it. The first game I've had to give a thumbs down. It's also the first game I asked for a refund over. \n\nIs Dark Void Zero the worst game I've ever played? No. But it's also not very fun. Which is a shame because it has all the components for a good game: colorful graphics, action platforming, and a cool sci-fi theme. But the problem is that none of those things are done particularly well. Dark Void Zero tries to bank on its retro-for-retro's-sake aesthetic without actually delivering a solid experience like the games it hearkens back to.\n\nThe gameplay of Dark Void Zero boils down to navigating large, maze-like levels with the aid of a jetpack. You shoot enemies and dodge obstacles. There are level objectives thrown in, like hitting a switch or finding an item. And the game is short, too, only having three levels to play through.\n\nSo what's wrong with it all? To begin with, the graphics, while bright, do not look good. Take a step back and compare a game like Batman: Return of the Joker to Cybernoid. One looks much better than the other. Now take a step forward and compare a game like Axiom Verge or Odallus to Dark Void Zero. When the ability to make gorgeous pixel graphics is as accessible as it is today, there's no reason for Dark Void Zero to look this bad.\n\nMoving on, the controls suck. 8-way navigating should not be frustrating. In Dark Void Zero it is. It doesn't help that the level design, instead of being open and wide, is tight and cramped. The freedom of zooming about, shooting bad guys is replaced with being corralled around narrow corridors and shafts. What makes that even worse is that oftentimes any powerups you might have found (which are more difficult to get than they're worth) are taken away from you to which you're then forced to use another, more inferior weapon for a portion of the map.\n\nWhy give me the freedom to explore when you take away the fruits of my labor? That would be like playing the original Zelda, and after working hard to find all of the extra Hearts and the Magic Sword and the Red Ring, walking through a door only to be reduced to four Hearts and the Wooden Sword. Why? Why give me the option of finding secrets that only aid me in finding secrets that in turn don't help me in completing the stage?\n\nI've seen a few people laud this game for its classic NES style. As an avid collector, I can say right now that if this game was released back in the day it would be about $5 in a bargain bin, even with todays price inflations. \"Retro\" does not excuse a bad game. You want a good \"retro\" NES game? Play Shatterhand. Or Vice. Or Ninja Gaiden III. Or Batman. I could keep going, but my point stands: 8 bit graphics and sound do not excuse a bad game.\n\nPoor game design like that is what held this game back. Poor game design, along with its poor controls and poor level design, make this game too difficult for the wrong reasons. I find this very similar to the original Dark Void: full of potential, but flying just short of quality."}]}
