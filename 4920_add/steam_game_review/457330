All of them have the same thing in common. 0.1 hours played. \n\nHigh Octane Drift is very fun and easy to get a handle on. It definetly is not like any real drifting, but that is almost the beauty of it. It's a new mechanic to learn and it's fun to practice it and get better. \n\nThe customization of cars is awesome. There are not as many cars as I would like, but it's still in development. Modifications are very good. There are many different options with pros and cons on each part. I would like to see more body kits and exterior modifications, but again, I still have hope for the future. \n\nWhen first starting there is a tuorial of some sort... For me it was buggy and not helpful at all. I did resort to asking other people online (Mostly everyone online is pretty cool too) about things and using Google. After playing and messing with things on my own, it came along pretty quickly. \n\nMicrotransactions are 100% not needed and not intrusive at all. You do get an edge by paying real money, but name a game that you dont get an edge by paying. \n\nThere is also a mechanic where you must repair your vehicle, buy tires, buy fuel, etc. At first I was very turned off by this, but it is not bad at all. \n\nOverall High Octane Drift needs some work to be better, but being in open development means they will gradually improve! I'd definetly say play this game and spend at least 30 minutes in it", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517028", "timestamp_created": 1485387589, "recommendationid": "29492108",

does have potential but as of now its not really worth it, yes it is free but it has many problems. problem 1 the physics are terrible  and i mean terrible sometimes you just slide through things. problem 2 the backround is horible to look at bcause it doesnt move a the same pace your car does and btw motion blur doesnt solven this. problem 3 the fact you have to wait to repair your car repairing your car should be instant and free not timed like a mobile game. problem 4 the video settings screen is lacking, there is no fxaa nob,no mxaa, basically no antiallaising switches at all. nuow heres one thing that is reedeming about this game, it is genuinly fun to go into servers and drift, but that its for the pros. i do think this game has potential but it needs to inprove\n",
