It has a good potion of humor though.\n\nHowever, VR vise, the game is well worth every penny!\nThere is so many VR mechnics built in every level, you constantly get to try out new things and have to figure out how to solve the little puzzles.\n\nIt's a little like a tech demo, a sales pitch. It goes through many mechanics, you constantly learn to use them more and combine what you learned and then you reach the end.\n\nIt's not that long.\nBut it does it all so much better than many other VR \"games\" I've tried, at a very reasonable price!\n\nAnd I hope to see some of the mechanics this game tries out in future games as well.\nLike phyiscally walking down a narrow path and not touching the edges for example. That just doesn't feel the same sitting in front of a monitor!\n\nTotally recommended to try out!", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1501430463, "recommendationid": "33908046", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561197970577430", "last_played": 1502531773, "num_games_owned": 169}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 31, "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 27, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
