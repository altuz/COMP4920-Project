The gameplay is miles ahead of the first game, between the much larger world with much more activities, and the core mechanics of the game being based around making combination weapons and vehicles to gain PP from using special weapons to kill - versus taking photographs and getting the occasional extra points based on standard weapons or melee kills, in the first game. While the graphics are better in some ways than the original, the texture quality is also worse. That seems to be the weird case in 3 as well - the graphics overall are better, but the texture quality is muddied by crappy Instagram-inspired post processing like desaturation and constant solar flares, for some examples.\n\nCompared to Frank and Nick, one of which is kind of a jackass and the other is a doormat, Chuck was the only protagonist in the series who felt relatable, too. \n\nOther than that, Dead Rising 2 isn't that much better than 1 or 3, but I feel it slightly edges them out by a few percent, despite having most of the same weapons as the third game. For example, the blam bow in DR3 is kind of disappointing, although it was cool they changed it up with fireworks instead of dynamite. \n\nOne thing's for sure though - if you want to mindlessly slaughter hordes of zombies, you're better off with 3, as the maintenance tunnels and plazas of DR2 won't offer the gigantic crowds to get you up to 100,000 kills quickly. Not to mention DR2 is still unstable and abandoned, and they never released Case Zero on PC. The game will also crash if you kill too many zombies at once, how awesome!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504822119, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34803478", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198043728918", "num_reviews": 101, "last_played": 1505964186, "num_games_owned": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1924}, "timestamp_updated": 1504831566, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1]Improved formula; now with co-op[/h1]\n\nDead Rising 1 was a cool little game around the time it was released that displayed what's possible with improved processing power and an overall hardware boost. At its core the game was about escorting survivors to safety and completing missions within alloted time in a mall playground where pretty much everything could be used as a weapon. \n\nDead Rising 2 is the type of follow-up that doesn't rock the boat too much and adds incrementally to the formula. Now rather than just a sandbox with a large amount of weapons, you can participate in various activities throughout Fortune City.  Most are slots, gambling, and various related games. It's fine if you like wasting time, but I've never been a fan of mini-games, and there is no time to waste. As stated in my Dead Rising 1 review, you have a sandbox playground predicated on timed missions leaving little room to mess around in unless you're aiming for the bad ending or doing a subsequent playthrough.\n\nGranted, there's not a lot to do anyway other than slots and other gambling related activities. Most of the interaction is in picking up different weapons and killing zombies, which means there's a lot to see and kill but nothing beyond that. The real fun and reward is in time management and juggling optional survivors with finishing the mainline quests in time.\n\nNew to the series is the ability to create new weapons by mixing two together; albeit with the restriction that you must obtain the card for the recipe first. Meaning that you can't get creative; you can only mix and form what the developers have allowed. It's a fine feature but, like the gambling and slots, it just gets a shrug from me. It's a nice addition but nothing amazing.\n\nNew to the series is the addition of co-op. I tried it out a bit; it was *alright*. It's just another hand to help you complete the game, but as most of the game is escort missions its really just a lot of walking around. The person I played it with didn't find it enjoyable, and I can understand why. In my view its not a \"co-op experience\", its more like co-op in Sonic 2: something included that doesn't really add anything or do much other than fulfill an obligatory game mode. I'm not saying its bad, I'm just saying it doesn't add anything or do much other than make the game easier. It's not a \"co op game\"; one that you buy specifically for the co-op. It's more an aside; and as an aside it does its job fine, but it will make the game easier so do take note of that.\n\nWorth noting is how much better the survivor AI is. My god is it better. They won't get stuck in every horde and...its just night and day. You don't have to desperately clear waves of zombies in front of you lest the survivors get stuck. It *does* make things a bit easier but, man, if its this or DR1 pathing of some of the survivors this everyday please.\n\nLike Disgaea 2 or Crazy Taxi 2 its more of the same; if you enjoyed the previous title you'll enjoy this one. And there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nWorth noting is this ridiculous \"zombie rights activists\" subplot introduced early on and then abandoned.

The co-op is good and can grant you a lot of fun either doing the campaign or just killing a lot of zombies. Looking for zombrex can be a little tough, but once you get the locations it get's easier to deal with the missions, which is a shame that cannot be delayed to roam around.
