I'm sure there are others who love it, but I just don't.\n\nI feel like this game is a lot of wasted potential. It was a fun idea, running through a maze of traps and monsters with an announcer. I guess I was kind of hoping that it would be like Professor Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax from Saints Row.\n\nI was really let down. The game is incredibly repetitive, does a poor job of explaining anything, and feels unfinished. Not to mention, it has really long loading screens(even on an SSD!!) with no progress bar so you end feeling like you're being trolled by the game with a giant WATCH THIS loading screen that sits there for up to two minutes making you think the game has frozen.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503216", "timestamp_created": 1501944390, "recommendationid": "34039660", "language": "english", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "steamid": "76561197997678124", "last_played": 1501870280, "num_games_owned": 911}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503921602, "review": "So fucking bad", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498560", "timestamp_created": 1503921602, "recommendationid": "34551039", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198073081524", "last_played": 1503921488, "num_games_owned": 151}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 121, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 79, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 42}}
