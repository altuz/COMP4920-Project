There's no achievements associated with the last two levels, though.  \n\nPros/Cons:\n+ Surprisingly good controls.  Mouse wheel is for rotation.  WASD moves the camera.  Space/shift raises and lowers.  It's all very fluid.  \n+ Oddly satisfying gameplay.  There's nothing quite like toppling over a line of dominoes without having to pick them back up.\n+ Unlockable patterns for the dominoes.\n+ Free play mode.\n+ Fun mechanics (ramps, balls, etc.)\n+ The domino limit per each level is rather lenient, allowing for a casual challenge.  \n\n- I experienced some issues with the framerate dropping every so often-- not enough to discourage me from playing, but still annoying.\n- Sometimes the physics were a little janky.  For example, I'd fail a level then retry(with no changes) and somehow win.  \n- Restarting a level after a failed attempt would sometimes leave a stray domino that I'd deleted earlier.\n- Some levels seemed entirely based on luck.  \n- You cannot stack dominoes.\n\nOverall:\nDomino Sky was surprisingly fun.  For $3.99, I got ~3 hours of gameplay out of it.  It's not a bad priced given that I did not mess around too much with the free play mode.  Physics puzzlers are always a blast-- especially when the levels are so satisfying to figure out and complete.  Though my troubles with stutters and overall jankiness was frustrating, they didn't quite hinder my enjoyment of this game.  I liked this one.

The most fun part of this game is the fact that you get a quite good simulater of domino physics. The problem is, there isn't much depth the game can add to those physics, and so if they aren't constantly adding new mechanics to the game the levels feel repetitive are are a bit too easy. Also the controls were a bit clunky.\n\nI enjoyed it for a good 20 minutes, but it's really hard to make knocking down long chains of dominoes interesting after you've done it 5 or 6 times, although if you do enjoy that process of planning out your domino trains there's certainly plenty of levels for you to enjoy.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502491", "timestamp_created": 1500852358, "recommendationid": "33755116", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "steamid": "76561198069852998", "last_played": 1500852091, "num_games_owned": 357}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503519805, "review": "If you have a coupon for this game get it.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1503519805, "recommendationid": "34446076", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198168548740", "last_played": 1501457735, "num_games_owned": 48}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1503955222, "review": "This game made me break my cup.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1503955222, "recommendationid": "34562469", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198268598087", "last_played": 1504012199, "num_games_owned": 15}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1501649500, "review": "i like domino", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488235", "timestamp_created": 1501649500, "recommendationid": "33963760", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "steamid": "76561198289207953", "last_played": 1501319187, "num_games_owned": 84}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 58, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 49, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 9}}
