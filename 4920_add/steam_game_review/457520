The smooth and simple platforming mechanics carry right over from Amatniek's previous game, There was a Caveman: with limited controls including movement and jumping, and bouncing off walls being about the most complex these moustaches get. \n\nAs a tiny (but burly) man with a moustache, you platform your way up 15 single-screen levels with increasing difficulty and traps. Heaps of bloody spikes, player-activated arrow traps, shifting blades and narrow platforming -- your goal is simply to make it to the right side of each screen without losing three lives.\n\nA single, successful game should only take between three and five minutes, but it'll likely take up to an hour to get there the first time. To keep things interesting, each screen is pulled randomly from a handful of options (except level 11, which always seems to be the same).\n\nAs with Nauris' other solo projects, the music is the dreariest boops and bops of anti-music, easily making it the game's weakest aspect.\n\nMoustache Mountain doesn't come with much, but it's a fun project easily worth the measly price tag it carries. I also recommend following the developer on Twitter / Patreon (@namatnieks), where he actively creates gorgeous pixel art and tutorials. :)~", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508754", "timestamp_created": 1499618606, "recommendationid": "33408876", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 115, "steamid": "76561197970801416", "last_played": 1499588953, "num_games_owned": 1403}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 39, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 26, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 13}}
