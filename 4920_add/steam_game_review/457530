Now, to be fair, I wasn't expecting much; 99 cents, independent game, whatever. I figured it'd be worth a shot.\n\nHoo boy. So we'll start with the pros. It's cute! The art is nice for ambiguity on all the characters apppearances, giving an air of inserting ones own ideas as to how everyone looks. And I like the naming system, as silly as that is. I used my partner;s middle name, as well as mine for the title characters. The voice acting was well done. Michela Laws is on my subscribed list on YouTube, so she was the main reason I bought the game.\n\nUnfortunately, the cons far out-rank the pros. I'm disappointed with the dialogue. Yes, the game is short, but there are better uses of speech and exposition that could have been alloted for this story. Length is not an issue for me; substance is. I've read better in penny-romance novels from the dollar store. The whole chess element is odd, and not gone into enough. It was confusing to add, and since it was only for the storyline choices, it honestly made no sense with the in-game situations. The endings themselves were predictable, the characters lackluster and generally unappealing across the board. My biggest issue, though? That there are MULTIPLE dialogue/character choices that ultimately DO. NOTHING.  and automatically send you towards the worst ending. No real indicators of which choices will change your path or not. And while I get that the mechanic is more or less the point of the choices, I technically had this game beaten in 45 minutes; I spent an annoyingly long time into finding the 'correct' answers.\n\nAll-in-all, this game was unfortuantely not worth the pennies I spent on it. I applaud the attempt, but would recommend refining the text and options for another venture into gaming novellas such as this. 1/5 stars.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1501723671, "recommendationid": "33982877", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198055885620", "last_played": 1501722716, "num_games_owned": 53}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 70, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 57, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 13}}
