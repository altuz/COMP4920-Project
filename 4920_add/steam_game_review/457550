There are a few steam settings that need to be changed to run games without closing Bigscreen, and some games will need to be in Borderless Window.\n\nThe tech is very impressive but I would have liked a bit more focus on privacy. Once a room is joined, the default setting is to immediately start streaming your desktop. Also, the Vive microphone was active by default. There didn't appear to be an easy way to mute that didn't involving aiming a laser pointer at a virtual screen. Regardless of these issues, it is an excellent VR desktop and chatroom with a good UI.
