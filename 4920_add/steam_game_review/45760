Once you get the hang of it, you will have one hell of  a time with this game. There is so much content ranging from chracters, color swaps, stages, taunts, the arcade mode, online tournaemnets, ranked battles, and much much more. I can personally say that after playing this, I have learned a few things and you might too. In conclusion, if you were on the fence about this, don't be. This is a fantastic fighting game that I can assure that you will love it. This game also has the added plus of being better than Street Fighter V."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504593670, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496116", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34750963", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198044917795", "num_reviews": 78, "last_played": 1495399462, "num_games_owned": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 13981}, "timestamp_updated": 1504593670, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Last decent Street Fighter title. At least until SFV is completed, but who knows if that will ever happen. \n\nLarge cast of characters, great homage to older games in the series. Solid gameplay that SF games are known for.
