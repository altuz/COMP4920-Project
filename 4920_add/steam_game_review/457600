{"reviews": [{"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506444360, "review": "An enjoyable game.  It features some throw backs to old zombie games with resource management.  It also comes with an isometric shooter, where you aim your cursor over the undead hordes that come down on you.  You are also able to have quite a skill tree to pick from when you are upgrading your weapons, and abilities.  One draw back to the combat system is that it's repetitive, but that is to be expected with most isometric shooters that are fixated in one position.  It's definitely not enough of a draw back to not play this game.\n\nIf you like a nice throwback to older zombie games, and are a fan of base defense shooters, you will like this game. $7.99 isn't a bad price for the game, but I know you should be able to pick it up on sale also.  I'd at least make it to your wishlist until it hits a sale.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520814", "timestamp_created": 1506444360, "recommendationid": "35225537", "language": "english", "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "steamid": "76561198006794681", "last_played": 1500972659, "num_games_owned": 1080}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506426220, "review": "Well i got this game on a whim and i haven't regret it yet, sure this game has a few issues with crashing and sometimes glitches which make you have to revert your save or restart your game but this is the fault of the engine it runs on, not the dev of the game.\n\nI find this game wholly enjoyable and these 41 hours i have on record were from playing it non-stop day after day between work and other things and, though at the moment i'm taking a break from the game (I get odd moods for certain games from month to month) i still haven't finished the game and i intend to complete it!

Man, it has sucked me in and this is quite the little game. I thought that with it being turn based, that it would lose my attention. But in reality, the game seems to be quite fun. I've played through the tutorial, which took me about 2 hrs. Maybe I play slow, maybe I was distracted at times. I find the game has some depth to it, customization, and almost a board-game like feel to it. Very well done!\n\nIn my opinion, this is a great game to buy on or off sale.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "timestamp_created": 1506976420, "recommendationid": "35427990", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 171, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198031106646", "last_played": 1506979432, "num_games_owned": 198}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506379405, "review": "I can't really put my finger on it, but I felt like Emerge was just okay.\n\n It contrast to many games these days, it felt polished in what it was, but incomplete. Like, maybe give the player some options during the explore action instead of just having it be pure RNG. And maybe have the opportunity to fight *alongside* your automated defenses to make them more effectve, rather than forcing you to mop things up. Or sally out to attack zombies even if you don't plan on capturing the sector.\n\nIt was a neat premise, but it didn't quite get there for me. Can't recommend, but its not a *hard* thumbs down.
