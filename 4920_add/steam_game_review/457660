It concerns a young man named Jack who is alive (on Earth?) in the distant future, after some sort of apocolyptic event.  There is an interesting contrast of the dark age that Jack lives in and the crumbling infastructure of present day life that is completely alien to him. (He doesn't know what power lines are but carries a sword for protection, and the narrator describes the powerlines as monuments built by ancient rulers, for example.)\n\nThe narrator does a good job overall, his voice is pleasant and easy to understand.\n\nI have not spent lots of time in this experience but I will finish it as I work my way through the list of available HTC Vive content.  Thank you to the devs for creating this and I look forward to seeing this new medium evolve.\n\nFor $2, about the price of a bottle of soda, I highly recommend you check out \"Andromedum.\"", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519194", "timestamp_created": 1461712775, "recommendationid": "22654162", "language": "english", "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197972360286", "last_played": 1461446478, "num_games_owned": 178}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 1}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1482108430, "review": "Price is acceptable.

I like books, I like post-apocalyptic worlds, I like VR.  Obviously, if you combine all of them, I'll like the result, right?\n\nUnfortunately, not in this case, no.\n\nThe VR scenes only have a fixed viewpoint, which completely shatters the illusion.  One of the fantastic things about this generation of VR hardware is the ability to do positional tracking, so every little movement of your head (not just rotations) are translated into the virtual world.  That is, I think, essential to a virtual experience.  I don't expect full room-scale support, but the ability to move around even a little would be nice.  ([b]edit[/b]: According to the dev on the discussions, this will be added at some point in the future, so by the time you read this it might have been added)\n\nAnyway, I could have put up with that, and I did, for the first few scenes.\n\nBut then the other bugs started.\n\nFirst off, the menu navigation is awful, and even once you figure out how to use it, it's still rather janky and unpredictable.  It's the same with turning the page, which can be frustrating when the narrator restarts from the start of the page each time.\n\nI also could've put up with that, and I did, for the first few scenes.\n\nThen, at some point, during a scene transition, the background image got very dark.  No amount of page flipping and scene swapping could fix it -- every scene I went to was very dark.  Okay, whatever, I'll restart the app.\n\nAfter restarting the app, the narration no longer worked and I couldn't see a way to get it started again.  Okay, whatever, I read way faster than the narrator anyway, I'll just keep going.\n\nAnd then the background went dark again.  That was it, I just exited in frustration.\n\nIn short, fantastic idea, but terrible and buggy execution.\n\nProbably won't be requesting a refund, though, since it's only $2 -- maybe it'll work better for my wife, and hopefully the dev will fix some of the issues.\n\nUnfortunately, however, I can't recommend this at this time.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504874", "timestamp_created": 1466239955, "recommendationid": "23628684", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198006595227", "last_played": 1466238856, "num_games_owned": 520}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1467599195, "review": "I know this is cheap and all, and that's great...but essentially what we have here is a book... in VR form... with pretty pictures in the form of 3D backgrounds.\n\nIf that sounds like a really cool thing to you, then get this...
