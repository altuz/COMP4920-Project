This didn't have to just be just a black screen with random text alerts that appear, all using the Unreal engine, though. The audio cues are minimal at best, and you don't need a single clue to actually finish the game. You could have been blind and deaf and still come out on top.\n\nSeriously, I found half the objectives just by taking a few steps and finished the five of them (and thensome) in 5 minutes. Get a real sound engineer on board, flesh out the levels in the darkness a little better, even have difficulty options grading on various levels of vision imparement, and this could have been something a lot more enticing than a simple five minute romp with a broken achievement. Until then, the Stevie Wonder Simulator is less euseful than the Watch Paint Dry Simulator.

AVOID THIS GAME LIKE THE BLACK DEATH!\n\n\nThis is what's considered a 'game' these days? \nHorrible. Absolutely horrible. \n\nIt's just a black screen, no music, around 10 total text notifications, with brief stock sound effects.\nEven with this minimal amount of 'gameplay', it's still frustrating; you tend to get stuck on objects in the room, and I guarantee you will sigh frequently as you hunt for the last thing you're supposed to do, just waiting for it to be over.\n\nSpeaking of the objectives, let's talk about those... you get a list of objectives that don't change each time, just the locations of these objects in the small, black room. They are boring things such as 'brush your teeth', and 'sleep', though why you'd need to sleep when you're trying to brush your teeth and seemingly get ready to leave is beyond me.\n\nNow for the only positive this game has: the achievement. This game has one achievement, for finishing the short, short game (around 3-5 minutes), but even then you have to beat this nightmare twice in order to get the achievement, as it seems to be bugged the first time you complete the room. \n\nSo yeah, this is obviously someone trying to throw together the most minimal, bare bones of playability and put a two dollar price tag on it in hopes of making any amount of money that they can with this throwaway garbage. I'd say it's a scam, but it does function, just in the most basic way that would be embarrassing for even a student project. Trying to charge money for this heap is where I draw the line, however. \n\nSo if you simply MUST get this game, just to pad out your perfect game number, just make sure you idle it for over 15 minutes, so that it will count on Astats.
