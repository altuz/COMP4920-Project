Using literally almost everything you find around the world as a weapon to crush, slice, dismember, burn or to explode zombies to kingdom come.\n\nAlthough there are many great games out there today, none combine the reckless humour and pure zombie carnage as well as Dead Rising. It really means something when a game succeeds in making you spill your guts with laughter AND keeps you sticking around for another go. That is what truly makes this game special. \n\nThe game is pretty well optimized. I haven't encounter any frame drops when massive hoards of zombies appear on screen. The game actually doesn't look all the bad with its amount of graphical options. \n\nTo make this game look even better, I fiddled around in Nvidia Control Panel, setting Antialiasing, Texture Filtering and other options I could find for the game, to On. This made the game look really amazing without the need for any major graphically intensive mods. The only extra mods I used for the game is an FoV file modification and the use of a program called Flawless Widescreen which fixed some hud elements and tweaked some other graphic options.  \n\n\nSo, is it worth it?\n\nDEFINITELY. Wether you pick this up for full price or on a sale, you won't be disappointed."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500251719, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511214", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33597472", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104682501", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1503529418, "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1885}, "timestamp_updated": 1500251719, "received_for_free": false, "review": "First off I'll note that before playing this game, I'd never played a Dead Rising game before, so I can't really say how this game stands up against the rest of the series. \n\nTo describe the game briefly, you play as Frank West, a photojournalist and protagonist of the first game, who is visiting Fortune City looking to get himself back into the spotlight. Fortunately enough, a zombie outbreak occurs during his visit, prompting him to investigate the origin of the outbreak. The story isn't anything to be taken too seriously, and the game is well aware of that, with a charming, self aware humour that maintains a sort of B-movie tone throughout the game. Alongside the main objective, the game gives the player optional side missions, which typically have the player either bringing survivors back to the safe house, or killing various psychopaths who essentially act as bosses. These both reward the player with PP (the game's EXP), moreso than the player would get by just going around and killing zombies. Levelling up grants players standard upgrades (Health, speed, inventory, etc.) as well as special moves that can be performed barehanded and combo cards, which allow the player to combine two weapons to create a better weapon. All of this is wrapped around a time system, as the game takes place over 72 ingame hours. Both story and side missions must be completed during a certain time frame, or they'll be gone forever. Particularly damning when losing story missions, as it may require you to go back to a saved game (On that note, SAVE OFTEN, and use multiple slots).\n\nSo, as a wrap up:\nPROS:\n[list]\n    [*] Decent playtime (My first playthrough lasted about 24 hours, with some sandbox mode gameplay)\n    [*] Controls well (With a controller)\n    [*] A fun gameplay loop of saving survivors, defeating psychopaths, and tending to the plot\n    [*] A B-movie tone with all the cheesiness and one-liners you could ask for\n[/list]\n\nNEUTRALS:\n[list]\n    [*] Timed story and side missions (I personally enjoyed it for its uniqueness)\n    [*] Possible lack of variety (The side objectives tend to be samey, with some standouts. The gameplay can also become repetetive if you don't embrace the combo weapon system)\n    [*] Challenging (I could definitely see people finding the game too hard, especially if going into some areas unprepared. On a side note, psychopaths can have frustrating attack patterns that take a while to learn and overcome)\n[/list]\n\nCONS:\n[list]\n    [*] Occasional game crashes, particularly during cutscenes. I've only had the game crash twice, but have seen others report near constant crashing, so proceed with caution in that regard.\n    [*] Sandbox mode is a bit lacking, especially if you're not interested in completing the challenges\n[/list]"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500741813, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507822", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33724876", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197996040992", "num_reviews": 25, "last_played": 1500610754, "num_games_owned": 1982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2039}, "timestamp_updated": 1500741813, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A rather buggy game that really needed an auto-save when you rescue people. The first few hours are tough until you get a few levels and one speed upgrade. Has an issue with crashing unless you manually save often, has very glitchy textures in cutscenes, loading areas sometimes freezes your controls in one direction until you mash the buttons enough to get him to stop moving. Has AI issues the deeper you get into the game, to where armed humans ignore you if you attack them. The final stretch having (queen immune) mutant zombies endlessly hound you to where you can get stunlocked when you fight humans and the whole time hear an endless cacophony of very loud dinosaur screams while they swarm you in larger numbers. You need to restart a couple times, because you ran out of time doing something or that being low leveled gets you killed in four hits or one second.\n\nIf you can get past all that bad stuff, you have a game that gets enjoyable as you mix drinks that makes you ten times stronger, or turns off zombie AI, or shrugs off boss attacks that would otherwise knock chunks of your HP off. Survivors also get buffed from your drinks, so you can have granny NPCs with oversized weapons you gave them, running at 80MPH. There are enough variations with bosses to keep you busy, but a health magazine and painkillers will get you through most of them quickly. Don't expect to save everyone or for them to remain alive to the very end.

Hopefully I'll finish my playthrough sometime this century)\n\nRegarding Off The Record specifically, it's a slight improvement over Dead Rising 2 all-around. From what I've heard DR2 is slightly more stable (I experienced no real gamebreaking bugs and only FPS drops in the new Uranus Zone but that's just me), and DR2 is certainly of more value if you want to follow Dead Rising's canon story (dunno why you'd want to do that after DR3 started to derail the series slightly and DR4 finished the job, but whatever), but gameplay-wise Off The Record is absolutely the superior version.\n\nThe changes are fairly minimal, but it includes, among a few other details, a new zone into the map, new combo weapons, combo weapons from Case West have been imported, and the camera mechanic also returns from Case West. It's pretty much Dead Rising 2.1. (There's also a few psychopaths with a new coat of paint, primarily the final boss)\n\nAnother large selling point is the all-new Sandbox Mode, which is an alternate gamemode that does away with both the missions and the timelimit, and just lets you roam around the map killing zombies, psychopaths, and doing fairly enjoyable challenges. If you just want to screw around and kill zombies, this is what you've wanted. It's also a nifty feature for those who don't like replaying Dead Rising games over and over in order to get better at the game and eventually get the best ending, as you can level up to 50, get combo cards and so on without the time pressure getting to you.\n\nNow, a general summary of the game rather than simply what OTR includes. Dead Rising can be difficult to describe, but it's a 3rd person beat-em up (for lack of a term I'm more familiar with) where you plough through hordes of zombies. A large gimmick of the series if your ability to pick up anything that isn't nailed down in order to use it as a weapon (I'm still being surprised by how many random items there are I've never seen before, or seeing new moves I didn't know certain weapons had), and Dead Rising 2 introduced the ability to combine weapons into significantly stronger Combo Weapons.\n\nSo, the core gameplay of Dead Rising is effectively buttonmashing into hordes, and finding better stuff with which to buttonmash into hordes. This is where Dead Rising puts twists on the gameplay to make it consistently enjoyable, rather than making it Dead Rising 4.\n\nFor one thing, durability is a thing. Weapons in Dead Rising are NOT things you can just keep around. A combo weapon might get you through 60 zombies if it's an especially durable one. Taking out a crowd of zombies will take several weapons' worth of durability. You need to figure out if it's worth burning your combo weapons, or if you can scavenge enough mediocre weapons from your immediate environment to deal with the zombies fine.\n\nSecondly, Psychopaths. Psychopaths require preperation, careful management and skilful gameplay in order to get past them. It's not Dark Souls or anything, but a single Psychopath is far more of a threat than any amount of zombies, and many of them are used in pretty clever ways- For example, during a certain period of time, three snipers set up in the centre of the map. You could invest time in clearing them out, or side-step them on the map, and it's the player's choice to figure out which approach they'd rather take as well as which approach they think will consume the least time.\n\nAnd speaking of time, yes, Dead Rising's stories have a time limit. This isn't just something the game implemented to be a dick, it's to add degrees of strategy to... Basically everything. Farming PP (exp, basically) will cost time. Getting money will cost time. The more time you consume, the closer you get to having negative consequences- Sidequests each have individual time limits, critical story missions have time limits and you will fail the main quest if you aren't on time for one, and Frank himself needs to consume Zombrex every 24 hours or he'll succumb to his infection. If you're going for 100% completion, this results in an extremely strategic and really awesome balancing act. I was turned off from the series when I heard about the time limit, but after playing it, the time limit really isn't an issue. Don't let it stress you out and see it as another objective- \"Okay, I need to be here within 20 minutes, but that's 20 minutes of time to do whatever I want in the meantime... Hey, who wants to raid a zombie-infested casino?!\" (or, if you're being pragmatic, you'd be picking up magazines you want for your build. But nobody plays Dead Rising to be pragmatic)\n\nI can absolutely, highly recommend this game. IMO it's the overall best Dead Rising game. The original still has a lot of value, and if you JUST want to fuck around and kill zombies without caring about the series' other elements Dead Rising 3 is arguably superior, but DR2 executes a lot well as a sequel, and Off The Record improved its problems.\n\n[spoiler]but seriously if you take one thing away from this review, it's that you should NOT buy dead rising 4[/spoiler]"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501640614, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498012", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33962043", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011134507", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1501798858, "num_games_owned": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1124}, "timestamp_updated": 1501640614, "received_for_free": false, "review": "controller didnt get detected so i had to fix it, otherwise its my favorite dead rising. fucking awesome gameplay and you play as frank. buy this shit"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500963910, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500391", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33780618", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198062948220", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1503368027, "num_games_owned": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 300}, "timestamp_updated": 1500963944, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I got This game on Speical during the steam winter sale.\nit is a good game itself used to love playing it on xbox 360 the reason I downvoted it has nothing to do with the gameplay its the bugs this game has and how poorly its been ported over to pc\n\nI managed to play 5 hours but thats all I'm going to be able to play because now it crashes everytime I try to start it up and Yup I tried too fix what problems it might of had but still wont work \n\nso if your willing too push your luck and be able to play it past the 5 hour mark and risk no refund go for it otherwise dont take the risk"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502826175, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498232", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34262627", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198202579944", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1503856354, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2448}, "timestamp_updated": 1502826175, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Fav game of all time"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503285800, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494419", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34387146", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "5", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009984310", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1503284616, "num_games_owned": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1503285800, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I have windows 7 64bit, gtx 1060 6gb, i5 3470, 16gb ram.
