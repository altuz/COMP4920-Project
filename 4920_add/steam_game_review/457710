This game is baaaad!!!\nEven after paying only 10c due to a 90% OFF Coupon (Thank-You to the Coupon Dumpster Group), i still feel like it's not great value.\n\nThe graphics are extremely average.\n& the gameplay is really, really, difficult. Way too many obstacles on the tracks.\nNo Controller support. You use the \"A\" & \"D\" Keys to move your Car Left & Right.\nThe Heavy Metal Instrumental BGM is probably the only positive as far as I'm concerned, although even that gets repetitive after hearing it 10 times in a row, while trying to beat the stupidly hard levels.\n\nLuckily, for some odd reason, after you've crashed into the maximum amount of obstacles that your car's Armor will allow, you get the Game Over screen, but your car keeps driving down the track, & eventually finishes the level & awards the Achievement.\nSo thankfully my Avg. Game Completion percentage won't suffer, & i was able to get another 100%.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to fans of the Racing genre.\nHowever, i will say that Achievement Hunters might get something out of it (Achievement wise, not Gameplay wise).", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526818", "timestamp_created": 1504450084, "recommendationid": "34713606", "language": "english", "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "steamid": "76561198132960300", "last_played": 1504476511, "num_games_owned": 633}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504452804, "review": "Idiot Game ;,D", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501433", "timestamp_created": 1504452804, "recommendationid": "34714655", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561198285732671", "last_played": 1504456777, "num_games_owned": 608}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 100, "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 24, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 76}}
