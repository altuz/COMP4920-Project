Has an interesting story and comes with a lore pdf in the game files for background on the world and further reading.  if you go around and capture all the bases and scan all the things it'll probably take you about 6-10 hours if you're decent at shooters, less if you're very efficient and never die.  No punishment for death other than having to walk back to where you were makes it very forgiving to play.  It's a fun world to explore and wander around with good lore, though the shooter mechanics and enemy/ally AI are a bit simplistic, but really impressive for 4 people to put together in any amount of time I'm gonna rate it 9/10.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510284", "timestamp_created": 1504872781, "recommendationid": "34813215", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198039943594", "last_played": 1504872296, "num_games_owned": 339}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505737693, "review": "Love this game so much. The writing is top-notch (do get all the story via the pickups and do read the accompanying booklet). Gameplay is fun and ramps up nicely. The scenery is great. But perhaps my favourite thing is the sound design. It's so well tuned to tell you what you need to know (there's a firefight over that hill, someone is alerted to your presence, your gun has drained) but it's also just pleasant to listen to while yomping across the terrain.\n\nI've never played an FPS where simply going from place to place is so much fun.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1505737693, "recommendationid": "35044318", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197966835849", "last_played": 1499990170, "num_games_owned": 142}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504579480, "review": "Reminds me a great deal of [i]Betrayer[/i]; budget title with a striking aesthetic and proficiently designed, if, undeniably, a little repetitive.

Good mystery, beautiful world, challenging AI. Dont listen to the whining from others, this game has playability even when finished. I was hooked for a few solid days. The only thing that could be improved imo was the story, it needed something more than just a linear finish, but all in all the devs can take what they made here and implement all of it and more in something similar.
