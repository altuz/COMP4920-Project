This is just the action version in which you go from your hub into \"dungeon areas\" to grind over and over until you hit a time limit. \n\nJust feels like random excuse to dress the part of shadowrunners and have an rpgmaker game using the Mercury/City of Chains assets. Takes assetpack, combat mechanics, itemization wholesale from the established franchise.\n\nGo to some hotspots with rewards and reputation adjustments three times a day up to 7 days. With the occasional plot-centric event here and there. you navigate a simple grid minimap of the location, with trashmobs and chests peppered about randomly. Having to handle movement through dialogue window was a little bit odd. Reach EndTile after grind to exit instance.\n\nAny other gameplay comes in the form of balancing the difficulty curve with the ressource management in a game where you cannot actually generate encounters at will and are completely handheld by scripting to distribute experience and loot.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "timestamp_created": 1504728734, "recommendationid": "34782400", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1973, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "last_played": 1504728368, "num_games_owned": 4956}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 20, "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 11, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 9}}
