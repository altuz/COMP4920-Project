You will spend most of the time watching, and some of the time on the moons surface reading info cards and listening to radio chatter. A very small part is an interactive mini-game of lining up a docking port, and another very small part is rotating the lander module and occasionally firing the booster in order to land.\n\nIf you don't naturally like this sort of thing, I don't think you'd like it.

It doesnt work as a VR game and is shallow as just an experience.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\n+ its amazing to see the magnitude of this human accomplishment and gives a good feel of what was neccessary to achieve this\n\n+ the music is good and atmospheric\n+ original audio from the actual mission which was very interesting to listen to\n\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\n- its super overpriced for just one hour and almost no interactivity\n- a lot of the textures are blurry and dont look good\n\n- the immersion is completely broken by the fact that you for the most part are an observer from the outside....like you are standing in space and watch the vessel fly.....I didnt like that at all and wanted more first person views to actually experience how it was like to go on this huge mission....its especially hilarious when you leave the moon and the game lets you stand outside the spacecraft to watch it fly off, leaving you on the moon....I felt like being stranded\n\n- there are only 2 interactive parts, where you can steer the spacecrafts and its horrible.....you have to be way too accurate for a VR experience and its just annoying. You also get a grade and I got an A- and still didnt pass.....luckily you can skip it once you are too frustrated\n\n- there is advertisment for Audi on the moon.....Im not even kidding here, if they got them as a sponsor, why do I have to buy this at this high price?\n\n- its like this wasnt meant to be for VR, often times the camera flies around something really fast like in a cinematic scene, but in VR this just makes you uncomfortable and dizzy\n\n- everything is so lifeless and stale, the other astronauts never interact with you, the flag on the moon does not move like it did in real life, breaking the immersion again, which VR is all about\n\n\nNot a good experience and super overpriced for 1 hour with no replayability whatsoever. I played better free VR experiences.
