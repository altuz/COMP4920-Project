Sure, I didn't start playing until the Four Peaks update which has reportedly made the game remarkably easier to learn and play, but still, I want to make this point about my experience: 20+ hours into Spelunky, I still haven't even beaten Olmec; I have, however, taken down the boss at the peak within 10 hours of playing TumbleSeed. I kind of want to say TumbleSeed might actually be an [i]easy[/i] game because of that, because it is. The boss at the peak isn't all too difficult to take down once you get the hang of the movement. That doesn't mean it isn't fun, though. Similar to Spelunky's hell run, TumbleSeed has something quite similar that I still haven't really come close to beating. It's really difficult. Besides, the base game is strong on its own.\n\nMastering TumbleSeed's movement is a blast. It's unlike anything I've ever done in any other game I've played. The usual style of movement in a vast majority of the games I've played is either your FPS-style WASD movement, or the left/right/jump combo in almost every platformer out there. TumbleSeed's movement is something completely new, so it presents you with a learning experience that typical first person and platforming games can't offer, and once you get the hang of it and find yourself able to navigate paths you originally found impossible and dance circles around enemies, it feels pretty awesome.\n\nThe roguelite elements are done very well, too. You're just as powerful on your first run as you are on your thousandth, which I like in a roguelite. Nothing is required to be unlocked; you could theoretically beat the full game on your first run after purchasing the game. Instead of adding on passive abilities or items through your run like in The Binding of Isaac or Spelunky, you collect different powers you can use throughout your run, giving variance to each time you play. There aren't really that many, I think the number is around 20-30 aside from the starting abilities, but I feel that, too, is a good thing as it makes it easier to master each power and to find the ones you like. Success in TS isn't as reliant as TBoI on level generation as well, which makes TS more arcadey (Ice Cold Beer, anyone?), like Nuclear Throne.\n\nThe most conflicting thing to me about TumbleSeed is actually the sound. Most of the sound design is fantastic. The sounds made by using abilities, scrolling through menus, taking damage, falling... really everything just sounds [i]nice[/i]. But then you get to the later levels which have a spooky sort of ambience that just isn't fun to listen to. It's not like, nails on chalkboard or anything, but it isn't exactly pleasant or really even fitting with the whole aesthetic of the game. That and the sound the magnet aura makes (an item that allows you to pick up currency at range) kind of ruin the sound design entirely for me and I don't understand why they would include such unpleasant sounds. The music is fine though, but I'm one to usually turn the music off quickly in these kinds of games to listen to my own tunes. Not that that matters for this review though.\n\nBut yeah I like this game a lot and I really wish more people would play it. It's deserving of much more attention than it has now and thank god it isn't a multiplayer game so you're free to enjoy it whenever you want without fear of a dead community. Of course, the daily leaderboards are kind of just dead on Steam, but that doesn't really matter does it?\n\nBuy this game though. It's a solid roguelite with interesting movement that's worth checking out.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510140", "timestamp_created": 1501214506, "recommendationid": "33847541", "language": "english", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 1815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198042145197", "last_played": 1502644510, "num_games_owned": 310}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501339323, "review": "Found this game after searching for information on the mechanical arcade game on which it's based. I probably wouldn't have bothered trying Tumbleseed if it weren't for such a solid musical presence in the trailer, I thought wow if the soundtrack is this good who cares if the game is terrible? Fortunately the game is awesome.\nPlenty of abilities and moving enemies make this game a satisfying and challenging departure from the arcade game, and the soft and brooding score keeps my mind focused on the tasks at hand. It's a slow burn kind of game, I suppose you COULD try and speed run it, but that's not where I get my enjoyment. Patience is key, and if dexterity games give you anxiety you should probably skip this one but I for one am very glad I took the chance and bought Tumbleseed because this will go down and one of my favorites.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "timestamp_created": 1501339323, "recommendationid": "33882228", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198032529062", "last_played": 1501828635, "num_games_owned": 359}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 51, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 49, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
