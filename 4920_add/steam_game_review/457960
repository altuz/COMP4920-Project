I enjoy that it gets me moving, but there are a number of issues with it that keep me from playing more.\n\nFirst, the mechanics for the bow lack a lot of feedback for the player. When knocking an arrow or drawing the bow there is no feedback from the controllers. This small omission really makes it difficult to know when you've got an arrow knocked and how powerful your shot will be once drawn. \n\nThe hitbox for the quiver is a bit small as well. More than once I've reached for an arrow only to come up empty.\n\nThe \"enemies\" are just a series of spinning cubes that fire at you when you hit them or if they have been left alone too long. They can spawn anywhere around you but do so without a sound or any other noticable cue for the player. This forces the player to spin around, looking for potential threats. As a result, the player is constantly at odds with the headset cables. I've almost tripped over them more than once and could have seriously damaged the hardware.\n\nIt seems like the developers had a really interesting idea but just got as far as making it playable. Were they to polish it up a bit more and really think about the requirements of the platform and the needs of the player, Holopoint could be a much more enjoyable experience. As it stands now, I'd stick to the Lab's longbow.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489719", "timestamp_created": 1501613896, "recommendationid": "33955313", "language": "english", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198009279415", "last_played": 1501558522, "num_games_owned": 266}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 8}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 485, "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 450, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 35}}
