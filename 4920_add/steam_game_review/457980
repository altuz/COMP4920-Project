Its a very frustrating platformer with a zombie theme. There is some good puzzle potential but at 80 minutes of play I uninstalled and wish I hadnt paid for this. \n\nIf you like frustration and doing the same thing over and over again then this is the game for you. Still a neat take on zombie games and for that I applaud it. Now off to uninstall and play something else.", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503914", "timestamp_created": 1465132697, "recommendationid": "23399956", "language": "english", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198044925303", "last_played": 1465132497, "num_games_owned": 89}, "voted_up": false, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 6}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1466079037, "review": "While the game had nice graphics the game responsiveness got slower and slower the longer you played, which made the challenges even more difficult.
