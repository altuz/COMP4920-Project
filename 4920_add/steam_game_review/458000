It needs more ways to avoid combat and maybe even a more expanded weapon system. There's no real story when it comes to your companions, which is a shame. The end of the game is REALLY cool, though, and you have to make a lot of choices that matter. Your previous actions are also taken into account.\n\nOverall, I think it's a decent way to sink a couple dozen hours. I don't feel any draw to 100% it, though.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504480", "timestamp_created": 1500184664, "recommendationid": "33577665", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561198024994107", "last_played": 1500180634, "num_games_owned": 186}, "voted_up": true, "received_for_free": false, "votes_down": 0}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499698306, "review": "This game is something of a turn based survival game with textile encounters. It reminds me of something like an chunkier 8 bit version of Sheltered (also a decent game). The game is basic in design as you are trying to travel through each map to the next location, with random encounters on the way. The map is VERY basic and other than color schemes it took a few minutes to figure out where I was and what I was doing. Combat is essentially just relying on turn base with ability to pause to change tactics (essential since enemies are real time while you are changing between characters and combat tactics. Otherwise,  not a bad game for 8 bucks,  more than that and it isn't really a deal.
