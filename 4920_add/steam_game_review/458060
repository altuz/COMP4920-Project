Meh character development, internal coherence and historical believability. Low amount of content. Interactivity limited to very few choices mostly in the intro and at the end to supply the ending.\n\nNoticed some typos and this borrows too much from real history which might at first confuse the player as they slowly are faced with the fan fiction grade plot layers. Game art was actually okay-ish for what it was, and the writing was at least well structured and had a certain elegance about the storytelling aspect of it. I found the wish fullfillment to be both a little on the blatant and unsettling side of things, especially given the nature of the relationships between everyone and their supposed status as powerful entities of their time. It just does not gel. In the end this is just too short and has too many issues to actually warrant keeping on active library and I will move it to declutter.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "last_played": 1503292948, "num_reviews": 1973, "num_games_owned": 4956, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1503293336, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505580", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503293453, "recommendationid": "34388486", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
