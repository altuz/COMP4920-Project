This game, much like towerfall, shouldn't be played solo. If you have controllers and a few friends to play with this is a great couch co-op game. If you were looking for something to play solo / online, this is not that. Easy enough rules / button configurations that my wife (who does not like video games) could play with me; and even she had a good time.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI really wanted to like this game. The art style is cool, and it looked like a lot of fun.\n\nIt's not fun, unfortunately. Its really frustrating, and what you see is what you get. There's not a lot of fun alternate modes, or secrets or strategies. Just play pong with a zelda/final fantasy skin.\n\nI just can't recommend this.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198056761078", "last_played": 1486091346, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 36, "playtime_forever": 235}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1485832750, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499748", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485984433, "recommendationid": "29597478", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I think the game is great, and it's fun to play with friends.

I discovered that SpiritSphere brings much more... Except things I\u00b4ve already mentioned, it has cool funny music which perfectly fits to whole concept of the game, singleplayer is also fine for a while until you unlock all spheres and understand differences between characters and maps, but ... the best is multiplayer. It\u00b4s so incredibly fun. Yeah, I have to warn it\u00b4s probably not a game for impatient persons. But otherwise it will gives you tons of funny moments. Playing it with my younger brother (honestly he\u00b4s not very patient) and we got hella fun. Brother is getting mad constantly (in a good way) but we\u00b4ve never played funnier game. I cannot eager to play it with my GF or friends. xD You will be angry, frustrated, mad, crazy about that but you want definitely stick to game and play it more. Beating your friends is so rewarding. You know that feelings like: \"Ok, one more game. It\u00b4s my turn. Now I\u00b4m gonna beat your *** off.\" xD  Yeah, you\u00b4ll probably keep saying that right after every game. At least I do. This game is a hidden miracle (in a meaning that it\u00b4s not well known yet which is sad, because SpiritSphere deserves much more attention and I hope it will get it in a future). Excellent couch party game. Simply, top notch. Cannot wait for more promised content (stages, characters, squash mode, etc.). \nI totally approve Warwick J\u00b4s review and recommend you to read it if you are interested and thinking about SpiritSphere. \n\nThanks a lot to developer for a hard work, great idea and even better execution. I love it. BTW, still don\u00b4t know how to unlock Kao (hidden character).
