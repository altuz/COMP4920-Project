You need to get from A to B in 15 minutes. The levels are randomly generated. Enemy robots stand in your way. You don't have much ammo, but you can find more as you go. When you reach the end of the level, you get a new random level.\n\t\nThe game looks good for an indie game, but it does look like an indie game. It doesn't have the visual polish that Triple A games have. Then again at $5 it doesn't have a Triple A pricetag either.\n\nGOOD\n* Good shooting and melee combat.\n* Moving around using the thumb trackpad is pretty much the same as ONWARD and works well. And it didn't make me sick, even after hours of playing. Being able to wander the ship properly, peeking around corners and not doing a dash-teleport thing around really added to the immersion.\n* The randomly generated levels give heaps of variety.\n* A Star Wars-y visual style.\n* Performance is great on my nvidia 1080.\n* You have to reload in a sort of realistic way. I can imagine not everyone will like that but I do.\n* It starts easy and then gets tough. It's pretty hard to reach Level 5.\n* Dev is very active in the forums.\n\nNOT SO GOOD\n* Not enough kinds of enemy. While the dev says they're adding more, for now there are only two, a shooting robot and a melee robot. It's a reasonable start, but it needs at least a couple more for variety I reckon.\n* While the levels look good, they're a bit sparse on furnishings. Having more variety in rooms would improve this. So would having more things to use as cover in the rooms.\n* The enemy units look okay but not great.\n* The AI is generally good but enemies sometimes get stuck on eachother.\n* Loading levels seems to take a long time for some levels. Maybe because the dev is using Unity Personal Edition? Dunno, but I was worried the game had crashed the first time.\n\nIt's indie and looks it, but it plays well and offers heaps of variety. If you can handle trackpad movement, do yourself a favour and get it. Considering the pricetag, it's a bargain.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197979021167", "last_played": 1488781081, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 315, "playtime_forever": 3902}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1484393774, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510970", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1484393774, "recommendationid": "29245221", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I'm enjoying this game.
