You could in theory create a wide range of things and really get a lot of content out of a game like this. I talked with the developer and hes working on features that I think will really improve this game.  \n\nPros - \n- Cool Idea\n- Great Examples\n- Decently Stable\n- And a very cool Developer\n\n\nCons - \n- Programming interface could be Better (3D object based language), This would help keep you in the game and help you   understand the basic logic of programming. Also having a simplified programming interface would help inexperienced people gain a foot hold into the world of programming. \n\n\tExample coding Language \u2013 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language\n\n-  No social connections, it would be nice to have multiplayer or a way to share code easily.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025566002", "last_played": 1468704084, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 300, "playtime_forever": 37}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1479367545, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1480893283, "recommendationid": "26640783", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Alot of fun, the possibilities are endless!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197980410810", "last_played": 1487929588, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 491, "playtime_forever": 65}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1488069129, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1488069129, "recommendationid": "30181918", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
