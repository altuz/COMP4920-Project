It's not flashy.  Theres no story.  It's full of dumb jokes and laughable \"Characters\".\n\nBut after an hour of play; it's got tight controls (Didn't find a way to remap, but honestly, I was too busy playing the game to really look), an easy to navigate UI, easy to understand but difficult to master AI, and the upgrade/ship system adds something I've never really experianced before in the genre.  The soundtrack is pretty sweet, too, and I wish I could get it as a DLC (In Lossless format, please).\n\nIn short; it's a diamond in the rough.  Even at full price ($1.99 at the time of this review), it's worth the coin and I got it on sale.  I've paid a lot more for a lot less.  Fans of the genre; get this. It's not perfect, but it IS enjoyable.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034062675", "last_played": 1461490965, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 295, "playtime_forever": 98}, "votes_up": 21, "timestamp_created": 1461270542, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537992", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1461270542, "recommendationid": "22555908", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I think there are better games at similarly low prices on Steam.
