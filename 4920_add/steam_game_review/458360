I was lost, Where do I start? Where do I put my fingers...Clueless, Looking around on steam after watching some less than helpfull youtube videos I found this lovly little program. 3 hours later and I already have 3 jungles under my belt with a basic understanding of how to read music. I have a Casio Keyboard and Its really nice because I can hook it up to my PC with a USB 3.0 (the square one). The program gives instant feed back and guides you along right from the very basics.
