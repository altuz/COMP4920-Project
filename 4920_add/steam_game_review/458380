That aside, most of the existing reviewers have already highlighted the details of this VN, so I'll just skip to what I like and don't-like-as-much.\n\n+ [i]Stellar[/i] artwork, and made even more apparent with the storybook-like placing of the character sprites and background images. The vibrant character design and the relative bleakness of the setting may seem to be weird combination at first, but it works.\n+ Good soundtrack. Admittedly, I find it less memorable than [i]Sharnoth[/i]'s soundtrack, but I still find it fitting to the VN's overall atmosphere\n+ (Mostly) interesting characters, and even most of the antagonists are sympathetic. Helps that some chapters focus on side characters.\n+ Enchanting world of steampunk and Lovecraftian mix, helped with Sakurai Hikaru's unique writing style. That said... (see below)\n+ Top-tier voice acting. This is especially true with Neon, whose VA managed to give her character a \"cute\" charm while still giving her air of maturity (especially when compared to her friend Izumi who I find to fit the more standard \"cute\" character type).\n\n- While I do not dislike Neon and Tesla (I like them and their dynamics, in fact!), the way the story reveals who they are and their motives very late into the story may not sit well for some (especially when compared to [i]Sharnoth[/i], where it didn't take long for Mary's motive as main character to be established). Even more so once it is revealed that [spoiler]Tesla had what could be considered romantic relationship with Neon's direct predecessor (grandmother?), although it went nowhere in the end due to circumstances surrounding Tesla's existence[/spoiler]. I don't necessarily have problem with this bit, but I know some people may.\n- Pacing issues in some parts. The one with Gates of Hell is probably the most glaring one for me.\n- Some charaters remain underdeveloped. My biggest disappointment lies on Izumi and Albert, especially because they're supposed to be good (if not best?) friends of Neon.\n- the appearance of the user interface (buttons etc.) seems... lazy? I personally find it not quite fitting with the aesthetic of the VN.\n- The repetition in the writing (such as during Tesla's transformation sequence) may be annoying for some, while others may find it to be part of Sakurai's writing charm. Your call, really.\n\nThat said, I recommend this piece.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067086008", "last_played": 1502667091, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_forever": 945}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499520730, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499520878, "recommendationid": "33374277", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
