{"success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 8, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 8, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_positive": 6, "review_score": 0}, "reviews": [{"language": "english", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Before beginning to write this review of Zombie Pinball, the reviewer carefully read ZP's Store Page. Actually, it says very little, and claims little more, except the possibly questionable \u201cA super addictive gameplay\u201d. In fact, Zombie Pinball is all it claims to be (with the one possible exception.) It is fun, it does (one presumes) have seven tables. Thus, this reviewer will give a positive review of a game that presents itself honestly, but will also attempt to include enough information to allow each gamer to make a personal choice.\n\nYes, Zombie Pinball does involve hitting BALLS with FLIPPERS, and by doing so, scoring POINTS. It has lots of SOUNDS, and LIGHTS, and does it ever have POINTS! And it looks GREAT! So it certainly does fulfill every component of the definition of \u201cpinball\u201d. But it is by no means \u201ctraditional\u201d pinball.....\n\nZombie Pinball has seven tables, but at this point only three of them (very similar in most ways) are part of this review to any degree. The reason? Tables beyond the first one need to be unlocked by the acquisition of \u201cBloody Stars\u201d in order to play. And while it\u2019s not an overwhelming number of stars, for some beginning players it might take many hours of play to access each next table. (This player managed to get over half the required stars for the next table from a single, 1.3 billion-point game (since, vanished from history. \"News at 11:00\".)\n\nAs for scoring, Zombie Pinball offers an achievement when a player manages to \u201cObtain more than 100.000.000 points on any table\u201d (table or game?), so clearly this game is geared toward the less experienced pinballer. And this reviewer doesn\u2019t doubt for a moment that for these players the game will be a real blast, providing many hours of fun and considerable challenge. But for a more advanced player (with this player falling somewhat in-between), this game may not be more than marginally suitable or enjoyable. One can see endless games; literally games without end. Or at least, games lasting hours and hours, since most of the time there is more than a single active ball. As such, it\u2019s unlikely that there will ever be a time without the opportunity to assure a \"next\" ball in play, with the relatively easy opportunity for extra balls. There does seem to be some indication of table difficulty increasing (far too gradually) as new tables are unlocked, so this review may be wrong, and need correcting later.\n\nNo doubt, for a less experienced player it will be exciting to have in excess of ten balls in play at once during a Zombie Pinball game. But for the experienced player this multi-ball play might easily account for up to a third (or more) of game time, with the flippers constantly \u201ctattooing\u2019 (or, pressing of the keys in a rapid, staccato fashion.) This \"rapidly\" (Har!) grows tiring, and more than just a bit boring. But, WOW!, does it build the points quickly! And did this reviewer forgot to mention: 5-ball games? (Great when quarters are at stake, but perhaps unnecessary in computer pinball.) A player may also invoke the previously mentioned \u201ctattoo tactic\u201d when the common \u201cfire mode\u201d is achieved, as it\u2019s very difficult to see exactly what is, or isn\u2019t, a ball. That\u2019s also the case in some of the more flashy modes. Red balls have become the 21st century's version of \"DIP\", or \"Darned Invisible Pinballs\" ( at the best of times.) So clearly, the fingers will get a workout, two at the time.\n\nZombie Pinball includes some game-accessible modes which are interesting, but of minimal challenge to many players. In some of them creatures or items float across the screen, offering additional balls as they are hit. It also offers Challenges that might act to liven the game up a bit for more advanced players, 70 Challenges total. Each must be completed to continue to the next.  The first one simply reads \u201cValidate 10 ramps\u201d, but not a clue as to how that\u2019s done, or quite what it means. And after scoring numerous billions of points, it hasn\u2019t happened on its own for this player, so perhaps only the best players can achieve these 70 goals (or it\u2019s really far simpler, and being overthought.) However, Challenges do offer additional, no doubt well deserved \u201cBloody Stars\u201d for those figuring it out.\n \nThere\u2019s a total of eleven Zombie Pinball achievements, most involving \u201cCompleting\u201d individual tables. Apparently a table is \u201cCompleted\u201d by invoking four specific modes. However, having received as many as thirteen times the \u201cachievement\u201d high score, and had the words \u201cCompleted\u201d flashed on the screen repeated times\u2026the reviewer has yet to receive this achievement. Not even on the original table. Who knows, at this point, what\u2019s missing or done incorrectly? The \u201cRules\u201d are very brief with terms that may be familiar to the DEVs, but are not expressed clearly enough, or sometimes grammatically proper enough to be helpful to this player. (Achievement statistics indicate that while nearly half of players have the high-score achievement, no one has any of the others.)\n\nCurrently Zombie Pinball has a number of bugs, apparently mostly under consideration. One causes the game to crash upon every exit. This reviewer encountered one on a three occasions where balls simply ceased being issued mid-game, and experienced the disappearance of the mentioned 1.3 billion-point game from the high score listing (though without the documentation necessary to substantiate.) Perhaps some of the other concerns or questions expressed in this review are actually not intended to be a part of the game. Perhaps we'll know soon.\n\nThis player hasn\u2019t attempted to play Zombie Pinball with a controller, and it seems perhaps to be designed exclusively for keyboard play. The menu system is very poorly designed, but game play should be the deciding factor. \n\nWho should buy Zombie Pinball? Completionists, of course. Beginning pinballers. Better pinballers who don\u2019t mind throwing the last balls of a game away in order to leave the house. (Seriously.) Those who want to have fun without taking the experience too seriously. Those who want a pinball experience to cool down after or warm up before serious pinball. And certainly, those who enjoy zombies, which I suspect is the intent of this fun, but (so far) non-challenging game. For its moderate and fair price perhaps no one should ultimately be discouraged from this purchase.\n\nThank you.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198140299850", "last_played": 1474073788, "num_reviews": 112, "num_games_owned": 1211, "playtime_forever": 264}, "votes_up": 30, "timestamp_created": 1466627393, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542072", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1466656526, "recommendationid": "23713314", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Well I just wanted to put a few things out there for people looking to buy this game...\n\nI spent a little over an hour with the first table, which was fun but not at all what I was expecting. The table itself is fine, and there is 5-6 mini games you can activate by hitting targets. The physics feel super floaty...  the balls themselves sound and feel more like you are playing a pachinko machine filled with glass beads. I say this because the first table has at least 4 differant seperate multiball modes and you can trigger them all at the same time. Ten+ glass beads shooting (floating) all over the place while on fire (yes on fire with trail effect) is exciting but not what I have been used to playing on FX2 or Pinball Arcade. In how it compares to actual pinball I would say this is the lowest of the pinball games I own.\n\nSome of the rules language is a bit strange. The first challenge is \"Validate 10 lanes\"\n\nThere seems to be a score bug occasionally and the scoreboard is local only for now from what I can tell. The real stinker for me is the lack of changeable options. I have not figured out how to change my flipper and launch keys, as in there is no setting on the menu (the default is the left and right arrow keys). Not mentioned anywhere in the game either so you kinda have to press keys to figure out what is what lol.... lame. (Enter was table shake, and space was launch). Another thing that irritated me was the fact that all but the first table are locked. You must earn enough points to unlock the next table. Maybe I dont want to play the same table 20-30 times in a row? Pinball just seems a strange game to content lock table variety down.\n\nI know it just launched, and its super cheap... but it FEELS like a tablet game to me. If you are totally fine with that and want some semi mindless pinball lite gameplay then grab it. I DO like it I just don't know how often I will play it when there are so many other options with leaderboards and tournaments. Maybe in the future they will add more options to customize keys. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970341241", "last_played": 1466565940, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 1073, "playtime_forever": 68}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1466567261, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520546", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1466567261, "recommendationid": "23698428", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very boring very quickly to this semi-pinhead, and have to earn other tables which is an unwelcomed hassle.\n\nNot a serious pinball game, might be good for kids/new to pinball.\n\nWouldn't recommend this over any Pinball FX2 table, Pinball Arcade, or Zaccaria Pinball, or even Worms Pinball.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198031587838", "last_played": 1478833220, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 1300, "playtime_forever": 95}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1482866732, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515071", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1482866732, "recommendationid": "28723635", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is hillariously fun, omg the first table is simply put a scream, the amount of replayability is cannot be described in this review.

I grew up during the golden age of pinball.  I played some really good tables, good themes, talking tables, etc.  The best tables always had great gameplay with smooth flipper action.  The theme was almost always fun, but good gameplay always wins out over theme.   I've played many a table where the hotspot on the flippers would klunk off an corner.  As the tables aged, the flippers would give the ball less momentum and the ball didn't roll as well ... leading to weak action (balls just going up to the target and .... falling well short to roll back down again without hitting anything). \n\nVideo pinball never ages or succumbs to weak action, burned out lights, poor ball rolling, etc.  There are many pinball games that capture this table realism and maintain the pinball feel like an actual table, but Zombie Pinball is not one of these.  Zombie Pinball offers an interesting approach to pinball, doing some really cool things that a real table never could.  And it does these things quite well.  The flipper action is smooth - no klunking off corners.  The flipper hotspots have a real smooth and satisfying result - usually to the top and down a winding side tunnel or pegging a target.  Very nice. \n\nFloating video animations can be unlocked that are vaporized with the ball.  Multiball can be unlocked (two ball), and several other multiball scenarios can be unlocked with what appears to be a dozen or so balls.  Sometimes they are on fire.  It has a thoughtful \"Ball Saved\" mechanism, so that when multiball happens, drained balls are automatically shot back out onto the top (for a certain amout of time).  This way, you get a reasonable amount of gameplay with the multiball scenario that you spent the time unlocking (a super nice feature).  I've played a real world table that shot the multiballs at high speed right at the flippers.  If you weren't expecting it, they went straight down the drain - and there went your multiball.  Thanks for that!\n\nOther tables can be unlocked by accruing Bloody Stars (basically points for scoring while playing a table).  It's fun to spend some effort learning to do something well with a reward at the end!  I haven't played all of the tables, but the main table is fun enough for the price of admission.  The unlockables are just a bonus.  I am having fun just playing the main table so far...\n\nThe configuration options for the game are very limited.  The devs just added using the SHIFT keys for the flippers, so that was really the big concern.  The keys can't be configured, but they are pretty standard.  Some people report issues with certain resolutions, but the Devs are on it.\n\nThe devs are active on the forums, and they have already implemented several suggestions.  Please feel free to add some constructive ideas!\n\nBottom line.  If you want realism, look elsewhere.
