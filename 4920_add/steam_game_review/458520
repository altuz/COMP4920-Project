The game is more of a tech demo at best, and not a very good one. (see tl;dr below if you don't want to read this entire thing)\n\nThere's no options menu, so everything has to be set via ini files. For people unfamiliar with Unreal Engine games, this will be all but impossible, as there appears to be no guides anywhere in the WoA forum explaining how to do this. So you're basically stuck with the default settings, including motion blur, I still don't understand why anyone thinks motion blur looks good in any game. No control over volume, no way to rebind keys unless, again, you're familiar with UE games and know the console commands to do new keybinds. This is a massive oversight by the developers, in my opinion one of the first features that should be included in any public release of a game, EA or otherwise. Players should have easy access to, at the very least, the ability to rebind keys, change resolution and window mode, and change the game's volume via a menu.\n\nAside from those obvious issues, there's lots more when you actually get into the game. The default PoV is over the shoulder, which makes interacting with anything incredibly difficult because the targetting reticle is a tiny white dot that's often obscured by the overly bright bloom effect, so you have to wiggle your mouse around until you see the item on the ground highlighted. You can change your PoV to first person, but then you have to deal with the fact it looks like your arms are coming out of the side of your head, and they completely obscure your vision if you look down towards items on the ground. Which leads me to the next fundamental flaw, mouse sensitivity (again, something you are not easily able to change). \n\nThe vertical and horizontal mouse sensitivities are either based on screen aspect ratio, or they're independently set at different speeds, because in order to look up and down you need to move your mouse about twice as far as you do to look the same distance left or right.\n\nThe landscape was dull and uninteresting, with many of the same assets reused over and over, and I realise in my extremely limited play time, I haven't seen the entire world, but first impressions count for a lot. I would go from burning up to freezing cold, back to burning up in a matter of seconds just walking a few feet. My thirst stat seemed to drain so rapidly, the 6 bottles of water I found lying on the ground by my feet when I entered the game would have lasted me about 5 minutes longer then I was prepared to play this game, and I saw no way of getting water apart from finding bottles of it on the ground. I couldn't drink from the nearby pool of water.\n\nNow let's talk about combat. It's awful. There's absolutely no feedback for hitting an enemy, or for an enemy hitting you. The enemies have a health indicator above their heads, in the form of a large number, so when you're close enough you can see that number go down, but when the enemy attacks you, there's absolutely zero indication of it apart from your health bar in the bottom left corner going down. There also appears to be no rhyme or reason to who will attack you. The first thing I attacked just stood there and took it without any reaction at all, then as I approached a second NPC of the same type (and I mean the exact same type, a human that looked exactly the same as the first one I killed, which by the way looked exactly the same as me), it started moving towards me and then I died. I didn't see any firing animation from the enemy, didn't get any visual feedback I was taking damage, I just died. The gunplay is horrible, the default ginfire sound asset are terrible, overall the combat is just bad, it reminds me a lot of the original Doom, except the original Doom did it better.\n\ntl;dr: \nIt's clear this is a very early alpha, and has a really long way to go. I can't say I can see great potential in it, because it's so early in it's development. Way more issues than positives right now.\n\nPros: \n- Honestly, I can't really think of any in it's current state, apart from maybe the Summer Sale price...?\n\nCons:\n- It's not nice to look at.\n- Lack of basic features, like an options menu.\n- Terrible combat system\n\nI didn't get around to playing with the crafting or base building system, so can't really comment on them.\n\nAs it stands, I seriously can't recommend this game unless you're a super diehard fan of survival/building games and want to be there at the beginning for bragging rights.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197991196780", "last_played": 1498543122, "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 321, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_created": 1498546716, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538704", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1498567782, "recommendationid": "32844742", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Looks great on a big monitor.. needs campaign mode soon", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198375372583", "last_played": 1493136694, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_forever": 19}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1493136126, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498103", "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1493136126, "recommendationid": "31359853", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Interesting themes. Still a bit rough around the edges - but has a lot of potential.
