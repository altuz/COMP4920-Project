The goal is to collect 51 fiery runes (called totems) in every level, however the counter in the game only goes up to 50. \n\nThere are 6 levels total, but each of them are just the same 1st level with various filters and lighting adjustments. The \"3rd level\" places a blur effect that is so badly implemented that the game lags on a really good PC. \n\nThe achievements are bugged. After completing the entire game and collecting every \"totem\", my achievements are still only at 84% because some of them never registered upon completion.\n\nThe design of the one level is of a small, enclosed space with some invisible walls and floating platforms that you need to magically hop around on. You can't move the camera to see what's around you so you can't plan very far ahead. It's super easy to fall, and to add to the difficulty, you don't know for certain what will happen to you due to the inconsistent barriers and the ball's fake shadow. You know how when you're trying to land on something in a game and you look to see where the shadow is down below in order to gauge where you're headed? That's not possible in this game. The ball does have a shadow but it's like it's 2-dimensional in a 3D world. \n\nAt first glance the game looks pretty but the assets the game uses were pre-bought or free and they are so poorly placed; there are floating patches of grass, grass stuck in walls, trees with no collision, trees WITH collision, and for some reason the upper part of the area is a fire asset that has (yet again) been poorly added. The music itself I kind of like but it loops endlessly with no variation.\n\nLastly, another example of the lack of effort put into this game is that even the cards are lame, named after the assets ... some of the greats being \"Tree\" and \"Water Plants\".\n\nI do not recommend buying this game even if it's on sale, as it will give money to someone who wants cash for no effort. Achievement hunters, stay away. You might not be able to 100% the 300 achievements. The developer responded in the discussion forum to a player who complained about the bug and said it was fixed but that was before I got the game and it's still broken.\n\nAll in all, a lovely 1/10.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035428434", "last_played": 1498974922, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 661, "playtime_forever": 125}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1498366030, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525816", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498366324, "recommendationid": "32755909", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I usually like games with balls in them. Usually, however this isn't one of this times.\nI don't understand how or why this is getting positive reviews. This feels like like a tech demo to me, and it seems to be showing off some very low quality tech. \n\nThe game defaults to a window mode. When you enlarge the window it's fine, but if you click off screen and come back it resizes back to a floating window. There is no options at all on the main menu just a level selection, the options is only accessable from in game.\n\nWhen finally checking out the options screen I noticed the game defaulted to 1280 x 720 instead of 1920 x 1080 (my monitor resolution) and high rather than ultra graphics. You can change it but if you leave the game and come back it will reset.\n\nThe ball doesn't handle very well. I tried a controller and keyboard and it actually handles far better with a keyboard, unlike every other ball game I've played which plays better with a controller.\n\nThe platforming is terrible at best as you go through a very uninspired level. What about the other levels though, there's 6 right? Well, not really. Even though it says there are \"6 levels\", it is always the exact same level but with slightly different lighting and different weather. The weather seems to be purely cosmetic too..\n\nAlso what's up with the name of this game? In Steam it's listed as ZRoll. On the buy screen it says \"Buy tbs\", and when the game is running it seems to be called \"Landscape Mountains\".\n\nThere is one positive thing about this game and only one. There is this really nice visual effect (particle effect?) you see when you collect one of the totems. It's really nice and I like that a lot. It's funny though, it almost seems like far more work has gone into this one special effect than the entire rest of the game combined.\n\nFirst Impressions / Gameplay:\nhttps://youtu.be/h0EJiMWkefU\n\nI don't recommend this game at all.

The more I think about this game, the more I understand how much I actually over-scored this game in the video link above.  It was the cheapest of three games I reviewed right in a row, and while this game was the best for the price, it still wasn't good.  A 61% is over-rating it, and my value score should have been a ZERO instead of the 30 I gave it in the video review which I think I gave it just because it is under a dollar and had good enough graphics.  Maybe I assumed someone else would be able to play it better without the frustrating experience I witnessed.  But no.. the value goes down to a ZERO because I believe that most people don't want to pay even 99 cents to be frustrated and quit any game.  \n\nThat means this game gets a 31% overall score.  - And even that might be pushing it.
