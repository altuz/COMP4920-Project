Where to start describing this game's features...\n\n-Multiple game modes including a daily run\n-Challenges similar to Isaac's challenge list\n-Around 9 unlockable characters to play as, all with their own weird and sometimes wonderful perks and quirks\n-Great music and sounds\n-Very heavily inspired both looks-wise and function-wise to Zelda and Isaac\n-Secret rooms similar to Isaac, but only one per floor\n-Mimics (*shudder* mimics...)\n-Nice mimics! These will accept keys to give you items/character upgrades or money for xp\n-It is a rogue-lite with xp leveling on a per run basis including passively gaining more health, strength, etc. randomly from leveling up (xp is gained from killing monsters)\n-Like Isaac, there are more floors than the initial set (similar to the Womb levels and onward in Isaac)\n-There is a closet to store a starter item that is in the starting room of each floor. If there's an item you prefer to start with, you can save and buy it for your closet\n-Pets! You can equip a pet and level it over time and get perks to help your character out on the run that the pet is with you!\n-Each floor has you kill a mini-boss to get the boss key (like Zelda) then when you are ready, you can go for the boss\n-Sacrifice rooms (similar to the spike sacrifice room in Isaac)\n-Shops including ones where you have to buy items with red hearts instead of gold\n-Multiple extra heart types (some I have no idea what they do) including skull hearts, shield hearts, gold hearts, recharge hearts and time hearts\n-All original sprites and a funny premise that is quite likeable from the start\n-Different difficulty settings to play on\n-300 or more items to discover and use\n-Once you pick up an item for the first time, you can look up the item and see what it is/does\n-If there item effects you don't want to keep using (such as throwing bombs everywhere), you can go into the items area of the pause menu, find the item and hit the DROP button\n\nReally one of my only suggestions for the devs on this game is even though it can be played quite well with a controller, please let us navigate the menus and lists in the game with controller instead of having to switch over to mouse when we want to look at something. Also allow us to have a scroll wheel or continuous page to look at all the items we have so we can tell what they all do at all times.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this wonderful little Isaac like game. I think you will find it fun and a great value for it's price. Also with the promise of online multiplayer coming soon, there is not much reason to not pick this up and at least try it out.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989177019", "last_played": 1500806132, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 805, "playtime_forever": 495}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1500292097, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525472", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1500332209, "recommendationid": "33606202", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Love the game.

That being said Slimeking does not completely ruin the concept and delivers the same type of experience. On the price point and that last note alone I think this a recommend even in it's current state.\n\nSure this game has long way to go to smooth out the experience to the point it could compete directly with Isaac but it's already solid fun and the developer is actively and aggressivley improving the game at the moment.\n\nEA Grade.....7/10 and rising\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198158149244", "last_played": 1501791862, "num_reviews": 100, "num_games_owned": 393, "playtime_forever": 116}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500566760, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500566760, "recommendationid": "33675262", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Played Binding of Isaac until you can see it when your eyes are closed? Good news! This game is exactly what you hope it will be. \n\nThe Slimeking's Tower is incredibly fleshed out for being so new, it even has a few features that i wish BoI had. A pet system that persists between runs, where you upgrade monsters as pets, who will ultimately grant you an extra ability when equipped. A store that allows you to buy items to send in on the next run. An in-run XP system where you gain levels that grant additional stats or features. A large cast of characters with very individualized perks/flaws that make them all feel truly different.\n\nThe game moves fast, and has many of the features that BoI players might expect as well. You have secret rooms, item rooms, shops, and a multitude of special hearts. Ghost hearts, shield hearts, gold hearts, recharge hearts... just, look... this game is as close to a different version of BoI as I've ever found, and it's done well. There are a few issues and bugs to contend with but keep in mind that this game has been out less than a week as of this review. \n\nIn short, it's incredibly feature-rich for such an early stage, and it will scratch that Isaac itch in a fun way. Plus, look at the price! This game is worth every penny.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198061859631", "last_played": 1501285362, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 453, "playtime_forever": 873}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500613897, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498753", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500613897, "recommendationid": "33688800", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I would look at Vaelsh's review because he goes indepth on what to expect and helped me decide to get it. I love this game and i would reccomend it, but keep in mind it is an early access game. So it does have its problems. And since Vaelsh goes over all of the great aspects of the game, i'm going to go over just a few things that are negatives. First there isn't full controller support, so you can play the game itself with the controller no problem! but when using the main menu or pause menu to look at the items you picked up (with the description) you have to go from controller to mouse. Second is that you can only look at your items up to a certain point. So it is like isaac in the sense that it has alot of item that change the way you play. So you are always picking up new items and wanting to look at them. Well you have four lines in a box where you can do so, but if it fills up, you can't see any items you pick up from that point on unless you drop or remove items that come before that. which is really annoying and a hassle. Third is that you have to be careful when fighting a boss. Because once he dies, a stair case will spawn in the middle and if you are standing there or running down the middle when he dies, you will automatically get teleported to the next level and miss out on the item. Really annoying! and when you beat a couple high bosses later in the game, one will drop a crown and one will drop a mustache. I recommend not picking up either because you don't get any achievement from doing so and it just ends the game when there are more levels to enjoy and play through. If any of this will annoy you or if you don't like early access games then i suggest to wait and see where it goes. With all of this said, i enjoy playing early access games and deffinately would recommend this game! with these annoyances the game itself is alot of fun, there are some cool characters to unlock, and the devs want to keep adding to it and working on it! I just wanted to let you know some of the minor issues in case that is a problem for you.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198082219377", "last_played": 1500887505, "num_reviews": 59, "num_games_owned": 517, "playtime_forever": 917}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500457987, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500311", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500458347, "recommendationid": "33648152", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I LOVE THIS FREAKING GAME, I CAN'T WAIT FOR NEW ITEMS (please don't make the new items dlc because I can't afford it D:)\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198296242163", "last_played": 1505774963, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 265}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504041506, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490997", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504041506, "recommendationid": "34589055", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game feels just like Binding of Isaac... well.. not completely. \n\nThe game has its own twists.
