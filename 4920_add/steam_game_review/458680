After playing for a little bit I found myself enjoying the actual game.There are multiple classes with their own weapon and stats that are premade but there is also a custom loadout menu that lets you build your own car. My only complaint would be that all the cars feel like they have the same weight in the air. This wouldn't be bad but it just feels too floaty and hard to control yourself in the air.

It's deeply nostalgia rich and has a great vibe going on steeped in the Saturday Morning Cartoons of the 80s.  Basically a FFA or team based car battle arena with 70s and 80s vehicle asthetics and cellshading.  The synth heavy soundtrack is absolutely killing it featuring bands such as TWRP.  The fact that further content updates are coming makes me super happy, I hope the game goes full on M.A.S.K with temporary transforming, Wheeled Warriors with crazy car melee weapons, starriors with the missle tower concept or even evil alien villian tropes from that era.  While the primary gameplay is online against players or bots I have to say, I loved the tutorial mission.  I'd be happy if we got more single player content from this as week with future updates, I want to know about the Crossroads battle against the neon ninjas.  The only real downside currently (which is an issue with most brand new titles) is that theres not a ton of people playing yet.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 456, "steamid": "76561197994797652", "last_played": 1507164223, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 456}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506093924, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506094036, "recommendationid": "35130468", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game has a lack of content at the moment.  It's pretty much just MP, which plays well.  I haven't experienced any lag or framerate issues.  The game is fast paced and can be hectic.  But the gameplay isn't the biggest problem I have.\n\nThere is no soul in this game.  There are voice actors that do a nice job.  There's also a soundtrack that add to the feel of the game.  However, everything else feels generic.  The vehicle design is boring.  None of the cars have character or unique feel.  They're just cookie cuttter.  The devs added the ability to modify your car.  I like that option, but all you can do is change weapons or passive abilities.  I liked to see some visual customizations too.  \n\nThe generic feel is why I have to thumb this down.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 83, "steamid": "76561198021492317", "last_played": 1506463701, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 304, "playtime_forever": 83}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1506462323, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509050", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506462323, "recommendationid": "35230882", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
