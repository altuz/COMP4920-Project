Also, the larger number of heroes with individual leveling needed per hero seems a bit more annoying in this game than how the leveling of heroes and the number of them worked in the first game. The overall difficulty, however, is what really put me off here, because I felt like it was perfect in the first game, but excessive this time around. If you wanted a harder Kingdom Rush, this game is for you, but if the first one felt just right, this one might be a disappointment for you, as it was for me.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972040704", "last_played": 1500689370, "num_reviews": 455, "num_games_owned": 831, "playtime_forever": 271}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1505711642, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462866", "votes_down": 24, "timestamp_updated": 1505711642, "recommendationid": "35039266", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
