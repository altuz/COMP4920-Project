The story is alright, the only two routes I found interesting were Ellie, Fuuko and Narika.. The rest are pretty forgettable in my opinion. The story itself is rather simple and nothing too fantastic, just your average action anime. \n\nThere is a lot of grinding in this game, which can get old pretty quickly if you're looking for excitement, the combat and levels are all randomly generated and apart from being skinned differently throughout the different places you visit.. They are more or less all the same and purely for grinding, it really slows the story down to a halt.\n\nPick it up on a sale, it's not worth it otherwise.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198015084624", "last_played": 1501560630, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 279, "playtime_forever": 2395}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1501605155, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1501605155, "recommendationid": "33952568", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game is quite enjoyable and the visual novel parts are funny, but expect alot of grinding to level up in dungeons.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044520690", "last_played": 1502638311, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 535, "playtime_forever": 2981}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500880213, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500885836, "recommendationid": "33760333", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
