The story prompt seems simple on paper, but what distinguishes this simple concept from other simple VN concepts is that the quality of writing and storytelling in this VN in particular is exceptional.  Perhaps to make this more impressive is knowing that the main part of the writing was done in a month for NaNoRenO.\n\nAs a brief aside to the music and art quality of the game, I would like to say that both are adequate.  I found the music overall to be rather mundane, but there are a few pieces that, in my opinion, fit excellently with the mood of the setting and enhanced the reading experience.  Likewise, the art quality would from time to time switch from mediocre to cute and pretty, but felt somewhat inconsistent, and sometimes unfitting to the mood.  Overall, I would say the music and art were supplements to otherwise exceptional writing.\n\nWhen I say the writing is exceptional, I don't mean to say \"exceptional for a VN writer in particular,\" but exceptional in the sense that someone (though, there were multiple writers) with a firm control of English rhetoric and emotional storytelling wrote it.  The short story is filled with humor and serious moments that flow naturally and realistically.  At points in their space-travelling, the Passenger and Budapest would frequently tease each other in the same way friends (or perhaps a romantic couple) might, and it feels quite heartwarming and funny to watch the frivolity.  These brief intermissions of happiness, in my opinion, do well in emphasizing the dramatic moments of the game, which feel very heartfelt.  You feel a sense of identity in the deuteragonists of the story and it's easy to form an emotional connection to both of them.  This is the mark of a story largely written by a skilled contemporary writer in the making.\n\nAs a brief digression on the emotional impact of the game; even the main develop of Renpy made a comment on his Twitter of the game's sentimentality: https://twitter.com/renpytom/status/583849407474458626\n\nThe game is not too long, perhaps an hour's length - shorter if you're a quick reader.  I've refrained from detailing any specific plot points at the risk of making them less dramatic or humorous.  It's a VN that's well worth your time, and I hope will at least make you ruminate about the themes in the game, which are fairly straightforward but otherwise thought-provoking.  It is certainly a beautifully-written game and, I should hope, can become a standard for proficiently written VN's in the future.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043760821", "last_played": 1488087238, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 107, "playtime_forever": 97}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1488089216, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500832", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1488089216, "recommendationid": "30187471", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very well done.
