After putting a good chunk of hours into Dirt Rally I wanted to try something different so I bought this on sale. \n\nThis game gets an undeserved bad rap. In simulation mode the driving is just as hard, and feels very similar to Dirt Rally. \n\nYou can also crank the AI difficulty up to extreme and you will probably come in last every single race. Or if you're like me, put it on medium and come in first every time which is kinda nice after not doing so well in Dirt. \n\nUnlike DR this game has different gameplay options from arcade driving to full simulation. \n\nWhere this game does lack compared to Dirt Rally is the finishing touches. I use headphones when playing and the sound in the car just doesn't quite sound real. The flying gravel sounds like a recording played on loop that doesn't quite match with what the car is doing. And the co-driver is frankly, awful. His voice clips and he sounds robotic the whole time. Except when you get near the finish and he for some reason yells out \"finish!\" and it's so jarring compared to the rest of robotic delivery. \n\nAt least he doesn't sound mildly disappointed after a big spin out like the co driver in D:Rally. \n\nBut this game has an upside compared to DR and that's the career mode. First of all it's real WRC licensing so you get all the cars and drivers and tracks from the 2016 season and there is a real progression not just buying news cars and trying to get into the next racing tier. \n\nWe all know Dirt Rally is the current king of the rally games but this game is quite fun and worth playing especially when you can get it for 50% off.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993423353", "last_played": 1503003598, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 229, "playtime_forever": 245}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1502741661, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505536", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1502742697, "recommendationid": "34242673", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "i love when people sh*t on game without explaining why .. \ni feel sorry for you stupidity \nnormaly when you do this is to explain to people: \nif they need to buy the game are not \nand the reason why ! \nso yeah this game is a little glichy sometime \nthe track are soso \nbut overall in sales its work the price", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198268281577", "last_played": 1504564539, "num_reviews": 43, "num_games_owned": 95, "playtime_forever": 88}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504216150, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503441", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1504216150, "recommendationid": "34644955", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Its ok.

Sure, it doesn't reach the simulation fidelity of dirt rally, or other highly praised racing simulators, but it isn't bad. I feel that simulation fidelity is somewhere around the F1 codemasters series. The cars do feel realistic and behave like expected. It's rich in content - containig WRC Junior, WRC2 and WRCs cars, and all 2016 rally events are present in the game.

There is one intesity of rain, one intensity of fog...etc.\n[*]Car setup is there, it does affect the car, but it is very basic.

The weather is all over the place, changing from sunny, to rainy in between stages. The time of stages don't make much sense either, i.e. you often run your last stage on sunday in the dark.
