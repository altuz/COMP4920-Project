You go to a \"carnival\" and play stuff like the ring toss or knocking over bottles with a baseball.  The difference here is that the games aren't all rigged so you'll lose.  In fact, it's quite the opposite.  The games all seem rigged so that even if you screw up spectactularly, you will still get some tickets.\n\nI've only seen a couple of the areas to play in so far, because you need to spend tickets to unlock new stuff.   That's kinda neat since it forces you to play the games for a little before advancing to another, but it's also kinda annoying since each game area uses its own set of tickets.  If I go to do the shooting gallery and earn 25 tickets and then leave that area to go to the next area, It will say I've got 0 tickets because I didn't earn them in that zone.\n\nI guess that's not that big of a deal since you're only going to unlock a game or two and then a new area, and there's a ton of crappy toys to spend tickets on...but I still kinda found that annoying.  \n\nSpeaking of annoying, there's a carnival barker there in EVERY scene talking in an EXTREMELY exaggerated WAY that YOU will QUICKLY find TIRING!  OH and HE has TO comment ON everything YOU do AND there's NO way TO shut HIM up WITHOUT silencing HIM completely!  He doesn't even sound like the stereotypical barker either.  \n\nExample: I go to play the ring toss.  I throw one ring and he says \"this DOESN'T look LIKE your GAME!\" and then I throw another ring and it lands on the highest scoring point value and he says \"i LOVE to SEE a MASTER at WORK!\".  They should definitely tone this guy down a bit.  I could understand him saying I suck if I screwed up multiple times in a row, and I could understand him saying I was a master if I was doing extremely well over the course of the game, but it seems like he can go from \"YOU SUCK\" to \"YOU'RE AWESOME\" in no time at all.\n\nAnother annoying thing (and it could just be the way things are set up for me) is that the game puts stuff just out of reach, and when I reach for it or move to grab it, the whole screen goes black and it tells me to recenter my play space. It's not really well made for Room scale, and the standing playspace it uses is really kinda small.  Is this game aimed at Rift users? \n\nGraphics are decent, the areas are colorful, and there does seem to be a slightly cartoony carnival vibe to the whole place.  Everything is well polished and it looks fun enough, but as far as I know, the game is played solo, so you'll just be going for your own personal high score and any friends who happen to have it will also show on a leaderboard. \n\nPros: \n[list]\n  [*] Nice graphics\n  [*] There's some fun games to play\n  [*] It's not too difficult or rigged so you'll fail\n  [*] You can win some silly stuffed animal toys and there's an area for you to play with them in. \n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n  [*] The Barker is annoying\n  [*] The aiming scheme with your controllers on the Vive is awkward\n  [*] Some of the toys don't even seem to work properly\n  [*] It's single-player where having a friend play side-by-side would have been great.\n[/list]\n\nLooking at the store page it says it supports the Vive only, and Room scale, so maybe there's an option somewhere that's missing.  I know it's set for room scale in VR because in virtually every other game I can move around the room easily.  It still doesn't explain the awkward way you have to select items.\n\nOverall this is still a fun game, and it's worth playing, but don't buy it expecting multiplayer, and you might want to turn the volume on that Barker guy way down.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969913402", "last_played": 1498268176, "num_reviews": 149, "num_games_owned": 1966, "playtime_forever": 122}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1497068585, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512416", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1497068585, "recommendationid": "32308378", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very enjoyable VR game! Usually I play the VR with many people over and we take turns, so having one game with many different gametypes involved is a plus, rather than constantly launching new games. Game runs very well and is set up in a believable carnival setting, Games are relatively easy to pick up on, yet challenging enough to leave the user wanting to continually better their final score.
