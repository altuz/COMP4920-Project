The idea of switching between third and first person is nice idea, however it requires you to constantly hold down your right mouse button to stay in 1st person. If you release the mouse then you switch back to third person, only now the movement keys change direction. Very frustrating. \n\nAlso the pefromance is pretty laggy for such low intensity graphics. And finally the combat - you only get two slow firing weapons, and there is very little feedback as to where the enemies are shooting from, and no indications when you are being hit. So with no health bar you will just suddenly find yourself dead. Mercifully there are at leat in game checkpoints, but no save game. Rinse and repeat infintum.\n\nFor a bit more work on the controls and combat this game could have been quite fun, as it is however, it is more frustration than anything else so hard to recommend. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989290281", "last_played": 1497260429, "num_reviews": 108, "num_games_owned": 1203, "playtime_forever": 74}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1501526393, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498538", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1501526393, "recommendationid": "33933309", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
