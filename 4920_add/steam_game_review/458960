The game takes very little skill, and how well you do is entirely based on your stats.\n\nHowever, where this game really fails is that there is simply no feeling of character progression. In other words, in a game that is entirely based on stats, the gains in stats when you level up are hardly noticeable. Like you would expect after gaining a few levels to be able to go back to a course that was challenging before and now do much better. Unfortunately, that simply is not the case.\n\nPlus there really doesn't seem to be any gear or clubs to \u201csave up\u201d gold for. There was like 1 shirt in the apparel shop and then some clubs that seemed like a downgrade from the clubs that you got for free from quests.\n\n\nEdit: To explain my point more.  When you start the game at level1, it is impossible to reach the green in 2 shots on a par4 even on the easiest courses.  Pretty much every par4 hole is:\n\nShot1: hit the crap out of the ball with the Driver\nShot2: hit the crap out of the ball with the 3W\nShot3: hit the ball onto the green with a wedge\nShot4: 1 putt for par\n\nWhat you would expect is that you could come back in 15 levels, and now easily be able to make it to the green in 2 swings on the easiest courses.  However instead, the only change is that now your pitch on shot3 is 40 yards instead of 70 yards.\n\nAlso, I don't like the fact that if you are in the rough (or worse the sand), there is a totally luck based chance that you next shot goes off in a random direction even if you hit it perfectly (get a \u201cnice\u201d).

The courses are are very nice looking and other players are great so far. Ive played this about a month now have a level 19 power player and a 20 accuracy player. Here is the whats not so great. Accuracy players have it way easier the punishment for running out of mentality as a power player is so bad that your either buying tons of mentality drinks or your round is done the meter moves like lightning. The physics need alot of work yet. Sometimes the wind seems random as to if it will effect the ball flight or not. Bunker shots are a joke most of the time. You can wing a full meter and go 2 ft even with a straight swing. The greens are definately more along the lines of putt putt vs golf. There are holes in middle of hills down in pits in the green and some greens the shot can have 3 breaks and a downhill so bad a full swing meter wont get you there. I really like this game and I want it to be the next big online golf game but its not there yet. I would like to see them really study the courses and fix geometry and physics issues like hole 10 or 11 on Seven Angels if you land just at the top of the hill before the first water trap all the shots go straight down into the water reguardless of club. I had to pitch backwards and redo the shot. I would like to see better servers as the lag effects the swing meter as well as the group play we see alot of disconnects and game pauses from players being dropped. I have done my part to support the dev I spent roughly 250$ on this game so far seeing if the premium stuff made it better.
