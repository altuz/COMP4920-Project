It is a puzzle game with an interesting story and now the controls are fixed it is mostly fun to play and does not cause me any nausea.\n\nHigh points:\nHuge play area, lots of \u201cwow\u201d moments.\nFun puzzles\nGreat humour\nThe light gun is fun to use\nGreat music\n\nThere a a few issues to a aware of:\n1. Movement control was still a bit odd I would it have liked to have moved in the direction I was pointing the controller rather than the direction I was facing. Otherwise you can't run and shoot to the side.\n2. There is no save feature I could find, so you have to play though in one session which can take a couple of hours\n3. Replay is pretty limited as the play is a bit linear\n4. Am I supposed to kill all the poor arachnids? seems a bit cruel:)\n5. A bit too easy for my liking\n6. Music could be a bit load and obscure the dialog\n7.
