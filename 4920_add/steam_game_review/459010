But, there are two flaws that plague this game for me that ruin it, and I'm hoping the developers read this and update their game.\n\nSaw this as a demo at Mid Summer Scream today, it just looked awsome and it was running on a Vive. I asked the guy at the booth would it run on an Oculus and he said yes with 3 sensors (Which I have, ceiling mounted, entire room mapped and guardian system) it would be fine.\n\nSo, after the horror con, I came home and bought this. Heck, 9 bucks, who can beat that! Then I played it and got frustrated within 2 minutes of the game and here is why.\n\n1. You can't rotate your virtual self. -- There is a left thumbstick that is just waiting to be used for something. Right now, it's not used for anything. The only way you can move in this game is point the flashlight where you want to go, and pull the trigger. It'll start walking in that direction. This didn't cause me any discomfort as other walking games do, and I don't believe they need to add teleport. But rotating your virtual self while standing still is a MUST. It's tremendously annoying having to walk to one corner in the room just to get yourself turned around so you can center yourself somewhere else. With 3 sensors there can still be a minor dead spot and it comes back to bite you in this game. I'm seriously hoping the developers can add the ability for the left thumbstick to rotate your virtual self.\n\n2. Gun bugs. -- I can't tell you how many times the gun would just \"lock up\"... ie it'll just freeze in mid air and not be useable for 20 or so seconds. Then it'll pop back in your hand. This is a huge bug and for a shooting game, where you can't shoot, well, you do the math. \n\nSo, 3 for effort but they need to add rotating with the thumbstick and fix the gun bugs on Oculus. \n\nNote, every other game I have in the rift works completely fine, so, it's not my setup nor my hardware. These issues only affect this title.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024920261", "last_played": 1501396257, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_forever": 26}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1501402754, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501402754, "recommendationid": "33899663", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is a wierd but terrifyingly fun smash up of Mr. Toads Wild Ride, a shooting galary, and a horror movie, and its fantastic.   The on rails amusment park shotting galarie is just perfict.  It feels just like an old timey amusment park and I was a kid again playing that section.  The horror section has plenty of jump scares and a spooky spooky atmosphere.  The negatives are that the game is a little simple and repetative in the later sections, plus the deaths dont feel like anything happened.  You see something drop on you, but the action does not stop, so I did not realize I had died as often as I did.  Also the game is only a few hours long.  All and all, this was a great experiance for me, and I played threw the first shooting gallary section more than a few times.  My face hurt from smiling, and my heart was pounding from the jump scares.  I very much recomend this one as the emersion is top notch.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198016632416", "last_played": 1481413237, "num_reviews": 175, "num_games_owned": 717, "playtime_forever": 47}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503856086, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503856086, "recommendationid": "34535207", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is the closest I seen to the feel of the Disney pirates of the caribeanne ride only scarier.
