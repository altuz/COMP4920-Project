Every level just has a different layout but plays out the same way, you take the exact same steps every level to complete it. It seriously lacks any strategy and diversity since all factions are 95% the same. The multiplayer is very vague and unplayable. I do not recommend this game but if the developer were to bring out a new game and spent more time on the gameplay and forgot about the multiplayer it could be worth checking out.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198086835118", "last_played": 1499860416, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 450}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500297686, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503123", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500297686, "recommendationid": "33607769", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
