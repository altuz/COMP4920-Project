Transistor and Portal 2 come to mind, because this, too, is a game where everything just comes together and *fits*. It's beautiful, from the backgrounds to the character designs to the phenomenal voice acting to the music; I honestly cannot praise any aspect enough.\n\nThe battle system is tastical but never grinds to a halt. It's also a vehicle for the world building and so is everything else, because Masquerada never wastes your time. For example, the \"codex entries\" are not written like schoolbook texts. They are written by the main character and it's genius and refreshing. You get information about the world as seen through Cicero's eyes, and get information about him at the same time. I'm actually surprised this hasn't been done more often yet.\n\nThe world building is dense and everywhere, but never overwhelming (except maybe for the 'prologue', a separately playable tutorial that is thankfully not indicative for the game itself). There is no distraction in the form of sidequests, no long and confusing corridors that eventually lead to a loot chest. Open world games can be fantastic and fun, of course, but the balance between keeping you engaged in the story and distracting you with hundreds of markers on your map is very often a thin line, at least for me.\n\nIn Masquerada, there's only you and the characters and the story, and once it grabs you by the heart it's very difficult to take a break from it. There are no filler screens, nothing that doesn't further flesh out the world you are exploring or helps you understand what makes the characters tick or where they stand to each other.\n\nSpeaking of the story: you'll know some of the beats, some will take you by surprise. It's a story about redemption, about found family, about war and loss and coming to terms with your decisions and their consequences. There is death, but the game never crosses over into grimdark territory, never loses that spark of hope and humour. Cicero is now one of my favourite main characters, but honestly, there is not one character I wasn't emotionally invested in by the end, even the villains. They are just that human, that honest and *real*. The excellent voice acting does its part as well.\n\nThe love of everyone involved in this project shines through in every screen, in every line of dialogue, in every gorgeous musical note, and it's just a joy to experience them.\n\nI hope this wasn't too confusing. I'm just still so stroked about having played this game, and looking forward to another run of it!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 895, "steamid": "76561198049190233", "last_played": 1506724895, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 89, "playtime_forever": 1115}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1506368518, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506368518, "recommendationid": "35209376", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "highly addicting, my roommate judged me while I stayed up to 6am to finish it", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 403, "steamid": "76561198069240963", "last_played": 1506669738, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 616}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505014433, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505014433, "recommendationid": "34852326", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Some of my friends admitted that they had heard of this game but passed it by as 'just another indie RPG'. If you've got the same impression from the game's description, please, hear me - it is anything but! Not 'just another' anything. By no means 'generic'. And not even an RPG (well, not what we usually call 'RPG'). And though it is (kind of) indie, it has basically none of the flaws usually associated with this tag. It is beautiful. It is polished. It has amazing soundtrack and VA (it is fully voiced, by the way).\nSo, about what it actually is.\nWitching Hour Studio did what I was hoping to see for a good long while. They approached the game itself as a mean to tell the story instead of way-to-popular approach: using the story to keep player from closing the game. It seems like a minor difference, but in fact it changes everything.\nIt is a story, in the first place. Beautiful, strong and completely linear narrative. And in this case I with no doubt put linearity as a 'pro'. Because not a once had I seen non-linear plot and choice-driven dialogs written at the level of a good book. Choices and branches simply put too many boundaries on the writers and the industry still has to learn to come over them.\nWell, with 'Masquerada' developers decided that they want to tell a story and got rid of everything that got in the way. And oh, they did it splendidly! Everything that works towards immersing player in the world, everything that amplifies emotional impact is refined to the point of perfection. Everything else is toned down and done well enough to neither distract nor cause any annoyance (well, save for companion's AI and checkpoint system. They actually CAN be annoying at times. Nothing too bad, though).\nI guess, it is quite obvious by now, that I absolutely LOVE this game.  \nIt is like all my prayers being answered:\n[list]\n[*] strong, entralling story with just the right measure of tragedy and comfort, despair and hope. It is way more, than I expected and way better than I can express. I'm sure to replay it more than once, just like I do re-read my favourite books. \n[*] beautiful, unique and very stylish world. Worldbuilding is fantastic. Society, (not)-religion (oh, how I love the way it is portrayed here! Most certainly not your generic Christianity/Greek mythology rip-off. And one of the most beautiful set of charnel traditions I've ever seen), politics and history, magic system - everything is beautiful and well-thought, everything fits together perfectly and contributes to the story. I highly advise reading all the Codex entries right upon finding them. Though, I think, the advice is unnecessary because of how wonderful the Codex itself is. It is not some paragraphs from schoolbook. No, instead it is protagonists' personal journal. It contains all sort of things: cold facts, dear memories, bits of philosophy, thoughts of things long gone and events now present.\n[*] wonderful, flawed, struggling, developing and very, very [i]alive[/i] characters. I loved them all. Their and their relationships' growth is absolutely believable and very touching (or, at times, heartbreaking). I've never acknowledged how forced and unnatural these things are in most AAA projects, till I played Masquerada. I've just thought something like 'well, games, genre, all the restrictions, you just can't expect book's level interactions here'. Now I know for certain - it can be done! And if choices need to be removed for this to happen - I personally am glad to send choices to hell. \n[/list]\nActually, this is already enough for me to like the game, but there is more:\n[list]\n[*] charming visuals. Living proof that you don't need bordering-real-life 3D (and cutting-edge graphics card for your players) to make the game truly beautiful and appealing. Animated comic-book styled cutscenes are also clever move, adding to overall impression.\n[*] fantastic soundtrack. Orchestra and choir and even in-game songs. The music is amazing by itself, but given it's match to the world's style and specifics of the world's traditions... I lack the words to express it. Just listen.\n[*] superb voice acting. Dialogs are fully and wonderfully voiced, I feel that it added so much to the characters' depth and overall perception. \n[*] Cicero Gavar. I know, I've said about characters earlier, but he deserves personal mention. Easily my favourite game protagonist and one of the best across other mediums. \n[/list]\nNow I need to stop with exaltation and say something about gameplay.\nPersonally I found it quite nice and entertaining. I've played on Storymode, though, so my opinion may be not the most worthy one.\nCombat is real-time with tactical pause, you've certainly seen enough of the kind. Two companions at one time, fallen party member can be resurrected right during the battle if you manage to channel long enough. Battles overall are fast-paced, positioning is quite important, skills are fun, varied and look nice. Some combos, if you manage skills carefully. No stats, no loot, no inventory, no grinding. Skill points are awarded for plot battles. You can choose an element near the beginning of the game, it defines available skills. Skills can be enhanced through not-very-big skill trees and easily respecked since certain point in the game. You can find new Mascherines on the locations, these will provide you with different ultimate abilities. Also you can find inks and engravings which will provide some additional benefits. That's about it.\nAt Storymode combat obviously was pretty easy, I had no need to actually setup party behaviour (there are some options that may be usefull on higher difficulties) or micro-manage the party, save for couple of battles, where companions were adamant about entering every single AoE (and there are quite a lot of AoEs!). On higher dificulties those suicidal tendencies may become annoying, I guess.\nI like so much how carefully every combat mechanics is woven into lore. It is a small touch, but it is so nice to feel during the combat that you are actually [i]in[/i] this world, adhering to its rules, feeling how your actions [i]fit[/i]. \nExploration is pretty straightforward: you see glowing circle - you go to it. Some are at open sight, to find others you'll need to do some walking around, but nothing too long or complicated. Personally I like this approach, since I still have nightmares about Deep Roads and endless doors and chests with nothing of interest (and my interest is lore) inside. Some can find it too easy and obvious - well, you've been warned.\nI also like how the tutorial is done - it is short story serving as a prequel to the main game. And even in tutorial you get lore, emotions and drama - to get you prepared for what awaits you in the main story.  \n\nMy review turned out to be an ominous wall of text, so TL;DR.\nPros:\n+ Story\n+ Characters (all of them and specifically protagonist)\n+ Worldbuilding\n+ Visuals\n+ [i]Soundtrack[/i]\n+ Voice acting\n+ Lots of well-written text in Codex\n+/-  Linearity and pretty lightweight gameplay (I think it is for the best, but some may disagree)\n- Companions AI\n- No manual saves.\n*If you are not well accustomed to high fantasy genre you may at first find yourself drowning in lots of Italian-esque terms. Brace yourself. It won't last long, though. Lore is given to you in thoughtful way, so after the first impact it won't be overwhelming. I am fan of the genre and had no troubles here, but I see how it may become an issue.\n\n'Masquerada' is beautiful, breathtaking and heartbreaking story with uforgettable, flawed, growing and alive characters set in unique and amazingly well-thought world. Visuals, VA and wonderful soundtrack greatly add to the experience, and nothing detract from it. Gameplay is solid even if not the deepest one. Unfortunately almost unseen game, acting outside customary boundaries (which makes it hard to determine it's genre - certainly not what is usually expected from the western RPG) and doing it splendidly.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1306, "steamid": "76561198141312600", "last_played": 1506981603, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_forever": 1306}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506901548, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501916", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506954737, "recommendationid": "35399542", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Looking Cool Joker!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 251, "steamid": "76561198276066602", "last_played": 1506922250, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 58, "playtime_forever": 251}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506750129, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506750129, "recommendationid": "35324222", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
