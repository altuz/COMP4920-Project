The first 2 levels start out really slow. One of your weapons is a piece of paper... that's right, paper cut your enemies into submission. The 3rd level actually picks up and you kill some monsters, but the game lacks direction on the levels. I ran around for a half hour trying to find the next door I needed to go through and then just gave up. I'm VERY easily scared, but even this game got boring very quickly. Also, if you don't figure out that you manually need to save, you'll die and go back to the very beginning of the game...
