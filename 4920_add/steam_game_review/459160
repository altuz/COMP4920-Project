Has the spirit of might and magic.  Has a great story and has something thats missing in newer mmos - open world pvp.  The game actually rewards time spent and equipment is usable at endgame even if playing solo to defend or PK. You can own an astral ship, an island, mounts, and a neat assortment of classes and races.  It even has cinemas, underwater combat, a lot of maps and pvp is not forced.  The population seems to be very stable.  \n\nThe bad? The f2p server does lean towards spending at least $10 a month in cash shop if you plan on staying on raids at end game however, I prefer this model of f2p vs archages or teras.\n\n  The P2P server is amazing on its own since all items are lootable and no cash shop item gives advantage.  The game reminds me of Ultima in a way.  I play on the f2p since I can fool around when not playing hard core and simply drop a few dollars and have them ready for when I want to play hard (considering incense lasts 30 days and doesnt cost more than 3 dollars - it was a good investment).\n\nIts pay2win if you've never played a semi-free game like tibia or fff, other that this is one of the most impressive and cheap freemium game around", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198048430032", "last_played": 1498081889, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_forever": 4406}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487098171, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1487098171, "recommendationid": "29926566", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Well, played on and off since 2011.. Game was always P2Win. Now with the new release of rentals with additional bonus of keeping fragments of what you rent it's well playable, I mean, a level 8 rune for a month is like $2.80 AUD. You also get Crystal chips to cover it worth like $2.50 so it's costing you next to nothing ($0.30c per rune) . All other items like this are similar and I would rather do this than sub over on another MMO. The main city is full most of the time. There's more people on here than on some WoW servers I've played. Community is pretty decent. Gotta love dat Steampunky Russian style on empire tho. I rate it 5/7.
