Why? What were the egyptian beliefs about life, death and the afterlife? What's the significance of the dog-headed Anubis figures? Who were the pharaohs and what was their role in egyptian society?\n\nIn practical terms the time spent on the treasure hunt section would have been better used to provide much deeper educational content. If people want to play a game on their Vive, this isn't going to be the title they reach for - so why spend time and resource developing it?
