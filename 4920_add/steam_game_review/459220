A casual RTS side story set in the Halo Universe before the Halo Event. A fantastic OST and Campaign for the nostalgic Halo fan. Some downsides are the clunky controls not aging well and multiplayer playerbase is quite dead.

It feels like how it did when I played it on my Xbox. I plug in my controller, because that's how I played it on the console, and it's like I never stopped playing it.\n2. It is a very simple Rock, Paper, Scissors RTS game that someone could learn quickly.\n3. It is a game where you can play on...\n- Easy - which makes enemies brainless so you can learn the game\n- Normal - where they show signs of aggression so you can step up your game against an enemy\n- Heroic - where the enemy starts getting aggressive much earlier introducing some rushing elements to challenge you\n- Legendary - which allows you to harness your ability to maximize on time, resources, and rotating units\n4. It feels like Halo without it being Halo. I can build Spartans and they be a presence as they take vehicles. Scorpion tanks feel and sound like they should. Banshees feel like they should. It doesn't feel like it's just a reskinned game to look like Halo.\n5. Introduces new vehicles and units that challenge certain army builds and counter others. \n6. You get all of the DLCs, which includes more than a handful of maps and modes, and it adds to the game.\n\nCons:\n1. In this version on Steam, the online/matchmaking element is... pretty bad. It requires you find games already set up in a pool of players that was small from the day it was released because of how you have to find lobbies with people. The random matchmaking element that was on the console version is gone. :(\n\nI loved this game on console and I love it here. A friend and I love to get on and play against computers to do silly stuff and see how fast we can get units up and size up. What kills this game is the horrible matchmaking system/lack there of. Because of this, there is no real true skill system. It killed the community very quickly. It's worth a buy on sale if you know you will have friends that will buy it with you and play every once in a while.
