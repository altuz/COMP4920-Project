Nearly all customization is taken out of your hands.\n\nFull Review:\nI really enjoyed the other games in this series but this one is just way too preachy for me. The author trys to shove his poltical stance down your throat. If you make a decsion not in line with his vision of the world the game condems you for it. This isn't how an enjoyable game is made. Sure you can punish the player for making gameplay mistakes like using a fire sword against a boss who heals from fire damage. However to punish the player for his or her opinion makes your game like a self righteous jerk. In the previous games you could tell the author leaned a certain way on the poltical spectrum but he didn't make the stroy revolve around it. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063355082", "last_played": 1460350302, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 192, "playtime_forever": 142}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1503425336, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512591", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503425336, "recommendationid": "34421098", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Is this good? That's why people check reviews right? Since a yes or no isn't the best method of stating endorsement. It's hard to say.\n\nWhat is has going for it, is what the others in the series did, it had a good grasp on how its world works and showing you how it works too. I loved th eoriginal trilogy of this writer.  I've gone through them five times, btu this was a struggle for the first. \n\nIt's decently written, but it's also the most preachy thing i've ever written. Even considering there was a completely forced dialogue in the second novel of the original trilogy where a bunch of characters have a completely uneventful argument about sexuality and gender, when none of them have really shown any real commitment to those issues. This? it just wants you to see the author's views and makes sure they're always present.\n\nThe other glaring issue, is the fact that although you direct what your character is, you lose all customisation. What happened to being able to fine tuen the colour of your beams and your costume? Instead of this, you're given different looks for each day to further represent the writer's beliefs. He's better than this, the writer should be able to makie a compelling story, without hamfisting socio-political commentary down your throat the whole time. \n\nEverything else i find issue in in this is covered by other reviews.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198070070375", "last_played": 1475558789, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 73, "playtime_forever": 819}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1503323773, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503323773, "recommendationid": "34395552", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I didn't expect it to be on the level of the original Heroes Rise trilogy.
