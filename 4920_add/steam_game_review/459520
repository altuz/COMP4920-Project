It is easy to understand the way of how it works and how to use what you have to create something, but as already been said here \u2014 this thing is easy to learn but hard to master. But still I love it as something quite unique.\nMyself I have both musical skill and above basic knowledge how to correctlty compose music, earlier I've sometimes had a mood to write polyfoniac melodies on many different voices, but I've got used to tabulature programs such as Guitar Pro or Power tab and tabs/notes themselves (actually, not counting them as a programs since I'm not a pro and usind them for personal joy), and this game at some point made me wonder \u2014 if it will be better to reccomend it for people who hates solf\u00e8ge to show that solf\u00e8ge as it is is not such a difficult thing as they may see it, or quite opposite \u2014 to reccomend it for ones who see solf\u00e8ge like crazy dark woods but still want to try to write songs somehow that they have in their minds. I can't say that game itself can really help to understand many-many composing rules, but at some point I think it even can be helpful for studying. Maybe, it can be helpful in both cases.  \nAnd I think kids should like it since it's a completely new point of view on the composing question, which is simple at understanding what to do and what you can get if you'll try to do something with a serious attitude. \n\nAnyway, it is a great idea and a great game to lost your head in it. It is still so much fun! Especially when because of drops bouncing not where you thought they will makes you think also about such things like improving personal geometrics... XD\n\nWell, still planning to beat it and create something serious with it, yep. Someday. I hope.
