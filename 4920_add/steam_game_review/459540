It's good. Not great. But it's fun and has a lot of charm. The price point is a touch steep for me, and I don't see it having all that much longevity, about 3 hours for a playthrough, or so. Replay value will probably trail off pretty quick, too, as you exhaust the dialogue for the girls you like best.  That in mind, waiting for a sale might not be a bad choice. Still, it's definitely worth playing.\n\nMost of the reviews I've seen cite the resolution as a major flaw of the game, and quite frankly that baffles me; not every indie japanese game that [i]barely[/i] gets a translation at all can get the Fruitbat treatment. Japanese games don't tend to support higher resolutions. Very often UI elements lock the game to the default resolution. I could see it being an issue if you have a tiny monitor that you're running above its native resolution, but if you happen to be that corner case, you are going to have other problems on a daily basis anyway, resolution of this game being least among them. It might be annoying, sure, but to say it makes it a terrible game by default would be funny if it weren't so sad. The game is perfectly playable as is. Saying it's some sort of criminal cash-grab because they didn't add higher resolution support is... bizarre. \n\nAdditionally I see a lot of complaints about a lack of transparency in the combat system, and enemy cards with low numbers frequently beating cards with higher numbers. This is because, [i]as the game points out in both the tutorial [b]and[/b] the tips section, card value is not the only determinant of victory[/i]. The number next to the move in your move list is also a major determining factor. If you have a punch card with a value of five for instance, and pick a level 5 punch, it will lose to an opponent with a level 2 card. \n\nThe phrasing in the tutorial could probably be clearer, but the tips section explains it rather plainly. If you don't understand the mechanics and yet you haven't bothered to look at the freely accessible help section, that is not necessarily the game's fault.\n\nThe game has a high amount of luck involved, but like any game that involves rolling dice, the strategy lies in minimizing the amount you have to rely on it. Choose skills that do so. \n\nAnd finally, I've seen a lot of complaints about how the game has ironman mode on at all times. Just back up your save if you don't want an engaging and tense experience. Seriously I've never seen so many people PC Master Race so hard about resolution without knowing how to PC.\n\nNow that that rant about how to play the game is out of the way, the game does have its fair share of problems. While the references were initially endearing, they're so constant throughout that it starts to grate after a while. \"Oh. The girl with a stand made another Jojo reference. How unexpected.\"\n\nThe inability to check what a character's moves do if she's not in your team is also brutal. While I could see it being because in reality you [i]wouldn't[/i] know what these moves are if you don't know the girl, it's rather frustrating in a gameplay environment, especially when the AI obviously has no such disadvantage.\n\nThe tutorial is a bit vague, and some of the wordings (particularly on the card value and move value subject) could use some clarification, and while the tips section helps, it doesn't explain everything (lax or strict club environments? That one i have only guesses on). There are useful tips on loading screens, but with no easy way to view all of them at once, it's not the best way to present that information. Additionally, some NPCs around the school will give \"useful\" advice, but since you have to spend AP to even wander the school, these conversations are a frustrating waste of money rather than actually helpful most of the time. \n\nThe art is quite nice, though. Combat portraits and everyday portraits are both very high quality, although the difference in style can be a bit jarring in some cases. Character writing is also quite wonderful as far as the girls I've seen, Liling best girl, though that might be heavily to taste. Several characters fell a little flat for me, though that too may just be taste in archetypes.\n\nOverall feels like the hate is unwarranted. People's main complaint being the resolution ought to make that obvious anyway.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013549332", "last_played": 1466061246, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 553, "playtime_forever": 404}, "votes_up": 47, "timestamp_created": 1465956579, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558954", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1465956797, "recommendationid": "23562733", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "\nI tried to like this game, I really did. \n\nThe art is great, the sound is decent and upbeat. The resolution didn't bother me and I don't care about saving.\n\nHowever, this game has a combat system that is punishing, random, and lacks transparency. I can forgive a game for any one of those three, but games--like this one--that combine the three are not fun. \n\nCombat is punishing. Mistakes incur devastating penalties.\n\nCombat is random. Each round you are given 5 random cards, each of which has a rank from 1-5 and an attack type (punch, kick, throw, etc). It sounds intriguing, but then the reality of RNG stes in: your boxer--who only deals damage with one of the 6 card--may *easily* go 5 rounds in a row without drawing a card that permits you to use a punch. IF you do get a card that permits a punch, it may then be a rank so low that the attack will fail. Combine that with the devastating penalties, and you have numerous occasions where the game gives you the illusion of choosing your attacks, but the underpinning gameplay reality is that all your choices result in failure. \n\nCombat is not transparent. It isn't clear what moves win and when they win. What is clear is that the CPU opponent will always win ties. Sometimes, the CPU will use a low ranked card and higher ranked card will still lose; this would be okay if your lower ranked card sometimes won. They don't, and you get no explanation why.\n\nThere are so many great games available on Steam that I feel cheated when a belligerent developer insists on this type of bad gameplay and poor instructions.

I'm glad I did, though, as this game is a lot of fun. The developers must have paid attention to the reviews about the resolution and full screen mode, as these features have been changed now and I ran the game beautifully in full screen. \n\nI found the tutorials and the tip pages to be just fine in teaching me how to play the game. Sure, the systems aren't fully transparent, but that would take the fun out of the game if they were. Part of the challenge and enjoyment of this game is trying to figure out what works best in combat and training. There is a learning curve, and you should expect to lose a few matches (or even lose the game on your first play through.) If everything was handed to you right away it wouldn't be any fun.\n\nI will admit the random card values and odd tiebreak system did upset me from time to time. While it may seem like the computer wins ties more often, if you play enough you will see it does even out. Unfortunately, I hated when the rng failed me. My first playthrough I was in the finals and both teams were down to a single girl. My girl was half health and the opponent was at a sliver. My three highest cards were all 4s, and my opponent got all 5s, and I lost. Fortunately, the game autosaves before the final so you can replay those as much as you need to in case you get hosed by the rng. \n\nI think the replay factor on this game is great. There are a ton of combinations of girls to choose from, and each has a wide variety of moves they could learn. With the numerous strategies for training, coordinating the girls, and leanring moves, I'm excited to play through a few more times to see which strategy can work the best.\n\nI got this on sale ($11) and I think it was a great deal at that price.
