On the upside, if this review looks too long to bother with then it's a fair indication that R.C. Bot Inc. isn't the game for you, since time and patience are both required in abundance.\n\nThe gameplay is easy to describe: a third-person physics-based game where you (barely) take control of a quadrupedal bot and two support vehicles - a carrier truck capable of transporting the bot and a drone that can quickly survey the area and establish custom camera angles. The bot's task is to parachute into an environment and collect, capture or fight targets with the aid of on-board tools including harpoons and a cannon. However, this is somewhat secondary to the [i]real[/i] hook of the game which is the way you control the bot. All input from the controller acts upon real-world concepts modelled with nVidia's PhysX engine; for example, the rotation of a joint or the exertion of force by a thruster. The entire game consists of manipulating these real-world concepts to drive the bot and achieve the goal.\n\nThis is going to be a divisive title. Some will love it, some will hate it and even those in the former camp should be prepared for a steep learning curve and a lot of frustration while picking up the basics. It took me over an hour to master the art of merely standing up; in any normal game, standing up is not an art to be mastered - you generally just start that way. But R.C. Bot Inc. is not a normal game, it's barely even a game but rather a very detailed physics simulation with some objectives thrown in to challenge your mastery of the simulation.\n\nTypically I'd clock up far more than 6 hours before reviewing a game of this nature but it's already clear that this is a very unique title that has taken considerable skill to create and has a lot to offer to technically-minded fans of physics-based gaming, if they can rise to the challenge of a deep and all-encompassing simulation. This is likely to be a relatively small niche of players but the game certainly deserves better than the 0% positive rating it holds at the time of writing. This is based on two reviews totalling 0.6 hours playtime combined; I can empathise, I hadn't even managed to stand up after 0.6 hours! Casual gamers beware, this is [i]not[/i] a pick-up-and-play game. The controls are so complicated that the developers have documented them in an on-screen overlay that you can keep open and refer to while playing. It really has to be seen to be believed:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=737256708\n\nYou know you're in for a rough ride when it's a challenge to even comprehend the control scheme. Notice in the background there are further instructions printed on large boards - this is the tutorial map where there are several of these to augment the help overlays. Did I mention there's another help overlay accessible from the main menu? Well, there is!\n\nDespite all the information in the game, its presentation is rather lacking. The menus are cluttered and chaotic and the tutorial is minimal, throwing you in at the deep end with little more than the gloriously mind-boggling control overlay and a few tips scattered around the map. On parachuting into the level you'll immediately topple over and writhe around randomly for 20 minutes before taking up the game's offer to press Return and display the control scheme. You'll then spend another 20 minutes staring blankly at the control scheme - this may be enough to break you. If you insist on persevering, give it another 20 minutes and you'll realise that you're an hour into the game and barely any better than when you first started.\n\nHowever, with sufficient hand-eye coordination and a growing understanding of the mappings between controller inputs and the PhysX-modelled devices they actuate in-game, determined players should begin to see some method in the apparent madness and the control scheme starts to feel oddly natural. Patterns of input become increasingly apparent, for example the pattern required to actuate the various joints on the bot's legs to achieve a walking motion. It's still difficult to master because you have so many controls to oversee; the bot has four legs and two arms, each articulated in two places (hip and knee or shoulder and elbow respectively). With L1 held down, the left stick controls the shoulder joints and the right stick controls the elbow joints. With R1 held down, the left stick controls the hip joints and right stick controls the knee joints. This may remind you of gag games like OctoDad that have deliberately difficult or imprecise controls, but the comparison doesn't stand; the control scheme isn't deliberately abstruse, it's necessarily complex.\n\nR2 fires thrusters on the bot's four feet which allows for limited flight or instantly flips you over if the bot isn't perfectly balanced. And it never will be, so flight is a literal balancing act that requires perfect control of all four legs and both arms simultaneously. You may find yourself working two or three buttons and both analogue sticks at the same time so dexterity with the controller is a must. The game provides some assistance here but not by simplifying the simulation; the developers clearly want to remain as close to real-world physics as possible, so to aid with flight they've modelled another real-world construct - a gyroscope. This works exactly as you would expect it to (i.e. maintains balance but only while the force of its angular momentum exceeds the force of gravity trying to displace it). This is a small touch but it impressed me, as it demonstrates the developers' dedication to maintaining an accurate simulation. There are no compromises here, no artificial aids, no scripting and no subversion of the core physics simulation to make the gameplay more forgiving. The result is an extremely hard game but an extremely accurate simulation.\n\nThere's a lot more to be said about this ambitious title; I haven't even mentioned bot customisation (allowing part variants that affect the simulation accordingly), but this review has gone on for long enough and hopefully served its purpose. This is [b]not[/b] a game for everyone, it caters to a fairly niche audience of physics-based gaming enthusiasts, but the reviews to date are an unfair portrayal of a very competent game. If you don't think you can muster an hour or more with it then don't buy it because you [i]will[/i] leave with a bad impression. But if it resonates with you and you're willing to put in some time and bear some frustration it can be very rewarding. It took me an hour just to stand up but by the 6 hour mark I was effortlessly back-flipping the bot into a handstand and walking upside down on its arms. Mastering the simulation can be arduous but the pay-off is immensely satisfying.\n\nObligatory pros and cons:\n\n(+) Built with best-in-class middleware (UE4, PhysX).\n(+) Amazing value for money (currently on sale for $1.99).\n(+) One of the most uncompromisingly accurate physics simulations ever to grace a game.\n(+) Solid graphics and performance.\n(+) Auto-configured itself perfectly on my system but still has...\n(+) Plenty of graphics settings to tweak (press space in-game).\n(+) A very rewarding experience to master - if you can.\n\n(-) Rather bewildering and inaccessible to new players.\n(-) Steep learning curve that casual players are unlikely to surmount.\n(-) Cluttered menus/UI that lack finesse and can be unintuitive to navigate.\n(-) Certain UI conventions are ignored, adding to the navigation issues; e.g....\n(-) The Escape key immediately quits to desktop (menu please, everyone expects it).\n(-) Some camera issues, e.g. reset (R3) positions it directly above your bot looking down (a totally useless viewpoint that you'll immediately have to adjust).\n\nHighly recommended to some, but only you can say whether you fit the niche.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198166230474", "last_played": 1470246396, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 1273, "playtime_forever": 387}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1470284352, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519536", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1470284352, "recommendationid": "24701849", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is just my opinion, but I feel that this is the worst \"game\" I've ever purchased in my life.
