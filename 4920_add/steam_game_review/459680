The result is a game that is fairly easy to learn the basics of, but which presents emergent complexity through combinations of simple behaviors.\nI really recommend that if you try it, try to reach rank 4 or so before making up your mind.  It'll burrow into the back of your mind and roost there. :-)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197998765120", "last_played": 1504337285, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 263, "playtime_forever": 269}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1492808287, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500784", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492808287, "recommendationid": "31283263", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not really that fun.
