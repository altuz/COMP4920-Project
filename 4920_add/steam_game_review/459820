When you actually have the game opened, your time will be spent getting the required criteria to \"level up\" your relationship with a girl. When you run out of money or lack the skill level to further improve relationships, you'll need to earn (in-game) money and train your skills, which happen in real time. Therefore, you can either leave the game idle or just close the game with the meters running; you'll reap the rewards the next time you open the game.\n\nSo here's the thing: while I said it's a cleverly disguised dating sim, it is not, in fact, a dating sim. That's because your ultimate goal is to max out the relationship with all the available girls, so you don't really make any important choices like picking one girl over the other. There are no negative choices you can make that will ruin your relationship with any girl, no quizzes with right and wrong answers. It's just a grind from start to finish, rinse and repeat kind of game. Probably the only things you do in this game are clicking on the girls for hearts [spoiler](which is something easily accomplished with an auto-clicker software)[/spoiler] and planning your activities efficiently, the latter which gets stale late game when you have more than enough time blocks.\n\nThe plus side about this gem is that it has a somewhat nice art style. That, and the girls' not-so-subtle reference to modern pop culture. You have your standard line-up of a [i]tsundere[/i], a gamer girl, and a \"cosplaying\" cat girl, but there are also girls who are also right out of other genres ([b]SPOILERS![/b]: [spoiler]Ayano is from the Yandere Simulator game, Iro is a reference to Rainbow Dash from the My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic cartoon[/spoiler], etc.) so if you're a modern day geek like me, you'd give the game points just for those.\n\nI would recommend this game, since it's free anyway; you have nothing to lose but your virginity. Wait, scratch that last part...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "steamid": "76561198286517247", "last_played": 1507197070, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 335}, "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_created": 1488273978, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532963", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1488273978, "recommendationid": "30236971", "votes_funny": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Idle Games all follow the same pattern. You have resources (time), you allocate these resources to gather goods (money or hobby levels), you use goods to gather more resources (more time blocks). You hit a ceiling at some point in which more resources cannot be obtained; then you \"reset\" and in the next incarnation certain benefits take place (prestige bonus) that allow you to break through the previous ceiling.\n\nThis category of game is very little about gaming, and more about managing resources and achievement hunting. Usually the premise doesn't play any role, but CrushCrush tries to shine in its market by offering the \"dating simulator\" premise (which is VERY questionable), kawaii waifus and a very, very, VERY pink interface. But by far the most attractive point of CrushCrush is the fact that it is \"F2P\". Quotes intended.\n\nAs I said, the premise doesn't matter for this kind of game, but it has its touch of humour at some points which is a plus. The art is okay, awkward sometimes. What kills it - beware my friends - is the fact that there is a limit in \"resetting\". And it is not of the reasonable kind.\n\nAfter the obtaining the modest 2048 multiplier, your resets give you no further benefit and by all means there is not a reason to reset anymore. Alternatively... you can keep going further by affording Speed Boosts in the \"$$$ Store <3\". Of f***ing course. Let me give you an idea of [i]how bad[/i] it is, shall I? So if you spend, let's say, 10$-ish and get a x64 Speed Bonus, you'll have a 2048x64 multiplier. Having in mind the wooping 2048x8192 multiplier, it doesn't take a genious to realize that Speed Bonuses are [i]absolutely necessary[/i] for this game. As a F2P you can afford some of these Speed Boosts with bonuses you get along the game, but nowhere near the 8192. Sadly, I did buy the bonus at the beginning before I realized that this game was unreasonably unbalanced.\n\nDon't go on trying to defend the game devs by throwing the \"it is supposed to last forever!!\" kind of cards. According to the maths in the official forums, a F2P player would need, after obtaining the maximum Prestige and free Speed Bonus, 2 years to unlock the last two girls. I am not talking about two years of fun, dedication and love. I am talking about two years of [i]not playing the game[/i], because there is absolutely [i]nothing[/i] more to do there, other than [i]waiting two bloody years[/i]. Even for a game that it is [b]*not*[/b] about gaming, this has crossed the line between the \"lulz\" and the \"wth? O.o\"\n\nAdvice to the devs: tune your game down, Karma and Sutra are unreasonable. It takes about a week for someone with MAXED stats to get Golden Slippers. I'd wait a week if your game had something else to offer during this week, but when instead it literally tells me \"forget me, come back next week\" I might as well not come back at all. Lift the Prestige Bonus Limit, or at least raise it. A Lot. Add more girls in between Karma and Luna to help F2P to farm Diamonds for Speed Boosts.\n\nAlso, personal advice: this game is hosted somewhere else, a website which has been rumoured to scam customers with \"fake drop ratios\" for some of the other games they host.
