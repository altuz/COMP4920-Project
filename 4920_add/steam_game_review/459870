A bit clunky but what isn't at first? The concept is straightforward... movement and key frames with curves. It doesn't get much simpler. This is a good start to a great concept. Really interested to watch it develop further. I had no problem in getting started with basic movement of a spacecraft model. Keep in mind it is Early Access... while this means fewer features it also means helping the dev shape the final release with your feedback.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197975864970", "last_played": 1463023915, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 121, "playtime_forever": 85}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1462942805, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517005", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1462942805, "recommendationid": "22906354", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I have been porting over alot of SFM models, and it has been working pretty well.  A few times the armatures get a little weird, things like legs/arms bending the wrong way, and not sure how to make additional bones available to be articulated in 'game'.  Looking forward to more features.  Having animations play in room scale VR is awesome, and honestly a game changer, but still a lot of work to be done.   I have even imported a few of my 3D printer objects and being able to walk around them is awesome.  Need to find a way to add an in engine light source or two.  Having a couple of 'flashlights' would help.  Doing everything through the SDK would be a little cumbersome for most, not sure if it is OK to reupload other peoples stuff into the workshop with the new format, so I am keeping it all local right now, but it really only takes a about 15-20 minutes to convert once you get the hang of it.\n\nHope the developer stays active!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007429937", "last_played": 1491413752, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 651, "playtime_forever": 387}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1474662630, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510022", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1474662630, "recommendationid": "25657175", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "pretty fun to play around with.
