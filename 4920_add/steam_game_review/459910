Take 'The Impossible Game', slap on even more crudely drawn Microsoft paint images and a supposed \"coffin\" containing your hero, absurdely hard jumps, and you get this nightmare of a title that doesn't even let you play without solving the riddle of the fucking sphynx. \n\nOf course, this is referring to the game during launch. If you're not sure how to get to the game until it's fixed (which the developer has informed me is being worked on), simply load game, close game at difficulty select, start game again, choose continue game, then first stage. (Or just click the giant red START I chocked up to being a header given it's placement. Again, developer clarified this)\n\nThe first stage is passable but don't ask me how the hell I did it. Thumbs up for recomendation simply because it lives up to exactly what the title says. You're experience on level 2 and beyond may vary though. I also fear the later two difficulties and what hell they shall bring with them.\n\nJust keep calm, and carry on.
