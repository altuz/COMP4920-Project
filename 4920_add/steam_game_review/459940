And the controls are absolutely terrible and not always responsive.  You open a container to see clothes inside, you pick up an axe, you re-arrange deer paintings on the wall.  I have no idea why I did those things other than give you busy work in a game.  You collect freaking antlers!\n\nHowever, the story is actually good.  And the atmosphere the game creates in such a short period is also not just good, but immersive (which VR titles should be).  You start running along and you feel like the you are the protaganist in the story.  Spoiler alert: [spoiler] I felt like Deer Man, I got why I, as the protaganist would feel a sense of keeping up the ethos of the Deer man [/spoiler]\n\nYou don't have to agree with the moral of the story.  But I bet if you experienced this game, you will understand the moral of the story.  And you will understand why the author is so passionate about it.   You'll feel something.  And I just have to recommend this game based on the low price and how it makes you feel something.  There's definitely more than $2 entertainment value here.\n\nRating 6/10 ... I experienced no crashes or jitters on i7 1060 GTX [spoiler] forget collecting the antlers and you'll enjoy the game more [/spoiler]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1505529743, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 38}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505534819, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505534951, "recommendationid": "34987192", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
