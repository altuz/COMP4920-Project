I don't think [i]Bob Came in Pieces[/i] is an outright bad game, it's just a game I can't get used to, nor do I find any fun in it.\n\nThe basic idea is sound and actually somewhat original: controling Bob, you have to travel through several levels in order to collect the missing parts of his ship (Bob is a spaceship that came down to earth in pieces). There are several obstacles on the way, most of those objects that have to be removed or replaced (well, in the few levels I played anyway). By putting together Bob in the right way on the work-pads, you can figure out how to overcome the obstacles/puzzles: putting an extra engine in one of the slots makes a huge difference, and there's a \"pull beam\" that lets you pull away objects. At least, theoretically. Since the controls of this game are off-target to say the least, controlling Bob once some pieces of the spaceship have been adjusted, became a nightmare. Even more problematic is that the game relies on physics to solve puzzles - bu the physics seem to have been hugely overdone, with every action leading to a much greater reaction than I would ever expect. That makes the game nearly unplayable for me - although I would love to progress further into the apparently well designed levels and discover more of Bob's pieces, the controls and physics just don't let me do so. Graphics and sound do a pretty good job, so all the more regrettable that the gameplay let me down.\n\nWith over 80 achievements, of which the greater part have only been achieved by under 2% of all players, this game seems like a nightmare for achievement hunters. Apart from achievements for completing levels & gathering spaceship parts (fair enough!), there are lots and lots for finishing the levels within a certain time limit. These limits are set so extremely tight, that those achievements are only for the most stubborn gamers out there, or for these who figure out the wonky controls to perfection. People looking for another 100% game, definitely should skip this one, and it won't help in getting a good average completion rate either.\n\nBut there's a fair chance anyone else can actually figure things out, and enjoy this game. It's just not my cup of tea, I guess.\n\n[b]Not recommended, unless you're very good at solving physics puzzles and have lots of patience[/b]"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1456611256, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526669", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "21509782", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000560738", "num_reviews": 800, "last_played": 1456659779, "num_games_owned": 5356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1295}, "timestamp_updated": 1456611256, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Real dedication is when you love your job so much that you\u2019re willing to travel across the surface of a vast alien world to find all the ship parts necessary to repair your damaged craft, rocket back into the cosmos, and then jet to work to punch-in on time. Even if such an extreme dedication to the nine-to-five grind work doesn\u2019t ring as true with everyone, Bob Came in Pieces is still an intriguing indie game that blends exploration and problem solving puzzle elements with a strong physics engine and a lovely design to create a whimsical adventure.\n\nBob loves the freedom to dress casually and chat all day on the phone, and who wouldn\u2019t? Except Bob is a green octopus-like alien that works as a telemarketer in a crummy cubicle at an intergalactic call center. While most of his co-workers don\u2019t share his enthusiasm for the less than stellar gig, he\u2019s pleased as punch to clock in each day and go about his normal work routine. Unfortunately for Bob, his commute to work is cut short one day when his ship is struck by a wayward meteor. And his day doesn\u2019t get much better from there.\n\nLosing his hyper drive unit, as well as numerous other crucial chunks of his ship, he crash lands on a strange planet without help in sight. In order to get Bob back to work, you\u2019ll guide what\u2019s left of his spacecraft through different and interestingly designed areas of the planet to recover missing parts and the ever-important hyper drive system. What makes the explorative journey so fascinating is that you\u2019ll use the junk parts you recover along the way to constantly re-build and re-design Bob\u2019s ship to overcome the obstacles you run into.\n\nBoth above and below the surface, the mysterious, earth-like planet is rife with mechanical contraptions designed to impede your progress. Among giant locking mechanisms and puzzles that must be assembled you\u2019ll find trigger plates to depress, large objects to move, and force fields to circumvent, alongside more peculiar hurdles. While solving puzzles on the first few stages only require some basic common sense, these impediments grow increasingly complex and you\u2019ll have to make more drastic alterations to your ship to proceed.\n\nYour core ship is a small orb with eight bolt points where additional parts can be attached. As you explore the planet, you\u2019ll find basic extender parts, various hinges, and several special functioning items that you can combine and assemble onto your vessel. Most levels have multiple hotspots where you can stop and freely play around with re-designing your ship using any parts you\u2019ve collected. Frequent experimentation is necessary. For example, one area may require you to assemble a long hook-like fixture to your ship in order to flick a hard-to-reach switch. Other areas require you to attach a pushing or pulling device to manipulate rocks, mechanical devices, and other gadgets you find.\n\nBut it\u2019s not as easy as just dropping anything onto Bob\u2019s ship willy-nilly. The game features a dynamic physics system, and the more you add to your ship, the more it affects how it handles in accordance with balance and gravity. Plunking down too much junk on your craft without beefing up your boosters will render you virtually immobile, and you can only move in certain directions if you have boosters located on the opposite end to push you. The realistic physics make designing your ship a fun challenge, and tinkering around with the different parts to see what you can come up with to solve each problem is equally entertaining.\n\nThe levels, puzzles, and the overall visual worlds in Bob Came in Pieces are really nicely put together. While it\u2019s great to focus on the task at hand, you\u2019ll also find yourself taking a moment to soak in the colorful backgrounds and unique terrain designs. Also, the way some contraptions are put together is pretty brilliant.\n\nThere are 14 stages to go through which doesn\u2019t take terribly long to accomplish, but you can revisit previously completed stages to try for a faster time. And there are plenty of things you\u2019ll miss on the first go around due to initially having limited parts. Sprucing up your ship with the cool technology unlocked later on in the game makes it worth going back to check out where else you can use it. Bob Came in Pieces oozes creativity and rewards you for noodling around to your heart\u2019s content. It\u2019s easy to get into but hard to stop playing once you\u2019ve been hooked."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1318090088, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500603", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "1547271", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197994527992", "num_reviews": 113, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 1817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 379}, "timestamp_updated": 1318090088, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Belated review.
