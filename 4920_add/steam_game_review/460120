All the characters are their usual quirky selves.  The 4th wall gets shattered, and rebuilt for the sole purpose of shattering it again.  There's a ton of meta references.  And the new characters are cool, especially Uzume (no she didn't slip me any credits to say that).  Basically, everything you enjoy from previous titles.\n\nThere were a few small changes made: some good and some bad.  I liked that they tied the weapons to their own combos, and combo traits to ensure crits, because it causes you to think about what style works best for you and realize not every new weapon is necesarily better for you.  I enjoy the strategy part of a game, and this added to it.  Not just picking out the newest weapon because this time it may not be better for you.\n\nThe investment system was fine although forgettable and I didnt really find a need to develop items much at all.\n\nDifficulty-wise, it's usually not difficult (except optional dungeons), but there were some situations in the main dungeons where if you fought a certain enemy it was pretty much a game over, and every enemy will actively chase you and outrun you.  Wasn't too thrilled about that.  I don't mind difficulty, but some consistency would have been nice.\n\nThe new share system was a mixed bag for me.  Shares going down from being attacked did not make sense to me because taking damage in RPGs is a given and should not be penalized.  You could also game the system through scouts and investment, but at least it would negate the damage issue.\n\nScouts seems like a mixed bag.  They are both necessary and not.  They help you find new dungeons, items, and enemies, which can help you unlock quests, but the luck dependency can make this a chore, and makes quest hunting less prevalent than previous games.  Better than the Stella dungeons though, in my opinion.\n\nMy biggest issue though is the route building, which was pointless, but also having to traverse the entire world over and over again, instead of  teleporting.  I HATED going to Lowee and then back to Planeptune all the time, because you would get randomly jumped by usually very weak enemies, like Dogoos, leading to very pointless fights that should not even be there, sometimes a dozen times per trip.  And then I had one time when I got jumped by a enemy so powerful it one-shotted my entire party, leading to a very frustrating game over.  Really wish that system goes out or gets an overhaul.\n\nStill though, very very enjoyable and I'm glad I spent 50+ hours on this.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198055075965", "last_played": 1505880223, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 168, "playtime_forever": 2943}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505925057, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509585", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505925057, "recommendationid": "35087576", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Another Great game from the hyperdimension seires. adds a whole new TRANSFORMATION!! super sick! boss fights a whole new experience too!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198089933978", "last_played": 1490487749, "num_reviews": 85, "num_games_owned": 121, "playtime_forever": 1919}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505443693, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504395", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505443693, "recommendationid": "34962538", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "vert ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198183709110", "last_played": 1505659764, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 58, "playtime_forever": 1152}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505785633, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500780", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505785633, "recommendationid": "35056165", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I have no friends...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "steamid": "76561198037305979", "last_played": 1506901522, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 549, "playtime_forever": 3569}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505706672, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501199", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505706672, "recommendationid": "35038307", "votes_funny": 6, "voted_up": true}]}
