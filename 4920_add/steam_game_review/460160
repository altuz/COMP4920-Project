I am... unsure how to describe it. I guess the first thing is it likely takes place sometime during the \"common\" rotue of Fruit, as none of the girls seem to be on their paths. Also, Michiru appears to be the main character, so it seems to have something in common with Idol Magical Girl Chiru Chiru Michiru. Also, it is a comedy, rather than the more serious themes Fruit goes into (not that Fruit doesn't have a lot of laughs).\n\nFor the price, it is decent. And if you already are a fan of the Grisaia games, you will like it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "last_played": 1502746852, "num_reviews": 362, "num_games_owned": 445, "playtime_forever": 67}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502645411, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502645411, "recommendationid": "34218736", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
