The PC port is basically the same game with more levels and campaign options, so if you bought the 360 version you won't be disappointed.\n\nIt's a charming and simple game where you blow up things with a rocket launcher, and the entire game uses pixelated characters and terrain (which is also destructible) in a unique enough way to make it interesting. Some of the levels are legit challenging but the game is not especially difficult. There's plenty of replayability with its additional campaigns and game modes, and the soundtrack is pretty cool too (though I much prefer the Xbox 360 version's menu theme to this one.) I find myself quoting the lyrics to the song (Rocket Riot Rocket Riot) from time to time around a good friend who also played this game.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game. It's not perfect (sometimes you die in a cheap way by getting blocked by something and firing a rocket isn't the most responsive 100% of the time), but still charming and interesting enough. Its main campaign is a bit short but it's pretty fun. I definitely prefered mouse controls to gamepad, it makes it easier to aim. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "steamid": "76561198023175868", "last_played": 1505629634, "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 164, "playtime_forever": 287}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1484681733, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1484681733, "recommendationid": "29322920", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fun game but really good do with multiplayer like on the xbox360.\nFrom forum, looks like devs are working on it", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197973763460", "last_played": 1501016183, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 85}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1484672831, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1484672831, "recommendationid": "29320243", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Holy smokes, I had no idea this game was on steam!
