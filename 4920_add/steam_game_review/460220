Haven't tried hard or survival or co-op yet.\n\ntl;dr: Game is effing amazing, for sure worth the $10 or less.\n\nVery competently done shooting, with a couple little details  that really click with me.  For instance, the enemies don't just fly by you in formation, they often break off and circle around and try to hit you a couple times before flying offscreen.  It suggests dogfighting in a way that most other shooters don't at all.\n\nThe upgrade system is well done as well.  A few upgrades are absolute no-brainers, but the majority are either situational or a matter of preference.  Upgrade progress is reset after each set of levels and each set has different starting ships, so you get to play around with slightly different options every so often.  Ships are also fairly balanced with each other, although a couple do fill similar roles.\n\nThe main draw is the ability to switch between four different ships on the fly.  This serves three purposes.\n1) Dodging.  During the second or so it takes to switch ships, you can't be hit.  This allows you to avoid those frustrating shooter moments when you're backed into a corner by enemies and bullets and can't help but be hit.\n2) Preserving damaged ships. \n3) Picking the best ship for the situation.  This is the most interesting part.  Encounter a big powerful gunship?  Switch to the ship with the strong but slow-firing railgun.  Bunch of asteroids filling up the screen?  Switch to a smaller, more nimble ship.  And so on.\n\nReplayability seems high.  Enemies don't attack in a set order and vary considerably from level to level and set to set.  Each enemy is itself a fairly unique sort of threat, hence each combination of enemies requires a bit of strategy.  Once unlocked, any ship can be used on any set.  Hard mode is unlocked after completing the game on easy.\n\nI don't normally bother writing reviews, but this is an A+ indie shooter that definitely deserves it.  Maybe not the be-all-end-all of shooters, maybe not enough of a challenge for hardcore fans of the genre, but Xenoraid is the most fun that this casual shooter fan has had lately.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198394692579", "last_played": 1505774065, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 147, "playtime_forever": 662}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1502777389, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508197", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502777389, "recommendationid": "34250000", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Nice little shoot'em up. I like the ability to swap ships during combat, which makes you impossible to hit for a second or two and allows you to dodge bullets - due to this you don't have to be absolutely precise in all your moves. Obviously, this makes a game a lot easier, so don't think that hardcore gamers would love it. But I am casual gamer so i do.\nNot much else to say, really.
