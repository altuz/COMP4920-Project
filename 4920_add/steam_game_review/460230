I suspect the rest of the review will sound somewhat negative so it's important to bear that in mind. If you're looking for a \"Football Manager for horse racing,\" as Starters Orders is so often described, this is as close as you are going to get at the present moment.\n\nIndeed, in some ways this is a throwback to the text-only games of yore. The majority of the action takes place ensconced at the training center of your farm, preparing your horses for upcoming races, participating in auctions, selecting sires and dams for breeding, and so on. The only non-text based aspect of the game are the races themselves, which, unless you are playing in jockey mode (I never do), will only be a video for you to watch.\n\nNone of that is necessarily a bad thing, bear in mind. The allure of a game like this isn't the action, exactly, although it can be surprisingly exciting watching one of your homebreds charge down the homestretch of a graded stakes race. Instead, the pleasure is in the puzzle of it all, piecing together the clues to outwit your fellow owners, identify undervalued bloodstock, chart campaigns for your runners, and so on. Much of that can be done in real life on pen and paper. So it is here as well.\n\nAs with any uncanny valley situation, it's the deviations from the areas of the game that come closest to being realistic that are the most grating. Players are offered the option of starting in any of four geographic locations, but all of the games are heavily anglocentric. Race meets last a handful of days at most and pop up at random throughout the calendar. Only two tracks conduct meets on any given day. 12+ furlong races are common. Betting is done with a bookmaker. And then there are the peculiarities that can't be chalked up to Englishness. Claiming races are largely replaced by \"selling races\" in which the horses running are entered into an auction following the race, not a sale at a set price before the race. Two year old racing begins on January 1. Yearlings are not available for sale. Auctions take place every single day.\n\nThe root of the problem may be that the game attempts to encompass *every* aspect of the sport. This would be daunting on any budget, but it's folly for a smaller developer. The betting and jockey portions of the game are weak (the latter is especially jarring, as even mobile games have progressed well past what Starters Orders displays). Overseas racing includes both the flats and the hunts. Every add-on like this creates its own complexities - and this for a game that can't manage a proper tutorial (or even elimination of typos from game text).\n\nLest this all sound too negative, it's worth pointing out what Starters Orders does so well. The calculations that go into the racing seem, from afar, to be impressive; you can tell from watching a race when a horse is running outside of his comfort zone or was compromised by a difficult trip. The breeding engine feels similarly sophisticated. The racing itself is reasonably realistic, though nits can be picked. Several mods are readily available, though none quite solves the problems identified above.\n\nAll in all, Starters Orders is a decent time sink. If you are a horse racing fan, you could do a whole lot worse. In fact, it's the closeness to being great that vexes. With a little focus, Starters Orders could indeed reach a status among horse racing fans like that held by Football Manager among footie fans.
