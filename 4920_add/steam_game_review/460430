Maybe a bit longer than is the norm, but my husband and I love to voice act the 'thought' portions of the game, so we take our time with the game. \n\n+ Most characters have a unique and interestering personality and background (though I can't stand Rebecca...).\n+ Lots of choices throughout the game.\n+ Choices matter. A choice you made in chapter one is going to affect your whole playthrough.\n+ Overall great voice acting.\n+ The monster/antagonist (however you want to call her) is truly scary. There is a great progression in the fear she instills in the player and the characters alike. \n+ Great CGs.\n+ Every QTE is different and therefore more interesting than simple repetition. Also you can skip them. \n+ Many different endings. Good endings, bad endings, meh endings. \n+ I'm on my fourth or fifth playthrough which is entirely different from my first one. It is exciting to see the effect of all your choices and how they influence the story. This time around is almost completely different from the first playthrough.\n+ Wonderful visual style, especially in the journal and epilogue. \n+ In the menu you can see all CGs, endings, objects, achievements, everything you have unlocked.  \n\n- This game suffers from cluncky dialogue sometimes. Which manifests itself in some sentences with horrendous grammar or an obsession with words like shoulder. \n- This game's story/dialogue needs some serious editing. There are parts where the story progresses soooo slowly. Mostly the parts with the inner dialogue and mostly concerning Rebecca or Isabella. \n- Sometimes inner dialogue/thoughts get interrupted by spoken dialogue. The inner dialogue then carries on from the point before, which sometimes makes it very easy to lose that train of thought. Same with references like 'the former' and 'the latter', referring to things said/thought ages ago. \n- There are some bits of voice acting missing from chapter 5 onwards (though I believe they are trying to fix this). \n\nOverall I can only applaud this great visual style and mostly compelling story. With their next game they should probably hire a native English speaker to check their dialogue and they should probably hire an editor to weed out the tedious bits.

I have played through it three times now to get different endings. I am a big fan of text-based adventure games in general so I was excited to play this one, and it does have a lot of choices that affect the direction of the story, so that's its strong point.\n\nIt's not scary at all. The \"bad guy\" pops up occasionally to offer up some jump scares, so if you are easily frightened then maybe you will find it horror-like, but that part was really disappointing, particularly since I'm a big fan of Japanese horror films as well. Plus the animation is so cartoony that it detracts from any horror elements that are present.\n\nAlso, a lot of the story and dialogue is childish and focuses a lot on long rambling internal monologues about what one character thinks about another. I think a preteen might enjoy that kind of thing, but as someone who is nearly 30 I found it really tedious and unnecessary to the story. The creators should have focused a lot more on the horror aspect of this game instead of creating what feel like diary entries to take up more time. It just feels like filler to me.\n\nI think if you are 12 and really interested in fictional romances, this game will be perfect for you. Otherwise it is definitely not worth the $20, but the creators have potential and if they can learn to focus on cutting out filler dialogue/story and focus on staying true to their genre, I think they could make something worthwhile.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198256123928", "last_played": 1504667733, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 59, "playtime_forever": 687}, "votes_up": 19, "timestamp_created": 1505057564, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511416", "votes_down": 15, "timestamp_updated": 1505057750, "recommendationid": "34864675", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I'm in love.

Strap yourselves in, ladies and gentleman. This review is going to be a long one. It's also my first review on Steam, so I hope I can do this game justice.\n\nThe Letter is a horror visual novel developed by YangYang Mobile, a small team from the Philippines. It takes a lot of inspiration from J-Horror staples like The Ring, and Corpse Party. That said, my attention was drawn to this right away. \n\nI'll open the meat of the review by saying this much. A couple of years back when this game was being crowdfunded through Indiegogo I strongly considered supporting it, but I backed out at the last minute. I regret that decision after looking at (and playing) the finished product.\n\n\n[h1] Plot Outline [/h1]\n\nNow, the story itself is explored out of order, and you play as seven different characters, each one distinct and unique, as they endure a curse placed upon them when one of the protagonists finds a letter within an old 17th century British mansion. Most of these protagonists are either friends or connected by work in some way.\n\nOutside of that much (basically the first twenty minutes) there isn't much else I can say in terms of story because it's driven entirely by your choices as the player from that point onward. It's on that note I'll start discussing one of the game's finest points, freedom of choice.\n\n[h1] Freedom of Choice [/h1]\n\nOh boy, here we go, the fabled section about freedom of choice. How many times have we been here, guys and girls? How many times have we gone into a game expecting our choices to matter? You know the kind of games I'm talking about. All too often we're led to believe that the things our protagonist does effect the story, when sadly the outcome is already set. Only the path to reach the outcome is able to change slightly.\n\nI am happy to report, however, that this is not the case in The Letter. Yes, you heard me right. Your choices do matter, and I'll explain why. Between you and I, this is one of the reasons I had such a deep enjoyment of the game.\n\nThere is no illusion of choice here. Every choice you make, even the tiny ones, holds a weighted and measured impact upon the overall progression of the plot and your relationships with other characters. Here's an example:\n\nSay if character A is needs to do something important at a later stage of the game. Well, he or she may need help to do that, and if you got character D killed in some horrible manner during their respective chapter, they won't be there to help. This in turn could lead to character A getting hurt or worse, gruesomely maimed. Yes, the choice system is deep and winding. Just looking at the route map for each character (especially the last two) was a little overwhelming.\n\nYou can skip, miss out, or have entirely different scenarios play out through your choices, with each character having a solid handful of different endings to their chapter depending on the things you did. Sounds detailed right? Yep. Your every choice rolls over to following chapters, and that one tiny choice you made in chapter one can effect a chunk of somebody's story in chapter three.\n\nThe point I'm getting at? Tread carefully if you don't want your characters to die. Yes, character death and injury are both things here. If people die the story will change. Everything you do matters. Honestly, it's one of the best VN's I've played for the way it handles its decision tree.\n\n[h1] Animation/Art [/h1]\n\nBoth the backgrounds and characters are animated and expressive. Characters move their hands/turn their bodies and their facial expressions change. It makes the whole experience feel so much more alive when compared to the VN's of earlier days. Art is also wonderfully detailed. Lighting plays a heavy part here, too. Dark surroundings (when something nasty is afoot) feel suffocating and hopeless, while brightly lit scenes feel crisp and fresh.\n\n[h1] Voice Acting + Music [/h1]\n\nThe game is fully voice acted, with every piece of spoken dialogue narrated by a VA. It's all done to a very high standard, too. True, the odd line here and there might sound a little corny at times, but what do you expect from a horror game? Need I bring up the truly amazing voice acting of Resident Evil 1 on the original PlayStation?\n\nI'd say nine out of ten times the voice cast nail it. Some people might cringe at one or two of the American VA's trying to put on a decent English accent, which most of the time they do, aside from a few mispronounced words here and there. Overall, however, it only adds to the experience. How many visual novels have full (good quality) voice acting?\n\nThe game's music works almost too well at setting the scene, and I especially love the song 'Letters Goodbye' that plays during the animated opening. Look it up on YouTube. It's great.\n\n[h1] Characters [/h1]\n\nThere are seven main characters throughout the game. Instead of talking in detail about each, one I'll put a list below and give a short summary.\n\n[h1]Isabella Santos[/h1]  A Filipino real estate agent who moved to England to support her family back home.\n\n[h1]Hannah Wright[/h1]  A wealthy heiress who's kind-hearted and extremely loving beneath her aloof surface.\n\n[h1]Zachary 'Zach' Steele[/h1]  An American photographer who moved to England at a younger age to live with his grandparents.\n\n[h1]Marianne McCullough[/h1]  An Irish interior designer who works for the Wrights in the story.\n\n[h1]Rebecca Gales[/h1]  A Scottish high school teacher and friend to Ashton since their teen years.\n\n[h1]Ashton Frey[/h1]  A strong but caring private investigator who's friends with Zach, Isabella and Rebecca.\n\n[h1]Luke Wright[/h1]  Husband to Hannah. A cold businessman with a powerful grip over the local town.\n\n\nYes, this is a diverse cast alright. Both in terms of their backgrounds, their jobs and their personalities. Now I can't say much about their character interactions aside from the pre-established ones, because most of the interactions in game are down to you as the player. These also play a very important part in the game. In fact, character interactions and relationships make up a large chunk of the game's choice system.\n\nYou may be interested to know that the game also has some small romantic elements. too. So, those of you who like character pairings? Yep, the option is there. I must stress however, that it's not the core focus of the game. It's more a side note based upon how you have one character react around another, but it definitely adds a nice touch.\n\nNow let's move onto the horror side of things.\n\n\n[h1] Horror Element [/h1]\n\nOur villainess in the game takes the form of a supernatural spirit/creature tormented by rage and pain. She's very close to something out of The Ring, and while it's not her concept that's unique, the way she carries herself makes her a very frightening foe.\n\nShe will hunt you endlessly - her presence will make you tense.\n\nIn short, the game doesn't rely on simple jump scares to get under the player's skin. It uses atmosphere.\n\n[h1] Drawbacks [/h1]\n\nWhile I really enjoy this game, it's not perfect. There are still grammatical errors that need ironing out. The developers have promised these will be fixed soon but right now, they're still in game, and this review is based on the game in its current state. There are still some missing spoken lines that don't match text on screen as well.\n\n[h1] Final Score [/h1]\n\nDespite its small issues the Letter is still an amazing game and I'd highly recommend you buy it. Heck, even if you can't buy it, download the free demo and give it a try. Spread the word to other fans of horror and visual novels as well. I'd love to see this game pick up a strong cult following and be recognized. I'm half tempted to write a FanFiction continuation based on the ending I got because I didn't wait it to end! ;)\n\n[h1] 8.5/10 [/h1] \n\nOne of my favorite games this year, but the grammar needs fixing.\n\nI hope my review was helpful and informative.
