It feels more like a minigame than a standalone title. The bots feel unbalanced, and there isn't a lot of fun to be had here unless perhaps you have three other people to play with. Even so, there isn't much replay value here. The soccer mode is kind of fun, but I found it altogether lackluster. I played this game once with my friend and then uninstalled it.
