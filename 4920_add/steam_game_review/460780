I want to see loads of dialogue and exposition from characters around me. I like picking a class and building it in massive skilltrees. And the Ultima games are some of my favourites.\n\nAnd yet Avadon falls totally flat for me. I'm finding it hard to put into words why, it's more of a build up of lots of little things.\n\nSome of it is how utterly static the backgrounds are. There's things lying on the floor but you don't interact with them. You just press your inventory and they show up in an area called \"on the ground\". Chests and barrels are occasionally available for you to open and you can touch those, but that's it.\nWhen you equip items they don't show up at all on your character either. Not even on their paperdoll.\n\nThere's huge amounts of totally useless items too. Mops. Weights. Bones. Limbs! I understand that they're there to add character to the world but when everything else is so static it doesn't \"fit\".\n\nThe dialogue trees are extremely annoying as well. I don't feel like I have choice. To find out about a quest I often have to ask everything available even if it doesn't feel like something I'd want my character to say. If I say the wrong thing there's times i've had to repeat the ENTIRE dialogue again until I get back to the point I was at.\nThis isn't for specific story stuff either, just random normal quests. A quest where a character wants me to find a gift for his betrothed and because I asked a question at the end of the dialogue I had to re-do the whole thing to get the quest.\n\nAnd a big thing for me - if you've already done a quest you can't say that during the picking up of the quest. If I've cleared the quarry you're asking me to clear I cannot say \"I did that already!\". I have to finish the dialogue and then speak to the person again.\nThis often meant getting the quest, going to where it said and realising that I'd already done it a few hours ago. That's extremely frustrating for me.\n\nIt also autosaves extremely rarely. It's my own fault for not saving, but it's still quite annoying.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004173499", "last_played": 1494884088, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 92, "playtime_forever": 532}, "votes_up": 19, "timestamp_created": 1494885299, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519198", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1494885299, "recommendationid": "31777156", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "For a cRPG fan - this game is a nice, solid portion of fun. \nAt first I thought that the visuals could be a bit better - but after few initial hours I totally didn't mind that. \nThe story is good (nothing too fancy or philosophical, but it's deep enough that you want to uncover more of it). \nTurn-based fights require some amount of tactics (especially at first). \n\nbtw.

Their storytelling and the rich lore of every game world (Avernum, Lynaeas, etc) is fantastic. I've clocked up over 30 hours and haven't even finished yet.

I mean Warborn.\n\nAdavon reminded me of the Catholic Church which secretly had more power then any kings.  The Hands reminded me of the Inquisition whose sole job was to actually shut people up about the Secret Knowlege that the Church wanted no one to know about and keep the vassel states under it's control.\n\nand the Stone Code Sharia La which is a Bane on the World!!   We must do this it's the law it's written on stone(morons)\n\nSo we have the ending of Avadon.  Was it good?  Yes it was Good man it was Great To make Red Beard Suffer!\n\nI just think he should have suffered more and The Dukes Story should have been fleshed out a lot better.\n\nWe do get to have the Traitors full story fleshed out which was fantastic!   And I loved that she got her revenge.\n\nBut that revenge should have eaten at a certain someone more.  The Corruption story part was done reallly well.\n\nThe game has the same Battle Mechanics but there poorer now then Avadon 2.  The developer doesn't understand that \nnot every enemy should have tons of health and be hard to kill.   There should be early on a way to kill one enemy with one skill.  A Game that did good job of this was Dragon Age Orgins(Battles redone Mod)  Way better balancing.\n\nThe story flowed really well and you once again could behind Red Beard's back try to make his life living hell!\n\nI chose through out this series to go my own way.  I tried to be the good guy and fix things between both groups.\nSometimes playing off of them.\n\nWould have liked Havar Council to be more involved in this series.  Over all...It was fantastic Series!\n\nIt just needs better battle set up.   More Skills, more Spells.  Stories that characters have should have reflected on the characters skills as part of their story.    \n\nAlso more battle animations...  Sword swings , arch up and from the side, fatal attacks.   \n\nGreat Game!
