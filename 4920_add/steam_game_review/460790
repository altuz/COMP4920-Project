Who'd have thought it would be fun to beat up groups of angelic eldritch horrors as a witch who can literally summon demons with her hair?\n\nWhile the plot of the game is pretty serious, Bayonetta herself looks like she's having fun while taking down various creatures with different weapons and combos. And this game is ridiculous fun. There is a lot of charm and charisma and all the characters are well-written.\n\nGraphics wise, it's very well-rendered and the usually muted background colours help to make the foreground colour (where all the action is happening) pop out but they're also not too distracting. Character models are well rendered and wonderfully animated, especially Bayonetta herself. Nothing particularly negative to point out here.\n\nSound wise, the soundtrack is very well put together. Atmospheric in places but also oozes a lot of charm and charisma when it needs to. Very well crafted and puts the tension in the right places. The only complaint I really have is that the battle music can get a tad repetitive but that's me being incredibly nitpicky.\n\nNow onto the meat: the gameplay. I did play the original console version before this and the combos feel very fluid, although some of the more important mechanics (such as Dodge Offset) aren't very well explained. However, combat does feel very satisfying and the various weapons you can get all pack their own punch. The addition of auto-aiming on lower difficulty settings, as well as assistance with the trickier combos, is very good and doesn't take away from the overall skill too much (some skill is still required to get big combos even on lower difficulties but it still works). The torture attacks were fun and the end of boss fights (Climaxes) were well done. Only complaint is that some cutscenes did have a few too many QTEs but aside from that, all very good.\n\nControls felt okay if you're using a keyboard and mouse, but I ended up havign to put the sensitivity quite far up. However, using a controller make everything feel like a dream. It is playable on keyboard/mouse but I highly recommend using a controller to play. Much more fun.\n\nI had such fun with this game and I cannot recommend it enough.
