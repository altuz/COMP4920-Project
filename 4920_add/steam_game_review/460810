Or faster.\n\nWhile I appreciate the graphic Innovations of recent years and have a machine that's more than equipped to run them, I recognize how well made this game was for the time that it came out. Some games age well, Batman Arkham Asylum or Arkham City still look beautiful today, and Vanquish falls into that category.\n\nThe graphics aren't the most advanced thing ever created, but they are gorgeous, epic in scale and more than adequate for the gameplay they are crafted around.\n\nI never played this game on a console, this port is my first pass and it played flawlessly with a controller.\n\nI've heard from other reviews that some of the intellectual content inside the story seem like a rip-off of other franchises, but taken by itself everything in the game works beautifully, whether it's an original idea or not.\n\nI felt very much the same way about 40K Space Marine, another game that didn't limit you solely to running for cover in a third person shooter environment.\n\nAnother important issue, is the wonderfully ethical price structure attached to this port.\n\nI purchased this port at full price, yeah a \"whole $20\".  I feel Sega/Platinum should be rewarded for pricing this game as a remaster should be, they did the same with Bayonetta and I applaud them for it.  \n\nWhen you compare this practice to gearbox's insane $50 price point for the Bulletstorm remaster, The $15 price point attached to this game as I write this review, should feel like an absolute steal, Because even without a sale it's worth every penny.  \n\nLast but not least to any game gods that may chance upon this review, this game falls into a special category for me. That category would be \"most desired sequels\": Along with Bulletstorm, and Space Marine, I would LOVE to see a sequel for this game, and would happily pay for a pre-order.\n\nBottom line, if you're a fan of shooters or action games and you've never played this before, Buy It Now, no matter what the prices is.\n\n10/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198139484676", "last_played": 1499984449, "num_reviews": 47, "num_games_owned": 353, "playtime_forever": 626}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1504716131, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515868", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504722305, "recommendationid": "34778985", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Metal Gear Solid like story with futuristic amor.\n\nPros:\nGreat story line\nSound track is awesome\nthird person shooter\nSliding Bullet time shooting\n\nCons:\nEnemies can be slightly repetitous \n\nThe Maps are  slightly cluttered making it semi difficult,\n to shoot targets while sliding.\n\nOVERALL:\n8/10\nMetal Gear Solid type clone.\n\n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198136351564", "last_played": 1504799661, "num_reviews": 84, "num_games_owned": 121, "playtime_forever": 43}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1504800067, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511866", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504800067, "recommendationid": "34797191", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pretty good. Remionds me of Binary Domain. Both are exactly what they advertise themselves as being. $15 seems like a good price for this. Some of the movements feel a little old after a while but the design and structure of the main character work in this atmosphere well enough that you stil want to try to be as creative as possible with your battles. Its a win. Normally this isnt even my type of game. But when these style of action/arcade 3rd person shooters are done well they can even reel me in.\n\nOverall Id have to give this a 7.5/10. Few things that seem a little odd are the cutscenes seem to be a little long and a little to frequent. And most of the cutscenes almost seem like there is built in screen-tearing. Im using a 144hz with v-sync on and its just the type of action and animation that seems like there is always motion blur and always enough choppiness to make it seem like v-sync is off. Minor issue but a slight annoyance. And the voice acting and script isnt great. When a cutscene is going just imagine some average folks at Comicon CosPlaying a scene in their hotel room after behing at the conference all day. Not sure if this an issue of direction or not. Most actors still need to have a director help get them into a scene; it is the director's (or writers') job to lay out the premise and tell them how to deliver. It feels like these folks had no guidance. And thats tough when youre trying to read into a sci-fi world.\n\nSo the game doesnt really do anything great or perfectly. But it does enough of everything well enough.

The combat is fun and fast, and feels like something between [i]Gears of War[/i] and [i]Jet Set Radio[/i]. I enjoyed the story and was genuinely shocked by a few of the plot twists. Each Act takes place in a fairly unique environment that keeps everything feeling fresh. New enemies are introduced regularly forcing you to adapt and encourages using different weapon types; although the overall enemy variety is a little underwhelming and most everything can be easily taken down with a fully upgraded Assault Rifle. My biggest complaint is the length, with only 5 total Acts. Even on the hardest difficulty available at the start (an even harder mode is unlocked after completing the game once), the campaign will only take about ten hours.\n\nCompleting each Act will unlock a new Challenge, which is basically a horde mode consisting of five waves each. Each Challenge gets progressively harder, and completing all five will unlock the sixth and final Challenge.

It is short - I took my time and got 6.1 hours total. But it was a good 6 hours.\n\nGraphics: 6/10. 10/10 for its age; 8/10 for a remaster. Definitely has a \"Sega\" type of style that you'll notice heavily in the main menu. Obviously don't expect the graphics to look like RYSE or Quantum Break, but they still aren't disappointing even in 4K UHD.\n\nMechanics: 9/10. Mostly good 3rd person action shooter mechanics with a few neat twists. Occasionally some console-esque button mashing that I found annoying. A variety of weapons to choose from and some fun ways to utilize and upgrade them. The slide-boost mechanic is awesome. The designers talk about playing the game differently than typical action-shooters, but don't feel like you have to. \n\nStory: 4/10. No meat, lackluster character development, some scenes that make no sense at all. Continuity gets interrupted frequently by points calculations like a street fighter game from a 90s arcade. Most cutscenes flow into the game smoothly, but some are annoyingly jarring. But +2 (6/10) for a few clever lines of dialogue that make it fun. Don't get too attached to any of the marines.\n\nOverall: 7/10. Not one you'll take home to mother, but you'll enjoy playing it while you have it.

Especially in that kind of action/ fast paced game. And Vanquish's gameplay's great. I had a lot of fun sliding around, beating robots to pulp, bigger robots to pulp and russian clich\u00e9s to pulp. It's quite inovative, i dont remember a game using a sliding system like that. And mixed with the bullet time ( or AR, but it's bullet time) it actually slows down the game a bit, allowing you to take a deep breath and get back in, which is, to my mind, a great way to give a game a good rythme, a rythme that i'm the one to control.\n\nGraphics are ok, even to these days, it really doesnt look bad. For a 360 game it's not terrible, compared to, for example, alice madness returns. And the main character design, as well as the weapon design/huge bots designs look very futuristic and it's very well rendered with the many animations they implemented. When you switch weapons, it actually transforms in a very stylish manner. Same for the bosses when they switch stances, it's all very fluid.\n\nWhich brings me to another very important part: it's a good port. A very good one. Anti-aliasing, bindings, mouse/keyboard combo, everything's customable and working perfectly fine. No frame drop, no crashes, no glitches. That's how a port is supposed to be! And I thank sega for that. It really bugs when i cant change the bindings in a game.\n\nAs for the sound, well the musics gave, from time to time, a Streets of Rage vibe and since i'm a huge fan i loved it. Yet, and now we get to the cons in the game, the voice acting might be one of the worst i've ever heard. It's so bad i even thought the whole game was kinda 2nd degree you know.\n\nSame goes with the scenario. It's so clich\u00e9, the characters are so, i dont know, i cant find the words, everything's so predictable from the beginning to the end, the dialogues seem to've been written by a 12 yo child it's just bad. And it's so bad i happened to think \"is that some kind of critiscm against the american movies/games?\". It might be. I dont know tbh. So, i dont know if it's a con or not, cause some people might like it. I personnaly laughed quite a lot at the catch phrases.\n\nSo yes, if you like face paced game in which you dont need to think, just shoot your way through to the russian big guy and the disapointing ending, then you can buy it.
