No, its the absurd amount of cheap, gimmicky, just stupid convenient situations you find your self in.  You'll be sneakin' up to do a mission and just as you get near the base, a Unidad helicopter will fly over and detect you, setting off the entire world, plus bringing Unidad in on you.  \n\nYou will engage a base and be covering from enemy fire and out of the blue, teleported in, magically and conveniently on the side you DONT have cover, 2 cars of sicarios will appear and just mow you down, with no where to go. \n\nYou will take the time to disable a VIP's vehicle, or a supply convoy, destroy the escorts and prepare it for capture, but JUST as soon as you step out of your vehicle, and get out in the middle of the road, either a clueless fking civilian will run you over, or out of the blue, magically and from both directions, 2 Sicario trucks or a pack of Unidad will show up and mow you down with no where to go.  \n\nYou will be running certain missions and just out of the blue, for no apparent reason they will just fail.  My first run through the Amaru mission, 1st mission in the game.  I was engaging the Sicarios around Atollo farm and out of NOWHERE, it said \"Amaru was killed\", mission failed.  It wasnt evne the Sicarios, they dont shoot VIPs and Amaru is inside a barn, behind a caged door, no way anyone coulda shot him.  \n\nThen there is terrible vehicle handling, horrific, vehicle drop spawning locations, putting your helicopter inside buildings, your tanks on top of buildings, your helicopters wedged under and around objects that render it useless, or destroy it once you get in.  \n\nand there are just GOBS of issues that pile up and pile up and over time just drove me completely to hate this game.  I tried to adapt to these things, learn and change, but ultimately, there just isnt any way to really get around  issues, they are how the game operates, and it destroyed the enjoyment for me....\n\nGREAT game concept, it is ALOT of fun when the BS isnt happening, but the problem, is the BS happens FAR to frequently.  There is no way to get away from it. \n\nOther issues being, for as large a map as they made, there is ALOT of wasted, empty space.  Missions are redundant and few, despite the huge map and many sectors.  There was a huge missed opportunity to really expand this game and make it really large and actually alot more fun and enjoyable.  \n\nFix the stuff I mention above and honestly, it would be a fantastic game.  but as it is now, yeah, it was just an act of pure rage and fustration.....", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1727, "steamid": "76561198034964352", "last_played": 1507171495, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_forever": 12342}, "votes_up": 69, "timestamp_created": 1505301279, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545145", "votes_down": 39, "timestamp_updated": 1505301279, "recommendationid": "34917471", "votes_funny": 17, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "When I first heard of Wildlands I knew it would be for me.\n\nI just finished MGSV and knew that Wildlands would give me the same satisfaction if not more.\n\nWildlands was everything I expected.\n\nI could only crave for more hours of gameplay and an never ending engine that could supply me with endless missions to accomplish.\n\nThanks.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 387, "steamid": "76561197979768155", "last_played": 1507131835, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 98, "playtime_forever": 5409}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1506688196, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506260", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506688196, "recommendationid": "35291926", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game will have a lot of repeating missions, that's the first thing people looking to buy this should know.

This game is meant to be a multiplayer game with tons of replayability so I'm not too bothered by the repeating missions. Side missions help to remove some of the boring feeling of repeating missions so if story missions get to repeated, play the side missions! Again, lots of repeated missions but if you switch around, you should do fine. Play online with others, that will make things a little bit more interesting. I've had a few laughs myself while playing with others. Your AI teammates can often times be idiots, yes, that's why players need to remember that this is a MULTIPLAYER game meant to be played with friends. But, if you are short on friends to play with (like I was), your AI team will do just fine. Graphics are amazing, gameplay is not that bad, AI partners could use some improvements, and etc. Nevertheless, I would recommend the game if you take the story slow and switch up your playstyle.

Very nice graphics. Interesting missions. But it's not something that will keep me playing longer than 20-30 hours.\n\nHowever, the PvP mode is really good. The beta mode (which basically still had half of the game content locked) was  already so enjoyable that I could easily put 26 hours without being bored.\n\nGhost War (the PvP mode) is a tactical game that is a bit more slow paced than other games, but heavily relies on strategy and tactics rather than solely on shooting skills. There are 16 classes that you can choose from. And each class comes with its own advantages and perks. \n\nI am really a fan of the new suppression mechanic that they added which certainly makes the game more challenging. On top of that, drones can also make sure that you just can't run around shooting everybody with your gun in this game, as drones make your movements easily detectable if you're making reckless moves. These mechanics make you think twice before going in a specific direction.\n\nThe revival mechanic is also a good feature, which makes the game interesting in the sense that, once someone is killed you face two options: either rush to their aid and risk being shot by the enemy (since they usually keep an eye on the surroundings of someone they just killed), or play it safe and try to pull it off despite the enemy's team number advantage.

If you like to snipe, you better hope nobody finds a body or else the entire camp/outpost/base has a ten digit grid of your location and will dome your ass while dual wielding SMG-11s from 400 meters away with laser accuracy. It keeps me from getting immersed in the world because it just devolves into a gunfight, the missions all feel the same, and the weapons, while plentiful, are done a grave injustice in nearly every way. Empty reload animations even when not empty, standard magazine size being 20 rounds when most every NATO country uses a 30 round standard, and assault rifles having more controllable recoil than SMGs just takes the weapon accuracy you'd expect from Tom Clancy games and shoves it out the door. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "steamid": "76561198050860552", "last_played": 1506139926, "num_reviews": 40, "num_games_owned": 167, "playtime_forever": 905}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505067170, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505067170, "recommendationid": "34868071", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Llamas and BASE jumping.

To me, GRW is a best practice for wasted opportunities. It could be so much, but Ubisoft wrapped this game in chains and will never unleash it's potential. On top of that the game is never running smooth.\n\nLet's start with what GRW could be:\nThis game was announced as a large scale sandbox. But it isn't. Of course you can play the game the style you want, but that isn't the meaning of a sandbox. Beside your very own character and weapons there is no piece of customization in it. After I've finished the story, I'd love to explore more of the world. But why? They have truly created one of the biggest open worlds in the shooter genre. But on 95 percent of the world there is nothing to shoot at. If you leave roads, you'll never run into a group of enemies. So what is the benefit of a dense jungle, when no patrols cross your way? You always know, where the enemy is. In bases, towns or roadside. What a waste of this beautiful world.\n\nNext up is the content. That Ubisoft can make money with microtransactions, another game made for modders is denied to modders. It would be so cool to see more factions, equipment, vehicles or simply user created missions in this game. Was it that hard to implement a little editor for droping down markers, a mission objective and some text, to share it with your friends? That would be something useful for the companion app with it's live map. But we've got a guerilla minigame with it. No need for it.\n\nOk.. requesting Mods is something huge. But let's get into the microtransactions:\nIt's something we have today. If we like it or not. But if a developer missed out some core content for the game and is charging us afterwards for it, is not acceptable. I talk about one of the latest \"Ghost Packs\" including the Night Vision Goggles. Those were requested since the Beta. Because you have Night Vision in the game, but no goggles on the head. Immersion breaker. Instead of giving the community a candy, Ubisoft put the NVGs in a ghost pack and charged 15 (!!!!!) bucks for it. Guys.. that is 25 percent of the price from the full game. Again.. this is NOT ACCEPTABLE!\n\nOn top are a lot of graphical issues. (My PC specs are below) I really hope that I am not too dump to set this game up. But I have stutters and framedrops all the time. In addition to that, the camera shake while running, which cannot turned off, make the game feel more stuttering. Moving cars for example have sometimes a weird 'tracing' of their texture, as well as NPCs when driving by. I've tried it all. Medium Settings, High, Very High, Custom... it never stops dropping below 60 or sometimes 50 FPS. And yes, I also tried 'Fast Vsync' in the Nvidia Control Panel. The game just won't run smooth.\n\nThe graphics finally made me writing this review. Because I really want to enjoy, what the game is. Even if I see lot of missed potential. But if you don't want to ride a bike or drive a vehicle, just because you know it will drop your framerate, it isn't fun at all. \n\nAnd yes.. this review is also meant as a feedback to the developers. Please stop destroying your own creations. All these \"Content Packs\", preorder bonuses and season pass stuff is cutting up your games. I never have the feeling to get a complete game these days. Everyone should get the very same experience. Not everybody can preorder every game he wants. Those people get punished with less content. Just because you (the devs) want to make money, BEFORE we get anything.

And from entering bolivia to dismantling the santa blanca cartel has been an awesome ride! I've still to try out the dlc's narco road and fallen ghosts, but looking forward to them both. To anyone looking for and open world, PvE & PvP game to play with friends, I highly recommend that you look into ghost recon wildlands. You will have alot of fun. And based on the games preformance, machanics, cutsences and overall gameplay is awesome! There are one or two issues that I did come accross with the ending cutsence does not show your exact weapon paint or attachments, also the other ghosts aka npc's that you control throughout the game are sometimes not responsive to the hold position action, sometimes they will just keep going foward. But other than that a awesome game to play with your friends in my opinion.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 523, "steamid": "76561198141337644", "last_played": 1506040867, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 55, "playtime_forever": 4455}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506106590, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500341", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506106590, "recommendationid": "35135133", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
