It's a little too \"open\" in parts, there's quite a few areas where you can bye-pass mechanics completely, \"oh I need a key do I?\" .. \"nah i'll climb this hill here instead\" .. etc. To me in a story driven game your character needs to be directed by the story and the map a little more, sometimes it's not clear where to go and you can end up going around in circles. The voice acting is a little over acted for my liking, and the Chroma key work just doesn't blend with the game, a video of a real person just seems out of place with the art style of the game in my opinion. My biggest bug-bear is the keys, keys, keys scenario, I see it a lot with indie games, the developers get it stuck in their head that every door needs a key that you have to find, many of the keys could be replaced with a variety of simple puzzles, the \"key\" here is variation, nobody likes doing the same thing over and over and to be honest I found myself saying \"oh don't tell me, I need another key!\".\n\n But none of that detracts from the fact that it is a good game, and when you factor in the software used to make it, a very good game indeed. You can tell that Ertlov has put his heart into the work behind the scenes, the story is very creative, the placement of objects and terrain is very well done, and it's obvious a lot of care and attention to detail has been made here.\n\n So, in short: While I feel that the lighting downgrades the look a little, and it could do with a few invisible walls and such to guide the players around, as well as more variation to the puzzles (ie less keys), I still find it a very pleasant, and to be frank impressive game, it's a thumbs up from me!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198036209052", "last_played": 1466893635, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 173, "playtime_forever": 183}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1467877090, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508095", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1467877090, "recommendationid": "24151847", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "As a Gameguru user myself, I was very excited to play Father's Island.\nFirst thing I noticed was the very calm and nice atmosphere.\nTons of work have been put into this game. You can see that at every corner. As far as the story goes - it was definitely a surprise. I like the voice of the character and the one liners he throws at you. Some scenes are quite disturbing - all I say is \"the sheep\" There are multipe endings wich are very different. \n\nThe cutscenes are pretty interesting and I like them! The Performance has been improved now and I can say I got 25+ fps at least. That's okay for me, because I know that most part of it is engine related. On the other hand, we have a huge island, filled with insane amount of detail. What I noticed as well are the awesome hills and mountains. I know how the engine works, and I was really impressed with the way the mountains are made. Overall, the game looks pretty nice! Definitely keeps me motivated to see more and explore further.\n\nAt the bottom line, I can say that this game has:\n\n- Very nice environment and much detail. \n\n- A very cool music system wich I never saw before. It switches dynamicly. The music itself is very nice and calm. \n\n- Great atmosphere. It really makes me feel that I am on a huge, lost Island, in the middle of nowhere.\n\n- surprisingly deep story. I wasn't expecting much at the beginning, and it turned out to be pretty cool story, that even makes sense!\n\n- Only bad thing are the performance issues ( wich have been improved since my last session ), and other technical issues like greenscreen after loading, wich forces you to restart the game and wait another couple of minutes to load.\n\n\nOverall, I totally recommend this game. Take a cup of tea, coffee or like me, a nice hot chocolate and enjoy this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198060792246", "last_played": 1499072020, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 409, "playtime_forever": 203}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1473175995, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509329", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1473188233, "recommendationid": "25381945", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Things you can do with $5.

All of which will be more fun than playing Father's Island.\n\nWithout a doubt, Father's Island is one of the worse games of all time. I'd rather play Atari 2600's E.T.

Even the water was gone.  The only two things that were left were the trees and the buildings, and the buildings are carbon copies of each other.  \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=858089322\n\nThe write up said that there are \u201chundreds of buildings, structures and relics, wildlife and strange machinery.\u201c  More like 3 or 4 buildings, structures. etc. everything else is cut and paste.  Even if all of the buildings were different and unique, there are at tops, 3 or 4 dozen in all.  Wildlife?  Bunnies, sheep, and birds... that's it and they move like robots.  \n\nMore than once, I loaded a game and waited and waited and waited until... a green screen.  I had to shut down my computer and restart.  If you load the same saved game... green screen again.  You have to load a different saved game, if you don't have one, you'll have to start over.\n\nWhen the game did run, the graphics were unimpressive.  You can see the mountains, and other items, being built in the background as you walk (Poorly optimized).  If you go up into the mountain, (which you'll have to do at some point) there must some magically curse on this area because the vegetation floats in mid air... or is it the amateur that made this crappy game?  I vote for the latter.  Also, what the hell is up with the blood red sky?  It's hard to look at after awhile.\n\nYou must find several keys in order to proceed through the game, but there is no indication where they are so you'll be pixel hunting too, oh joy.\n\n\u201cSeriously, are there any good points to this game?\u201d  (*Theme to Jeopardy starts playing*)  WAIT!  There are 4 different endings... all of them suck.  [spoiler]You can either commit suicide, abduct a woman and force her to be your wife, find your brother and build an army of monsters, or...

Not a surprise for an ameturely made game, but being able to pick up objects through walls? Overlapping dialog? Textures that pop in and out? The game dropping to about 2 fps just because you dared to put your face near green glass? \n\n- Terrible writing. It's just...bad. Cheesy. Poorly written. Non-sensical. \n\n- Bad acting. So the short video clips that are triggered are poorly acted, but they're actually pretty awesome. As somebody who loved 90s adventure games, which heavily used FMV to propell the narrative, I'm definitely a fan of that part. However, the voiceovers are just awful. I think it may have been the same guy in the FMV videos doing all the voice work, just employing an accent for one and \"I just ate glass\" for the other. \n\n- Awful graphics. I mean, they aren't horrible, but the constant red on brown...the whole game looks like a scab. Trying to find brown keys on brown objects - all the while being blasted with red everything else...I mostly found objects just by happening to get near them and seeing the text about picking it up.\n\n- The worst sin of all - it's boring. The story is actually somewhat interesting, but...not a lot happens in the game. You wait forever at the intro loading screen, which wouldn't be much of an issue if...you know...it actually loaded things for you to do. All it does, though, is load a wipe open expanse of nothing. There's no reason to explore. There's nothing to do. I found a key in the game, which opened up a building, and except for a brief voiceover explaining that the building smelled like shit, there was nothing else to do in there. What was the point of making me find a key to a building that housed absolutely nothing?!\n\nLike I said, I really, really wanted to like this game. It gave me somewhat of a FPS version of Harvester vibe and I dug that, but there's just a lot going wrong here that I can't recommend it. \n\nFull disclosure, I didn't actually finish the game. I think I got near the end where you have to find your fathers house, but I died in the worlds smallest pond (yes, water = instant death) and didn't want to wait for that initial loading screen just to pick up where I left off. \n\nThere's something good here. There is a right idea somewhere in this game. It just needs more development, more playtesting and a rewrite. As it is now, take that $2.50 and buy a box of pop tarts.

But if you want to reload a save, or if you accidentally die and you have to reload a save, it reloads the whole damn thing all over again, and you just have to wait, and wait... every time.\n- Default music volume was too loud and the soundtrack would start at the wrong time, overlapping some voice-overs and causing you to miss some important information. Solution: reload a save, and wait, and wait...\n- Occasional crash on save. Restart; and wait, and wait...\n- Occasional crash on load. Restart; and wait, and wait...\n- Green screen after load. Restart; and wait, and wait...\n- Ground textures disappearing when looking out through an open door, from inside a building. They usually reappear as soon as you step aside, but one time they did not, so I had to restart, and wait, and wait... \n- Some textures are misplaced and some vegetation appears to float in mid-air.\n- When pressing \"E\" once, doors and gates would fling open and immediately close again.
