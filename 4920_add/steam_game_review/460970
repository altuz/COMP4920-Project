There's a limited number of them you can have at the same time and they're not invulnerable. These aspects allow for for some interesting gameplay, including \"running battles\" not seen in more static TD games.\n\nMuch like with every other MagicalTimeBean game you get a great soundtrack and a fair amount of bonus challenges.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198026123571", "last_played": 1464637918, "num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 1437, "playtime_forever": 651}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1480002448, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504912", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1480002448, "recommendationid": "27213045", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a game, or rather two games, by the creators of the Escape Goat series, which while in a different genre are a pair of games I'd recommend wholeheartedly. Soulcaster actually came out before Escape Goat, and like it was available on the Xbox Live Arcade, but unlike it had quite a long wait through greenlight. It's finally here, and pretty worth the wait, I think.\n\nYou play as a nameless wizard on a journey to...do something. It's not explained right away, but on the way he bumbles across an area protected by monsters guarding the statue of an ancient warrior, Shaedu the Archer. She lends him her aid to help him survive. Not long after you find Ajax the Warrior and Bloodfire the Bomber; you'll need the help of all three to survive your journey.\n\nSoulcaster is sort of a mix between an old-school dungeon crawler and a tower defense. You're presented with levels either one screen long or big enough to be miniature dungeons, each with a set amount of waves that spawn in when you pass a certain threshold, step on marked tiles, or just kill enough of the previous enemies. Shaedu can shoot enemies in her line of sight, but can't fire through allies or cover. Ajax can only hit what's next to him, but has a higher amount of health and can hold down choke-points extremely well, but can't take much punishment from the back. Finally, Bloodfire can throw bombs past allies for area damage, but is quite fragile and explodes when killed, which has friendly fire.\n\nAt the start you can put down three of them total, which can include multiples of the same hero; to unlock more you'll need to visit the merchant, where you can also buy upgrades for all your heroes. Unlocking a fourth and fifth slot is expensive, but a good investment, as the game wastes no time getting difficult. You can move around as the wizard while fighting is going on, and recalling your heroes before they die heals them completely, so you'll often need to make some snap decisions and reposition yourself. Collecting potions gives you a full heal if the wizard's life hits zero, and finding scrolls gives you a bomb that hits every enemy on the screen, but if you're surrounded without one you may as well restart the level and save yourself some time. It feels like a puzzle game at times, and it is fair about its challenge.\n\nLike Escape Goat, it seems like both games might be short and sweet, with some other reviews noting both chapters can be finished in about two hours each. There is a hard mode and some challenge rooms available for each game to increase that a bit, but they're still not huge games and aren't intended to be. It seems like the developers, Magical Time Bean, are working on Soulcaster III at the moment, and I don't doubt they'll keep up their track record.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010267364", "last_played": 1481427696, "num_reviews": 57, "num_games_owned": 982, "playtime_forever": 230}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1469517349, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501246", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1469517349, "recommendationid": "24532323", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "These were the best games ever made for the Xbox Live Indie Arcade and now they're available on Steam!
