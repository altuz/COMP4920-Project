I thought I was pretty good at eyeing straight lines but I guess not. My poor little player character has drifted off into space way too many times... RIP.\n\nEnjoying the game so far though. You can tell the game was originally made for iOS, but the music is very serene and the minimalistic style of the game is really nice to look at.
