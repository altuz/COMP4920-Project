Depending on who you play with, it can quickly turn hectic.\nEither through skill or desperation, teamwork is necessary to complete\nmost of the levels. The feeling you get when you've done so is wonderful.\nBut the feeling you get when you have 1 second left and your friend can't\nseem to go through the fkn door is equally wonderful in it's own way.\n\nPros:\n- Great value ($5 for a couple hours of fun for up to 10 people?!) \n- Very easy to play\n- Fun to just watch as well!\n\nCons:\n- No music/sounds (am I missing something here?)\n- Sometimes our phones would disconnect (but easy to fix)\n\nGreat job with the game.

Third: A collective \"Aha!\" moment. \n\nBut after figuring out the puzzle, you still need to DO it. This is always harder than it looks, due to the madness caused by 5+ characters moving around.
