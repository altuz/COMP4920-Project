Compared to the simplistic style of Altspace and RecRoom, SurrealVR is head and shoulders above in terms of graphical complexity, yet despite this there is not a single clothing or model combination for your avatar that doesn't come across looking like a complete and utter d-bag, including the female avatars. Everything about the style and events makes it feel like it is specifically catering towards \"mature audiences\" as some sort of VR Second Life, but it winds up coming across rather seedy.\n\nThis might be why the place is so empty. Though I haven't played extensively, the only person I've ever bumped into was apparently away from their headset at the time. Alternatively, it might just be because there's not really much of a quick start option so you can get into the meat of the content before deciding if you want to invest in the trouble of actually creating an avatar that suits your tastes.\n\nDespite this, there are still interesting areas to explore and different VR tools/toys to play with. I don't know if people are ready for adult oriented social VR interactions, but it's entirely dependent on the people who actually try this app and continue to use it that will decide what type of attitude will foster and thrive there. If a bunch of creeps (or just people who feel this is a good place to do creeping) then it could turn toxic very quickly, but if mature people actually go there to meet people and have real talk conversations, it could wind up filling a very important niche in the VR community.\n\nI recommend trying this at least for a few minutes each day over the course of a week.
