I wanted to enjoy Beglitched, I really did, it's a cutesy game with a lot of heart and passion in it, and the design is clever. Unfortunately, the game makes some really inexplicable missteps which kill it. First and foremost, which had this not been around, could have forgiven everything else. When you die, you are sent back to the beginning of the \"dungeon\" which might not seem like much, but the combat of the game really isn't strong enough to support doing the same area with the same gimmick over and over. This leads into another issue, the game has really odd difficulty spikes. The one that caught me and sent me into a frenzy is the cat zone which has instant kill failure states which are incredibly easy to cause, so you'll likely be stuck doing that one over and over until your hair goes grey from the stress. It doesn't help that the game never really explains anything, which some may write off as me being a tutorial baby, but honestly, the game explains literally nothing, even the store page doesn't really tell you what the game is. I dunno, if they make some changes maybe it'll be worth picking up, but for now, it's just too frustrating to recommend.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198050602761", "last_played": 1501832583, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 715, "playtime_forever": 271}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1501833851, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508386", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501833851, "recommendationid": "34010702", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is such a sweet little game.

Nobody will heed my word. Friends, listen: it's a great game. It's almost too clever, asking the player to think outside the box and grasp onto new concepts at a fairly speedy pace. It's almost too cute, giving you a pink laptop, cartoon avis with puns, and a match-3 puzzler that is anything but casual. \n\nIt's a high-concept cocktail of genres, that doesnn't bother to explain, or answer for the flavors. Beglitched all takes place on the pink computer I just mentioned, given to you, your character, by a talented, precocious - maybe genius - hacker who left a long shadow. You are exploring it because you were entrusted to it, and it should be fun. It has two interfaces, one a Bejeweled-like \"fight,\" where you have to use one of several pieces to track down how far, and in what direction a certain enemy is hiding, before you blow them up. Outside of battle, you are a cat avi, traveling through a varying grid of computer screens which you can dive in, digging into more. This is the \"adventure\" mode aspect, where you get from one point to another over a longer period of time, with battles intermittently. It plays like Minesweeper, where spoils of certain computer screens are only revealed by their neighbors, so you deduce the \"mines\" from the desirables. Once you dive into a screen to the next level, it blurs and makes a quick \"dial-up\" sound. Which never gets old.\n\nOn a third, \"menu\" screen, you are simply clicking icons on Glitch Witch's desktop to travel into her files, where you can read her poetry and journal entries, or travel through a lost woods of folders that reset once you hit a wrong \"turn.\" It has a voyeuristic thrill, except of course Glitch Witch always feels one step ahead of your nameless protagonist.\n\nAll this minesweeping and Bejewling is a metaphor, for something that goes over my head, but never bores with its ambient buzz. You meet other hackers, other speaking animals who are all happy to see the \"Glitch Witch\" again. Based on her old \"forum\" buddies, you can start to build a portrait of what kind of person she was, an early 4chan type who had experiments and potential with trickster trolls, fortune hunters, and others who didn't develop the sense of responsibility with their skills. I love these characters, and the lonely environment that drew the enterprising souls together is a classic story the old internet days. Their fate puts this in the leagues of great short stories, profiting off every minute, and compensating every frame.\n\nEventually, after a difficulty curve, the new mechanics in each level are also explained in journal pieces as metaphors for what she was thinking when she created certain programs, or possibly even \"spells.\" The \"glitch\" part is taken to the extreme as outside of the box thinking forces you to push the limits of what is given to you on the screen. Also, probably a metaphor, of course.\n\nThe tutorial is left out: it assumes the player can pick up how to play. This may rankle some, but please others, who don't like to be pulled down by tutorials. I didn't have a problem, because I like to get my hands dirty first; the game doesn't punish you for failing until after you've grasped the concept. Unfortunately, I didn't catch on to the story elements until it was past time to reflect on the first half of the game, so I may go back to clear things up. The ending, however challenging, still teases that I haven't completed the game, and there is a techno hole in the pink laptop that I still can only speculate about, like he playfully cryptic journal entries.\n\nBeglitched is completely emblematic of our times. It's a computer within a computer, to show how some people lived online, even before the dawn of social media. As a cultural artifcact, younger players may come to understand better the life of a nerdy person maybe in the 90's or mid 2000's. One can hope that her friends don't dwell on that nostalgia, though; that our contemporary ghoulies of irony and elitism will join Glitch Witch in more productive ventures.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198064264057", "last_played": 1504349912, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 175, "playtime_forever": 550}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504239361, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504239361, "recommendationid": "34651025", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
