Obviously I work with + and - .\n\n+The level design is very cool to look at. There seems to be a lot of detail outside the playing box.\n+The animation of the ball is quite cool and the particles of your racket are well done.\n\nHowere besides the designs, the game is very poorly made and it still needs a lot of work.\n\n-The ball bounces are random. Sometimes you expect after the ball falling down at a high speed it would bounce up again, making you able to hit it. However the ball sometimes does not bounce well and instantly disappears.\n-The reaction between the racket and the ball doesn't always work. As you play, you'll notice the ball sometimes goes through your racket, making it almost unplayable.\n-There are 2 levels you can play. However they both work the same besides the size of your playing box. This game will require a lot of variety.\n-No scores? Anything? I hope they will add that after they fix numerous bugs!\n\nOverall I had a lot of trouble playing it as it's quite unresponsive. I do have to say it looks gorgeous!\n\nMy rating would be a 3/10 + 0.1 for being a free game.\n\nI will update this review should there be any updates!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198081473394", "last_played": 1497723404, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 209, "playtime_forever": 39}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1488209455, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496491", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1488209455, "recommendationid": "30222008", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is pretty sweet.
