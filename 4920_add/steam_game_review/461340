The concept involves time travel in hopes of reversing the pollution of the \"present\" day (considering they have time travel, it is probably future to us). A journalist hears a rumor that the military might be involved in some secret project, goes to check on it... and touches the wrong buttons (of course), stranding him and someone else in the past. While trying to survive, they make acquaintances and try to fit in.\n\nGameplay is smooth, and the graphics are beautiful (for an RPGMaker). Areas are set up with care and forethought, as are encounters. This game looks to be quite a blast.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "last_played": 1492247703, "num_reviews": 362, "num_games_owned": 445, "playtime_forever": 67}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1492245724, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506772", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1492245724, "recommendationid": "31151718", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game was easy, perhaps a tinge too easy, but overall I enjoyed this romp through time.  Sure the time travel aspect isn't expounded upon much in game, but the end result of the story was one of the best I've had in ages.  I admit the character development and story hooked me into this like I haven't been by some bigger indie and AAA titles in a long time.  That's what makes these things so enjoyable.\n\nPlus due to the fact you are from a much more advanced society heading back in time, they have a discussion among themselves as to what 'magic' actually is, which is a thing most games don't do.  And it makes this world so much more likable as a result!\n\nThe main criticism I have is that for a good majority of the game you will have no real opportunity to upgrade your gear.  And then right before the finale when your two teams join together, you get access to 3 equipment shops that will totally overhaul your equipment.  \n\nThe other thing is a piece of advice, in a lot of rpg's using a physical attack can often be as good as using a skill for a turn, not here!  Use your skills AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!  It makes things so much easier in the long run, I rarely used physical attacks during my playthrough.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198214989148", "last_played": 1496700554, "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 948, "playtime_forever": 717}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1496753448, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508200", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1496753448, "recommendationid": "32219375", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Overall rating: 7/10\n\nIt's clear that quite a bit of effort went into this game. If you enjoy JRPGs with heavy customization, you should have fun with this one.\n\nThe game has mouse support and also starts out with the ability customize the difficulty and the visibility of enemies. I chose \"Hard\" and it did genuinely feel hard, so it appears well balanced. I would wager that I may have died in the first encounter if I had chosen \"Legendary\", the hardest difficulty.\n\nThe levels are well laid out and the mapping is quite good.
