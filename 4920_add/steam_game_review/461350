I have played about 40 hours and decide to write a review. This is a relatively weak Aldorlea game, and is actually at the borderline of recommend / not recommend. If I can give percentages in steam, I will give it 51%, but I put recommend in this game.\n\nLet me explain some of the good and bad things about this game in detail.\n\nThe GOOD aspects:\n1. As with many of the Aldorlea games, the gameworld is beautifully designed and the dev paid lots of attention to minor details to make the game asthetically pleasing. The towns and dungeons are all exquisitely crafted.\n2. I like the portraits too.They are well done, and make the game interesting to see new portraits instead of custom ones.\n3. I like the different character classes, which make the game interesting. Initially I thought that the fat minster is useless, but it was only much later that I found out how useful he is. He can cast some mass spells to inflict slow and idiot to all monsters and bosses that CANNOT be resisted. Wow, that is useful.\n\nThe POOR aspect.\n1. The storyline is weak and almost non existent. At the start, you pick 4 out of 8 team members, and then have to go through 9 disjointed dungeons fighting lots and lots of monster to rescue a princess. After a while, it get routine and boring, with just too many uninspired fights. You do not get the pleasure of meeting and recuiting more party members as the story advance (oops, what story?)\n2. They have a quest button that is greyed out throughout the ENTIRE game, and I was initially wondering why. Well, there are NO sidequests of any kind in this game. There is no main quest, but implicitly it is just : Finish Dungeon 1, Finish Dungeon 2, Finish Dungeon 3, Finish Dungeon 4, Finish Dungeon 5, Finish Dungeon 6, Finish Dungeon 7, Finish Dungeon 8, Finish Dungeon 9, Finish Final Dungeon to free princess. End. \n3. The game is ridiculously unbalanced. There are 9 different mode in terms of difficulty, with the easiest mode being the Story Mode, which is suppose to be a no-brainer. I wanted to do a quick run and tried the no-brainer story mode. Here is what I experienced:\nMost of the fights are indeed no brainer, and you can kill all the enemies with 1 shot. However, at later dungeons, some enemy casters can also 1-shot my team, and wipe me out. That is so ridiculous. I am not talking about a speed run. I am a completionist that love grinding, and grind my team until they are at level 50+. I equiped them with all the best armor and weapons in the game, and even have 2 LEGENDARY weapons (one for becoming arena champions for finishing all the fights, and another for killing some very high level boss). My team have ridiculously large amount of HP and my tank, for example has 700+ HP due to excessive grinding. Now when I entered one of the later dungeon called Secular Tumulous, some monsters there can just 1-shot my tank and wipe out my entire team that is armed to the teeth with all the best gears in the game. I am not talking about the final game boss. I am talking about just being wipe out my some random monsters while I am playing in Story Mode!!! That is really really bad game balance, and a big shame on an Aldorlea game. I wonder how much testing has been done.\n4. The game itself feels UNFINISHED. The fact that they left a greyed out QUEST button during the entire game makes me feel that they wanted to add something but did not have time. It feels like a rushed release of an Aldorlea game, which seldom happen in the past. Indeed the quality of Aldorlea games have been dropping.\n\nI am not sure I will finish this game or not, but I am taking break from this game for now. \nLike I say, I will give this game a score of 51%, but will still put recommend, although it is a weak recommend.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 3411, "steamid": "76561198011891156", "last_played": 1506725062, "num_reviews": 50, "num_games_owned": 758, "playtime_forever": 3411}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1506380231, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509322", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506468124, "recommendationid": "35212029", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is an interesting game.

It reminds me a lot of the original final fantasy with the ability to choose class layout before starting. But ultimately, I think if you don't choose a certain class, you might struggle to survive until someone learns a skill that will enable you to pass through with ease. I apparently chose a good party layout on my first try, having a rogue, a healer, a monk that can act as a secondary healer, and the best character, money bard...erk I mean minister. Also in certain areas, that are considered difficult to get through, you can brute force your way through in a war of attrition until you run out of mp/hp items or revive items. The gear you can purchase can be quite expensive no matter where you are in the game...unless you have money bard...Minister I mean. Even then its still hard to earn enough to buy more than 1 or 2 things for your party. Its also easy to do dungeons out of order without realizing it.\nHowever, I will say, I like many of the classes ability, especially money bard. And I like the relics concept, but ultimately it forces the player into the \"conserve until later\" mindset\nDespite all my issues with the game, I still think due to being allowed to build a party of your choice, it has high replay value, and if you don't mind a kinda slog of a game, it can be quite fun\nDo I reccommend this game?
