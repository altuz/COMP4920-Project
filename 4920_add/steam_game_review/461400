Does not look as a scam, as announced. EASY mode, unlimited lives, unlimited bullets ! Great art. And XBOX 360 controller works !!! Don't want to troll, but for me this is as fun as Nuclear Throne. I keep this game and will explore further.\n\nEdit 23/09/2107\n\nI made it through level 6-1 in easy mode (immortal). \n\nMy 2 cents:\n\nFirst off, THANK YOU SO MUCH to consider the stupid players like me, highly UNskilled, with the immortal mode. So few games with VERY easy modes !!! Butcher has an easy mode DLC. But so many remain for the elite or the super top skilled gamers: Enter the Gungon, Nuclear Throne, even UltraGoodness is hard. After 8 hours of work, tired, I still can enjoy killing monsters. And practice ... to slowly improve ?! I returned Enter the Gungeon within minutes... Nuclear Throne is hard but practicable. Massive is very great for me. After playing Massive, I will miss the feature in NT.\n\nMASSIVE is NOT a clone of NT, there are very good ideas, specific to this game.\n\nMy two cents about the +++ and the suggestions ???:\n\n+ destructible environments are great; allow to take shortcuts and can be part of the strategy\n+ shields in steel, excellent idea\n+ configurable difficulty: thank you again\n+ monsters are great, so as existing guns\n+ frame rate is OK\n+ pixel art is fine\n+ the map (bottom right) is great\n\n? \"level of zoom\" for me is a little too excessive: one can see well the character but not enough of the global scene. Other games have the opposite drawback (character is too tiny). So for now the scenery is pretty OK, but slightly \"higher\" would be better imho\n\n? first levels are little too dark to be readable. Level 5 is very readable for example.\n\n? no levels after 6-1 ?\n\n? more guns please (the existing ones are great): laser, lasso, grenades, blast, invisibility shield, etc\n\n? monsters with seeable movements are disturbing (for me); others are fine. The now standard idea of a big monster destroyed which leads to several tiny monsters ?\n\n? destructible environments, along NON-destructible environments and steel shields (movable, excellent ! or NON-moveable) could be a FANTASTIC part of the strategy. For now, empty spaces imply fragility (hiding and unveiling is a great part of the pleasure in such games). I realize that this is absent from NT (as far as I know, but again I have little experience).\n\n? in the map, sometimes ennemies are now shown\n\n? intermediate state between \"immortal\" and \"easy\": stay immortal but indicate when character is supposed to be dead so that I can improve while continuing to play (well ... there's a counter no?)\n\nAs a very superficial conclusion I would say that this game is great to practice and to avoid despair found in Nuclear Throne. Probably an intermediate space in between NT and Massive is to be taken. I doubt Vlambeer will accept to consider very casual gamers like me, so my last hope is that you developers of Massive can try to leverage the differences (e.g. destructible environments with non-destructible and/or moveable parts; funny guns; considerations for beginners; randomized maps)\n\nThank you again and keep going ! Please pursue your efforts !\n\nBest regards\n\nedit 30/09\n\nparametric difficulty\nhello. the discussion about (the number of) traps makes me think about \"parametrization\" of the game. since levels are procedurally generated why not give the hand to the player ? my own blocker is difficulty setting and i am so poorly skilled that i need a very easy mode. yet the choices in difficulty are brutal, in that no subtleties can be brought.\n\nif the user can choose in settings the number of traps (or a range thereof), the level of power of guns, if environment is destructible or not, to what extent (cursors), etc it could be a huge differenciator versus other similar games. possible variables: number and power of ennemies, number and power of guns, surface of map, complxity of level, number of traps, speed, ...\n\ndo not know at which point it is feasable to \"open\" access to such variables in the code base. but the promise could be that the mix of the game could be personalized to player's taste.\n\nyes some combinations may not work but it is an appeal to play with game some more ;o)\n\nthe more i think of it... it a sign of respect to the user to offer configurable gameplay, let alone of considering difficulty", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "steamid": "76561198263016258", "last_played": 1506176323, "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 512, "playtime_forever": 35}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506098056, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500898", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506769289, "recommendationid": "35132140", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
