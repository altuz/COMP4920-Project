I'm not really into the CS:GO style VR games out right now, but when I tried this out I felt it was exactly what I was looking for: fast-paced, able to leap large distances, on the fly weapon upgrades, and in-and-out 10 minute arena matches. The shooting is accurate in VR, the graphics are good, and it has a great feel to it when you're running and jumping around shooting others, The bots are good enough to play with, but what is seriously lacking is a playerbase, though I have encountered other players a couple of times. The bots fill the gap between games with others, but this game will really take off once the playerbase picks up. Bonus points for an active dev and an actually updating EA game. Highly recommended fast-paced FPS with the hopes that the more people pick this up and get into it, the better it'll be for everyone.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002049680", "last_played": 1505526868, "num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 214, "playtime_forever": 163}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1502595171, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495559", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502595171, "recommendationid": "34205275", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Really fun game.

This game is awesome if you like Unreal Tournament / Quake. Remember when you were young and played UT with InstaGib? You can do that here, but this time in VR!\nIt is fast paced with alot of different game modes. \nThe reason i dont have more playtime is because what others have pointed out... Empty servers!\nI hope it gets as much attention eventually as Onward or Pavlov does.
