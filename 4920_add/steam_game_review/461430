An online multiplayer where you are all a certain role within a NYC fire dept. With multiple departments on each map. Now thats a great idea. However is unfinished... \n\nI managed to get in a game after about 5 attempts. Spent about 10 minutes trying to figure out how to turn on my fire engine and open the door to the get out, while having the worlds loudest siren blaring away. Once i arrived at my first emergency i was met with about 4 other fire engines. Guys that clearly had the same idea as me. Lets drive this thing around New York! \n\nUnfortunately when we all arrived there isnt much you can do after that. There was no way to get the pumps going or the lines attached to put the fire out. At the moment its more of a fire truck driving simulator. I would recommend this is there was more to do. But until then it's a no from me. Maybe i'll change my opinion in an update or two.

To try to drive a police car, and operate it remotely, is almost impossible.

While not a critical issue it would be nice if the designers added more realism, in graphics, to Manhattan.  Lower Manhattan, with a few exceptions, is mostly low level buildings--10 floors or less.
