I love it! Such a tight well designed puzzle platformer! It uses a grid-like movement with well defined rules. For example, if you move through 3 squares you gain speed which can be used to jump through gaps. That's what I mean by grid-based. The first levels will be mostly just showing you different uses of the basic set of movement rules. Then it introduces more elements, like the bubble, then you can control a machine that sticks to metal walls etc. And with each new mechanic comes a world of levels exploring the possibilities. Seriously, the amount of levels is so large it's surprising how they kept them interesting and fun for the most part.\n\n\"For the most part\". Yes, there are a few levels that shy away from clever puzzles to a more reflex oriented type of level. The majority of levels are fun and engaging though.\n\nAnd the music is pretty cool too.\n\nI just bought their bundle here on steam, so I'm replaying this gem of a game.

A good deal of that has to do with the control scheme - most unusually, there's no jump button; instead, you automatically jump under certain conditions. Combined with the clearly defined grid layout, this allows for more interesting puzzles than could have been created with a 'free' jump, but it makes platforming feel pretty awkward.\n\nThere's a reasonable variety of puzzles, but most of the better ones make good use of boxes that you can move around with a magical floating bubble (?) and in some cases destroy. The bubble also can be used to 'scout out' levels and trigger some switches - it's a key mechanic of the game and it eventually feels fairly natural, though like much of the control scheme, it's weird at the start (and the fact that you can only move either your character or the bubble at any given time gets cumbersome). Additionally, you unlock a vehicle after a few areas that can grab onto magnetic surfaces, allowing for some more interesting level design.\n\nIn short, while it's not exactly intuitive, there are some neat puzzles here that might be worth checking out.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198012273796", "last_played": 1475683521, "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 1382, "playtime_forever": 651}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1473295793, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502694", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1473295793, "recommendationid": "25404596", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198033107016", "last_played": 1488387360, "num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 349, "playtime_forever": 1023}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1465947723, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476693", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1479660026, "recommendationid": "23561156", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Years ago when I got this on my PSP it was with a large bundle of games and I thought/knew nothing about it, eventually boredom permitted me to try it and I ended up playing all night, eager to finish 'just one more level'. \n\nWhile starting out extremely simple, the game quickly starts to develope some more challenging and brain teasing obstacles that will sometimes leave you stumped, but be generous enough with checkpoints and quick restarts that you don't get too discouraged.\n\nIt's a mix between a platformer and puzzle game with a very simple but smooth pace, well established physics, and oddly satisfying sprites that seem reminiscent of a sega genesis game.
