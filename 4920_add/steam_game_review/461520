In its current state it's quite impossible to beat, which I guess is the developers laugh on us. You first appear in a house and receive a phone call from your sister who asks on the answering machine when you are coming over. You immediately put the phone down and get ready for the trip into Canada's bear country by equipping all the necessary goods. \n\nProblem is you can't kill the bear, you can't really out run the bear, you can't shake hands with the bear, and you can't sit down and work out an enterprise bargaining agreement with the bear. All you can do is startle the bear by waiting for his nostrils to rest on top of your gun nozzle before you shoot, ending with him just running away and later pouncing and charging on you like he is some sort of huntsman spider. Or simply offer your head up as a picnic basket so you can be done with this game. \n\nUpon your car breaking down as you enter into this Canadian wilderness, you might as well sacrifice yourself because the ending is quite impossible to orchestrate. You see the ultimate objective is for you to find the parts (Car battery & Tool box) necessary to fix the car and leave. Problem is you can't carry the two items needed together as they weigh too much, also your car doesn't accept the items individually. Place the items near the car individually and they disappear. Press all the keys on the keyboard and the car still says no. Hand the items to the bear and ask him to fix your car and he kindly says thankyou by munching down on your cranium. The developer hence gives you a Kobayashi Maru impossible win scenario, this forces a player with the need to deal with a helpless situation. The only way pass this would be to fix the results as Captain Kirk did. Maybe a Modder in future will save us all by rewriting the programming and allow us to chase the bear around the wilderness and bite him. I'd sure pay for that experience.\n\nPersonally I did not appreciate the no win experience, I also found a few bugs where i could walk through walls and doors, other than an initial scare  with the bear, when I discovered that each building is a safe haven, it really wasn't scary, just annoying. The mechanics of the bear being frightened by the gun is not consistent. The gun load and reload function is abysmal. DO NOT BUY THIS. Honestly why would you pay $5.00 for this when you can get the game completely free by doing a quick google search? There are many sites that offer this game free. Below is as far as you can get in the game...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EPhw_G1JFCc", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198112866114", "last_played": 1500512052, "num_reviews": 183, "num_games_owned": 2624, "playtime_forever": 144}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1500877495, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529637", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502833516, "recommendationid": "33759848", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "horror game of the year 1900", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198131254874", "last_played": 1499859622, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499859696, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499345", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499859696, "recommendationid": "33477558", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
