Such is the case with Mandagon, a 2D exploration game set in a Tibetan vision of limbo. You don't know why you're there or what you're doing or why you're a cheeful-looking stone head that can jump, but all will be revealed as you wander the serene temples and ruins of this magical place. There's no real puzzling to do, other than sussing out the story from the cryptic rhymes shared by ancient statues, but the exploration is more than enough to keep you engaged for as long as it lasts.\n\nThe heart of Mandagon's appeal is its environment and atmosphere, which would be remarkable even for a full-priced game. The graphics are finely-detailed pixel art, showing off every crack and bit of moss on stones and every groove in the pillars holding the place aloft. You'll start your adventure in a stony valley of pools and cliff dwellings, but soon your adventure will take you to etherial ruins floating in the sky, their banners and wind chimes tossing gently in the breeze. With no enemies to harangue you and no challenging platforming to speak of, the art turns Mandagon into a peaceful trek across a gorgeous and fantastic world.\n\nIt's not a big world, of course, and you should be able to see all its sights in 30 minutes or so. Your goal is to place six tablets back in their proper places, and there aren't a whole lot of places where they could be hidden. The arches where the tablets must be placed also serve as the fast travel points, making it easy to get back to where you need to be at any time. You won't find any abilities or upgrades, just shortcuts to activate and one special travel method high up in the ruins. There are a few little secrets tucked away that also build on the excellent atmosphere as well.\n\nThe story's not bad but it's told in terribly vague terms, so unless you want to really puzzle out the rhymes you'll just be here for the journey. And it's an absolutely lovely, imaginative journey for the short time it lasts, so there's no reason not to give it a go if you like exploring. This feels like a title for people who loved the Knytt games, because it definitely pushes a lot of the same buttons for me. Here's hoping Mandagon's creators are hard at work on a full game, because this little slice of heaven left me hungry for more.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

So yeah, wasn't good nor bad, for me.\n\nThe game itself is the worst part, since, despite a beautiful and rather large \"world\" (the game is short, it's only \"large\" in the context of a single room/level), it's just about jumping on platforms and using lifts to get to several tablets spread around the game. \n\nThe platforming isn't challenging at all (you're quite slow in the air), and most of the jumps are very forgiving, giving you a fair window for error.\nThere are no mechanics at all, other than a single jump.\n\nSo yeah, you can imagine it being very stale. It's just about moving around, with the most basic movement system you could think of.\n\nThe only challenge here is orientation, since the game only lets you see the map in specific spots, so you can get lost, or miss something and forgetting where it might have been.\n\n\nThe other aspect I should mention is the whole \"Tibetan theology/philosophy\". I think what they wanted to say was \"imagery\", because there's nothing meaningful about philosophy or theology here. And nothing apparently that relates to a particular way of thinking.\nThere are some cryptic lines spread around the game, but you never have to use or understand them. So... no.\nMaybe there are some environmental clues I'm missing? Maybe... but even if there are, they're completely isolated from the *game*, making them irrelevant.\n\nIf it was just about imagery, well... they should set different expectations in the description, I guess.\n\n\n\nThe game isn't too bad, and it's free, so nothing's stopping you from giving you a go. \nI just didn't find anything interesting in it aside from the art-style, so I'll give it a no.\nI'm interested in their future projects regardless!

There is so much detail and I enjoyed every little bird, plant, the shrines, the big temple, the houses, the water, the snow ... should I go on? It has a very distinct Tibetan touch and it makes you feel like you got teleported into a little pixel Himalayan region. It's absolutely beautiful.\n\nMUSIC - 8/10\nThe music sounded ominous and a little disharmonic and spooky, but kinda ... ethereal? I found it to be very fitting in regards to the place and the story.\n\nSTORY - 8/10\nThe more wisdom totems you speak to, the better you can figure out what's going on. I do not want to spoil anything for anyone, but there is symbolism around to help you understand too (the six big murals/pictures on the walls as you ascend in an elevator) and if you pay a little attention to any of the totems, the ending of the game will make you go 'ahh, I knew it was about xy'. It's not very hard to follow but nice to figure out imo. I enjoyed it and it fit the atmosphere and feeling of the game.\n\nCONTROLS - 7/10\nSome people are whining about how hard and unforgiving the jumps are, but I found them to be very forgiving and only messed up one jump in ~60 minutes of playing and found them to be pretty forgiving. Besides the 'tricky jumping', the controls were easy to adapt to.\n\nSuggestions/bugs:\nController optimaziton was a little messed up as both X and A made you jump, although X was supposed to be the action button, so it made taking elevators pretty much impossible as you would just jump instead of ride, over and over again. Additionally, if you weren't holding down on right or left while taking one of the glowing elevators, it would take you up and then down again, without letting you get off. \nDefinitely play with keyboard and mouse!\n\nOVERALL - 8/10\nIt's pretty, it's relaxing, it's only about an hour long, and well, it's free! I found it well worth the time and was actually a bit sad it was so short. I will be buying the DLC because I enjoyed the game a lot and I'd love to see some more games by Blind Sky Studios.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198164129085", "last_played": 1486633754, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 111, "playtime_forever": 68}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1486733965, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486733965, "recommendationid": "29823715", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Mandagon (mantis/panda/dragon) teleports you straight away to a Tibetan Buddhist concept known as 'Bardo' a limbo place between death and rebirth. Buddhists mainly believe that if you do good deeds you get rebirthed into a higher lifeform or do bad deeds and your soul will get rebirthed into a lower life form.\n\nThe objective of the game is to simply find six keys and a number of totems (optional) and open the big door where you will find a 'god' who will then cast his vote. The totems give you back ground information as to your background story as you can't tell much just by looking at yourself since you look like an Aztec version of pacman. \n\nTom Kitchen the main designer behind this game, suffered a family loss in death and looking through various answers though he is not a religious man himself found 'some' comfort in the Tibetan book of the dead and it's the information from that which gives you the background information to your game character as well as to what may have helped Tom get through his grieving process and helped him to move on with his life.\n\nSince morality is an integral part of all of our lives, improving ourselves, being our better self, ascension will at some point play an essential role in both our needs and desires. Likewise this game is all about ascension, moving up (forward) to find answers. Tom Kitchen is all for 'exploring' concepts of an afterlife. Unfortunately only one concept is displayed in this game and I would have been equally impressed if the game went onto explore other concepts, Mormon, Hindu, JW, Catholic, Atheist, phansigar. Maybe that could be a sequel. But the game does do more than just explore afterlife, it also explores the concept of what sacrifice really means too.\n\nWhile this is a free game there is also some DLC available for purchase. It consists of one soundtrack, some art concepts that never made it into the game and finally it places the totem poem in its correct order so it makes sense.\n\nI appreciate that Tom Kitchen was able to move forward as I also looked into Buddhism and read the 'book of the dead', but personally I was never able to get my head around one thing. I haven't always been a good person, so there is always a good chance according to their beliefs that I could come back as a lower life form. Ok fair enough. I have come to appreciate that things like stealing, lying, murder is bad. So here is my question. How can one be a good crocodile or a bad crocodile? Once you started going down in life forms surely you\u2019re doomed!?\n\nA free game that offers an interesting self-meditation on one's morality.

The games I have played throughout 2016 had helped remind me time and time again of my passionate love for video games and my never ending search for the next story. \nAlthough released in 2016, Mandagon was the indie game that started 2017 for me, and oh boy was it one hell of a beautiful game! \n\nCreated by developer Blind Sky Studios, a small UK games studio composed of four coffee loving people, Mandagon is a short and free indie, adventure and pixel styled game inspired by Tibetan theology and philosophy, in which the focus is Bardo, the Tibetan word or version for \u201cLimbo\u201d. \nIn Mandagon you play as a sort of statue or part of a totem, and you explore and climb a sort of temple, in which you are given samples of a story about a man, his daughter, and a choice. Although Mandagon is quite straightforward in its gameplay and purpose, a rather simple and not particularly challenging gameplay of hopping your way to the top and around to access the inside of a temple, the mystery of the story is what will give you the desire to keep hoping, to find out what is on the other side, and, ultimately, what will make you keep thinking about Mandagon even after you are finished with its story. \n\nThere are also two other elements of Mandagon that caught my attention and still has it, the aesthetic of the game and its soundtrack. Although simplistic at first glance, Mandagon is an incredibly gorgeous game in which I encourage you to stop at times and observe your surroundings. See how tapestries move with the wind, the birds flapping their winds, and every other sparkle of color and detail that were a very welcomed surprised for a free game. The soundtrack of Mandagon was also a surprise. A single 22 minute composition seemingly designed for you to meditate your way through the universe, the story and the game, with themes of contemplation and sacrifice. Though available for free on steam at the moment, a digital art book, soundtrack and extras are available as a package for 4.43$ on steam, which I highly recommend not only because it\u2019s awesome, but because I truly believe that Mandagon has too much to offer to be a free game. \n\nIn the hour or so that I spent in its universe, surrounded by its music and its themes or death, life, purpose and sacrifice, Mandagon gave me more than hours and hours long game have been giving me: it gave me an experience. \n\n10/10 \u2013 Will purchase the art and OST package, and would purchase anytime if it means putting my money where it belongs, in the pocket of true artists. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049485343", "last_played": 1485699506, "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_forever": 61}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1485707497, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485707497, "recommendationid": "29567899", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[h1] Not a single bad thing to say\t[/h1]\n\nI had a blast wandering around the beautiful world presented here.
