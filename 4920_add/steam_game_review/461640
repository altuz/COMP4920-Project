The story is solid but everything else is pretty poor.  The music and visuals are nothing special, and the combat is incredibly unbalanced.  Beyond the first few enemy types you encounter, most enemies have a huge amount of HP and are pain to fight.  They deal a lot of damage while barely taking any themselves, and level grinding is far too slow to be worthwhile.  Then around mid-game the cooking system becomes incredibly overpowered and completely flips this upside down if abused.  The story is pretty good though if you can tolerate your way through all the game's faults, and it's incredibly cheap to buy.  If you have some spare change then give it a try, but it's not something that I would recommend highly.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043214842", "last_played": 1502139707, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 53, "playtime_forever": 674}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1502196936, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530048", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1502196936, "recommendationid": "34102824", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Got my attack to 999 and one tapped everyone into oblivion", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198119756912", "last_played": 1500008402, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 71, "playtime_forever": 670}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1500862035, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491070", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500862035, "recommendationid": "33757105", "votes_funny": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Played this game for a total amount of 22 Hours.

The only development seen is the main character and not the other characters.\n4) Recruitment of other characters should be implementd to increase the enjoyment of the game.\n5) Monster from the 7 sins should be used evenly (i.e. lust/succubus demon only appeared once and is never to be seen again).\n\nOverall the game is acceptable, though it should be treated as a shortgame for fun and enjoyment.\nNot recommended for intense/serious players.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030896901", "last_played": 1498922256, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_forever": 1339}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1499432885, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499933", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499432902, "recommendationid": "33342257", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "\u304f__,.\u30d8\u30fd.\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000/\u3000,\u30fc\uff64 \u3009\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\uff3c ', !-\u2500\u2010-i\u3000/\u3000/\u00b4\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 \uff0f\uff40\uff70'\u3000\u3000\u3000 L/\uff0f\uff40\u30fd\uff64\n\u3000\u3000 \u3000 /\u3000 \uff0f,\u3000 /|\u3000 ,\u3000 ,\u3000\u3000\u3000 ',\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\uff72 \u3000/ /-\u2010/\u3000\uff49\u3000L_ \uff8a \u30fd!\u3000 i\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \uff9a \uff8d 7\uff72\uff40\uff84\u3000 \uff9a'\uff67-\uff84\uff64!\u30cf|\u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 !,/7 '0'\u3000\u3000 \u00b40i\u30bd| \u3000 |\u3000\u3000\u3000\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 |.\u4ece\"\u3000\u3000_\u3000\u3000 ,,,, / |./ \u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \uff9a'| i\uff1e.\uff64,,__\u3000_,.\u30a4 / \u3000.i \u3000|\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \uff9a'| | / k_\uff17_/\uff9a'\u30fd,\u3000\uff8a.\u3000|\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 | |/i \u3008|/\u3000 i\u3000,.\uff8d |\u3000i\u3000|\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000.|/ /\u3000\uff49\uff1a \u3000 \uff8d!\u3000\u3000\uff3c\u3000|\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 \u3000 k\u30fd>\uff64\uff8a \u3000 _,.\uff8d\uff64 \u3000 /\uff64!\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 !'\u3008//\uff40\uff34\u00b4', \uff3c \uff40'7'\uff70r'\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \uff9a'\u30fdL__|___i,___,\u30f3\uff9a|\u30ce\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\u3000\uff84-,/\u3000|___./\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\u3000'\uff70'\u3000\u3000!_,.:", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198212400725", "last_played": 1468679251, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_forever": 190}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1502457027, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501903", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1502457027, "recommendationid": "34168184", "votes_funny": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game has a few cons, like not being able to carry more than 99 of anything, having to go through a hassle every time you cook, not being able to change equipment, not being able to change fighting style etc. But it's dirt cheap, and the story is AMAZING.
