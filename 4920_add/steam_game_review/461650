I was actually laughing out loud at how much more ridiculous the story got with each passing chapter. It's hard to explain without revealing any spoilers. But that's part of the problem. The story is so poorly written, it drops spoilers on itself. Predictable is too mild a word. The characters are so 1-dimensional, that you can just match them up with their 'Creative Writing 101' archetype when they are introduced. At first there was disappointment with these flaws. But about half way thru, the story reached a point of absurdity that I couldn't help smiling at how awful it was. I also couldn't help but use the 'vast power of my imagination' to envision the author asking himself - \"How big a turd will these Choice of Games people pay me to pop out?\" The big twist is beyond telegraphed. It's like when a little kid tries to whisper something to you and its louder than if he had spoken in his normal voice. And this so-called twist is delivered to you by a character that is even too campy to be a Bond villain - it's all just laughable! This is the kind of game you gift to someone as a practical joke. I am seriously asking - was this *meant* to be funny? I can't tell. \n\nBut I feel kind of guilty wondering if it may have been a genuine effort at entertaining people. Oh ... that's sad. Now I feel bad again. To avoid inflicting upon others the crushing sense of despair that comes from realizing someone might have poured their heart and soul into something so dreadful, I can't recommend this story/game to anyone. Advice for the Choice of Games people - replace 'ultra-violent' with 'ultra-hilarious' in the game description and repackage it as an assassin parody- but don't tell the author. Then I will come back and give the game a thumbs up.\n\nNow I guess I'll go take a magic healing bubble bath that can help cure gunshot wounds, just like the hero of the story does after a tough mission.

If the alluring fantasy of being a sleek, cool assassin in fiction has ever appealed to you, whether it's through playing Hitman, The Darkness, or taking on the Dark Brotherhood quests in the Elder Scrolls series, or being enthralled by movies like John Wick and Pulp Fiction, this game is for you.\n\nThe writing does a great job of making your character feel formidable and impressive, and rewards how you want to personally characterize them from their personality to their skill set with a rich and interesting set of possibilities. It's one of the closest and most rewarding things I've found outside of some other conventional video games that lets you more or less live out what it would be like to be the star in a high octane action film.\n\nI would freely encourage anyone who thinks they might be interested to check out COG's other games/novels as well (all the free demos let you play out the first three chapters, giving you a fair taste of whether it'll hold your interest or not, so you can't really go wrong there), as I've found most of them to be pretty enjoyable, but I can definitely say there's probably nothing else they can offer that's quite like this. \n\nOf course, the story isn't 100% realistic, but where's the fun in that? If you can suspend your disbelief enough for an interactive novel the same way you would for 1980's Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, but don't want a story that's completely mindless or unbelievable, give the demo a shot at the very least (no pun intended). Not many of their games are usually $5 on Steam, but I'd say this is one of the instances where it's definitely worth it.\n\nThe first time I beat this game, I immediately started another playthrough.

That seems like an oddly simple thing to praise a game for, but that\u2019s exactly where these games have been failing of late.

They\u2019ve been taking place in entirely author created worlds with too many moving pieces and not nearly enough words or time to let the reader immerse themselves into it; that too with worlds that aren\u2019t nearly as interesting as the respective authors believe them to be. They\u2019re so distracted at being something else that they stop being choose your own adventures.\n\nThis was just that, an adventure where you\u2019re choosing the details, and steering the story.

It's okay i guess. Mediocre. I can only barely recommend this game and mostly only because it's fairly cheap.\n\nThis is another one of those choose-your-own-adventure type text-based games in the same basic style (but not of the same quality) as Choice of Robots, Choice of Alexandria or Champion of the Gods. It features the same huge flaw; the inability to simply turn the page back to a previous choice or a previous page.\n\nI have to admit though, on my first play through I was very impressed with this game. It's campy and silly and purposefully cliched in many of the right ways. The descriptions are good and visceral but the writing style never takes itself seriously as it is continually heavy-handed. In a way, this is a very well-done parody of those dime-a-dozen thriller novels featuring assassins and murder-for-hire secret organizations and so forth. The choices seem interesting and it feels as though each choice may be very important and could potentially lead to a very different conclusion. Unfortunately any sense of choice this game provides is largely an illusion.\n\nI started to see some serious draw-backs to this game during my second and third times through. Some choices seem to have fairly arbitrary results and all choices ultimately lead you either to the exact same death paragraph or the exact same final battle encounter. Some paragraphs are swapped in or out in favor of others depending on how evil your character is or depending on which side characters you've chosen to support along the way but the story is, very unfortunately, largely the same no matter what you do, unless you act extremely stupidly and manage to die before the story's end.\n\nWorse still, despite the initially compelling sense of danger this game provides, this game is actually extremely forgiving, particularly given its subject matter. Situations in which you should instantly die merely cause you to be wounded and you will usually have the opportunity to get healed before the next chapter. Once, I literally played through the game trying to get my character killed and didn't manage it until well into the second half of this game's story, mostly because I refused to allow him to get healed whenever the opportunity to do so presented itself.\n\nFrom the standpoint of being challenged to find the right path to a successful ending of some kind, this game practically plays itself and worst of all, you get pretty much the same ending (only with different moral overtones) no matter what choices you make. There is a single juncture at which you can either choose to end the game or continue but that is almost the only real decision that really seems to matter so far as changing the story's ultimate ending. The potential have the amazing experience of peering into a myriad of radically altered versions of the future, each based on your different potential choices, a trait which should ideally be common to all choose-your-own-adventure type games/stories, is largely ignored here.\n\nThere is no way, for example, to choose to side with the story's antagonists. There is no way to try to escape the confines of the story's plot and lead a life that is irrelevant to being an assassin (you can't drop everything and become a used car salesman instead). There is no way to simply dick around and do nothing until you get killed. The game forces you to go on airplane flights, to take certain missions, to go to Miami. Even if you fail all your early assassination missions, the game's final confrontation will still happen where it always does. No matter what skills you emphasize along the way, if you win, the villain will still be brought down in a very similar way (during a kung fu fight). This game offers few true choices. Playing it more than once merely kills your time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198075673573", "last_played": 1497775531, "num_reviews": 149, "num_games_owned": 269, "playtime_forever": 471}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1497863531, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497863531, "recommendationid": "32560780", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
