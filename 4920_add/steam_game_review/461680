It runs and loads fast, the graphics are nicer than a lot of other FPV games/sims and it runs perfectly with my Spektrum DX8 (i use the Aerofly usb connector from Hobby King $5) I like the realisitc look of the area and the quad. I see a lot of negative reviews for this game and i have never had any of the prolems mentioned. If you have never flown a multirotor before the controls might take a bit of getting used to but they seem realistic. The game probably isnt as forgiving as Liftoff but i think thats a good thing.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197991354216", "last_played": 1500180605, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 297, "playtime_forever": 67}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499935158, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504391", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499935158, "recommendationid": "33498467", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
