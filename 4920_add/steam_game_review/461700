The voice acting is on point and though I was a little disappointed in a couple of the new character drawings (Damien's overly childlike appearance mostly) it was still very visually beautiful as well. \n\nAlso the bloopers nearly made me pee my pants from laughter. (Jelloapocalypse, seriously. That man is hysterical.)\n\nIf you liked the first game or if you enjoy deep, emotional, humorous romances, play this game.
