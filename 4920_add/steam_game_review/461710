The actual stories aren't very original but they're still narrated with enough competence to make them enjoyable: the overarching plot is what I found to be most engaging as it affects the protagonists' lives quite deeply and it made me want to go forward to see how things'd end. Said characters also follow the tropes of the genre quite closely but they're at least given some well written dialogues that gives them some depth and makes you care for what might happen to them.\n\nAs gameplay goes things are quite simple for the most part, you have an AP system that governs skill usage and three different attack options differing in strength. AP recharge rate. Some eras will switch things up a bit but fights are never too complex or challenging: thankfully there's no random encounters and the number of fights seemed good enough to not make things dull.\n\nThe only thing that made me frown a bit was the last boss of the game: the fight itself isn't hard as the mechanics are quite easy but it feels a bit of a chore due to its length and the fact you're simply asked to balance AP usage, healing and skills. It also bugged out the first time I've attempted it, forcing me to close the game using the taskbar and go through all the previous cutscenes.\n\nFor a 3$ game Tales Across Time is truly nicely done and smartly puts its timelines idea to good use providing an enjoyable and quite engaging narrative. Pair this with serviceable combat and a good attention to both its graphics and sound and I'm going to say this one is quite the hidden gem.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006541362", "last_played": 1461172575, "num_reviews": 220, "num_games_owned": 2057, "playtime_forever": 303}, "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_created": 1461216781, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526801", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1461216781, "recommendationid": "22544917", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[b]Briefly: I've been a fan of Joshua's work since [i]8-Bit Adventures: The Forgotten Journey[/i]. [i]Tales Across Time[/i] is their new game and I can say it's splendid work both visually and storywise, exploring tropes rarely used in gaming.[/b]\n\nIn [i]Tales Across Time[/i] you play as several characters over three vastly different eras, all of which are bound together by a common antagonist. While there's no time travel, storywise it's got some similarities to such gems as [i]Chrono Trigger[/i] and [i]Eternal Darkness[/i], though it's neither a horror game nor a grand RPG, as it's only few hours long.\n\nThe game was first introduced at Indie Game Making Contest 2015 that introduced the twist of growth. This early theme can still be seen through the area and the world changing with the eras. In comparison, the published game is a lot more polished both graphically and storywise, especially with the third story that looks to be expanded tremendously.\n\n[h1]One game, three stories[/h1]\n\nFirst two stories are short, about one hour experiences. All three stories are very different in tone, from a simple exploration to politics to frantic chases and have different casts: after all, they occur at different eras.\n\nIn every story there are many characters to acquaintance in addition to the protagonist. Pretty much all characters are likeable and I found it refreshing that other characters are not idle but act in meaningful and interesting ways. \n\nThe natural main character for an RPGMaker game is a fighter. Thus, in the first story you take the role of the the seasoned warrior who guides the expedition to an old temple ruin in a desert. The story builds an anxious atmosphere of unknown danger and mystery.\n\nAs the guide you deal with any dangers (i.e. monsters) encountered. There are no random encounters, instead every combat is predetermined and usually unavoidable. I'll talk more about combat further down.\n\nSkip ahead few unspecified years and there's the second story at a flourishing trading hub that has emerged out of the desert. Tone is very different, merry and oozing of expectation and happiness, until a twist turns it into a darker mood. Overall there's less exploration and more reactive action than in the first one.\n\nFinally, again an era later the setting has turned from a mild fantasy one into a straight-out science fiction. The alarmed setting feels both mysterious and tense at the same time. The epic conclusion of the millennia long storyline, the third story is the longest of the flock taking almost 2 hours for myself, possibly because it's got more exploration than the first two stories.\n\n[h1]Non-random encounters[/h1]\n\nScrapping the usual random encounters and even levels, the combat system is refreshingly different. Without levels there is no grinding. Instead every fight is like a separate challenge or sometimes comparable to a puzzle. Usually every monster is only encountered once or twice to keep it fresh.\n\nYou even begin every fight at full health and half action points. Action points (AP) are similar to magic points: they are needed to perform special maneuvers like super attacks, full parries or heal-ups.\n\nNormal attacks of different strength replenish AP, the weaker the attack the more AP replenished. This way you have to manage them to be able to beat the enemy. Consequently every fight is technically 1 vs 1, though supporting characters can do some critical special maneuvers as well.\n\nFights can get rather difficult, especially if you don't immediately see how to counter enemy moves and manage health and AP accordingly. I had to redo a couple of fights several times. Luckily, dying (or otherwise losing) usually only restarts you to the start of the current scene where the encounter happened and has no other adverse effects.\n\nThe only ability progression happens by story-based events or finding enhancing crystals hidden around, granting a few bonus max hit points or AP. I think other kind of improving would be unrealistic anyway since the stories occur over a few days at most. For a short game like this the combat system is perfect. \n\n[h1]Visuals and technical side[/h1]\n\nFor an RPGMaker game the graphics are top-notch and soundtrack is cool and fitting. I encountered a couple of bugs but they were quickly fixed after reporting them in the forums.\n\nOtherwise, the only possible problems are:\n1) the lack of Steam overlay (because of the engine) and the resulting clumsiness of screen capping (so you have to go to the forums and find the instructions)\n2) having only 4 save slots\n3) inability to change controls the exact way I want (again because of the engine). If you can bear the standard controls it works well. I played with keyboard and also tested that my X-Box 360 controller handles correctly.\n\n[h1]Conclusions[/h1]\n\nThe whole game lasted just 4.5 hours for me. In comparison to their earlier title, [i]8-Bit Adventures: The Forgotten Journey[/i], [i]Tales Across Time[/i] is more story-focused and linear as this time around it's not an open world. That said, every scene in the game has a purpose and it's very focused on keeping the story flowing onward.\n\nAs a short title, I liked it quite a bit and it's cheap too. Call me crazy to say so but I even thought it was a bit under-priced: IMO, 5 \u20ac would've been perfect for this content.\n\nSo, want a good JRPG-style RPG adventure?
