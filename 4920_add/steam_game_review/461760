It's nothing amazing. Just a simple shoot 'em all type game. Basically you stadn in the middle with a character which you selected and you move up and down and shoot the people moving towards you. Some of them have shields and guns so you have to be careful which way you move. Also there are powerups that spawn on the top of the map or the bottom which will enhance your powers.

You pick a character based on your playstyle and attempt to thwart a New World Order - or a bunch of reptiles attempting to take over.  You're limited to moving up and down in the center of the screen, shooting attackers from either side.  As you progress, the enemies become more difficult and develop different characteristics - such as shields, shooting back, or becoming faster.  Kill enough and you may just end up on the leaderboard!  Your kills are also carried over in a total reptiles killed counter that goes towards unlocking other characters to use.  \n\nOverall the game is pretty fun for what it is and the low price.  I definitely recommend checking it out and having a bit of fun with it.  The only complaint I really have is using the Z key to shoot while using WASD or arrow keys to move.  It feels a bit awkard but isn't a terribly major issue.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2HbM0kg6hAA", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025227359", "last_played": 1470589778, "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 169, "playtime_forever": 18}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1470591645, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488658", "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1470591645, "recommendationid": "24763506", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I was not impressed with this game.
