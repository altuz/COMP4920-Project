I had no idea what to expect when I launched this game because I use a random steam game picker website.  I immediately noticed the wonderful soundtrack, very calming and gentle.  Started playing the game, and it's a puzzle game.  Okay, pretty simple, kind of like tangrams mixed with slider-puzzles where you have to move pieces around and avoid collision along the way.  Simple concept, the music really put me into a puzzling mood and I dove in.  Did a few easy tutorial puzzles, then I started to notice what I was putting together.  After every puzzle completion you get rewarded with a scene from an adventure with a little dood in some surreal world.  I'm motivated to continue because I want to experience the story.  All the while the music is tremendously soothing.  Decide to alt-tab and check the store page.  It has overwhelming reviews, I agree.  And then I see the price 99 cents!  For that money, based upon my half hour spent puzzling, I can already tell you that it is absolutely worth it.\n\nRecommend to puzzlers\nRecommend to anyone who is having a super crappy day, the zen qualities are amazing", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010553452", "last_played": 1505856945, "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 823, "playtime_forever": 46}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505794116, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505794116, "recommendationid": "35057616", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
