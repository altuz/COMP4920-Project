It's got less features and flavor overall when compared to KR though.. No hero levels or skill trees, less diverse tower types, and no interactibles in the environment as far as I can tell. I don't think there are any units that slow / charm / paralyze enemies, push enemies back up the path, insta-kill or anything like that. Just regular projectile/melee attacks all around, making the strategy a bit bland.\n\nThe towers don't necessarily target the furthest advanced enemy, which can be a bit frustrating since flying enemies sometimes just sail by while the archers are busy shooting ground enemies that are much closer to the beginning of the path. There are no options to change the targetting AI either. Instead, you can click on a single enemy at a time to make everyone within range focus on it.\n\nOverall happy about having bought this game.

I find upgrade mechanic interesting from what I've seen so far.\n\nThe performance problems are constant and incredibly frustrating. They seem related to the UI, but not completely. Any action that opens a window often takes a second+. It's so unresponsive that you start wondering if you didn't actually clicked the right spot. This happens even when you're out of combat such as between maps and you want to look at different upgrade options.  If I click on my hero, the FPS goes from 60 to 27 and the game often freezes for a second+. If I  let the battle run without touching my keyboard or mouse, there will still be significant FPS drops. Keep in mind there are not many units on the screen, maybe 30 total.\n\nAs for gameplay you can construct towers or support buildings and there are seperate build locations for each. The tower size determines the number of units and their strength. A level one tower has one unit. If that unit dies, it will eventually regenerate. The support structures determine the type of units. This allows you to balance between melee, range and magic attacks. From what I've seen the towers never fire or attack on their own. It's all about the units that they create. It's almost like your only towers are barracks or guard house type towers from other tower defense games. Maybe this changes at some point, but that's all I've seen so far.\n\nYou also have three powers: area attack, unit heal and slow. You get them starting with the first map. They seem to regenerate quickly.\n\nEach completed map opens up three upgrades which you can spend stars on. You earn stars by completing maps. Three initally then a couple more from increasing the difficulty. This is a maximum of five per map and the upgrade costs were 3, 3 and 4 stars so it might not be possibly to have all the upgrades. Again I haven't played very far so maybe this changes later in the game. None of the upgrades I saw really stood out and I took the 'archers do more damage'. I hope this changes, but none of the 18 or some upgrades I've open looked fun.\n\nYou also have a hero and apparently can open up more heroes at some point. The first thing you learn in that your hero is stupid. You will tell him to stand in front of the archers and 10 seconds later he's a third of the map away leaving your archers exposed. I've never seen him return on his own. The heroes don't appear to have any player controlled abilities nor advancement potential. The units themselves are also stlightly stupid. Enemy archers will slowly pick off each melee unit from a distance and the unit will just stand there until dead. You have to send in your hero to take out the archers or maybe micromange the unit locations.\n\nThe game has been out for several month and I don't see any patches. My game says it's 1.0. There are a couple old developers posts in the spartan forums. It doesn't like any of the issues will ever be improved.\n\nGood:\n[list]\n  [*]Art style\n  [*]Attention to art detail\n[/list]\n\nMeh:\n[list]\n  [*]Tower mechanics\n  [*]Upgrades\n  [*]Heroes\n[/list]\n\nBad:\n[list]\n  [*]Performance\n  [*]Depth\n  [*]Lack of developer support\n[/list]\n\nOverall: [h1]Strong Pass[/h1]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197991058411", "last_played": 1489720720, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 349, "playtime_forever": 32}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1489723631, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500768", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1489723750, "recommendationid": "30562563", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Well worth the price...\n\nAnother one of those great fun mobile games come to PC.\n\nThe only thing that I do not like is that all the heroes are unlocked and selectable right from the start.\n\nThey should have like in other games of this type slowly had you unlocked the heroes as you progressed through the campaign.\n\nAnother thing that I do not like is that the game does not have a way to level up the hero as they gain experience.\n\nBut other than those two small things I'm happy with this purchase.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009352135", "last_played": 1484367060, "num_reviews": 95, "num_games_owned": 403, "playtime_forever": 594}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1483170390, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500910", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1483171570, "recommendationid": "28859574", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Tower Dweller, is surprisingly enough a tower defense game. The graphics are cute and clean and works really well with the games feel. You start of we a really funny story of why you have to defend your land, the voice acting is phenomenal and it actually made me laugh!

Your towers can have supporting buildings next  to them, that upgrades your peasants to militia solders with swords. From each tower, you are able to set a flag down on the path, and that towers units, will move to that location, this way you can create different lines of defenses along the path to make your units perform the best and support each other....\n\nMy full review right here:\n\nhttp://rawdeegaming.com/tower-dwellers-rawview/", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992236233", "last_played": 1472166394, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 207, "playtime_forever": 388}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1472139984, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503830", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1472139984, "recommendationid": "25134464", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Due to performance issues I will not recommand this game.\n\nIt looks great and I like the way one can combine different powers to one tower, I even like the story but because of the performance I get frustrated quickly and just don't want to continue. \nIf you don't mind that try it!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198118196602", "last_played": 1499523274, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_forever": 417}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1490636218, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496942", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1490636218, "recommendationid": "30776421", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Remarkably buggy.
