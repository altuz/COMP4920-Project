Then picture yourself doing that 100 more times. It's actually quite fun, until it isn't. \n\nBefore I get into it: I'd give the game a 4/10. You'll probably play it once and put it away. But for less than $3, it's not much of a gamble. And yes, I did beat the game.\n\nPros:\n-The mable mechanic is really intersting. It takes some getting used to, but it is really nice once you have adapted.\n-The level variety is pretty interesting, ranging from slow platforming stages, to racing down the strip as fast as you can, to avoiding obstacles that will push you out of the way.\n-Some of the music is good.\n-The level designs are interesting, but get a little repetitive.\n\nCons:\n-There is no incentive for anything. The items are pretty useless. You can only use your coins for lives and slightly different skins. Points...Are just points. \n-Because items mean essentially nothing, there are many levels where you say screw it, move forward as fast as possible and jump until you reach the goal. This is further enhanced with the first bug I list below.\n-There are items that seem to serve zero purpose.\n-No timer of any kind. This would cause some stress and make me feel like I'm playing a game. Add some speedrunning aspect or a countdown timer to make it more interesting.\n-The first 50 or so levels are varied and somewhat interesting. After 50 you end up seeing previous levels with small differences. The last 10 levels or so...just a straight line with a bunch of 1 obstacle. Oh..and screw level 82.\n-Some of the music stinks.\n-Not sure if this is on purpose, but in some of the levels  the end of the platforms are not flush, causing a really awkward stall in flow. For instance, on the ginat ball rails you'll be fine until the end..where you hit the platform and get launched out of bounds.\n\nBugs:\n-Low on lives? No worries, just press start and restart level before you die...no lives lost.\n-Music stops looping on certain stages, so you're stuck with the sounds of the level, which is typically one 2-3 second sound that constantly repeats.\n-Some levels have no music.\n-Some levels are broken. You'll see messages along the lines of \"Lighting needs to reinitialize. <X objects did not appear>\"\n\n\nAll in all, give it a try if you want. If you've played games like this...you'll realize right away that it's not the quality of other ball platformers, but it's alright to waste some time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046669198", "last_played": 1462647435, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 211}, "votes_up": 52, "timestamp_created": 1462520757, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578684", "votes_down": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1462520757, "recommendationid": "22822834", "votes_funny": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I can barely play this game.\nI don't know if it's my fault for playing on a laptop or what, but I feel like a simple marble platformer should be easy enough to play on any type of computer.\n\nbut seriously though, I'm at 5 frames a second on the lowest graphics settings possible, why cant there just be a way to dissable the backgrounds to the levels (surely that's whats causing it).

It's a fair game that won't let you away with mistakes but at the same time - rewards your patience and skill.\n\nThe graphics and music and pleasant but I did notice some frame dropping - but that happened only on certain levels.  Most were fluid and responsive. \n\nThis game has been cleverly made to draw you in.  And it drew me in.  You also get about 28 lives to start with and you'll need them.  But I found that as I got better - I found new life tokens which were great.\n\nIt's been a while since i've seen a game that is beautiful and absorbing without any annoying side issues.

Sadly it did not; it seems a bit too rough and unpolished, the lighting effects aren't too great, the backgrounds can at times be so bright they make the level itself hard to see, and the mixture of different texture styles are a bit jarring to the eyes.\n\nWhen you make a game based around trial and error for solving the levels, a lives-system is infuriatingly aggravating and adds an extra level of frustration to the game. The timer for the puzzles also includes all your previous attempts as well, which makes the solve-timer seem somewhat skewed. My biggest gripe with the controls is the fact that you can't turn the camera around, but rather tilt it left and right in an odd fashion, which makes precision jumping an absolute nightmare. Now I don't mind difficulty, Marble Blast could drive my patience into the ground and grind on it and not let up until I decided to GIT GUD, but compounded with a limited number of lives (although it doesn't take many coins to buy 100 lives) takes away from the experience.\n\nThe physics seem a bit wonky at times as well, there's a sequence of falling platforms that you have to get across in one of the earlier levels, and if you're on the platform when it starts falling, the direction you'll be sent bouncing off into is seemingly completely random.\n\nI feel there is so much potential in this game, but the menus look like they're straight out of the 90's, the aestethics rub me the wrong way (the textures gives me the cheap low-key indie vibe in some levels), and the fact that precision jumping is a total bitch when you can't tell if your jump will be straight or not, and it just makes me long back to Marble Blast Gold and its sprawly levels of creative and sunny look and feel.\n\nIn its current state I cannot with good conscience give this game anything but a thumbs down; the game isn't strictly speaking BAD; while I didn't expect it to be Marble Blast, and I expected to be let down on at least a few points, the fact that it let me down on nearly all points means the game doesn't get my recommendation. I applaud the developer and hope they can take it to heart and make either updates to the current game, or a new one with improved controls, a little face-lift, and perhaps some more cheery backgrounds (that perhaps also wouldn't be so taxing on lower end machines as well), then they can have a new review and perhaps a recommendation from me too.\n\nTL:DR; there is a lot of potential in here, but the games' controls are too restrictive to deliver a good experience. Bad camera controls make precision jumping a pain, and the backgrounds can be too demanding for low-end computers without choosing a very low resolution.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198054225332", "last_played": 1464644781, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 244, "playtime_forever": 33}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1465135378, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499810", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1465135378, "recommendationid": "23400705", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game has needs some speed improvements, as well as a fix to the lag.
