HOWEVER!!!!!  since on the reddit forum (reddit.com/r/FreeGamesOnSteam)  you can get paid dlc for free, and i have... so far 5 free.  three of them came with premium gems.  every day on facebook they give away monsters as well, and you get the ability to draw them based on how many friends have used your shared guy.\n\nthis is all logistics... how is the gameplay?\n\nPROS:  gameplay is perfect.  its a 2d flat field that moves left to right as you click advance.  you can litearlly move everyone around as many times as you want, and in some instances, you'll very quickly find that might be the only way to victory.\n\ngraphically its very cartoon 80's.  you wont hate them.  every design is nice.  not overstated, not \"HERE IS 200 GIRLS WITH TITS BIGGER THAN  THEY ACTUALLY CAN HANDLE\"  oh no no.  there are females and they are drawn tastefully and a few have sex appeal.  its always done tastefully and never over the top.\n\nsocially, this game's servers are NOT full of over entitled children.   you can chat globally or with your guildies.  guild wise i never found one not aggressive - but friendly.  some will enforce donations, etc.  just leave those and go to one that doesnt.\n\noverall this has a bit of an old school rpg feel graphically.  the enviroment isn't toxic.  you can get gamepacks for free on reddit, and they give away monsters almost daily on their facebook page.\n\nbottom line:  if you like tactical games with drawing cards, you should check this out.  i paid about 15 bucks and received tens of thousands of premium in game currency.  and i get packs when i see them on reddit.com/r/freegamesonsteam and you should too, if you get into it.  it has a story, it has EVERY way to upgrade your characters in game, you get your own castle to upgrade that will give you EVERY currency for free.  daily and overall quests send you tons of diamonds, monsters, etc.\n\ngive it a shot.  you might like it.  its way better than any free to play games in this catagory.  you can buy in game currency but theres figuratively tons of ways to get them free without paying a single thing.\n\nWHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?
