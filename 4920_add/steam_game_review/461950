Most of the day to day missions seemed to strike a great balance between mundane tasks, time pressure and interesting curiosities.\n\nThe problem is I was expecting some sort of challenge where my actions would have consequences.  I'll try to explain while remaining vague enough as to not spoil the game. \n\nOn my playthrough, I took a role-playing perspective and decided I was going to follow a certain path of action.  This made making all of my decisions in game a lot easier because I basically made my mind up on what sort of cop I wanted to be, and then stuck to it. \n\nThe thing is - just when I was expecting something to happen - the game ended.  I hit a wall.  All the decisions I had made had simply just 'maxed out' my character towards one of the many dead ends in this game.  \n\nI was expecting complications and challenges.  I was expecting some sort of repurcussion to my decisions.  The repurcussion simply ended up being that my game ended.\n\nWhat does that leave me with?  Am I supposed to just grind through every obvious pattern of behaviors to get different predictable endings?  \n\nI guess if you approach this game as a 'choose your adventure' book rather than any sort of roleplaying game, it may be fun. \n\nFor me, it was a massive disappointment. \n\nSpoiler explanation:  [spoiler]I simply sided with the Mafia at every available opportunity.  By just completing my regular missions I seemed to avoid any negative consequences for doing this.  I was expecting something interesting to happen - would the police start investigating me?  Would the rival gang retaliate?  Would the mafia try to betray me? No, instead the game just abruptly ends, I couldn't help but feel I had just wasted 4 hours of my life.[/spoiler]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961919771", "last_played": 1491579963, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 279, "playtime_forever": 249}, "votes_up": 26, "timestamp_created": 1504862533, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553752", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505396092, "recommendationid": "34810709", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "An original indie game with time management concept similar to Papers Please. \n\nDay after a day you are going to the same few blocks of a street as a simple beat cop, and you have to focus on different goals at the same time; quite limited time, which you have to plan how to use the best. The daily routines are split into 3 categories: \n1)the mundane checking of parking, lights, tires, and catching punks robbing stores  (gets boring after a while, but is easy)\n2)helping the people of the city with their submissions (which usually are pretty intresting and clever!)\n3)working on your long term goal to finish the game.  (crucial for the story)\nYou dont always have time to do everything every day, so you have to decide whether you are focusing on 1) 2) or 3) (usually 3 for obvious reasons).\n\nPixel graphics are very rich, the world comes to live in retro style, with large ammount of animated sprites.\nAnd as you can hear from the trailer, the music is spot-on as well.\n\nWriting is solid; you get to know the characters even if their faces are just a few pixels. There is something new for each and every day, so even if the location of the game stays same for the duration of 21 days (each lasts like 15 minutes of irl gametime), you wont get bored. Only lackluster is the very end of the game; the climax is too fast, and ending is way too short. Shame that the ending couldnt be a bit longer and rewarding than it is...\n\nStill, the road to the end matters more than just the end, and its easy to recommend this game for anyone who likes indie games with original game concept. You need to have some stress tolerance though, as the ticking clock keeps you busy all the time, even though the game itself is not hard by any means.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198081450332", "last_played": 1502392613, "num_reviews": 40, "num_games_owned": 379, "playtime_forever": 806}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1504612164, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519278", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504612301, "recommendationid": "34754778", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Beat Cop Simulator is a side-scrolling, pixel art retro-inspired adventure game created by Pixel Crow and published for 11 Bit Studios.\n\nAs Officer (formerly Detective) Jack Kelly your job is to patrol your beat, a mix a few genuine law abiding citizens along with  stereo-typical Italian/Sicillian Mafia types, street wise and ultra dangerous African-American street gangs as well as petty criminals and opportunists. At the start of each day you are given your orders for the day, usually visiting certain characters of following up on crimes, as well a a regular number of tickets to issue for parking violations whether it's for being legally parked, having flat/bald tyres etc.\n\nThe underlying story is Kelly's attempt to make enough money not only to pay his ex-wife and debts but also to try to clear his name over a case of missing jewellery which has been stolen with him as the prime suspect despite the fact there is seemingly little evidence to prove the case which is why Kelly is busted down the ranks to rookie street cop.\n\nThe game itself is really nice looking for the style, it is after all a retro pixel style scrolling reminiscent of something from the earlier days of gaming so you shouldn't really expect 4k graphics and fast paced action filled cut scenes with guns, explosions and car chases, the game does what it is meant to do and that is it looks like an 80's/90's style video game and sticks to that ethic while giving it the polish of a modern game. \n\nThe streets seem active and though interaction with the people on the street is limited there are a few side-missions you can do usually if the scheduled police work has already been completed.  Unfortunately the game is let down a little by it's story and sometimes it feels more of an afterthought to the game-play and looks of Beat Cop Simulator although in fairness taking that 70's look it is in that respect very retro too in many ways for not over-burdening it with story.\n\nI did have one issue with the controls which I found to be a little awkward at times, being more used to using a controller wasn't really an issue as the controls are easy enough to pick up however their functionality isn't all that great and it is hit and miss sometimes when you are in pursuit trying to make an arrest having to move the character forward while trying to click on the handcuff to make the arrest, surely there was a better way of incorporating mouse and keyboard commands to make movement and general controls better.  Also the system for time and your shift on patrol feels a little off, it just feels like it hinders more than helps the game and while the slowing down of time when you speak to NPC's is a nice touch it still feels a little out of place for this sort of game I guess.\n\nAs of this review I have played a couple of hours of Beat Cop Simulator and really enjoyed it, it is something I can go back to for a break from the maybe more popular and bigger budgeted games I play but I do find Beat Cop Simulator is fun even though there are some issues with it.  Overall I would recommend Beat Cop Simulator, for all the problems it may have none really detract from what a fun game it actually is and it is a nice break from some of the more modern games.\n\n7.5/10\n\n\nJim @ Omen Gaming\n\nLINKS:\nSteam: https://steamcommunity.com/id/OmenUK/\nStream Notifications Group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/OGLSN\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/omengaminguk\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Omen_UK1972\nVid.me: https://vid.me/omengaming\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmpOV63XfXolrJibXpLI6wg", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057258664", "last_played": 1503855455, "num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 297, "playtime_forever": 137}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505135986, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506216", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505135986, "recommendationid": "34882651", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "When I was little I wanted to be a cop, little me would have liked this. 10/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 568, "steamid": "76561198174950258", "last_played": 1506554478, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 26, "playtime_forever": 568}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506563397, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501219", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506563397, "recommendationid": "35252779", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "100% Will beat the cop again", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "steamid": "76561198156166198", "last_played": 1505975565, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 169, "playtime_forever": 503}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505100476, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477701", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1505100476, "recommendationid": "34875985", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
