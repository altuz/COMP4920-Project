This is what happened. A.I.M Racing is a follow on in the series of 'A.I.M' (not yet ported to steam) and 'A.I.M 2' which can be found here...\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/289180/\n\nBoth of which I had never heard of before. Basically the story set up in these versions is that mankind was playing around with artificial intelligence and creating mobile war machines called 'gliders' which were in turn controlled by artificial brains in a capsule called 'mechminds'. Each generation produced a more complicated and sophisticated 'mechmind' and the 5th generation was considered to be the most superior. All this testing was done covertly on a planet known as 'Polygon 4'. Eventually because of various milestone events, the future construction of these war machine gliders were abandoned and the location of this planet a forgotten fairy tale. However the assembly line itself and the testing facility was still fully operational and the testing protocols as dictated in its programming was still active. Hence the planet itself was still testing the mechminds to see which was the most advanced in warfare and racing as set up in its programming parameters. Only once that answer had been obtained would the system 'shut down' or enter into a sleep phase.\n\nThe mechanics of the game itself will remind you of Star wars Pod Racing mixed with the unfair elements of maybe Mario Kart SNES. You see the ai that you race are developed on purpose to be unfair, with the ability to be able to catch up unrealistically and to be able to overpass you at that single moment in time when you\u2019re about to cross the finishing line in first place. So if you want a relaxing enjoyable experience and time to learn the controlling, I strongly suggest placing it on 'easy' so that you can at least unlock every level without needless constant repeats because of the unfair ai on the other difficulties and absolutely impossible ai to beat on the insane difficulty.\n\nThere are 30 gliders and 16 different locations that you will eventually be able to unlock. The most superior glider will only be made available at the very end and already has its speed upgraded to the max. So since you are given a limited amount of upgrade options you may wish to place it on the various facets that the last glider lacks. Why? This is because once an upgrade is chosen, it can\u2019t be undone and applies to all gliders from that point on. So perks such as strength, firepower or handling which the last glider lacks, will seriously help you in being triumphant against the last level which even on 'easy' setting is a trolling experience against unfair ai. \n\nThe landscapes themselves are quite versatile from one another and always will inspire you with wonderment as you speed across the various alien projections. The locations will test your ability to drive when confronted with bright light, extremely narrow passages, sharp turns and well timed navigation through or around various obstacles. Each location seems to have a unique test to it, even the open basic track can be very testing as you\u2019re now confronted with the fact that the ai can easily gun you down with rockets and splatter fire. Each location was also made unique by each having its own specific original soundtrack to accompany it adding again to an imaginative universe.\n\nYou really can see a fair amount of time was put into this, but there are a number of blaring issues that need to be mentioned to.\n\n* There are quite a few areas where you can simply drive off the map. The game just freezes your glider into a trapped small area but you never respawn back on the map, instead many times you will need to restart.\n* Controlling can be really obnoxious on some of the gliders especially if your wing tips hit something or your forced to go into a tube like you do in an underwater level as most gliders can't handle the sudden change of navigation at all and will be flipping all over the place.\n* Ai that just sticks with you regardless of whether you go slowly or fast does not make a good racing game.\n* There\u2019s not really a lot you can do when the ai in the harder difficulties are hot on your tail. Their splatter harassment and rocket launching will be deadly accurate with practically no warning attached. To evade their pursuit seems fruitless and more an inevitable mechanic of the programming. While other games often add defensive weapons, this game only offers offensive ones.\n* There isn't many shortcuts you can take, most of the tracks are just standard routes, offering no versatility in travel routes.\n* While multiplayer options are available no servers are maintained by developer or publisher so the game is more a solo experience.\n* No achievements.\n\nRegardless of all these gripes, because of its low price and imaginative landscapes I did enjoy the several hours I spent on this game. Granted it\u2019s not a \u2018great\u2019 racer, but it is one that at least kept me entertained for a day or two.\n\nDeveloper: http://www.skyriver.ru/index.phtml\n\nMontage of various levels of the game: https://youtu.be/R0BpuwFqiPA\n\n\n\n"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1338503444, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496884", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "754643", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197977451962", "num_reviews": 275, "last_played": 1338706800, "num_games_owned": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 111}, "timestamp_updated": 1338503444, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Once u get used to the wonky controls its pretty good.

Racing is one of those games that are reminiscent of the \"racing with weapons\" games like popular titles such as the Mario Kart series. A.I.M. Racing is a fast paced racing game where you obviously fight for first place using weapons such as mines, rockets and a default gun or laser shooter. There are also boosters that improve your handling, speed, and damage. You can also make your ship jump to overtake opponents or avoid obstacles and projectiles. You also have to finish first (obviously) in order to progress to the next track. Obstacles will be plentiful and can be moved and destroyed when ran into similar to games like \"Flatout\".\n\nYou can choose from a range of ships that each have it's own unique stats. These stats are divided between speed, power/strength, maneuverability, size (how many items it can carry), and other stats. These ships however vary depending on the league you are in (ex. Leagues 1, 2, and 3 all have different ships). That being said, they are usually just visually different, where the stats pretty much remain the same depending on the ship. There will always be a ship that excels in handling and another in strength in each league. Of course enemies will be more challenging as you progress in the game's campaign but in spite of that, you will also be able to upgrade stats after winning certain races that apply to all ships you choose. This can ultimately help you win races with more ease but unfortunately you don't get to choose what you want to upgrade, there will be two options that I believe are random.\n\nEven though the game can be really fun, there are some things that are a huge problem and can be game breaking or at least make it seem unplayable. First is the controls. I from my personal experience find that not unless you are using a ship that specializes in handling, the controls will be extremely slippery. Ships that do not have adequate handling (even with half or 2/3 full bars) tend to slide or drift when trying to turn. This makes the game almost unplayable because many of the tracks have turns and not unless you're using ships that have max handling, you'll be overtaken quickly in later levels. \n\nSecond is the physics. they can be extremely smooth at times, but sometimes things can happen that will make you question why or how it happened. A game breaking flaw I encountered multiple times in the game is the ability to get snagged on nothing. The game does [b]NOT[/b] take bumping physics lightly... actually, they do... a little [b]TOO[/b] much. Hitting a wall, obstacle or even player can turn your ship completely around, flip it upside down, or send it in the air. Even scaling a concave wall can completely mess up your orientation and result in you looking the wrong way. One specific track in the game has  this problem and it is definitely frustrating. But back to \"being snagged on nothing\". There can and [i]will[/i] be times where you're leading no problem, but all of a sudden your ship crashes into seemingly nothing and now you're going the wrong way. I can not stress enough how annoying it is to lose a race because your ship decided to crash into nothing. It doesn't happen a lot but it still does, which it shouldn't. Aside from these flaws, the games is still extremely fun and it outweights the bad in my opinion.\n\nThe game overall isn't amazing, but it is fun and intense. For the price, it isn't the worst I've seen. For the amount of content you get, I would say wait for a sale. Although, the campaign or \"championship\" is quite long and I still haven't finished it. Nonetheless, I would recommend it during a sale since there really isn't anything else to this game other than \"be the best champion in the racing league\". I recommend this game to people who enjoy the \"Mario Kart\" style of racing, where items are ultimately the key to winning. But remember, this game can be buggy at times.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1] A quirky racing game with limited fighting elements like \"Mario Kart\". Controls are for the most part slippery (use a ship with high handling) and collision physics can be game breaking (but does not happen often). Despite that, the game is more fun than it is frustrating. Recommended for people who like combat racing (ex. Mario Kart). As well as getting it on sale if you're considering."}]}
