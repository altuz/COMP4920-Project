Blocks spawn at the back of the arena and slowly move towards you.  You destroy them with bouncing balls and powerups until a block makes it to your side.  Then the game is over.  There's strategy in how you save and use the powerups, and skill in juggling and aiming the many balls.\n\nThe suprise for me was PvP multiplayer, where it plays like VR Pong.  There are no powerups or blocks, just returning the ball back and forth as it becomes faster and faster.  It sounds simple, and it is, but being face to face in VR with your opponent brings so much to the game.  It's an absolute blast.  Shoutout to Shaquille who beat me easily 5 games straight.\n\nCyberpong will have you moving all around the required play area, but it doesn't push you to swing with the same vigor that HoloBall does.  I've had to take a break for a few days from HoloBall for my arm to recover.  Cyberpong brings my pulse up, but doesn't wear me out.\n\nTL;DR: While Cyberpong VR and HoloBall look similar, they play very differently, and both are great fun.  The online multiplayer in Cyberpong VR is an absolute must try.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988023670", "last_played": 1463628048, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 274, "playtime_forever": 241}, "votes_up": 40, "timestamp_created": 1461900070, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568325", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1461900070, "recommendationid": "22698450", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I'm guessing a lot of people are considering whether to buy this or Holoball.  Well, here're my thoughts as someone who owns both:\n\n\n**NOTE: The following paragraph no longer applies; the Cyberpong team quickly changed the mechanics of the game to allow for smashing and controling the ball to a much, much greater extent.  You don't have to, but you can speed up the pace of the game quite significantly if you do.\n\nHoloball responds to how you hit the ball more than Cyberpong.  Holoball really is more like raquetball, and if you're looking for that smash-hit feeling, then Holoball is what you want.  For me, smashing it ends up straining my elbow after a short play-time, and I start feeling it there before actually working up a sweat.\n\n\n\nCyberpong is more polished, period.  The powerups, the tetris-meets-breakout singleplayer mode, the various characters that have different paddles (although, let's be real here - the default paddle is the best paddle), all of that just makes for a more fleshed-out game.  I played through Holoball and was done with it after about an hour.  I'm still playing single player Cyberpong trying to best my highest time.\n\nAnd finally, multiplayer.  I'm reserving my judgement until I see what the Holoball team does, but suffice it to say that this is the main selling point for Cyberpong right now.  It lags a bit, but only the interactions between the ball and the other player.  You never have a problem making contact with the ball (i.e. the ball never lags through your hand or anything).  It's incredibly simple - just barebones pong against another person - but that's all it needs to be.  Facing off against another human being who can wave to you, taunt a bit, sympathize when something crazy happens.  You feel the company, and it's fantastic.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend this over Holoball as of right now.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197991986059", "last_played": 1463320686, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 136, "playtime_forever": 341}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1461977797, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525581", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1462865836, "recommendationid": "22713989", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is the game I put the most hours in in VR, my go to workout program.

I can't tell you how many times I've hit my controllers against stuff, and how many balls I've missed because I'm too afraid to swing at my chaperone bounds.\n\nI can't believe the developers haven't thought about this. Look at Holoball, which does it right: in Settings, you can set a padding area from your chaperone that basically narrows down your playing field so you're not swinging at the edges. And the paddles are larger in Holoball.\nIn Cyberpong, the default paddles don't even extrude past the controller. No, for that you have to use an \"ability\" or select another character with long but extra narrow paddles. Utterly ridiculous.\n\nBeyond that, it's... eh. It's way too claustrophobic.
