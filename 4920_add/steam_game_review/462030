The game has around 20 levels, each requiring you to ensure that one or more white cubes are kept in play, whilst removing the red cubes from the playing field. The simple physics puzzles are solved by clicking to remove grey cubes and platforms and allowing gravity to take its course (or later, utilising cubes with abilites, such as a jump cube or a cube that shoots projectiles to either side).\n\nThe price reflects the amount of content and general quality of the game's assets. You will probably finish the game in around half an hour. It has some good ideas, but there are a few frustrations that really detract from an otherwise enjoyable game that feels like a good proof of concept for a more expanded title.\n\nThe major flaws are as follows; firstly, the physics occasionally work in 3D. Often (for seemingly no reason) blocks can fall backwards or forwards and out of play. The game would benefit from limiting itself to a 2D plane, where the rules are more clearly defined.\n\nSecondly, doing the same action doesn't always have the same result. This can be frustrating and there is one puzzle in particular that basically requires you to just click a cube and restart the level until you get lucky with how the other cubes fall.\n\nFinally, despite the games short length, it would be nice to have the option to save or at the very least a level select screen so you can pick up where you left off, or replay previous puzzles.\n\nAs such, overall this is an interesting prototype, but needs some more polish and refinement of the mechanics to be recommended. It is however very cheap, so if you're interested its not exactly going to break the bank to try it out.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001537206", "last_played": 1461530604, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1688, "playtime_forever": 35}, "votes_up": 32, "timestamp_created": 1461531738, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547124", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1461531807, "recommendationid": "22618742", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "fun little game, one issue- doesnt save.
