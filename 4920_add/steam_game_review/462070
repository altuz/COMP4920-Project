Fine so far....\nOnly two things on this screen are selectable - East and West arrows. That's it. Everything else on the screen is frozen. You cannot progress, you cannot play.\nHell, you can't even Exit.

It works, apparently on Mac but the Windows version is a wreck.\n\nThis is a major blemish on the name of the publisher. Beware HexWar Games.

Believe me, we carry big time grudges.\n\n\nWhere to from now? \n\nIf the Developer and Publishers have no intention of fixing this mess (and it's obvious they don't), then it falls upon the Publishers, HexWar Games to issue refunds/compensation (much as Paradox Inetractive have done with games they have published, not developed, that are broken) and offcially withdraw this product from sale.\n\nIt is a travesty that this broken product has not been removed from sale, despite being reported numerous times to Steam. It bvreaks all terms of service and if was a real-world product it would be gone from the shelves in a flash with lawsuits to follow.\n\nDO NOT BUY!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001912496", "last_played": 1478330926, "num_reviews": 38, "num_games_owned": 1451, "playtime_forever": 310}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1469834344, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506781", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1471292344, "recommendationid": "24604811", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "How is this still allowed to be sold?
