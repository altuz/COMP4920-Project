I'll play the 2 hours we're affored before a potential refund and make my descisions of a game based on how it starts off.\n\nStarr Mazer does this wonderfully, it knows what it wants to be and throws you into the action to learn off the bat.\nThis game is sink or swim done right.  \n\nSo let's talk gameplay-\nThe gameplay itself is fluid, you learn quickly how to play and what to do .  there's no hiccups or confusion as you progress and any sort of significant shift or change in either scenery or enemy formation is broadcast by voiced lines.\nThe emersion is fantastic, not once was I pulled out of it by any unusual stutters in either gameplay or character.  \nYou'll be shooting down heavy waves of foes, pressured on every front and challenged differently in every level you reach (I only managed the 4th stage before this review).\nThe game is challenging, but in no way punishing, if you die you know you're the one to blame and beter yet you'll learn form it.\nThe bread and butter of the Game is Carbonite, dropped by enemies you slay and better yet able to be combined by luring the floating particles together for increased bonus and point score.  \nthis directly relates back to my \"Sink or swim\" comment as this itself can be a gamble, you need to navigate around this stuff and lure it together as it slowly follows you like a powerup, but the enemies will not be keen on letting this happen and do not slow down.  Bide your time and keep an eye out on enemy fire, a bonus means nothing if you're dead.\nBUT Carbonite does more than just fuel your point score, it fuels your WEAPONS!  While your Weapon doesn't peter out it will become a pea-shooter if you let it, you can't waste shots and avoid enemies or you'll find yourself slowing down and struggling.\nDon't cover, show no fear.  Be bold and you are rewarded!\n\nThis doesn't even cover the enemies.\nNo game can excel with boring repettitive enemies or overly powerful ones.  Lucking for you this game has niether!\nEnemy patterns aren't predictably scripted, sure you'll run into similar mashes of them each time you play the level, but there are always a few variations to keep you on your toes.\nBetter yet each stage will feature new enemies with new attacks and challenges from stage hazards to enemies that will even abuse it to thier advantage.  \nYou aren't helpless though, there's an excellent variety of weaponds and specials available in a random mash when you select your pilots.\nYou'll earn your Pilots by playing the game, the better you do the more Pilots you will be able to purchase for combat, but it goes beyond that with different packs and playstyles.\nMix it up!\n\n\nScenery and Music-\nThe transitions for the background are fantastic.  The color blending isn't too loud or vibrant and won't distract you from the matter at hand which is kicking Alien Kiester. \nYou'll go from a Planet in ruin to space and the hazards beyond as you progress fighting off the Gr'ell fleet ensuring you'e never too bored of what you're passing through.\nAs for the music, it's beautiful.  \nMy favorite is currently in the first stages second act once you've entered the stratosphere.  You'll fiond the tracks always match your location and keep you rocking as you punch holes in alien cockpits and make scrap of fine engineering.\n\nVoice Acting-\nYou may find it surprising that this game features voice acting, unusual for a sprite-based shooter.  But as you recieve your orders from a deep-voiced smart-mouth Cat General you'll chuckle.\nThe pilots all differ in personality and gender (and possibly species?  I think I hired a lizard but he died a little too quick with an experimental weapon) from fast talking city-slickers to rural homegrown farm-girls.\nOverall I feel it gives the game good character as you get slightly attached ot these people only to see them die horrific explosive deaths.\n\nSo yes, I do recommend this game.  For an early access it's on track to becomming a fantastic release.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198086118787", "last_played": 1504335681, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 198, "playtime_forever": 239}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1499872980, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489096", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499877439, "recommendationid": "33481983", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Most of the reviews are talking about the surrounding controversy so I thought I'd write an actual review of this game. \n\nThis is a normal shoot em up game like Gradius but what differentiates itself from other games of the genre is the roster. Once you die, you will then move on to your next ship with different stats (Chance of death on hit, ship speed and Carbomite attraction) and weapons. The score you get in the game from collecting Carbomite also acts as a currency. You spend your currency on more ships and you could buy one really high powered ship for 100k + or loads of different ships to have many lives but will generally be less powerful. The different ships also have different pilots. The pilots don't really do much but add character to the game. All characters have been voice acted but the voice seems to be randomly assigned to a pilot. Sometimes I will see pilots who look like a young girl but have the voice of an old man which is odd. Hopefully each pilot could properly be assigned a voice during development. \n\nThere are many different types of weapons from single shot high damage guns to rapid fire machine guns or spread shot guns and more. These weapons wil be automatically upgraded when you collect enough Carbomite which drop from enemies. There are 3 levels of upgrades for each weapon. One stat you will see on different ships is Carbomite attractor. This determines how well you pull Carbomite towards you. This is important because you can pull two pieces of Carbomite together to make a bigger piece of Carbomite for a bigger boost to the upgrades of weapons and a bigger score. Bigger score means more money. More money means bigger and better ships on your next run.\n\nThe controls are ok but can be very painful after the first level. Due to the movement acting like a digital input even when using a controller, this means that you can only move in 8 directions and always at 100% speed. This is only a problem when trying to manoeuvre through a barrage of bullets and it feels so much more difficult because you can't make small adjustments well. The HUD doesn't help with this since I have tried dodging bullets and flew in the top corner of the screen but I went behind the HUD and I couldn't see where I was and I got hit. \n\nOnce you lose all your lives, you start back at the very beginning of the game but you keep your score to buy more ships. This is a really cool idea which I would be ok with if I could save my game somehow. I love playing the game but I have this small amount of dread when playing it. I would get to level 3, die and start from the beginning but with a huge score for better ships to help me on my next run. But if I want to have a break, play something else for a bit, I will lose my score and I will have to grind my score back up again every time I open the game. I could play for 10 hours and die but feel like I have to keep playing even when I don't want to just to keep my progress. If you aren't prepared to play the game for hours and hours non stop, you might as well just play something else which is a huge shame. Please save our score once we quit the game. \n\nThe levels are very VERY difficult, at least for me. I have only made it to level 3 once, and I do not know how many levels there are. Once I reach the end of a level, it feels so satisfying despite having done the first level around 10 times. \n\nDespite the negatives, the game is still tremendous fun due to the great soundstrack and sound design, the varied ships and weapons, the cool enemies that work really well and the unique way of buying lives and ships.

From what I heard this is not Mauer's score and sound effects, but I think the game is actually better for it.  Heard samples of her chip-tunes and I feel the one in this iteration of Starr Mazer: DSP is leaps and bounds better.\n\nBuy this game, it will not disappoint and you will have fun.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198020173432", "last_played": 1501906102, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 372, "playtime_forever": 140}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499875464, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502797", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499875464, "recommendationid": "33482844", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
