I love the aesthetics, everywhere from the calming zen-like music, to the track hanging over the futuristic metropolis below.

I could totally see speedruns for this game. All it needs is a bigger community.\n\nThis game is excellent, overall. Again, controls could be a bit smoother, but I never tried using a gamepad. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. (I am going to go do that now, actually!)
