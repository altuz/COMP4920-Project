The rogue-like elements take away from the core gameplay. Making it less fun and enoyable. There isn't that much of a positive. When the rogue-like elements go in your favor either. All it boils down to is. You get to progress.\n\nThe lack of a block placement preview. Is also a major oversight in game design. It would have made it more enoyable  and less frustrating to play. You can teleport at the cost of hp. However you always use this because you made a mistake. Not because you wanted to use it.\n\nTo me the rogue-like elements. Do more harm then good to the overall game. It takes more away then it adds to the game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 235, "steamid": "76561197980079561", "last_played": 1506589277, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 242, "playtime_forever": 235}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506481354, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506481354, "recommendationid": "35234434", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
