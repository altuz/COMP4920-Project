First of all, the background is rich and full of humor. All the voices and sounds are really fun, the animations beautiful and the musics work well with the atmosphere of the maps.\n\nAnd more importantly, the game is very well thought in terms of game-play and strategical/tactical options. Each of the three factions has its specificity and can be played differently, which adds fun if you want to master all of them. I think some units could be even a little bit more different. You can build very versatile armies due to the huge amount of units (tanks, healers, fast units, archers, mass destruction creatures...) and thus adopt completely different strategies. The management of resources is also interesting as it allows you to boost your units or build protections on the battlefield. And finally the existence of a champion and a totem to protect add also another dynamic to the game.\n\nI'm really looking forward for the next campaign missions and for more people to discover it so it will be easier to meet adversaries for PvP.\n\nThe only negative point that I found is the interaction with other players (adding friend, chatting, searching for potential opponents...) which is not very intuitive. But we can only hope it will get better all along the early access period.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 536, "steamid": "76561198383027155", "last_played": 1506793183, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 4645}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1494421697, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522151", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1494421697, "recommendationid": "31664769", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A really fun game for what it has now, sadly that is only three tutorial missions, three campaign missions, and a multiplayer with no one online.
