It's flawed, riddled with annoying bugs and weirdly implemented gameplay systems and yet I enjoyed its 6 hour long campaign (Steam didn't keep track of my whole playtime). It feels like a B-movie and has its own charme.\n\nYou are playing as Jonas Zimmermann, a German scientist who is apparently really old (as NPC often mock him because of his age), trying to get to Fort Stern to find a cure for the undead who are roaming through the battlefields of WW1. Oh and vampires or something... the story has no depth at all and that's not what I expected of Lost Company to begin with. You can find letters of fallen soldiers along the way. For some reason, the narrations of these letters will continue to play even after putting them away, which is quite annoying. The voice acting is terrible but fits the game perfectly, I adore the silly battlecrys of the undead and NPCs in particular.\n\nNecrovision: Lost Company is running on the Pain Engine and it shows. The game runs fine but the graphics are quite ugly. The original Painkiller from 2004 manages to look considerably better than this game. Body models look blocky and lifeless, texture quality ranges from barely acceptable to crap and animations look really unnatural, which on the other hand benefits the enemies. I really like their designs, especially those barb-wired zombies running on stumps, creepy bastards. Sound design is decent at best. You can understand what everyone is saying and the weapons sound powerful. The soundtrack is very well composed and some tracks stuck with me for a while.\n\nThe game features elements from modern shooters (such as regenerating health) but plays more like Serious Sam or Painkiller, albeit with a slower pace than those. Gunplay feels satisfying for the most part but the way weapons are handled in this game is mind boggling. You see, Zimmermann acquires an absurdely large arsenal of firearms on his way to Fort Stern and some of these are simply not needed. Why am I carrying a BAR when I already have a MP that is just as useful? Why do I need to carry 3-4 Gewehr 98 rifles (standard, grenade launcher, scope, bayonet) when I could simply have one with all these attachments? Why have a normal MG and the same one with a flamethrower? It makes switching weapons really cumbersome. Same with melee weapons. I maybe used 2 or 3 grenades during my playthrough because switching to them is unintuitive. Necrovision: Lost Company is a fairly easy game on normal difficulty since your character tanks through damage like a champ. It isn't necessarily a bad thing since you're not forced to take cover, thus keeping the pace up. You can also level up your \"Fury\" level, either by finding secret vampire artifcats or performing combos on enemies. I only found it useful when using the MP, since headshots would make me perform reloads much quicker and it would also stun enemies nearby.\n\nDespite all the issues I had with the game, it was worth the purchase. I suggest picking Necrovision: Lost Company up when it goes on sale.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNecrovision: Lost Company ist kein Meisterwerk. W\u00e4hrend meines Playthroughs bin ich auf zahlreiche Bugs gestossen und musste mich mit einigen fragw\u00fcrdingen Gameplayelementen rumschlagen und dennoch habe ich die 6-st\u00fcndige Kampagne genossen (Meine Spielzeit laut Steam stimmt nicht). Es f\u00fchlt sich wie ein B-Movie an und verspr\u00fcht seinen ganz eigenen Charme. \n\nMan schl\u00fcpft in die Rolle von Jonas Zimmermann, einem deutschen Wissenschaftler der schon einige Jahre auf dem Buckel hat (wodurch er \u00f6fters von NPCs auf die Schippe genommen wird) und sich zum Fort Stern aufmacht um ein Heilmittel f\u00fcr die Untoten zu finden, die die Schlachtfelder des 1. Weltkrieges unsicher machen. Oh, und noch etwas mit Vampiren oder so... die Geschichte besitzt keinerlei Tiefgang, habe dies aber von Lost Company nicht erwartet. In den Levels ist es m\u00f6glich, Briefe von gefallenen Soldaten zu lesen. Allerdings h\u00f6rt die Vertonung dieser nicht auf, sobald man die Briefe weglegt, was zeimlich nervig ist. Das Voiceacting ist eine Katastrophe aber passt zum Spiel. Besonders gut gefallen mir die unsinnigen Kampfrufe der Untoten und NPCs.\n\nNecrovision: Lost Company l\u00e4uft auf der Pain Engine und das zeigt sich bemerkbar. Das Spiel l\u00e4uft zwar fl\u00fcssig, sieht aber sogar im Vergleich mit Painkiller aus dem Jahre 2004 schlechter aus. K\u00f6rpermodellen sehen blockig und leblos aus, Texturqualit\u00e4t pendelt zwischen gerade noch akzeptabel bishin zu Augenkrebs und Animationen sehen sehr unnaturell aus, was aber den gegnern zu Gute kommt. Ich mag deren Designs, mein Favorit ist der von Stacheldraht umwobene Zombie, welcher einem  auf blutigen Stummeln zurennt. Gruselig, der Bastard.\nSounddesign geht in Ordnung, Gespr\u00e4che sind gut h\u00f6rbar und die Waffen klingen gewaltig. Der Soundtrack gef\u00e4llt mir sehr gut und einige der Titel blieben mir noch lange nach Beenden des Spieles im Ged\u00e4chtnis.\n\nAuch wenn das Spiel sich im ersten Blick eher auf die Spielprinzipien von modernen FPS aufbaut (z.B. Healthregeneration) spielt es sich eher wie ein langsameres Serious Sam oder Painkiller. Das Gunplay f\u00fchlt sich meistens sehr gut an, jedoch kann ich nicht nachvollziehen, warum das Waffensystem in diesem Spiel so schlecht ist. W\u00e4hrend seines Trips nach For Stern eignet sich Zimmermann ein absurd riesiges Arsenal an Feuerwaffen an und einige dieser Feuerwaffen werden nicht gebraucht. Warum trage ich eine BAR mit mir rum, wenn ich schon eine MP habe, die genauso gut ist? Warum besitze ich 3 bis 4 unterschiedliche Gewehr 98 (ohne Ausatz, Granatenwerfer, Zielfernrohr, Bajonett) wenn eines mit allen Aufs\u00e4tzen ausreichen w\u00fcrde? Warum ein normales MG mitschleppen, wenn sich dasselbe mit einem Flammenwerferaufsatz in meinem Waffeninventar wiederfindet? Das Ausw\u00e4hlen der f\u00fcr die Situation erforderlichen Waffe verkommt zu einem Geduldsspiel. Dasselbe Problem findet man bei den Nahkampfwaffen. Ich habe w\u00e4hrend meines Playthroughs h\u00f6chstens 2 bis 3 Granaten benutzt, weil das Wechseln zu diesen nicht intuitiv ist. Necrovision: Lost Company ist ein relativ leichtes Spiel auf normaler Schwierigkeitsstufe, da der Hauptcharakter einiges an Schaden wegstecken kann. Dies ist nicht unbedingt was Schlechtes, da man dadurch nicht gezwungen wird, hinter Schutzwallen zu verharren, was dem Spielfluss zu Gute kommt. Letzendlich kann man auch seinen \"Wut\"-Level erh\u00f6hen, in dem man Vampirartifakte findet oder Combos an Gegnern ausf\u00fchrt. Gen\u00fctzt hat es mir nur im Zusammenspiel mit der MP, da Kopfsch\u00fcsse mich mit einem schnelleren Magazinwechseln belohnt haben und nahestehende Gegner bet\u00e4ubt wurden.\n\nTrotz den Problemen, die ich mit dem Spiel hatte, hat sich der Kauf gelohnt. Ich empfehle euch, das Spiel bei einem Sale zu holen."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1401136799, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502848", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "10244850", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197983978320", "num_reviews": 22, "last_played": 1401163776, "num_games_owned": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 262}, "timestamp_updated": 1401136799, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you played the first NecrovisioN and thought it was lacking, the prequel sequel fills in all those gaps.
