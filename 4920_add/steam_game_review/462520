The game is very basic right now, but it is a really neat and fun game. I love the idea behind the game and I cant wait to see it fill out more. There is no tutorial at this point and only one game mode, but its very polished and well done.. The game almost feels like the shooting in SPT, like your playing SPT against someone else head on and the one who kills the most gets the  power ups.

It's a curious mix of a deck management card game with a wave shooter, I suppose.  You kill mobs before your foe can in order to earn points to spend on the use of one of five or so cards you've drawn from your deck which might help you or hurt your foe.  I didn't really know what to expect when buying it, but the result really tickles my fancy.\n\nIt's challenge is in the mix of accurately shooting, managing your points, choosing your attack cards at the right time, and saving points for defensive cards to thwart your enemy's attacks.  \n\nIt suffers from a lack of explanation as to these mechanics, but you'll learn fast playing in single player.  The early bot is easy to beat once you get used to the mechanics, then once you hit level 6 or so, the bot gets a lot harder to challenge you.  I wish they let you choose the difficulty of the bot, though, as my friends can't beat the harder bot without the experience of the easier one first.\n\nIt could also use a lot more players in MP right now.  I've had the most luck playing against Chinese players late at night, which are pretty plentiful.\n\nI see a lot of room for future expansion in this game, with new cards, new kaijus and new weapons to choose from.

This is a brilliant use of VR.\n\nIn a nintendo'ey kind of way, I love how easy to pick up the game is, but hard to master - there's a few different strategies you can take.\n\nStill early access and multiplayer is limited due to number of players (but being worked on). \n\nNice addition of new features, such as ranked mode, card deck selection etc.\n\nThis is a fast paced, player vs player / strategy / card battle/ shooter game, thats got hidden depth, is vibrant , with nice crisp graphics and presentation.\n\nThis game is NOT simply a wave shooter, it feels very different. \n\nMarketing feedback - was a bit dissapointed that the game didnt use the same soundtrack as the advert on steam. The music and advert were enough to convince me to dive in now.\n\nCould do with a very brief tutorial , or PDF instruction book (how to pickup bombs etc)\n\n\nOLD STUFF / Change Log\n\n\n\n\nUpdate - 1hr played -> Very impressive, crisp graphics and good sound.\n\nLike the additions of playing practice while waiting for online - great move!\n\n\nUpdate - 2hr played (Sept 27th) --> Nice work on the card system, it certainly adds some more strategy and diversity to the play.\n\nThis title is certainly stronger than it was on release, and is moving rapidly in the right direction (not that I had any complaints earlier!).\n\n\nUpdate 3hr played  - Coming along really nicely now, performance is great, the new secondary weapons are a great idea and the balance of cards seems really good,  I've found a couple of nice tricks , combinations and counters.  Getting easier to find multiplayer matches. To be critical, the single music track is becoming a bit repetitive now, any chance of integrating the tralier music, or stuff of that style?\n\nUpdate 6hr - it's been a pleasure watching this title grow from early access. Improvements that I didn't even think were needed have crept in , such as the A.I Kaiju levelling with you, and their animated celebration dances if they beat you! I can't wait until I move into a sensible timezone where I can regularly play humans!
