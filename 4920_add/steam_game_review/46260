It looked interesting so i tried it while it was on sale. It is one of the greatest purchases ive ever made on steam. It is fun and can keep a person entertained for days if not weeks. It is difficult at times and easy at others. I highly recommend for any strategy gamers who enjoyed homeworld or anything similiar to it. I would have paid full price for this game and it would be worth every cent."}]}
