I also am a surfer myself, so I can relate to the gameplay. I was particularly excited about this game, as there hasn't been a surfing game in almost 15 years or so.\n\nWhen I first played this game, I was awestruck with the amazing graphics. The water texture and wave visuals are excellent. Far better than any surfing game in the past. I'm not sure if they are completely up to what technology can do in these days, but they are fantastic and look really amazing. \n\nThe gameplay is fun and very much focused on the \"trick\" system. What this game is about is to do trick moves, and many of them, in all sorts and shapes. Some look impossible, but still not quite over the top. It took my a while to figure it out, but after 20 minutes I had almost everything down and this was the time when I was really sucked into the gameplay. It's great that you can do amazing tricks right out of the gate and not have to wait until you unlock them step by step. BTW, the camera angles when doing a trick really make it look awesome. \nI think the tricks overall are super fun (Barrels, Aerials, Face-Tricks) and it keeps me coming back for more. \n\nThe surfing locations are great, I can definitly feel the level of difficulty and the nuances and characteristics of each wave - nicely done! However, I couldn't really notice or feel a difference between the size of the waves. The different times a day (night/day/sunset/dawn) bring a lot of visual variety and it looks absolutely stunning.\n\nMy favorite part of this game is the controls. I think it's awesome to be able to press the trick button combination without time pressure, ahead of hitting the lip/jump. For a Kick Flip you press X, Y, A. But you don't have to press them at once at the right time, but rather press them one after another before you're doing the actual trick. This gives you plenty of time to get the button combination right, before you're hitting the lip of the wave to do the actual trick. This is such a welcome improvement compared to most trick based gameslike tony hawk pro skater, skate 3, etc. It helps with the flow of the gameplay, instead of having to focus on one moment in time and hit all the buttons in that very moment. Also, it requires a bit practice to find the right \"path\" to steer through the waves in order to gain speed. If you are a surfer in real life, you might be at an advantage. This part has been realistically implemented. You can feel the spots on the wave where you gain speed or lose momentum. You could even \"fall out\" of the wave, just like in real life. This is very well executed and keeps this game fresh! Tip for non-surfers: Watch some surf videos and look at how the surfers move on the wave, e.g. before taking off on an aerial or a big move.\n\nI hope there will be more DLC or something like that in the future. A two player split-screen would be great as well, e.g. surfing a real heat against someone and being in the same surf spot. Maybe bring in paddling, duck-diving, or even jetski pickup? It would also be nice to have more tricks in the barrel on on the face, e.g. the coffin, roof grab, etc. or nice face tricks like rail to rail carve, roundhouse cutback, etc. or even a layback bottom turn. \n\nBottom line, this game is a lot of fun. I'm so glad there is another surfing game taking advantage of newer graphics hardware and physics engines, it simply looks amazing. The trick system is probably the best part of this game, and the comprehensive customizations for surfer and gear keeps you coming back.  My expectations were kind of high after such long time without a surfing game, and I can say that I'm very pleased with the result. Can't put this game down! Thank you Climax Studios!\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone interested in trick-based Skateboard, Snowboard, etc. games. This is a must buy for any surfer.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198250234380", "last_played": 1505082169, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 251}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505080206, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505235575, "recommendationid": "34871951", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
