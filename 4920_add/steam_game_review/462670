It is exactly what I was looking for in terms of game play after I saw the movie pixel. Instead of centepedes it is dragons. A few points for the DEV though. I think you may need to add and option or consider and option to change where the dragons come from due to having to look straight up for so long. It would probably be better to have the portal on nearly same level as they player away in the distance and have the dragons come at you from the back to front. As my neck after 15 mins is quite sore. This will potentially stop long game plays of this and probably people would refund it. I have set my graphics as high (event super sampling to 2.0)  as I can to get the game looking its best but it still needs some tweeks I think. It still doent look as good as it possibly could, which seeing this is the focus of the game you might want to see what you can do. You may want to look at the brightness on the mushrooms and the dragons and lower them so they can look better as when they first come out they honestly look like just one colour with little definition as they seem too bright and you lose what they look like. . The movement thought was hard to work out, how to move the platform, honestly the tutorial needs tweeking as it didn't give me good direction on this. The reloading, the power ups etc is brilliant. I really hope you tweek this game and do a Galaga etc. Well done and keep up the awesome work, there isn't a game like this one atm.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198213665372", "last_played": 1484649151, "num_reviews": 32, "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_forever": 84}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1482270681, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499009", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1482273287, "recommendationid": "28494592", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I've only played one game but I already like the concept.\nBut I do have to say, \"Oh, my aching neck!\"\nHaving to look up for so long a period of time really does create alot of strain on the neck.\nThank goodness for heating pads, cuz I really needed one!\n\nSince seeing the film Pixels, I always wondered what it would be like to play Centipede or\nMillipede just like in the movie,\nNow I know.\nGood visuals, music and fun power-ups.\nReally kept me moving around, so that was a plus for me.\nI'm hoping future updates will tackle the present need to have to constantly look up.
