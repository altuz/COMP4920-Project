Yup. And adults who now and then like something relaxing and silly.\n\nFor currently 79 cent (90% off), can't go wrong if any of the above sounds remotely fun to you. :)\n\nOh, one thing.

Though it is these I still will complain about a few things. You will find out while playing it that RNG does play a large part in the scenarios, having to do with meteors being a random event that will destroy your city in one shot. You are supposed to be able to counter this by placing missiles to shoot the meteors out of the air, but the problem is still half the time these missiles miss and you lose your whole city. Plus there are a few very strange hitboxes on some of the buildings such as the Oriental Tower on the Shanghai scenario. And finally the balancing problems, there is a mode unlocked after beating a mission titled rich and poor, this mode allows you to place down slum buildings which don't require jobs or electricity. With almost exclusively these buildings it is very easy to beat most of the scenarios rendering most of the strategy elements useless. Even with these problems you should still pick up the game, but if the developer was to read my review the community would still like you to fix these problems.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198247587750", "last_played": 1499845072, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_forever": 235}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499893326, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488649", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499992290, "recommendationid": "33488848", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Really cool game but you must be stabilize it! this game crash again and again.
