But disappointed by gameplay. Very frustrating and annoying. Keep losing on easy no matter what I try. Bowling/batting with different settings doesn't seem to make any difference. I can't tell which players actually are good/bad (as in say FM series), no indication of their abilities. Telling me that some batter is aggressive doesn't help me much, as if after settling in I set him to aggressive (say 4-5), he gets bowled out.\n Played the 14 version and seems to be the same AI/mechanics. Also commentary is a bit off timed, in a way that commentator speaks before the event and that is annoying too.  With a little improvement could be a classic. Such a shame, can't really recommend even on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198020945214", "last_played": 1504452770, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 455, "playtime_forever": 2767}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504280857, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504370286, "recommendationid": "34662827", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
