I understand that Townopolis was released a while ago, but still, this one didn\u2019t aged very well in my opinion. \n\nIt\u2019s more of a puzzle game than a building management one, which is okay because I like puzzle games as well. The problem here is that Townopolis gets so repetitive and boring after the first 5 or 7 scenarios that I almost gave up on playing. The BGM keeps going over and over, always the same song.

The reason I gave it a thumbs down is the way the game is marketed.\n\n\"Build your own town and make heaps of money in this addictive strategy game. Construct an idyllic neighborhood with plenty of houses and keep your residents happy by providing all services they need, and they will reward you with a tidy profit.\"\n\nWhile that statement is completely true, it gives the impression the game is a city builder and a lot of the reviews below are calling it a city builder, but it's not.\n\nTownopolis is a cross between a puzzle game and a time management game. The theme might be construction, but the game is about figuring out the optimal arrangement of your buildings to achieve the goals each level sets you. There is no sprawling map or freedom to build. You are provided with a small map consisting of tiles. Some you can build on, some you can clear and then build on, others can't be built on (factories etc.) and/or cause negative happiness to the neighbouring tiles. You want to keep the residents happy, and every building type has positive or negative effects to those in the neighbouring tiles. \n\nNow that is out of the way. I bought the game because it was cheap and I love city builders. To that end, I was disappointed. The game, however, is simple to learn, isn't very complex, there is no resource gathering other than waiting for rent to arrive, and if you like puzzle games and approach it as such, it's very casual but worth checking out.\n\nThe only real negative I had was the frequency buildings broke down. As soon as you get to 8 or more buildings, it seems one or two of them start breaking down at random every few seconds, so you have to frantically repair each of them manually and the game just becomes about time management at that point. Not to mention how annoying the break down sound effect is, when you are hearing it every 3 or 4 seconds.\n\nIt's cheap, it's casual, it can be fun, but buy it because it's a puzzle game, not a city builder, and you'll avoid disappointment.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971047607", "last_played": 1468885814, "num_reviews": 116, "num_games_owned": 1424, "playtime_forever": 414}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1468887333, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532669", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1468887333, "recommendationid": "24399380", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "What is Townopolis?\n\nTownopolis is a casual sandbox/scenario based neighborhood planning game. It follows the traditions of the sub-genre of casual games, adding nothing new but doing well what it does. Mostly.\n\nThe sub-genre has you as planner on a map of a small neighborhood where you build houses, upgrade them, add features to them etc.\nThe houses generate income which is used to generate more income by building more houses. All the while you have a small resource management aspect with one or few resources (in this case one, named \"materials\") and builders. Each level has a time limit in which a certain goal must be fulfilled, for example in the first non-tutorial scenario you have 10 minutes to build a supermarket and have 6,500 dollars income per month (in reality: every few seconds) and ten upgraded houses (as optional goal). So you need 12 workers, lots of material, a supermarket building blueprint/license and you must make enough space for your building project. Things are made harder by the fact that there are two sawmills and some forests that can't be removed. The sawmills produce unhappiness to everyone living nearby, as does the supermarket. Houses grouped together are more happy because people like to live with other people. Which technically is true for not everyone, but in the game it is that way.\n\nControls:\nThe entire game is controlled with the mouse. The controls are explained ingame, but pretty much everything is done through a contextual menu on the main screen or the license/blueprint menu where time is paused. Alternatively you have a visible pause button as well.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are isometric, so you see everything and can act quickly. The UI fits with the isometric theme, but at the beginning can be overwhelming. However, since things unlock one by one you can learn the buttons all without complications.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is standard. There is nothing special, it just is forgettable music that runs in the background which doesn't become annoying but will also not stick with you after exiting the game.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay was described above in the sub-genre description. There are additionally some trophies to be earned that are also unlocking Steam Achievements. Apart from the usual ones that can just be grinded or naturally earned while playing, there is also one for completing the campaign and getting all gold stars (for par times). The campaign has 24 levels, which are enough for a few hours of gameplay. There is also a sandbox mode, which has an achievement to finish 12 missions or scenarios in it.\n\nOverall the game can be recommended for fans of the genre. The sale price of 1 Euro or your local equivalent is good enough to pick it up and have some fun. You just should expect a rather casual game, if you don't know the sub-genre already.\n\nRecommended: For genre fans", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197979215168", "last_played": 1478265135, "num_reviews": 59, "num_games_owned": 4711, "playtime_forever": 95}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1473759225, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532302", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1473759235, "recommendationid": "25491297", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Games of the same kind (cheap SimCity clone with no complexity and just a few options) are written in Flash and found online in great numbers.
