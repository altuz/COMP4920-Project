Yet, Pyre has come to mean more to me than both of its predecessors.  \n\nThis game quickly distinguishes itself by drawing you into the story and giving you the perfect role, whilst not demanding you forfeit your own personality or will. Your victories and failures, your mercy or your ruthlessness, all matter here.   \nI never imagined that a game could so perfectly knit you into the story like Pyre does. The immersion is flawless. You're not simply guiding The Kid or Red this time. You're you, \"The Reader,\" and you will live in this story.  \n\nThis unique experience is no doubt a credit to the incredible writers. The dialogue, vocabularly, relationships, character development, and especially the humor, are absolutely phenomenal. I can't count how often I laughed with tears in my eyes, paused to take a breath, then resumed only to be surprised by more hilarity and laughter. \n\nOf course, the art is completely irresistible. The ingenuity of Jen Zee's character design is so outstanding that you will be delighted and surprised by every new character you meet. Love or hate (most likely love), each one is visually ornate with personalities to match.\n \nThe vivid, colorful world with its abundant detail will keep your eyes lusting for more. However, many times, I wanted world exploration to creep by slower so that my eyes could feast a little longer on the landscape and catch every intricacy. \n\nAs for the soundtrack; it should be no surprise that it's incredible. I paused playing, just to listen, many times. Not a single track failed to bring a smile, or more, to my lips. \n\nMany people seem to have conflicting feelings regarding the sport-like gameplay of \"The Rites.\" It feels foreign to anything I've ever played before, so I fumbled here and there. However, that only made it more entertaining and rewarding. The game eases you into the oddity and, in time, presents some serious challenges. And, there is some room for strategy via customization of your team, their personal traits, and the items they wear. \n \nIn conclusion, I highly recommend Pyre. It has become one of my all-time favorite games. Greater even than its brilliant story, characters, soundtrack, and art, is how this game can make you feel. It invokes profound emotion without crushing and wringing the tears out of you with tragedy and loss. Instead, it's uplifting, even when the path you must choose is difficult. It gives you courage and inspires hope. \n\nIt sets you free.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 341, "steamid": "76561198084108375", "last_played": 1506127806, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 33, "playtime_forever": 2735}, "votes_up": 30, "timestamp_created": 1505359523, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550876", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505359523, "recommendationid": "34941546", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Definitely different from Bastion and Transistor..\nNot only 'cos you have a party of three characters and not only one for the entire game, like the other Supergiant titles.. but even 'cos your path is quite straight (even if you can and have to make many decisions on which road to take!), and all the battles take place into an arena with rules similar as.. basketball.. or some soccer game.. it's really strange!!\nBut awesome, as always.\nGreat graphics, great storytelling, great music..\nIt's just really another experience in the RPG genre, and has many elements of a visual novel.

This game is very very different from that one, and I'm sure it's not for everyone because of its uniqueness.

Which started off fine because the world is colorful and interesting. The characters are very well done and their personalities are varied and engaging. But after a while, the game gets to a point where it's just too much. Nearly all the information and dialog is more or less inconsequential. And you sometimes get bonuses for slogging through optional dialog so it's detrimental (albeit, only slightly) not to engage in it. I just want to play the game, darnit. All the significant plot details are buried in an endless sea of pointless information. \n\nThe actual gameplay is really pretty fun though. It's similar to Transistor and Bastion where you are encouraged to adapt and pursue different strategies with different characters, and it's done incredibly well. The short games you play would be perfect for a quick game session - just hop on, play a game, hop off - except that that's impossible because there's so much dialog and time spent both before AND after each game. It's frustrating after a while. I respect Supergiant's efforts to create something like Pyre and I think if you're interested in investing in a visual novel, then I highly recommend this.

Because Bastion and Transistor were so similar to one another I was expecting more of the same, but what they've done here is something else entirely. \n\nPyre is part visual novel and part sports game. While this may seem like a strange combination, the story facilitates the meshing of the two genres very well. When you aren't getting to know the world and its many characters during your travels, you're participating in the Rites - an intense game that pits you against a rival team for the chance at earning freedom from the Downside. Its not just your freedom on the line however; you're also fighting for the freedom of your friends. \n\nThats what I really love about this game. Unlike Bastion and Transistor, Pyre places a lot more emphasis on world building and character development. You'll get to know every character, learn their story and progress with them on your journey. You really start to connect with them - and if a game can effectively make you care about its world and the characters living in it, you know the writing is good. \n\nAnd yeah, the soundtrack is amazing but I'm sure you would have guessed that already.

There's a LOT of GREAT things in it, including the art and character design, the gameplay, the sound and music. \n\nUnfortunately, this game just didn't grab me the way other Supergiant games did and the primary reason is that this is actually a VISUAL NOVEL. \n\nNow, if that doesn't bother you, then treat this review as a \"thumbs up\".\n\nBut I don't like reading extensive lore and dialogue texts that descirbe a bunch of stuff that happened, and telling you what's at stake. The game breaks the \"show don't tell\" principle pretty hard. And that's weird, because there's definitely A GAME in here, but it's just two sparse. 5 minutes of gameplay every 20 minutes of information dump gets old kinda quick. \n\nThe gameplay is this weird hybrid of handball/basketball/rugby, with special powers. You play a 3v3 game with the goal of dunking on the opponent's.... goal. This is actually a really fun game. And the VS mode is in here to play with a friend.... and it works! It's a great fantasy sport game, and not a lot of devs try to do that.\n\nBut again,  not enough of it here. \n\nThe story is very hit or miss. There's this overarching goal, as well as relationships with your roster/cast. Unfortunately, your relationship with your cast only goes as far as clicking on them and hearing them talk at you. You get to know about them, but not really get to know THEM, know what I mean? \n\nEach character is unique in gameplay, but due to spoiler reasons, you tend to lose the characters you actually use during the game. So as soon as you can like a character, they bounce and you're kinda stuck with characters you may have been ambivalent about and, more importantly, that weren't very fun to play.\n\nThe ending heavily relies on your caring about the characters, but I feel like it's undeserved. The interactions with your characters is just too limited to really engage you to them.\n\nAnd that's really what lead to this thumbs down.

Supergiant Games continues to hit it out of the park - excellent characters and plot framing makes this a journey where you'll have to make tough choices and decide for yourself just what true freedom is to you. Supergiant hallmarks like deep lore, their art style and Darren Korb's music all return - just look at any of the trailers! I'd highly recommend this if you want a story-driven experience with all of Supergiant's special flavor, it's completely worth it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 838, "steamid": "76561198012624601", "last_played": 1506567400, "num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 326, "playtime_forever": 910}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506607156, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506607156, "recommendationid": "35262492", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
