This is such a wonderful game. Originally played on the ps3, got a bundle of 1 and 2 on sale--which resulted in getting two free games. \n\nGraphics are spiffy and the plot wonderful.

(looking at you old Link) \n+ There are Statistiks wich you can accsess any time \n\nNeutral: \n\n# Graphics are nothing special, the Warmastered Edition does a good job thought \n# The Kamera was annoying a couple of times \n# There could have bin more Weapons but it did not have to. Would have bin cool thought \n\nContra: \n\n- The leveling System could have bin better (A Number to work with would be almost fine)\n- Just a little bit more Charakter development for War would have bin nice \n\nThere is not much bad to say at this point. It's a good Game. Play it. \n\n\n\nPS: No shame in googling where all Collectables are.

I played through the entire main story, which is the only thing there is to do. I cannot see why people like this game.

Which I found confusing because you play as the character \"War\" but spend most of the game pushing boxes or throwing bombs. Then as you unlock new areas you find out there are ever more dynamic puzzles to which you spend most of your time discovering. The time spent on logistics greatly takes away from its gameplay value, which in my opinion, is meant to be a combat oriented game.\n\nIf your going to try this anyway, imagine \"War\" as \"Link\" and the game makes much better sense.
