The game, in my opinion, is pretty good. For a $5 game, I'm actually impressed. It is a simple strategy/simulation game where you own an airline and you simply create flights between destinations that are in demand and try to make a profit. You choose between a bunch of airplanes to service your routes and you can also choose the quality of your flights, which is based on meals, crew size, and quality of the seats. The tutorial could have been better because it didn't tell me what any of the symbols that describe the airplanes specs mean, but it's pretty simple to figure out, from left to right: seats on the plane, cruising speed of the plane, maximum distance the plane can travel, and fuel consumption. All of these things along with meals, crew size, and quality of seats determine a routes \"flight rating.\" Passengers tend to fly with the airline that has a higher \"flight rating\" and there are three other airlines that you have to compete with to try to have higher \"flight ratings\" in order to try to get as many passengers to fly with your airline. You start the game in 1960 and I think it goes on to 2009 (I say this because the game crashed for me at the end of 2009, and I'm not sure if that is suppose to signify the end or not). Again, for a $5 game, this is a good simulation/strategy game. I don't know what the other reviewers expected out of this game and how most of them came up with a review with less than an hour of gameplay, but I enjoyed it.
