This game is also pretty great for people who love games that are splitscreen co-op, like me.\n\nHonestly, I'd like to see more players online on this game. I could not find a single server, and if you're looking to sell/collect trading cards, it looks like only 4 or so people have them up for sale.

Buy 2 copies so you can play with a friend since the 1 player experience is short and sweet but with no replayability. Mute the music as well, you will know why I say that in very short order when you play.\n\nWith the few negatives out of the way the game is fun, I am honestly surprised. I was playing Streetfighter 5 online and the many, many problems with the online connectivity just made me give up. Disenfranchaised with my wasted money, I decided to just randomly buy this game. The reason I mention this is because I just don't understand how this little indie team can get matchmaking and lagless online play so perfect yet triple A studios like Capcom just, [i]can't[/i].\n\nIts truly amazing, the game works right out of the box, the online works, it is just such a breath of fresh air it reminds me why I do enjoy playing games! But enough gushing, is it any good?\n\nIts middle of the road. You see, every class shares the same stats which are more health, more mana, more crit and finally more attack. This means a warrior is no better or stronger than a priest. This creates a weird situation where you are better off picking the wizard since they have the longest range in the game because everyone is equally as strong and defensive as each other. This also makes leveling up pointless because you don't distribute stat points either and equipment doesn't seem level based, if you find an item then that seems to be all that matters, you are good to wear it.\n\nI don't mind the latter point since lets be honest we are all about the fat loot but the game is super simple and is much closer to a twin stick shooter (which it probably should have been) than a diablo clone. \n\nI might sound negative but I did have fun playing the game. I know if I was playing solo that I would get bored quickly and I recommend if you do fancy this game that you have a friend or two who you can play it with.\n\nIts certainly cheap enough that its shortcomings are outweighed by the fun to be had and again to stress that the netcode is neigh perfect which I respect.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198055311780", "last_played": 1480263267, "num_reviews": 156, "num_games_owned": 298, "playtime_forever": 255}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1480256386, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.420548", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1480409161, "recommendationid": "27834814", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Good game but pvp is dead", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198203383844", "last_played": 1501866475, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 13, "playtime_forever": 372}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1474320594, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500164", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1474320594, "recommendationid": "25594237", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Good Little game.

Usually mages suffer from the issue of being squishy and easily wrecked, but in this game stats are affected solely by items. They will affect each class the same way, so this completely mitigates the whole \"squishy mage\" archetype right there. Now, this is a huge issue because every class has 4 attacks: A basic attack you will spend the bulk of your time on, and three situational abilities that take MP to use that are more powerful, but are limited by of course your MP (which does regenerate quite quickly.)\n\nThe Mage's attack is a long range, rapid-fire arcane bolt that lets you hit enemies from near anywhere without needing to get up close and have them chase you. As they get closer to you, you can switch to your more powerful Flame Breath and finish them that way. This puts the mage well outside of anything's distance, allowing you to pretty much breeze through the game with little effort.\n\nThe Cleric, in contrast, has a short-range \"volley\" that is slow, has a long range Vampirism spell that minorly heals you, and then has two healing abilities that are useless outside a multiplayer game, and even then it's questionable as one is long-range targeted and one is a shockwave-style spell centered on you. But potions are not only plentiful to excess, they are usable at the push of a button, so this pretty much renders the Cleric completely useless.\n\nThe Fighter has a very short range basic attack, guaranteeing you will eat a lot of damage from enemies. A longer range attack is a dash that collides into enemies and damages them, which also puts you into strike range for your basic attack... and into their strike range. He does have an ability that reduces damage dealt to him, but it only lasts half as long as it takes for the cooldown to wear off. Now remember how stats are a nonfactor and that you need to power up through the items you equip... this means there is absolutely no compelling reason to play a Fighter in this game when you have the range of the Mage to work with.\n\nThe storyline is your basic \"go and kill the bad guy masquerading as a good guy\" trope. It takes about 10 hours to beat and then because there is no compelling reason to play through with characters other than a mage, this game will remain in your library, sit there and collect e-dust. The replayability is counting on you to be an achievement hunter, to do such mind numbing tasks like collect one million gold, or kill 1,000 enemies in PVP (as of this writing) or level up each class to level 30 (when I finished, I was level 15. This involves basically screwing around and redoing areas in the multiplayer game.) These tasks are more tedious and time-consuming than fun, and are there to basically artificially inflate the playtime of the people who just have to have every achievement unlocked. Since I personally don't give a monkeys about achievements, there is currently nothing bringing me back to this game right now.\n\nIt makes for a couple interesting gaming sessions, then you're done and it's on to the next game. It's the Chinese Food of video gaming: Satisfying at first but soon you will be looking for something else.\n\nDo I recommend it? If you have 5 bucks laying around and need something new to do for a couple nights, sure. If you want something of substance, this won't hit that spot. I can't give it a \"thumbs middle\", so I would have to say considering I have not touched it since I played through to the end, no, I could not recommend it based on that.
