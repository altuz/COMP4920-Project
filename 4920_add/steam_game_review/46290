Place AT guns on the reverse side peering just over the edge. Doing so will provide much needed cover.\n-Units zero in on enemies with each missed shot, move a tank or retreat a gun down a slope thats under fire to throw off enemy aim and force them to zero in again.\n-Caveat: Moving your own units, messes up their aim as well, trade-off accordingly. More experienced crews can fire while moving and maintain zero-in aim. (this is the era before gyrostabilizers)\n-Use tanks in hull down positions on slopes\n-Inexperienced gunners/drivers cannot fire while moving, they must come to a complete stop\n-Units with direct attack commands will zealously carry out their orders and chase enemies if they don't have clear line of sight. Be sure to cancel any attack orders with the stop command if you want them to acquire different targets.\n-Anti tank rifle infantry is great at finishing off wounded/disabled tanks. Remember that tanks poor vision near them and infantry can crawl around undetected.\n-Keep experienced soldiers alive during your campaign. An AT-rifleman/marksman or a tank gunner with good aim can make mincemeat of inexperiencd tanks--especially at a distance.\n-Units may panic if they have low leadership or no one nearby is around with a high leadership value.\n-Penetration values are ideal circumstances. That H35 with 35mm penetration probably won't kill a Panzer 4 with 30mm frontal armor unless some plating has already been blown off."}, {"votes_down": 7, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1496944853, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504757", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "32271506", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198028742706", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1496944583, "num_games_owned": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 309}, "timestamp_updated": 1496944853, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I thought this was going to be a fun an enjoyable game, but nope. The AI is the worst I have seen yet. The men can't even hit an armed car with their bazooka within 10 meters. That is if they decide to use the bazooka in the first place, most of the time they will just use their machine gun to attack an amored car. The other probelm is the men just won't attack they will just stand there doing nothing at all.
