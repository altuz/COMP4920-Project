This could be due to the visual novel being fairly short which is respectable. Even though it was limited, each piece of the soundtrack was well suited for each scene thus, keeping me engaged.\n\nSTORY: 6\nThe story felt unique but also familiar to other plot lines we have all seen before, without saying too much and spoiling the story I will say that it was predictable in where it was heading. Although the story was short, it was well written but it needed a change of direction or an option of a choice maybe.\n\nAUDIO DUB: 6.5\nI was fairly impressed with the voice acting of Kyouichirou and Chiyo which was well fitted to their characters. The other characters well.....not so much as it felt almost cringy and awkward majority of the time.\n\nOVERALL RATING: 7\nAmazing artwork throughout the visual novel, an alluring soundtrack and unique characters. Although it was a short story I did enjoy it and would be looking forward to a sequel.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197999567241", "last_played": 1487594776, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 408, "playtime_forever": 124}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1487597759, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517218", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1487597759, "recommendationid": "30057413", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Wander No More is a short visual novel I enjoyed.
