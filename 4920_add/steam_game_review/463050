This review will cover THE PIT AMD THE PENDULUM. FOR STARTERS: AT ONE POINT in this game you will be laying to the RIGHT of a PIT and the character will say the pit is on your right. This could be the fact that whomever made this game does not have ENGLISH as a primary language, or the interpreter is handicapped, as they FORGOT THE PLAQUE THAT SHOWS AS THE GAME STARTS.(WTF?) ANYWHO; TIME FOR THE REVIEW.\n\nThis game has some visually beautiful pictures in it, and some BEAUTIFUL (GOTO SCREENSHOTS, and LOOK FOR MY PICTURES) ANGELS. \nThat is the only thing visually pleasing about this game.\n\nThe game took me twenty-nine minutes to complete.. At least twenty minutes of this was reading, WAITING,(YES YOU HAVE TO WAIT AT POINTS) and Watching the credits.. which, by the way,  IS NOT SKIPPABLE. I accidentally clicked ABOUT in the in-game menu, so that AND the end credits gave me roughly fifteen minutes of my playthrough.\n\nThis game is short. It has some technical flaws, AS IN; to start the game, you must set all of your D3D options, and hope that you chose correctly.\nThat is all I pretty much have to say about this game.\nI got this game as a part of a bundle through steam. --PAID About $0.10 for this game.\n\nEdgar Allen Poe would be ashamed!!\n\nBUT, THIS LITERALLY IS A TELLING OF: THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM, BY EDGAR ALLEN POE.\nIt you like visual Poetry, this is for you.
