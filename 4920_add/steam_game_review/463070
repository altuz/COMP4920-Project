And they're mostly really good.\n- Dynamic difficulty system that works surprisingly well.\n- Good stage training modes and boss rush modes for practicing.\n\nAnd it's not just all stats either, it's got the good game design to go along with it: \nSome ships function very differently from others and will force you to heavily adapt how you play the game. Bosses are menacing and will not shy away from getting right up in your face, forcing you to leave the comfort zone at the bottom of the screen. Bosses sometimes come in groups and often times have strategic dismemberment. \nThe dynamic difficulty system affects game speed, enemy attack difficulty, and your own attack power, and will adapt to provide an easier experience if you're struggling, and a tougher experience if you manage to keep up.\nThe music isn't mind-blowing but it complements the action nicely and some tracks will stick with you.\n\nAll in all, pretty great. It's not nearly stellar or stylish enough to threaten Hellsinker's throne, but it's the closest I've seen a shmup get in a long time and you won't want to miss it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "steamid": "76561198026719448", "last_played": 1506481511, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 272, "playtime_forever": 1502}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1494955851, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514892", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1494989306, "recommendationid": "31791241", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
