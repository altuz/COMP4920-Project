First off, absolutly no music. Just the constant ping of you getting hit and losing health. Second, what am i trying to do in this game. I guess wonder around and collect items that have no importance at all. I guess you can't expect much from a two dollar game or whatever this piece of shit was but come on. They would have been better off just making this the old metrodvania/shooting platformer or something. I really love the fact that games are art and anybody can put their creations out there for others to experience it but I think Steam should really start filtering/weeding out crap games. I would rather go and play some atari games. On a final note, I'm not trying to be negative but don't waste your money on this boring game and also don't believe any reviews that say its good.
