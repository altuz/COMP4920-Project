The bulk of your strategy will rely on mixing and matching equipment which are semi-randomly dropped from the missions you complete, equipping them to characters, and then selecting the right characters for a mission.  At a tactical level, the game can be a bit slow (dice assignment is time consuming and large maps with tons of enemies take a lot of time to get through) but is overall very rewarding.  \nElements that detracted from the game include nearly everything left to random chance and not being able to save in the middle of a multi-map mission.  Battlefield control is kind of wonky; threat is well implemented but monsters can still run past your frontline without anything to stop or slow them down.  Also, there's no way to influence initiative that I could see.  Non-HP consumables seemed pretty useless... but I say that in almost every game I play so whatever.\n\nThe UI is adequate but could use a lot of polish to improve quality of life.  I would have liked to see an item-centric screen that lets me quickly see who can equip it and what the differences are.  Being able to adjust characters on the character... bar? on the bottom of the screen.  Saving consumable selection between missions.  Relatively small changes that could have improved my experience by quite a bit.\n\nThe graphics are simple but in a cute way that doesn't detract too much from the gameplay.  I turned the music off because I was listening to podcasts so I can't comment on it.\n\nThe story is simple and railroady.  Not really a selling point for the game.\n\nOverall, a fun game that I enjoyed.
