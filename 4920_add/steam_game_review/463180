The music is well made and reminds a bit at times strangely of something you'd hear in Phantasy Star or old Megadrive/Genesis games with the old Yahama synth sound. It seems to run on a endless board loop which get's more and more challenging as you progress levels with a pretty balanced diffculty curve. Scoring higher points can be assisted with the aid of using bombs to create chain attacks for higher bonus points. The controls and hitbox detection are pretty well done, although just catching the tail end of a bomb blast that you think you can avoid can be annoying at times. Certainly worth picking up for such a cheap price if you like older arcade style games. Well recommended.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006276098", "last_played": 1465855321, "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 312, "playtime_forever": 348}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1462721626, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501918", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1463750842, "recommendationid": "22865116", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "mc", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198301810040", "last_played": 1463481924, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 231}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1465655852, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493238", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1465655852, "recommendationid": "23503241", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Game is good. the cards are finally came out!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198141314089", "last_played": 1472395238, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_forever": 378}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1462605990, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495270", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1462611706, "recommendationid": "22839415", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Make it so you can customize the controls, otherwise I cannot recommend this game.
