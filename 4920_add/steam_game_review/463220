It's not easy, no, but it isn't badly designed either. Now, I wasn't a fan of the lack of variety, looping music, and poor platforming layout that made not getting hit a stupid amount of times an absolute chore... Not to mention I managed to crash the game multiple times by leaving the maps while going where I assumed was the right way to go. Some graphical updates could do this game quite well...

This nullifies the sense of doubling your health.\n\nOne of the bosses pattern consists on increasing its speed as its life goes down. The problem is that it also jumps when it is near you. Combine this two things and you will have to position yourself in order to provoke the boss jump in places where it can be dodged. The game tricks you into believing that the corners are this place, but this place is relative to you. This pattern is very counterintuitive.\n\nOther bosses have extreme difficulty, such as the wall of eyes. Funnily enough, Zolthan is the easiest of them all.\n\nGiven the very specific movements the game expects from you, save points should actually not exist, respawning the player at the entrance of each screen.\n\nMusic becomes repetitive as it is only a single melody.\n\nOverall, it's a short game whose problem is an excess of difficulty.

Level design is flawed, offering fake multiple paths that you cannot take until you get unlock something down another path first and is disguised linearity.
