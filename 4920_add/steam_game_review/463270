Holy moly this game is amazing, the loot system is great and the boss fights... I mean.. WOW! I honestly got tears in my eyes, this is basically what an oldschool game should be (+ it's a lot harder than expected, which I like)\ngreat and fun story mode, nice difficulty spikes, smooth and great gameplay. try it out!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197968702247", "last_played": 1505657441, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 141, "playtime_forever": 547}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505630538, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505571", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505630538, "recommendationid": "35015880", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I admit that I had to warm up to it in the beginning, but after a certain point it turns into a really enjoyable game. Once you start making a \"build\" of your main character it just keeps getting more and more fun.\n\nThe aforementioned cutscenes are indeed cringy at first, but they grow on you as they seem self aware of their cheese. The game is much like a B movie that doesn't take itself seriously.\n\nVoice acting is not good, but bearable. \nFantastic story concept -- even if you figure it out halfway through the game.\n\nGraphically it varies. The sprites themselves are great but the animation of the limbs of many of the humanoid robots seem a bit hokey. You get used to it. I am a fan of fully rendered sprites. I hope a sequel will have this.\n\nAbove all it is a unique find amongst all the \"metroidvanias\" out there. In my book offsets all the cons. \n\nA definite recommend for those 2D junkies out there like myself. I just finished it and I can't wait for a sequel. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 666, "steamid": "76561197980278131", "last_played": 1506403265, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 124, "playtime_forever": 828}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506405863, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505139", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506405863, "recommendationid": "35216550", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
