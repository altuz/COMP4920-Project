At times, it seems like the game purposely stacks the deck against you in terms of which stat you\u2019re gaining in and which you need for some important upcoming story choices. Say, you\u2019ve been patient for the most part of the game, but this one or two choices force you straight into the bold direction and what do you need for some upcoming choices? That\u2019s right, a high patience percentage. \nIt\u2019s just needlessly frustrating, especially when you\u2019re trying to explore all the options the game has to offer, but you have to restart again and again because you\u2019re lacking the correct stats again when they were just fine two sentences ago. By the way, let me just mention that I\u2019ve played several Choice of\u2026 games before and normally playing around with the stats can vary from tedious to fun depending on the game, but this is the first time I\u2019ve been so frustrated by the stat system in any of these games. It's like the game won't allow you to do anything it doesn't want you to do, as if it's only giving you the illusion of choice, but no actual choices. \nThe story itself, well, there isn\u2019t much of one, but it\u2019s interesting enough I suppose if you\u2019ve an interest in merfolk to begin with. \nThe romance options feel like they were just thrown in there because the author felt obligated to put some in. I\u2019ve gone through several playthroughs now and still haven\u2019t figured out how to romance anyone, even though the option should be there.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198128757892", "last_played": 1495224720, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 178, "playtime_forever": 975}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1495225073, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495225073, "recommendationid": "31846800", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
