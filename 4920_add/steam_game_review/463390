We get to have a cast that bounces off of each other's peronality nicely.  Though I did find their actions cringey at times, overall they are endearing.\n    [*] The Music - Piano and Jazz. Enough said.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n    [*] The Structure - The high school hijinks could have been changed to something else or at least its frequency got toned down. It was humorous at first but it got old quickly. the scene could have been more creative. I understand the highschool setting makes for a very limited array of options to choose from but I expected more.\n    [*] The Visuals - Honestly if I judge with the backgrounds alone then this should be in the pros list but there should be a lot more characters sprites with different poses to connect more with the scenes so monotone appearances throughout bothered me a lot.\n[/list]\n\nOverall a great free visual novel game and not bad since I ended up reading the whole thing.
