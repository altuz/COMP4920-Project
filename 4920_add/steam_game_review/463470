The gameplay is similar to Another World (aka Out of this World), in that you're a weak individual exploring a hostile environment and trying to find items, avoid traps, overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. Meanwhile death is around every corner and there are endless things that can kill you and gory ways in which you can die. People who are writing negative reviews clearly don't understand this game: death is not punished, you have infinite lives, you respawn immediately and checkpoints are given frequently (and there's even an \"easy\" mode). Quite often I jump into a trap or monster's jaws on purpose just to see what happens and to watch the death animations. Otherwise the controls are tight and the fixed camera angle was reminiscent of Alone in the Dark or early Resident Evil games.\n\nAside from the gameplay, the atmosphere and environments are beautiful and creepy.. the game is mostly black and white, and we explore a surreal ruined nightmarescape of blood, gore and cracked tiles, etc. It feels a lot like Eraserhead. As you progress, you unravel more of the story and the game spices things up by awarding you with new abilities and constatly surprising challenges presented by the environment (including boss fights). You control the protagonist, a strange little mammal creature who looks a bit like Ren (from Ren & Stimpy) but also a bit like a tarsier. He looks so scared and vulnerable in that awful environment and that, along with the excellent sound design and fixed camera, create an atmosphere of tension and horror. The graphics look a bit like goofy 3D from the early 2000's but that adds to the charm and it kind of suits the surreal, cobbled-together found-footage feeling of the game.\n\nI generally don't review games but I felt I needed to speak up about this game. It really is something unique, something special and you can tell that the developer has poured so much love and creativity into it. This game won't be for everyone, but it's not trying to do that. If you've got love and respect for the original Alone in the Dark and also Another World, or if you like your games a bit weird and difficult, then you're certain to adore this highly underrated gem.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198003146259", "last_played": 1485110158, "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 742, "playtime_forever": 407}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1484961556, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502784", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1484961556, "recommendationid": "29387368", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Lithium is Canu Arts first IP, and it's a damn good ride. While the game isn't perfect, the atmosphere it creates for the players reminds us of simpler times, where horror wasn't about the complications of a biohazard outbreak (and all the science sorrounding it) but it was about what might be hiding in the dark.\n\nThe game uses lighting to hide the monsters and make the players rethink their way around the navigational puzzles, which in turn makes us think about how we are moving in the environment. \n\nIf you can handle the few stuff that might be a little frustrating at first, you will be dealing with a hidden jewel in this game!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993363496", "last_played": 1477503123, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 436, "playtime_forever": 107}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1477430104, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502341", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1477430104, "recommendationid": "26221396", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Something we need to keep in mind is that this is a first for this studio and for such first attempt, this is a pretty decent game altogether. It is worth the price with the discount. Full price? You might want to think about it. The game has nice ambience and good music. The fact that this is based on actual mental patients adds a very nice touch. As for the art of the game, it still lacks a bit of work, but the design of the characters and monsters is very well done. The textures sometimes feel a bit plastic too.\nSome of the thing I did not like and which the developers must fix in a patch, hopefully:\nGame menu: it lacks a lot of options. I like to explore the options before I play. I went into graphic options and you would assume hitting \"ESC\" would bring me back to the menu. Instead, it exited the game.\nControls: very not intuitive. Awkward and the \"keyboard+mouse\" combo actually feels wrong. Mouse moves the camera but the game moves it anyway too. Also, you're only able to jump to the front; never in the same spot.\nSounds: While most of the sounds work fine, two things really annoy me. The stepping sounds; unnecessary and loud. But worst of all (probably the worst thing in the game): the strange animalesque sound the main character makes when jumping. Becomes too annoying too quickly.\nThe last thing and another huge annoyance is the fact that you press \"Y\" to activate things?? really?? not CTRL, not \"R\", not \"E\" or something actually closer to WASD. At least let me re-map it, guys!\nI know, I know... that's quite a few things, but my hope is that the developers will somehow see this and see it as positive criticism.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197999390179", "last_played": 1479447540, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 144, "playtime_forever": 14}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1477710193, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498602", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1477710193, "recommendationid": "26281288", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The games has a very nice ambient, dolls watching you, disturbing enemies and gore; The puzzle are very orignal and fun at the same time, the setting remind me a lot of Creatures 2 form the orignal Playstation which i player when i was little and it scared the crap out of me.\n\nIts satisfactory to lure enemies and see them die in gory ways, you need to use the head to kill them, i like the old school fixed cameras like in the original resident evil, now for the bad stuff; The character control is very akward and hard to control, the hand wall enemies are very unoriginal, why not an iron maiden instead of just a hole in the wall from which a random hand comes out?.\n\nThe UI is very bad, ctrl as \"cancel\" for the menus? come on! the standar controls are very badly set up also, R for attacking with the clock big guy, why R? the keys are set up in a very weird way, but these 2 i bet will be updated by the developer to be better.\n\nAnother thing, the switches which also use the Y key for some reason (normally actions in PC games are set to E key), are hard to activate and the light swiches, turn on the lights only for 20 seconds, that too fast, i found myself skipping ligth swiches all the time, another thing i dont like is the blood decal that they use normaly for bloody floors, i dont know where they got it, but its horrible, it looks nothing like blood and its repeatedly used, it would be cool to see a better blood decal and have some variation instead of seeing the same one over and over.\n\nI do recommend it, most of the problems can be easily fixed and im sure they will be fixed, the developer is launching hotfixes constantly.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010570419", "last_played": 1477696092, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 64, "playtime_forever": 169}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1477699399, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501753", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1477699567, "recommendationid": "26278847", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a review of the game played only with mouse and keyboard, and let me tell you that it is a very unpleasant experience.\n\nGAME FEATURES \n\n-It lacks in graphics settings, no options to remove Normal Maps, Dynamic Shadows, Antialiasing, etc. only two options are available for the graphics settings: texture and resolution (WOW), you really need a good hardware to play this \"Lithium\", and still it will run badly.\n\n-A lot of camera Issues. \n\n-In fixed camera angle mode, the camera position doesn't work properly with keyboard directional controls, it's very clunky.
