The ship moves too far too easily. You will either crash into something, or miss the monster. I found myself using tiny taps on the movement buttons. [i]Need to move to the right, then tap-tap-tap-tap. Oops too far, tiny tap the other way. Damn too far ...[/i] I spent the entire game constantly tap-tap-tap; that's tedious.\n[*]Screen shake. The entire game world shakes when a monster dies. After a while I have a headache, and some nausia. Didn't see a way to turn shake off.\n[*]Don't feel progression. With each power-up, I swear the enemies seem to be shooting faster. I don't \"feel\" as powerful as I should after a power-up.\n[*]Sluggish mouse in the main menu. Unless the game is using full viewport redraw, there is no reason for a slow mouse. This issue has no bearing on the game play. Moving the ship with the mouse is not supported.\n[/list]\n\nI've thought hard for something positive to say about this game.\n[list]\n[*]$2 price tag.\n[*]Tinydownload.\n[*]Autofire.\n[/list]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009891135", "last_played": 1499281163, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_forever": 31}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499284688, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506783", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499351018, "recommendationid": "33288990", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
