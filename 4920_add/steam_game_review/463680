Could use some polish but overall 8 out of 10 hip thrust.\n\nGoE may not appeal to all audiences due to the fact that it is slower paces than the norm that has been defined by Diablo. Combat feels more in line with Titan Quest  series where each battle is slower paced and you never feel like you have ROFLstomped your enemy even when you have obtained an item of worth I.E legendary however it still gives you the feeling that you do have an edge.\n\nThere is a bit of polishing the game still needs to put in as of this writing you can only change the resolution of the game as the settings for video options do not change without editing the .ini file.\n\nThe UI is not unique by any means and is in line with every other ARPG out there with a typical Health on left Energy on right and skills in the middle lay out. \n\nThe music is probably one of my biggest gripes. While not terrible it becomes repeitive like PoE repetitve quick. Some music scores are witten beautifully only to turn into a WTF type composition is this. New Ku'dan upper being one that sticks out sorely. Overall forgetable and easily muted to a Youtube mix.\n\nIve not found any input lag however there is an issue with the server not registering hits due to ghosting or moving npcs that are not processed on your screen.  I believe this is a Server issue\n\nParts of the games core are very tedious and it dosnt quite explain things as well as it could. Followers in your house and their stats and what they do{yes you get a house} is up to you to figure out. I still at the time of writing this do not know if the laid out Ability progression tree affects your character as a whole, or just the ability its tied to or if it comes into play when you have slotted sad ability. However I do like the fact that it does away with the norm and no longer use the same D&D formula STR, CON etc. And takes on Prestigue, Bravery, Blood and Focus that combines multiple cross stats that would not normally be grouped together such as  block and attack speed or crit and resistance.\n\nSo to follow up I rarely rate games but I feel this game deserves a bit of a push to help bolster its backing and support.

The fact that every class has energy- and physical attacks makes it awesome for character individualization. So you can basically do whatever you want the way you want it. Even ranged and melee combat isn't a hard choice, as every class supports both, based on the buildpath you take. That's what I like, because you basically just have to choose your main class based on the passives it provides and then do anything else later, as you learn the game and learn what you want to do. The game doesn't hold you back. Worst case would be if you can't make any use of any of the passives of your mainclass, but there are so many different routes to go that you will always find something you need. And yeah, the graphics are pleasant to look at aswell.\n\nCons:\nThe main problem is the playerbase really. That's a problem because you can't make much use of game features that require other players, like PvP. Another minor thing I think is quite confusing - but maybe it has a deeper thought that I didn't think of - is description consistency. An example are the words \"toxic\" and \"poison\". In the character creation it says poison, but in the attacks it's toxic. I know it's not horrible, but if a game has too much of tiny little consistency errors like this, it can become overwhelming over time.\n\nAll in all this game is good enough for it's price and I enjoyed the playtime I had so far.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001196379", "last_played": 1505744288, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 602}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1505495996, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1505919914, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516103", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1505495996, "developer_response": "Hi Lliqht, \n\nThank you for taking time to write this review and showing interest in GoE.\n\nWe are very happy to hear that you like the dual class system , it indeed does add loads of dynamic to the game. \n\nWith regard to the player base we are expecting this to increase with Commercial Launch.

Different markets have different tastes, and some markets might already be flooded with certain types of games.

As others have pointed out, it could use some polish in a few areas, but I still find the game extemely enjoyable.\n\nBoth Sacred 2 and Runes of Magic gave me a similar, peaceful feeling of exploration and advancing.  Both games had their rough edges, but there was a certain charm about them that made them uniquely fun to play.\n\nI think it's unfair to compare GoE to PoE or other ARPGs.  GoE, in my opinion, is intended to be slower pace, lean closer to the MMO genre, and elicit a completely different feeling from the player.\n\nNone of the bugs I've encountered have been breaking.  I'll sometimes have to release the mouse button and press again to start attacking in a different direction, or my spell doesn't make contact when it seems it should.  It happens rarely, though.\n\nI hope they can smooth out those minor annoyances.  And if they could add a little more \"oomph\" to the non-crit hits, that would make the combat a bit more thrilling.  The crits are good, though.  The sound effects are decent, and pieces go flying everywhere.  Very satisfying.\n\nI like that they have the \"holy trinity\" setup like a traditional MMORPG.

It's a decently fun game, but I actually had to stop playing after I cleared 1 of the dungeons because the hitbox issues and tiny little items on the floor that's hard to pick up. There are also graphic issues that other aRPGs share with environmental clipping mobs making them invincible as well as a pillar in the foreground that blocks the view of a gorup of mobs and stuff like that. I'd suggest have a faster dissolve of the walls and doorways and such.\n\nThe Dual class system is good, but then I wouldn't really want to restart a new char to try a new combination because that first 15 levels of questing was extremely tedious and not all that intuitive. You are sent all over the map trying to do quests while mobs are packed everywhere with a pretty quick respawn timer. I'd hack n' slash for like 10 levels, and then just end up running pass the mobs afterwards. In the traditional non-MMO style aRPG, the mobs don't respawn unless you reset the instance, and in a MMO, the mobs are spread out a more sparsely to allow people to travel, but this game took those two elements and try to smoosh them together.....It just became a game that doesn't give you any downtime (to even clear your inventory or upgrade skills),  and wasting all the killing on trashmobs that really drop nothing useful.\n\nAlso the quest rewards are really lacklustered.

I'm pretty \"experienced\" semi-hardcore but very min-maxing liking ARPG player writing my first review :)\n\nI've purchased game cuz it's released and was pretty cheap and so far i've totally Had my fun for the money i spend.\n\nEveything what's written is based on my opinion and the experience i had with the game so far. \n \nThe game is surely wasn't made for casual players, but also it's not as \"hard\" to understand as it seems at the first glance, i believe this is caused by the random stat(except weapon Damage) itemisation system the game uses, which is pretty similiar to the Diablo 3 in it's release era (prior to patch 1.0.4) but not as bad as it was back then due to one great future which devs(thx god) provided called \"Enchanting\" which allows you to re-roll stats if you're unfamiliar with it from other games.\n\nIn the beggining game feels very slow compared to the like's of D3 or PoE in the endgame builds :) This also is caused by the itemisation system which i mentioned earlier, add to that lack of good clearing skills on earlier levels on the most of classes, needless to say if you can survive in such enviroment for the first few hours the game will reaaally open up @around ~17-23sh lvl's and will start becoming more like traditional arpg's where you make few hits, destroy the pack of mobs, and move on to the next ones. Properly using \"Enchantment\" feature to re-roll trash stats into good ones on early gear you'l find, speed's up that process alot.\n\nSome text about skill system : it has pretty good design, but suffers alot from most of the skills (i would say around 60%) being straight up garbage, ~20% are very good and another 20% could be efficient in group play, currently this is the weakest aspect of the game by far, which really needs attention imo. \n\nTruth to be told it's made even worse due to passive stat boosts, which is provided in the skill \"lanes\" due to \"Demon\" being in them which i believe... must be exorcised :)  As it's stated in the Holy Book \"knowing the Demons true name gives you control over it\" and the demons name in this case is the \"Critical hit chance +0.5%\". That is just disgunstingly OP and unbalanced to the point it is better than any other stat u can find there by atleast twice amount O_O That Demon's power renders every skill lane where it is present to be maxed out w/o even looking at skills that lane provides and honestly that is just sad. \n\nI didn't find game to be 'clunky' like some people say, but it feels like there is some kind of undrlying server issue where server sometimes does not register your hits (either it's caused by ping or \"server/client sync tick rate\"), most of the online games(i think) adress those problems by chunk of netcode called \"lag compensation\" to prevent this but in this game it feels like there's none and that thing i would say is more negative than positive one.\n\nAnother aspect which requires some attention of devs is the Professions, which is for now atleast - completely useles. They does not provide you with anything and grinding for gear is much better/faster/etc option than trying to craft it.\n\nThat being said, i still liked the game much more than i expected to, it's totally not perfect and has the room for improvement but it's a good game with potential to become great one in future, i would rate it 8-/10 right now and will hope it becomes better in the aspects i've mentioned while still enjoying playing it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 4053, "steamid": "76561198160955082", "last_played": 1507162034, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_forever": 4053}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1506506092, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502380", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506513624, "recommendationid": "35238763", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Hi everybody.\n\nI really like the game ...

The loot system is terrible, mele class finding staff with better stats than any mele weapon. Or ranged character finding a mele weapon better than a ranged yada. So random its kinda stupid. Just how diablo 3 started out. Kinda looks stupid having a heavy armored knight rocking a crossbow or a staff. \n\nStunlock situation even when you have high armor, and good stats to survive. Get surrounded and watch your toon die.\nUpgrading your weapon and maxing stats for said weapons and armor is laughable.\nCrafting is even worse.\n\nMoral of the story.\nIf you enjoy a monotonous game where you will spend lots of time just tweaking gear and stats. Or running a dungeon 100 times just to get a sword instead of a staff.
