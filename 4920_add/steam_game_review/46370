Although the game itself is rather a disaster for me.\n\nThe graphics, all in all, looked pretty decent on the steam web page screenshots and in-game.\n\nUnfortunately, the game isn't what I hoped to be.\n\n[h1]What's Wrong About It?[/h1]\n\n[u]Quick Summary Checklist:[/u]\n-Terrible Camera View\n-Bad Optimization\n-Bad FOV In-Cabin view\n-Awkward unskippable cutscenes\n-No Map what so ever, or any checkpoints to know where you're going.\n\n[u]In Depth Details of my experience:[/u]\n\nThe Camera View isn't very good, the Camera ends up being so close to your truck In-View Cabin's windshield and outside of the truck, it's horrible to control with it.\n\nOptimization I had problems with. I had an old laptop and had issues running it on Medium and High settings, and I was over the recommendations by far. Now, I have a new PC that I got with an RX 480 8GB, I thought it would get rid of the issue and fix it along with my decent CPU for this game. Wrong, the game, in fact, ran worst than it did on my laptop. Why? I have no clue.\n\nThe cutscenes man, I can't handle them. To me, it was awkward dialogue left and right along with the character movement. I just wanted to drive some trucks, not seeing these cutscenes left and right. \n\nThere's no map to know what sense of direction to go. No checkpoints, GPS or anything.\n\n[h1]Final Overview[/h1]\n\nLook, if you want a decent truck game that's simulated I would rather stick with the SCS titles. I understand that this game is dated but the older titles of the [i]18 Wheels Of Steel[/i] Series was better than this with a whole lot more content. This game would only be good for such an 'arcade' feel I guess. I'm disappointed with my purchase on this, just glad I got it on sale, although unfortunately, I cannot refund it.\n\nFor my rating, unfortunately, tanks with this game.\n\nI would have to give it a 3/10.\n\nI would recommend checking out American Truck Simulator as I stated for a simulator."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1497215618, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32352273", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198106942769", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1389229471, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 168}, "timestamp_updated": 1497215618, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Graphics aren't as amazing as you would hope by looking and some screenshots.
