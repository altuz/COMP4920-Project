I can't think of any other game that captures the sense of speed and dynamic movement found in Super Cloudbuilt. In that regard, Super Cloudbuilt truly is a masterful work of art.\n\nThe game gives the player a multitude of ways to tackle any given level, and encourages creativity with many movement options at your disposal. As you hone your skills and become more confident with your abilities, new paths will open to you, and you'll be able to traverse gorgrous dreamscapes in ways you thought impossible before.\n\n If you like what you see from the gameplay trailer, do not hesitate to buy this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 425, "steamid": "76561198025034370", "last_played": 1507178019, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_forever": 3576}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1507178441, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507179372, "recommendationid": "35486346", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
