As soon as the game introduces the mobile enemies a few levels in, you have basically seen the whole game. Additional difficulty only comes from a larger playing field, more different symbols, and faster enemies. There are long stretches of game where the difficulty doesn't change at all. The content stretching goes so far as requiring the player to play a level twice to complete it, but then again, does it really matter if I have to play 2 identical levels, or one level twice? \n\nThe only reason why I didn't refund the game is that it costs below 1\u20ac, so why bother.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198047407608", "last_played": 1481018106, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 164, "playtime_forever": 198}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1465166920, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503374", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1465166920, "recommendationid": "23409523", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I am clueless on this one. I know a lot of games are not very logical but this one totally baffles me. Everything was fine until the enemy ships were introduced. Why would enemy ships steal the jewels and then return them... allbeit in a different location but still... why return them?\n\nAside from that I found it very boring waiting for the ships to drop the gems so I could move them. This is definitely a \"hurry up and wait\" game. And why does the game only save at chapter ends or checkpoints (every 4 levels so far).
