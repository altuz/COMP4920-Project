He uses those powers to solve puzzles, so he can move on to the next area of the game. The beggar also collects some purple crystals along his way which I don't know if they change anything at the ending apart from satisfying our thirst for collecting items. The puzzles are challenging but not very hard, apart from 1 or 2. There are a couple of enemies which you can either avoid or learn how to exterminate them. \n\nI liked the mechanics with the mask and how you use the powers to solve the puzzles.\nI liked the graphics and the music.\nI also liked the fact that it's not a long game (you can finish it in under 1.5 hours).\n\nI didn't like the gameplay as is it was a bit laggy.\nI didn't like the vagueness of the story; \"One day an old man finds a mask...\"\n\nIf you find it on an offer go for it.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198214096159", "last_played": 1503682900, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_forever": 360}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503683826, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503058", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503683826, "recommendationid": "34486619", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
