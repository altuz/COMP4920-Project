But it suffers from comparison with a great number of A-titles in the same class. If you enjoy epic historical battles and tactical thought, go for Medieval: Total War 2 (or any game of Total War series); if you enjoy historically truthful political simulators with high degree of complexity, go for Crusader Kings 2. If, however, you are not a fan of great battles and CK2 are too complicated for you... go for Knights of Honor. I'd really recommend Reign only to medieval eastern Europe enthusists as myself.\n\nReign: Conflict of Nations is an empire-building 4x strategy, depicting happenings in Eastern Europe between 1300 and 1700. Your ambition will be to unite one of the leading powers of the region (Poland, Lithuenia, Sweden or Russia) and become a hegemon. To this end, you'll need to build up a powerful economy, use diplomacy and spycraft, convert population to your religion, gather knowledge to make technological progress, and - of course - wage wars. Sounds promising, doesn't it? So... what's wrong with the game?\n\nFirstly, you will be required to do ALL these activities at the same time and that's - even with the help of action pause - is extremely difficult for bigger empires.\nNext, the battles are resulted by the computer, without giving you a chance to lead your troops or even influence the outcome. Moreover, the results are often unpleasantly random, so you'll find yourself kicking and screaming many times, after your highly superior army of knight has been wiped out by a rag-tag band of peasants.\nThird, you control basically all aspects of the game from the very beginning and none of them (to my knowledge) grows any more important later in the game, so it basically feels all the same when you control a miniature princedom in the heart of Poland, and a huge empire of the late-game. You just do A LOT MORE of the same stuff. And this is a recipe for boredom.\nLastly, the game does not give you much choice of how you will rule your empire. In other game of this kind, you can choose to be a pieceful diplomat and trader, or a vicious tyrant, spying and assassining your enemies, or a steeled knight, conquering the world with fire and sword. Here, the game strangely pushes you into doing all - you can't win by the means of diplomacy, but you can't hold too many provinces with brute force (for unhappiness spawns infinite number of quite powerful rebels, who will finally defeat you anyway).\n\nAll and all, R:CoN is quite playable, enjoyable and challanging in the beginning, but largely boring, time-consuming and repetative later in the game. It might be good springboard for those who want to jump into Crusader Kings, but feel intimidated by their complexity. And it might entertain you if you're fan of Sienkiewicz and history of Polish and Russian empire. In nearly all other cases, don't waste your money here!"}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1390057825, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580455", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "8754423", "votes_up": 51, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198119506543", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1466896621, "num_games_owned": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3025}, "timestamp_updated": 1390057950, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game has one major problem that is unnoticeable in the very beginning, but soon becomes an overwhelming tumor killing the game. It's the fact that you have to manually control the resource production. The most optimal strategy is producing \u00b10 food and throwing the rest of the city population into gold and knowledge production. However, because the food production changes all the time because of various reasons, it have to be manually changed, otherwise you cause starvation or waste resources. And everything affects food production \u2013 moving troops, growing population, settlers, religious unrest, disease. It's no big deal if you have 1-5 cities, but if you control half of the map, it's just boring and painful to deal with the mess.

It is missing minor production values and nuances of older games than itself but overcomes this through its choice of nations and almost endearing ruleset.\n \nI do have to admit that the GUI and Stain Glass/Manuscript art  is genuine and of quality. The game knows what it is implying and does so directly without notice of any shortcomings. To relive the Renaissance and Reformation era as Monarch/Head of State of an Eastern European Principality with very accurate names and maps is done adequetely. \n Its where the game ends is the drop off. At 1650 the game ends with one popup window describing my loss due to not being as formidable as other leaders, a pity since I was established at top ranking of every nation on the statistics window in game of every category, OK I wasn't maxed out at Diplomatic relations, that is because I had taken over half the map and ran out of people to truance with. In my mind...I won.\n \nFirst the dissapointment of doing all this hard work with nothing to show, not even a summary throughout the years. I had lasting family dynasties, many brutal conflicts, trustful allies, great enemies, miserable generations, fascinating trades. Not even a list of every leader I had, at least, in a time frame would have let me remember fondly my hours into it. \nThe game also misses some points  when - someone dies of say,old age. They sure tell you someone has passed away, but who it was and what their duties were in your vast empire, are up to you to remember where you positioned them, needing to check if there is a deficiency in your nation and replace him. The names sound alike over the years and portaits are reused. Confusing.\n Great Music  sticks with you throughout the day, and classical guitar. Only a handful of songs play throughout complementing the state of your province, they are good/great - I claim great. \n\nThe game is simply simple that meanders into deep engaging and addictive gameplay. I am a fan. High difficulty in that most everything has a cause and effect. Want to boost farming? well be ready to lose out on gold and research for around 6 seasons. Want to buff Research for some seasons, well every other nation gets some too. Things conflict. This is where I now see my misfortunes in my personal game. Poland, historically suffered tragedy in the timeline when this game nears its end. I should have devoted more time at the start of my campaign in the spread of my empire as there was impossible odds against my nation from constant robbers, and instant takeovers by rebel nations and dark times on the regular after roughly the late 1500s. That is the type of attention to detail that I respect from this thought provoking experience. What if this game had a higher budget? I am leaning towards the developers putting out precisely the game they had envisioned.\n\nPros:\nMusic\nGraphics/Map\nSimple battle control\nHistorical accuracy\nDifferent troops per region\nHighly replayable - each country should have it's own agenda\nNice damage system, regain health at city - red,orange,yellow,green - combine units\nHigh maintenance\nArt direction - Manuscript painting\nGet lost in the cultural significance overshadows some mechanics are half baked\n\nCons:\nCharachter models are simple\nSometimes hard to click on model because it is behind something.\nToo simple battles\nHigh maintenance\nDefineltely needs a journal because mission tab does not have any other messages to keep track of other countries at war etc.\nNuances that needed to be implemented,which  have detracted from its own originality. See the diplomat screen's lack of info\nRegiments do not regen health in villages\n\nI guess I could say most of the faults could be a primitive aspect such as the time period of the game itself. But thats not the type of 4th dimensional gaming I prefer. But I kind of believe that a power hungry monarch really had no reason to keep tabs on diplomatic relations all the way across the map. In a way this is similar to old style CRPGs, and drawing your own dungeon maps on graph paper.
