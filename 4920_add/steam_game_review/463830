Even if you've got one of the upgrades (and only one is possible to afford after a single runthrough of the four levels prior to him), he still kills you before you seem to be making any progress.  You can damage him for sure, but there's no indication of how much damage he still needs to take, so your efforts feel unconvincing.\n\nThe only option then seems to be to grind the four prior levels for coins to afford more upgrades - and I didn't expect to have to grind in a simple platformer like this.\n\nThere's also a few small glitches which make the game a little underwhelming to play - jumping near a ceiling is a little jerky for some reason, pausing very briefly on the upwards part, and colliding with the front of a moving platform causes things to pause again, until it finally delivers you to the floor (or spikes), and the platform is then delayed, which can make jumping between them more difficult.  And just hope you don't fall between two that are about to meet each other - you get stuck, and have to restart the level...!\nThere's also the small matter that once you break urns, you have to go a short distance away from the coins and then back again to be able to pick the coins up, which can be the difference between escaping enemies, and dying to them.\n\nThe artstyle is really nice however, and the \"fallen city\" concept interesting (if I could discover more of the story), and the simplistic take is refreshing - I hope it gets a few patches in the near future to address these issues, as otherwise this would be a pretty fun and relaxing game to play!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063372069", "last_played": 1461881446, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_forever": 49}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1461928000, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517154", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1461928000, "recommendationid": "22702595", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Bad controls. Glitchy hit detection (if you decide to play this game, make sure to always attack your enemies from below or from the right side, you hit much more often then). Some platforms just kill you if you step on them... sometimes. Sometimes you don't get to jump, sometimes you get stuck on invisible platforms in the air. You can't always get off ladders by going up. Sometimes you have to jump down the ladders and start over.\n\nThis is one of two games I own that I regret buying. Don't play it.\n\nEdit: And what you should do, if you for some reason decide to play the game, grind up max health and weapons on the first few levels. It will help a bit in the beginning. Not so much towards the end though, because then everything will be insta-kill.

There's an actual levelling system so going over levels again and collecting gold gives you a sense of achievement.\n\nHere's my gameplay review of this game but I seriously recommend you check it out yourself considering the price it is!\nhttps://youtu.be/Fttx1-QlvFM", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198259836407", "last_played": 1461937173, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 154, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1461948529, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483652", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1461948529, "recommendationid": "22707462", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
