There is little serious about the game, the premise is amusing (the rulers of a kingdom in a world of magic find out there is a girl with none, so track her down to find what hers is). Very few things make sense. Combat is fun enough, and the paths seem linear.\n\nJust realize the game does not take itself seriously and you'll be fine.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "last_played": 1494537162, "num_reviews": 362, "num_games_owned": 445, "playtime_forever": 67}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1494303237, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513803", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1494303237, "recommendationid": "31639352", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "In the first ten minutes of playtime this game is already confusing. The art style doesn't feel consistent throughout the game, some being more realistic, some more cartoony and some plain ugly. The game world isn't particularly appealing either, very bland with the same textures pasted everywhere, cluttering up the entire map with colours and animations that look plain ugly. The map layout felt like something straight out of a tower defense game, a singular twisting road, almost like a maze from the top right to top left, super linear, with random battles popping up here and there. The combat is very uninspired, either choose attack ability defend or item, the same as a lot of other games in the genre. There are very basic animations for attacks too, although i can't speak about the abilities as of yet. The combat felt very boring and grindy to me. The dialogue is very tacky too, some grammatical and some spelling errors mixed into the garbled mess. It seems like the story was written by a 7 year old from what i've seen, the humour is less funny than their errors which is really saying something. Very poor game even for it's cheap price. Will edit after more playtime though.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198076154141", "last_played": 1493998599, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 303, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1493999086, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507138", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1493999086, "recommendationid": "31561596", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Good time waster and pretty fun.

Seems about right. 2800% increase.\n-The last boss has something like 1 000 000 hp(?) and I could hit max around 4 000. Couldn't defeat it after 1-ish hour using almost all of my items.\n-Takes 5 hours in-game to get one of the achievements - the game being open and not minimized (Steam playtime =/= in-game playtime) so just leave it running when you're away and open a playlist of songs/tracks long enough to prevent your PC from sleeping.\n-No trading cards.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n-Achievements. \n-Cheap price if you buy the bundle when 1 of the 2 games is on sale (like now). But seems that this bundle is not available in Canada and probably some other countries as well..
