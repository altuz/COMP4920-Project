Its listed as a being similar to unreal tournament and I got more of a FPS Moba feel. I may be wrong but I was unable to find out as I searched for players in US-East/West and on the Europe servers and only ever found me. I would imagine because it just launched and is still early here. I may try again later and see if I can find a match.\n\nSo there was some neat things here, the shop system was a good feature and allows you to create your own play style. Visually its nice could use a tad bit of love, the sounds are pretty solid. \nMy one concern is the price I understand its a indie game and they have bills to pay also but 20$ is a little high.\nId say if a solid player base grows this game would be worth buying.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UJ5XNaAeWWE", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198016485091", "last_played": 1462433945, "num_reviews": 57, "num_games_owned": 306, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1461953841, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500264", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1461953841, "recommendationid": "22708813", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Don't buy it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198072273180", "last_played": 1466329298, "num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_forever": 31}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1470037082, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497103", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1470037082, "recommendationid": "24648025", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
