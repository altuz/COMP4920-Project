It took some time to understand the how the game wanted to be played but my playtime wasnt a very fun or pleasing experience, there was no sense of accomplishment, just figure out the level and move on. In the beginning I pressed 6 a lot to get past the levels I didnt properly undertand the game rules. Game feels flat as bridges doesnt break, bleak graphics ect. It has a few moments.\n\nThis is one special game. Like every other game this game takes time to play. However, I can easily think of 200+ games Id rather spend time with. If this is that special game you are looking to spend time with by all means go ahead.\n\nI think this game would have been more fun if there was destructable bridges, water, machinery and possibly some spells to scare people or make a cave in.\n\nThe game wasnt that bad, it just didnt appeal to me. I want puzzle with colors rather than blood and dirt. I first played 7 minutes and felt it was a waste of time. I later came back to it and played through the first 13 levels. If this was your favorite game I would be suprised and feel uneasy being around you, with that said I would not buy or reccommend this game for a friend. Even if it was cheap I simply think there are so many other games Id rather play.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994770950", "last_played": 1502808209, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_forever": 25}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1502131953, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481737", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1502808795, "recommendationid": "34087462", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
