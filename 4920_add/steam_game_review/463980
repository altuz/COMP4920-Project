I haven't felt this way about a game in I can't even remember how long.  There are a dozen other games I need to get to right now, but I keep jumping back in for one more run.  Before I know it I've clicked away 3 hours of my life, and I don't even care.  Rogue-lite solitaire is something I've never considered, but here we are with one hell of a strategic card game that's much more compelling that it looks on the surface, and is quite possibly my favorite solitaire game ever. \n \nI've never played a rogue-like before.  The prospect of losing my progress upon every death is something I don't think I'll ever find enjoyable, not when my time is valuable.  Solitairica is a rogue-lite game, however.  Your journeys to defeat Emperor Stuck may end in failure, but you'll still gather gems that can be used to level up the different card decks giving you powerful bonuses and extra equipment slots for your next run.  These  may not sound like much, but that lucky boost when you need it most makes all the difference in the world.  You can also purchase continues that allow you to pick up after failed battles.  They're a bit pricey and you need to buy them before you start the encounter, but they're definitely worth it if you're far enough along and worried about bad luck taking you out.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1095639731\nMake no mistake, as with any good solitaire game, luck of the draw is a big aspect of the gameplay.  Finding ways to overcome it with smart ability use is incredibly enjoyable, though.   Even when I fail, I'm determined to make another run because I know that with a little tweaking of my strategy, perhaps a bit of luck on items, and more favorable boss trait combos, I'll make it a step further than I did before.  And if I don't, well those precious gems will never go to waste.\n\nBeing forced to play through several times allows you to experiment with different ability combinations that may not have originally occurred to you.  The store's inventory is random after every battle, so you may never come across the one ability you've based your entire strategy on.  While this may sound frustrating, I cannot tell you how many times I was forced to try an approach I never thought was optimal only to realize how powerful that strategy really is.  There are several strategies for each deck adding flexibility and longevity to the gameplay. \n\nEach of the different playable decks have a hero theme, and it's entertaining how the game conveys the essence of these iconic RPG classes with only the flip of a few cards.  The rogue deck channels the quick strikes and swift movements of the agile class, allowing you to overwhelm your opponents before they have a chance to counter.  Wizards may have weak defenses but their devastating attacks can turn the tide of battle when they need it most.  All of the decks are unique in how they're played which makes mastering each a challenge and a joy.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1091644277\nMy one and only complaint is the RNG on later boss traits.  Certain traits are almost impossible to overcome when rolled together; even the best of luck won't net you a win as the disadvantage is too strong.  Still, this has only happened a handful of times for me, and I've found myself with manageable combos more often than not.  But it can be frustrating to have a good run ruined by something totally out of your control.\n\nThat said, I've already plugged nearly 30 hours into Solitairica and I've only cleared half of the decks.  The amount of entertainment and enjoyment I've received from the $10 I've spent rivals most other games with two to three times the pricetag.  If you love solitaire and enjoy a challenge, then do yourself a favor and grab this gem.  Just know that it's no walk in the park.  You WILL fail...A LOT,  but when you succeed that feeling of accomplishment is like nothing else.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197999732661", "last_played": 1504927138, "num_reviews": 67, "num_games_owned": 2214, "playtime_forever": 3408}, "votes_up": 70, "timestamp_created": 1501371294, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621129", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1501454804, "recommendationid": "33892660", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Solitaire is a difficult game to hold the attention of anyone today, with so many modern games and entertainment options, although it was a good hobby in the Windows 95 era. Thinking of making this card game more interesting and exciting, the developers of Righteous Hammer Games have created [b]Solitairica[/b], a game that brings a new a twisted way of playing Solitaire, as well as being heavily inspired by the puzzle RPG \u2018Puzzle Quest\u2019 and having roguelike elements such as randomization and permanent death.\n\nThe game consists of 18 battles. Whoever succeeds in eliminating the opponent wins. The player is defeated by losing all life, while the computer loses the match when the player manages to eliminate all cards from the table, which are combined in the sequence used in Solitaire (A, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). The interesting thing is that the cards can also do sequence in reverse, so if there is a card 5 on the table, you can combine it with either 4 or 6. \n\nThere are four elements: attack, defense, agility, and willpower, randomized on each card \u2013 and lastly, coin cards that can be used for long term upgrades. When you stack some elements you can cast spells that may change the tide of the battle. The AI can also cast spells, which in this case, make it difficult for the player to combine cards. It takes a good deal of strategy to figure out how to deal with each different situation. It\u2019s important to notice that the tutorial is very well done and helps a lot to learn how to play. Descriptions of each card or spell are also available by hovering the mouse cursor over them.\n\nThe game is very challenging, and if the player loses one battle, it will have to start from the beginning, unless he or she buys a special, expensive item: the Celestial Hourglass, which gives one more try. There are ten decks available - a initial one and nine that can be unlocked. Each one brings different spells and abilities that can be used, and it is possible to acquire new power-ups between each battle.\n\nAll sound effects of Solitairica are very well done, however, there are no songs during the battles, only in their transitions and in the menus. According to the developers, this decision was a design choice, since they believe that the songs would get boring by being played repeatedly for a long time, so it is recommended that you mute the music of the game and listen to your playlist.\n\nAll in all, Solitairica provides a fun and addictive experience for all audiences. Even with its high difficulty, the gameplay is very fluid, addictive and fun \u2013 it\u2019s an excellent choice for both casual and hardcore gamers.\n\n[b]Positives[/b]\n* Easy to learn and play\n* Addictive and fun\n* High replay value and variety\n* Difficult yet fair, and very well balanced\n\n[b]Negative[/b]\n* There are no songs in battles, making the game a little empty if played without your own music", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198064268501", "last_played": 1505841113, "num_reviews": 89, "num_games_owned": 770, "playtime_forever": 2417}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1499861276, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508694", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1502666104, "recommendationid": "33477984", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "An unusual game-concept, but a good take on it.
