If I had paid full retail price, I wouldn't have recommended this game.  However, I do recommend this game at $5 or even $10.  Each mini-game runs smoothly without any errors.  There are power-ups and bonuses that enhance and add variety as you progress (along with added difficulty) and, of course, there are leaderboards.  The main benefit is that you will get a workout (for those who hate to exercise otherwise).  Not all 3 mini-games are of equal value however.  Also, if you have a friend, you can PvP (you probably won't find a game otherwise but add me as friend if you want to PvP). \n Here's my review broken up:\n\n1) Bowshot 9/10.  This is the real gem from the \"arcade saga.\"   A lot of fun.  Very fast action, you have to move around to avoid shots and quickly shoot back and/or powerup your shots.   360 degree moving targets, shooting at you so you have to keep moving, you get the idea, very challening and unlike some reviewer said, the LAB bow mini-game is NOT more fun LOL.  I don't know any other bow game that is this fast paced and makes you move around as much as this with enemies everywhere.  There's prettier graphics on other shooting games, but not one that will make you move as fast and shoot as fast as this.  \n\n2) Smash 7/10.  Very fun, you get a nice workout.  Reminds me of Ripcoil (Oculus) or Holoball.  The graphics aren't as good as Ripcoil, but it has more variety in the gameplay.   I like the small hallway, as it means you can focus more on small movements to return serve.  So it's more about strategy and timing than moving physically fast.\n\n3) Fracture 4/10.  Very much like Boom Ball Kinect (almost exactly the same) or RacketNX (RacketNX is way more fun).  It's hard to control the swing of the bat to make the ball go where you want.  Very frustrating.  Just not too exciting even if it was easier to aim.  You move the least in this game as you mostly just swing (you can summon the ball close to you to hit it)\n\nSo 2 of the 3 games are fun and even the last one is not bad for a change-up.  Definitely buy on a deep sale.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1502051811, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 39}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502085934, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502085934, "recommendationid": "34075529", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Boring game (mini-games in a game).\nVisuals average, music and sounds are bland. Bow shot was pretty exhausting (work out, not a game), not challenging and just boring.\n\nThis also is the first game out of dozens of games that made me hit my controller hard two times. Happened in the gametype \"smash\". Funny eh? The game does not place/keep the player in a safe position so it's only a matter or time. Especially if you don't have a lot of room AND have expensive stuff around you, you better not buy this! I haven't played the 3rd gamemode since I stopped after destroying the controller.\n\nThe game is too expensive anyway. There's many other games that deliver a much better experience for the money.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988365551", "last_played": 1500048921, "num_reviews": 131, "num_games_owned": 693, "playtime_forever": 31}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500052664, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496721", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500052664, "recommendationid": "33540401", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
