I say stratetgic battles as this:\n\n1. In your attack phase, connect as many foes in your 5 slide movement as you can, while keeping a similar combo, such as RED to RED or MAGE to MAGE. Each attack that follows this suit adds to your combo meter, causing the last foes in the chain to take quite a beating if your chain is 3 (2 damage) or at 6 (4 damage). Chaining is the only way to damage bosses. If you wipe out ALL the enemies in a single sweep (in that wave), the next wave appears, but does not get to attack.\n\n2. In your Defense phase, all your enemies gang up on you, and you die. Unless you \"casually cheat\" and quickly memorize where they're about to hit, and dodge out of the way by hitting the correct \"DODGE\" panel(s). They attack in turn, with two moves being shown one after the other. So long as you pay attention (and have preschooler-level mouse moving skills), you'll have little issue with your evades. Every foe of a given type (grunt, heavy, mage, ect.) uses the same attack patterns, making it all the more of a \"DOH\" when you mess up a simple dodge, or forget what panels the archer is about to hit.\n\nOutside of bosses, the most hp something can have is 4 (like you, for example). With a bit of quick thinking, a good 90% of the battles can be dealt with, without taking any risk of being hurt.\n\nFor the LOW, LOW PRICE OF FREE....\n\nWait, why are you still here?
