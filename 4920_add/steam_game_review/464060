Let's get that out of the way asap. Nowadays a good soundtrack for a non-AAA title is almost mandatory, this game has it.\n- Gameplay. In general, the combat is fair and satisfying. It is also balanced greatly around wide variety of skills: normally in such a fast paced game melee weapons would rule compeletely, this is not the case here as building a ranged-focused character is absolutely possible.\n- Atmosphere. The developers managed to deliver a believable (and likeable) world in a difficult genre as cyberpunk. Strolling around Rengkok was actually enjoyable. \n- Difficulty. Ignore modern \"video game journals\" that scream about the game being too difficult. It's not. There's a lot of room for abusing abilities to make your game easier. Just play smart and don't be afraid of dying. Don't forget that sometimes brute force is the easiest way out as well. The \"Hard\" difficulty is recommended for everyone except people who just want to complete the game and move on.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Story. Honestly, it was lackluster for my liking. However, I've enjoyed most of the characters presented, so this is not an indication that the whole writing in game is bad. The plot is simple and predictable and the game sometimes fails to extract requested emotions from me.\n- Restarting at certain arenas/bosses. This grinded on my gears the most in this game. Two or three major battles in the game has to be restarted including the unskippable cutscene beforehand. Sometimes there are cutscenes during boss stages, which you also can't skip and you have to go through them until you defeat the boss. Frustrating, I don't know why it's in the game.\n\nIn general: 8/10, a very solid game, must buy for fans of fast paced action, cyberpunk and collectors of dat karma.\n\n*KILLER COMBO*", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 776, "steamid": "76561198038236873", "last_played": 1507127733, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 145, "playtime_forever": 776}, "votes_up": 68, "timestamp_created": 1506715797, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613460", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506715797, "recommendationid": "35310813", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Selected hard difficulty.

The setting is interesting, the \"glitchy\" effect is really good and in general it just oozes style.\n\nRUINER was definitely in need of a design pass, though. It has all the elements necessary to be great, but they needed to be re-arranged and reworked better.\n\nFirst off, the mid-fight resource management is really damn demanding. Your health and energy are in one corner of the screen. Your ammo/durability are in the other and your dash charges are center-bottom. Keeping track of all of these in a frantic fight is ridiculous, especially because the simple red UI blends with everything else in the game. There definitely should have been a better layout and clearer audio/visual cues so you know when you're hurting for something.\n\nSkills have a lot of unnecessary fluff and you'll quickly learn what the best combo is. There are VERY FEW points where the game expects you to have a specific skill equipped, but other than that, you'll probably stick to shield + stun grenade + dash upgrades. It's along the lines of \"Why would I have a wall I can place, when I can just have an insta-shield that negates damage regardless where I am\". Or \"why would I have a frag grenade that deals damage when I can just disable any number of enemies\". \n\nThis carries over to the weapons as well. Melee is always better, unless you are fighting a very specific boss and then you might want to switch to your ranged weapon. Melee stunlocks and deals more damage than almost any firearm in the game, especially in the first few hours.\n\nIt also feels like the devs knew this? For example, melee interrupts enemies for the majority of the game, but then you get an enemy category that all of a sudden isn't interrupted by melee. That's fine, you can stun grenade them. Well, now we have a \"flaming\" enemy type that is immune to the stun grenade specifically. OK, that's fine, you can still ram them with your shield to stun them? It's a weird progression, but the strategy stays the same: disable, damage, disable, damage, avoid until you have enough energy again, repeat. This is enough to get you S+ rank on almost all fights.\n\nThere are other weird things, like energy costs being relayed to you as numerical costs, but your UI is actual icons? I assume each of the icons is 10 energy/health, but I never know whether I have enough or not to do my thing, so, combined with it being hard to track your health/energy, I just never bother thinking about it.\n\nThe enemy encounters could have been better laid out. Again, all the elements are there, but the waves are uninteresting. You'll have two melee dudes and two gun dudes. OK, that's fine. Now you'll have a wave that's just suicide bombers. Now a wave that's just mines. Now a wave that's a draining device and one big dude. Why not throw in mines/suicide bombers in the mid of more varied waves? Then you can use them as tools against other enemies. There's very little target prioritization going on, because the actual battles aren't mixed up enough.\n\nProbably the two most frustrating moments for me were a boss battle with three health bars for no real reason (and you can just stun-lock him anyway) and that a very late fight has infinite spawns that the game literally teaches you up until then how to disable completely, and then the fight starts and it's like \"nope, they're immune now, sorry\".\n\nSo, yeah, the game is very stylish, I don't regret buying it, but I think it needed one big design and balancing pass to actually capitalize on all its other strong points.\n\nFor reference, I beat the game on Hard difficulty, since it was the \"recommended\" one.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 407, "steamid": "76561198002524261", "last_played": 1506792361, "num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 747, "playtime_forever": 407}, "votes_up": 61, "timestamp_created": 1506898681, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579480", "votes_down": 21, "timestamp_updated": 1506898763, "recommendationid": "35398682", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The best cyberpunk game to come out in years.

I hardly know 'er!\"\n\nI really wanted to like this game.\nThe setting is cool, the visuals are neat, the soundtrack is solid...\n\nBut mechanically this game is a few mistakes away from being a total trash fire.\n\nProbably my biggest gripe is that the gameplay in the trailers makes the game seem like Hotline Miami, in which you're dropped into a level & are free to dispose of enemies as you see fit when you come across them. In actuality, it's quite the other way around- you walk down some form of linear corridor before reaching a slightly more open area that you will inevitably be walled into while enemies spawn in around you & you're forced to survive them in small waves, like some kind of half-arsed top-down Killing Floor.\n\nPast that, certain key mappings are very awkward, & they are all seemingly hard-coded so you cannot remap them to be more convenient.\nMany \"cover\" objects/obstacles in maps are flat-out broken, allowing you/your enemies to press up to them & become completely damage-proof from one side, yet still shoot at enemies in any direction without being impeded whatsoever. I could forgive it if we were talking about thin barricades & walls, but most of the objects I'm referring to are more along the lines of solid rectangular shipping containers.\nGuns are underpowered while a charged melee attack has nearly as much range, far greater & more accurate spread, & doesn't break or run out of ammo while being a one-hit-kill for most enemies; saving you from having to expose yourself long enough to put multiple shots into a gun-wielding enemy & effectively making a majority of guns useless. While I'm sure there are plenty more options that open up to the player the further they progress & upgrade their abilities, for the first few levels that's the single most effective strategy & it makes the gameplay go stale almost instantly.\n\nIn all, it could be a lot worse for the price tag, but the issues I've listed just flat-out make the game frustrating & boring to play.

The variety of skills (that you can respec at any time) make the game more interesting, not just because you are trying out new styles of play, but I found it almost necessary to change to tackle certain bosses (which in turn made me better at the game). There is a really good array of weapons you can use that drop from enemies, a weapon grinder that drops after you beat a level, and weapon lockers that you can hack. To go along with all these weapons, RUINER has plenty of enemy types that will test you in a multiude of ways. \n\nRUINER does however fall short in some places that can't be overlooked. Firstly, I felt the lack of voice acting hurt the story a fair amount and prevented me from really caring about the characters. Without it, the story is still fine, but voice acting could have complemented the relentess action that makes up most of the game. 'Rengkok South' which is essentially a mini hub world that looks great, is limited due to how you interact with NPC's. You can't enter the buildings, you just initiate some dialogue. It's a real shame because from a design perspective, the world that's been created looks brilliant, and by that I mean the best cyberpunk world I've ever seen in a game.  \n\nThe music was also a bit of a mixed bag for me. There are some great tracks, but other parts just didn't do much for me. The sound effects for weapons and guns were all satisfying however, and it majorly enhances the action, while also making enemies easily identifable while off-screen. \n\nTL;DR \n\nLook, if you liked Hotline Miami and/or Hyper Light Drifter, this is right up your alley and you should buy this. It is just worth noting that, yes, the game does look great (no doubt due to being made in UE4) but don't let that fool you. The game is pretty damn hard, and I'm reiterating this for good reason. The price is reasonable, but it doesn't feel like the game has too much to offer in terms of replayability. So, if you're on the fence, I would advise waiting for it to go on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 632, "steamid": "76561198059614369", "last_played": 1506538896, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 140, "playtime_forever": 632}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1506542160, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508263", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506545145, "recommendationid": "35248436", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
