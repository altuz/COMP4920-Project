It's like the devs did not have any creativity at all and simlpy thought to make some easy cash by salvaging tons of common things about phantasy and just see where it gets them. At least you, as a buyer can be certain about what you are getting here - typical phantasy ARPG with linear story and an easy combat system.\nNow on to details:\n\n[b]Gameplay & Story: 3/10 [/b]\nThe story is absolutely linear and obvious since the first intro video. You were born being special and everyone in the main quest line keeps reminding you that the whole world is placed on your shoulders pretty much in every single quest after the tutorial. Whats even worse is that the whole story has been used billion times in other games - betrayal, invasion by demons, big bad guy threatening to destroy everything and you are the only one to stop him. The side quests are nothing but fatch quests having no connection to the main quest at all. During the whole game you will see about 10 differant map layouts and about 10 different type of enemies. Everything else is just being salvaged and re-used. In the whole game I've seen only a single enemy that was not reminding me of exactly the same in other games.\n\n[b]Combat & Challenge : 3/10 [/b]\nAt the start I thought that the combat fun gonna pick itself up when I get more spells and attacks. Sadly, it doesnt. Instead of spamming basic attacks, after skilling higher level spells I started spamming them. The choice is also not huge since you need one single target attack and one AoE to progress through the whole game. Besides that higher level skills in Avencast are mostly just upgraded versions of lower level ones.The only choice that matters is the skill type - melee or ranged, since the influenced by different stats. The AI is simply garbage, even worse than stupid, since it gets stuck a lot of times just trying to reach you. Same for NPCs that follow you in some quests. In battle the monsters simply run at you in a straight line, from time to time dodging to the side but thats kinda it. Even the monsters with shields either un at you or stand still \"blocking\" for 3 seconds and continue running at you again. Avencast offers no challange even at hardest difficulty whatsoever.There are tons of RPGs, especially action RPGs that have innovative or remarkable fighting systems and sadly Avencast doesnt use any ideas from these, neither inventing anything new or creative. \n\n[b]Graphic & Interface : 4/10 [/b]\nThe graphic feels quite aged, its not insanely bad but definetely not up to 2010 release date. A lot of areas dont feel detailed enough, there is no eye candy to get any attention. The characters take some time getting used to, since its a mix of older RPGs and cartoonish graphic style. Some areas have decent immersion with destroyed objects, but besides that sadly nothing worth mentioning. The interface is absolutely simplistic - few slots for items like potions, few slots for spells. A small ribbon bar for icons like character screen and inventory.\n\n[b]Progress & Mini-Games : 5/10 [/b]\nThe progress in Avencast is pretty simple - just follow the main quest markers. Sometimes there is a small detour into the room next to the main room on the map to grab a key item, but besides that its always straight forward. It earns few points here though for having some mini-games that either require some reading, thinking or try & error. Some timing and dodging minis at the end of the game also make the game last a bit longer than simply rushing to kill the endboss asap.\n\n[b]Audio & Immersion : 3/10 [/b]\nI dont even remember, if the game had any music, thats how unremarkable it was. The battle sounds are sounding mostly clunky, no real feedback giving about the impact of the hits. Playing as a ranged character the whole game I was listening to 2 different attack sounds for 12 hours. Since there are barely any differencies between the monsters, their sounds are being reused aswell. The only good immersion with sound feedback was inside the starting room where you could hear background chatting of the crowd with distinguishable words. After that the devs probably decided its not worth the time spending on immersion and sound feedback.\n\n[b]Side-Notes[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]This game is single player only.\n    [*]This game contains no achievements, nor ingame neither steam.\n    [*]This game offers none to minimal replayability. If you played it once, you will most likely never touch this game again, unless in some years you decide to try out the other skill trees.\n    [*]This game is fairly short, took me ~12 hours to finish it completely including all optional quests and exploring all the areas, killing all the enemies.\n    [*]The publisher often offers big price discounts for this game: highest noted was -90%.\n[/list]\n\nI hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game.
