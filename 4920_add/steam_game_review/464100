There is a good variety of units and upgrades that can creates a lot of strategic depth and the first half of the game is incredibly fun.  It all falls apart towards the end when your hero units become so incredibly powerful that there is no reason to ever use the regular units. And in the later levels you have no choice but to use the hero units which completely negates all time and resource investment in your regular units.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004033968", "last_played": 1492367259, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 428, "playtime_forever": 1349}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1502491742, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515524", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1502491742, "recommendationid": "34178653", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
