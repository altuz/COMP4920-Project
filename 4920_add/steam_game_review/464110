The singleplayer co-op, and by that I mean you alternate control between two robots on a splitscreen, works well thanks to thoughtful and clear puzzle layouts allied to very good controls. There's no pixel perfect nonsense or split-second time constraints here. If anything, I'd say the game errs slightly on the easy side, but that's preferable IMO to getting frustrated. Oh, and achievement hunters will be happy to know it's a simple one to complete 100%. There's an achievement for finishing the last level, and 12 for pressing buttons, pulling levers and exploding bombs x number of times. One thing I would like to have seen is an option to toggle off the music, but that's the only real negative I have. Maybe couch coop and even online coop would have given it broader appeal.\n\nOverall it's a fairly solid 7/10 and definitely worth the sub-\u00a35 price tag.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972137781", "last_played": 1486395513, "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 3789, "playtime_forever": 726}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1485167395, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509885", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485167649, "recommendationid": "29440234", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fun puzzler that exercises the same logic-problem-solving part of your brain as Portal.

The puzzles gradually build in difficulty and complexity, and there wasn't a moment where I felt like I was missing a detail about a puzzle mechanic. If I ever felt lost, it was because I wasn't thinking hard enough. And the story was engaging as well, with a fair bit of humor to it. Even the ending was nice, if a bti cheesy.\n\nThere was one annoying little bit around 5/6ths of the way in wherein the fact that the warp places you a few tile-lengths away from the exit meant that you sometimes fell into the plasma below. This tested my patience but, thankfully, this only happened on one puzzle. There was also another weird glitch I observed which would sometimes prevent one bot from walking onto the lift (by having it fall through into the plasma below) when the other bot was on it, but restarting the game seems to fix it for now, so it wasn't as bad.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game.
