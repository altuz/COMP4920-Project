Typically, this would lead me to believe my CPU is the bottleneck... but CPU data is, unfortunately, absent. Test results are better than 99% of the field with an overclocked 5775C @ 4.2GHz and GTX 1080 @ 2.2GHz - due to the eDRAM on the CPU, this makes sense. However, when I enable a 2nd GPU results scale poorly (technically it would be consistent with current VR software if the 2nd GPU isn't used at all... but this senselessly lands somewhere in the middle). In the Blue Room, with a single GTX 1080 @ 2202MHz, I'm barely over 60% of the target framerate and yet the GPU is not being fully taxed. In an attempt to \"future proof\" the Blue Room test, I believe errors have been made resulting in an inaccurate benchmark. \n\nI cannot recommend this product only because it isn't consistent enough to be a benchmark at this point and lacks required details to be a tool applicable to system planning/tweaking. If this were a free upgrade, I would say grab it... and while I don't think it's fair to give a product a poor rating if it does what it claims (which I guess technically this does), I don't think it's worth the cost of entry (even if you are an existing owner of 3DMark). I just don't see a lot of purpose here - that may certainly change with additional modifications to the software.
