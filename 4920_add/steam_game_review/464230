Charming artwork (if you like the style, which I do). \n\nNeither good nor bad: Using WASD/arrow keys to \"tilt\" a board to move droplets around goes from \"simple fun\" to \"amazingly difficult\" very quickly. If you like challenging physics-based puzzles, that part's great. If you like games with lots of easy puzzles so you can enjoy the sense of progress, you're not likely to enjoy this. \n\nTip: After the first few levels - GO SLOW. Tiny little taps move the droplets around; too many too fast will shatter them against walls or objects and you'll never get them to move where you need them. (There's a \"reset level\" button; you can keep trying. But it's going to be frustrating for many players. Action-reflex players will be frustrated at how slow it is; kids--the apparent target demographic--will be frustrated because it's unforgiving of mistakes.)\n\nThe bad parts: I can't get it to run windowed; I've tried several methods. (Lack of ability to run windowed really is what convinced me not to bother playing even when I was in the mood for it.) As others have mentioned, it seems incomplete. There's no story at all, no explanation of why you're doing this \"alchemy\" for the wizard. No sound at all. (Someone else said there's a single music track; apparently it doesn't play on my system.) After a few puzzles to get used to the setting, there's a strong sense of \"why bother?\"... the best thing about it is that ctrl+esc lets it sit in my taskbar and collect cards.\n\n\"No story\" is fine for some physics puzzles... but this one sure looks like it was intended to have some context. \n\nConclusion: I paid 49 cents for this on sale, and don't feel I was cheated - but even at that price, I wouldn't recommend it unless the buyer loved physics-based puzzles AND had time to burn on a slow-paced game AND didn't care that it's just an endless set of tasks with no rewards attached AND doesn't mind the game being full-screen. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198157038404", "last_played": 1467485141, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 266, "playtime_forever": 179}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1465317995, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542210", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1465317995, "recommendationid": "23437827", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "First impression: tilting labyrinth game\n\nThis game is a descendant of the wooden labyrinth where you have to guide a ball through by tilting the surface.
