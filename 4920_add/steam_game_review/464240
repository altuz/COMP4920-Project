No.\n\nTechnical issues too:\nNo way to change display resolution without going back to the main menu.\nDoing so destroys your progress because... you can't save anytime! Darn check points... There are only Autosaves on 1 slot.\nAutomatic text advance during the cutscenes should be banished as well, especially since there is no pause nor backlog and if you didn't have the time to read/were distracted, tough luck.\nYou have to click to advance, keyboard doesn't work.\n\nThe writing is not bad, but there are a few things that irritated me:\nHaving no period at the end of the sentences makes the text look like it's not finished. It's basic grammar, and yet...\nA few typos and spelling errors here and there, especially in chapter 3.\nAnd a consistant misspelling of \"opioid\" that lost an \"i\" every time it's written.\n\nBut the most annoying thing is the quick time choices where you have 1 second to choose between 3 choices. After 1 second, game over. No, no, dev.
