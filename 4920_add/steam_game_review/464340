I had so much hope before starting the 3rd Syberia. I love 1st and 2nd games. 3rd is nothing like the old games. Don't expect a graphical improvement. Infact it may be even worse. Magical world is now gone. Oscar is different. Kate is not the same Kate. Puzzles are too easy. Game is too short. Nothing to discover. Trouble walking up or down the stairs. Glitches. Tasks include running back and forth many many times. Reminds me more of the dullness of a hidden object game. Voice actors are the same but their voices remind me a of a speech bot. Game's original language is Russian so caracters' mouths don't move according to English language. Story is somewhat there. Syberia is still good with first 2 games. 3rd is a dissapointment.

The graphics were lovely and I liked the storyline. It made me kinda sad and happy in the end. The only complaint I would have is the mechanics of movement was kind of clunky. I wish there was better camera angle/movement. Sometimes it was difficult to get the character to move in the direction I wanted to go. Also, it leads you on a certain path and if you do one thing out of the ordinary, you can't go back. Example, I was exploring the abandoned underground station and went one direction down steps and couldn't get back to where I needed to solve one puzzle before I was faced with another puzzle. I also went through a gate before I should have and the game wouldn't let me go back through the gate. I had to quit and reload from my previous save.

When Syberia 3 went on sale i thought iI would take the risk, it was a pretty good discount, and the reviews seemed about average and gave the impression it was a marmite type game, you either loved it or really hated it.\n\nSo I played three hours and, man some people must be really easily pleased, considering this game was released in 2017 it is hard to tell unless you look at the release dat or any copyright information, it looks dated and even on the higherst settings looks really bad.  That isn't to say the Syberia 3 doesn't look nice, it does, just about 8-10 years ago when full priced games (which at RRP of \u00a340 it is) looked like this does.\n\nIn addition to that there is the controls, and menu system, while there doesn't seem a problem witht he keyboard controls as far as I can see using a controller is really bad, yes I understand this is PC gaming and the majority of people use keyboards supposedly, but it feels a little off I mean they are neither fish nor fowl they are just 'MEH'.\n\nOne of my main gripes is the script and acting, it sounds like it was done by people picking up a paycheck with little to no interest or passion in the lines they were reading or understanding of the story they were telling, which honestly is understandable as from what I have read the story seems to be less a feature film and more a badly patched togetr collection of small sketches meant to tell a story but ultimately leaving you baffled by the logic in the writing and just how bad the writing is.  \n\nAs I say for me the controls are an issue, but worst of all are t he camera angles when you move it feels like you are waiting to see where they will be pointing when you stop I mean it's at times ridiculous out low or far back or completly off center the camera angle is when you have barely moved and there are seemingly no onject to block a direct view of the character.\n\nThe fact I got three copyright claims for a three hour walkthrough video I posted online doesn't really help this game either, not that it wasn't going to be anything but a thumbs down review considering how bad the cap from top to bottom is.  The only reason I run adverts is in the hope I can hopefully make enough to  improve my set-up and be able to provide a better quality service to the few viewers I have and to the developers when I try to showcase their games which is what I try to do (no fancy graphics or talking heads just the game and where possible even the music when it's popular music, rather than being music made for the game being copyrighted) the claimant is the composer of the game, so thanks for that really appreciate the fact I am having to remove parts of the soundtrack of my video to show what the game is like because someone involved with the game is so desperate for the money, or maybe they are doing it to stop the music being heard idk.\n\nThere is one good thing about Syberia 3 I guess, I mean it is so bad that I doubt anyone would want to pirate it so I suppose it has that going for it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057258664", "last_played": 1504657996, "num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 297, "playtime_forever": 180}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1504667832, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503328", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1504667832, "recommendationid": "34768757", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Despite the many negatve reviews of this game I went ahead and purchased it when it went on sale as I enjoyed the first two games in the series.\nI must admit that the PC controls took a little bit to get used to, but once mastered after using a few of the help articles,this is a gorgeous game with interesting video additions.\nIt reminds me of the TinTin adventure comics which as a young boy I found both thrilling and absorbing.\nIt's a game that can be savoured and not hurried from talking to all the people in a scene to exploring the different scenarious the game leads you into.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 571, "steamid": "76561198000984603", "last_played": 1506675022, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_forever": 852}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505806161, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505806161, "recommendationid": "35059620", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "While this game was barely playable at launch, they've made a lot of patches that deal with all the major issues and replaced the awful control scheme with a far better point and click one. With the improvements, I can definitely recommend it to those who played the first two Syberia games. It's like those games but much larger and a few of the old issues are ironed out (like the constant going up and down stairs).\n\nThat said, you should be warned about a few things.\n\n-Awkward Camera Angles: The original control scheme was built with consoles in mind, so some camera angles don't work particularly well with point and click controls. You can still move with arrow keys ...buuuuut that takes forever on even just middle graphical settings due to ridiculous input lag with that method.\n\n-Loading Issues: Even on the lowest graphical settings, expect some long loading times. There are also bugs at a few points that have a lot of NPCs in the area that causes the game to be stuck in transition from in-game graphics cutscene to gameplay. I encountered it twice, lowering to low settings overcame the issue.\n\n-Cliffhanger Ending: This game took over a decade to make and they gave it a sequel hook ending. Based on the sales and reception this game has gotten, don't expect any resolution coming.\n\nThis game definitely has a lot of problems from development hell, but I'm glad I finished it all the same. Sokal's writing is still as strong as ever, and there's some truly beautiful moments to be found. It's a mess of a game, but then again, the other two kind of were as well.\n\nVery light recommendation, and only for those who played the first two.
