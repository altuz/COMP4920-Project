I said okay, if they could make it, I can do it. The sad truth is no, I actually can't do it. I would LOVE to be able to play this game, but after 2 hours (and earlier some more at the Tutorial) I'm still struggling to even create a Spawn, not to mention order them to do something. If I write a ~20 line command, it definitely has some errors I cannot catch, so the game becomes a boring CTRL+C and CTRL+V computing on the long run. This game is FANTASTIC (watch some people who can play it and you'll belive), but definitely not created for my kind. I'm sorry, there's a lot of work in it, but even playing the tutorial multiple times doesn't help me understand what's going on.\n\nPeace!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 95, "steamid": "76561198034561823", "last_played": 1506880841, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_forever": 95}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1506887332, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1507015890, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505598", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1506887332, "developer_response": "Thank you for your feedback.\n\nIndeed, the game is not designed for people without any coding skills, and it doesn't teach you coding in general, or JavaScript specifically.

I know of several people interested in the game but it's just too expensive for the kind of game it is.\nIf it cost a third, people might think about it.\n\nMy thumbs up means the following: Try the game in tutorial and simulation mode (even if you're not a programmer, but interested).
