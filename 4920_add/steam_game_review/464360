Star control, space Quest, Star Trek the 25th-anniversary game and many others would keep me and my pals awake till odd hours of the night.  Trying to complete these games in record time, or with better scores, or just figure them out in the first place.  For a long time, I've had the itch to relive that kind of gaming experience. \n\n3030 Deathwar Redux manages to scratch that itch in a very novel way.   Without the constraints of being too \"realistic\" or \"edgy\" or \"simulator\" oriented, the devs are able to tell a story free from the shackles of having to EXPLAIN the science of it all, while at the same time, reference countless sci fi genre tropes with blatantly in your face easter eggs. \n\nFor anyone who has played and loved Games like Star Control or especially Space Quest, you will instantly appreciate this. \n\nI have only had a short time with the game, and I can already see myself enjoying the open world space exploration and combat, and the humorous story and dialogue are right up my alley keeping it fresh and fun. \n\nIt doesn't hold your hand too much, you have to figure a few things out as you go, but it does a fair job of guiding you to learning the ropes as you play.  Gently suggesting at the next reasonable course of action to get yourself back on track ASAP. \n\nIt's not a perfect game by any means, and if you aren't into the brand of humor and gameplay it uses to tell it's a story you might not care for it at all.  If all you care about are high rez 3d computer crushing graphics, super easy linear shooters or anything like that, you probably won't want this game. However, had this come out in the 80s or 90s, it would have been a classic that would have shaped a generation of gamers perception of how to do a space sci fi game for the next decade.  \n\nIf you still have a soft spot for the old classics like the ones I mentioned at the start, you need grab this game and make a nice hot Tea and sit down on a rainy day and give this a whirl.
