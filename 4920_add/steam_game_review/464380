Best of Us has some fun moments, but it's overall a very mediocre game.  Especially when compared to some of the other offerings from Choice of Games and their Hosted Games.  If you're really bored and are not expecting a character driven masterpiece, you can get a fun couple hours out of this.  As usual, I suggest playing through the demo several times before buying.\n\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n\nModern day/real world setting.  No need to learn an entire pantheon of alien gods or to read a thousand year backstory, we already understand where the story is set.\n\nA Minor Spoiler:  [spoiler]While there are some unanswered questions, there are no major cliff hangers at the ending.  This is a pro to me, anyway.[/spoiler]\n\n\n[b]Other:[/b]\n\nThis game is a relatively short one, my first playthrough took me about 2 hours.  More on that below.\n\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n\nA fairly large cast and a shorter game length means that none of the NPCs get much character development, if any.  I think the author could have improved the story a lot by removing a few of the characters entirely so as to spend more time developing the ones that are really important to the plot.  Or just by making the game slightly longer to give each of them more time to develop.\n\nToo many fluff/window dressing choices, too few meaningful ones.  This game doesn't seem to be setting itself up for a sequel, given the lack of a save option at the end, so why can't I mess around more?  With the level detail in the description of the superpowers I was really disappointed by the lack of any real changes they made.  Ultravision gave me one extra paragraph of redundant information in one scene, and I didn't notice infravision give me any new information [i]at all[/i].  The description of flight mentions that you won't be able to go over Mach 1 without the durability power... but you never get to do that even if you do take it anyway!  Perhaps it made a few lines of difference somewhere that my eyes glazed over, but it didn't let me keep up with the speedster opponents I fought.  Also, the major 'pick a side' choice later on is not presented well at all.  One of the sides I don't see any logical reason to pick, making the other my default choice regardless of anything else.\n\nI normally prefer my choose-your-own-adventures to be 'wide' -giving the player more freedom- rather than long.  The longer an RPG goes on the more likely you are to notice the rails and have your illusion of choice broken I think, and if a sequel is planned then the first game has to accommodate for that.  Also the more freedom the player has then the more work the author has over time.  So, short and wide is my preference and what I was hoping Best of Us would be.  Sadly, it's actually short and [i]narrow[/i].", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197973810597", "last_played": 1461514727, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 135, "playtime_forever": 193}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1461360310, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514183", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1461520247, "recommendationid": "22575354", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game was a bit disappointing to be honest.

While not as polished as the author's former work, Best of Us does serve to entertain albeit not for too long. While it does create the feel of emerging superhumans trying to figure out their place in the world, it divides its cast too early. You hardly get to know the Superman and Batman pastiches before they force you to choose a side. Having played both sides I have to say that the leader of the \"Freedom\" faction is a lot less scummy that the obviously evil politician heading the \"order\" faction. \n\nThe fact that the first thing the \"order\" faction does is incarcerate even those superhumans who willingly stood down, in effect criminalizing those superhumans who tried to stick to the straight and narrow, robs Aurora of much of her argument. The game presents her as someone who is too idealistic and as someone who blindly trusts the authorities to do the right thing. Since the superhumans are already in jail for the crime of having powers (something that should have broken the US constitution into little itty-bitty pieces) at what point exactly would she realize the forces she has aligned herself with are not even remotely benevolent? When they break out the Zyklon-B? When they hire a modern Dr Mengele? When they start digging mass graves? How about when they give her a new snazzy costume by Versace with jackboots and an iron cross? \n\nOne the flip side, the \"freedom\" faction's leader is friendly, flirtatious and plans a jailbreak for incarcerated superhumans. The end game of the \"freedom\" faction is exposing the crimes of a corrupt politician. No huge anarchic break down of social order, in fact it is shown that the more sinister actions by members of that faction were due to fanatics acting out on their own once their leader got caught. So while they do attack both Federal and private property, both were essentially surgical strikes to expose an enemy. Effectively being on the \"order\" side is a lot more morally shady that otherwise. The moral greyness is less two shades of grey as off-white and slate. If you were looking for a complex moral dilemma, look elsewhere.\n\nOverall, it would give this a recommendation for its setting and the fun to be had.
