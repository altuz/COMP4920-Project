And if you do not like the genre of turn-based strategy you should definitely keep your hands off. This said, there is one use case that made it really worth the few cents I have paid for it: play by e-mail (and hotseat)!\n\nThe rules are simple enough to quickly recruit a friend for playing it. Within its simplicity, the gameplay is outstandingly well balanced. There is very little chance involved. And graphics and sound are surprisingly good to give you some satisfaction when you see your friend being blasted ;-)\n\nApart from this niche, the game has not much to offer. The computer opponent (AI) sucks big time, unless you like winning without a challenge. The campaign is very childish and ridiculous. And I do not understand why they put the game on a square grid instead of a hexagonal one as it is approved for by many other games of this type.\n\nStill, I do not regret my buying as it gave me hours of fun with friends and a few nice challenges in e-mail games. It is one of the few simple turn-based strategy games available."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1494987241, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31797747", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198023717534", "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1372130953, "num_games_owned": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 31}, "timestamp_updated": 1494987241, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Barely works.
