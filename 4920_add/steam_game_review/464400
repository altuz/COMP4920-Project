The music and overall ambience is relaxed, making this a nice end-of-a-long-day kind of game. The controls and feel of the puzzles is great, though I'm not a huge fan of the trigger for teleport.

The premise is simple, get a cute ball from one end of an obstacle course to the other using a limited set of pieces and a limited number of attempts at trial and error along the way.\n\nWhat sets Bounce apart from a lot of tepid VR puzzlers is that it takes full advantage of all three dimensions. The ball usually starts in the ceiling, and you have a limited amount of momentum to get it quite some distance to a target that could also be up in the ceiling, or behind numerous baffles, or only after finding a way to get through several hoops between start and finish.\n\nBounce earns distinction not only for the puzzles, but its soundtrack as well. The audio is enjoyable (except for the sad, sad sound of D1G-B hitting a bulkhead - and even that's amusing). The graphics are up to snuff and the game looks polished and professional.\n\nIf I have a disappointment with the game, it's that it doesn't tell you what \"par\" is for each course. Figuring out that style doesn't matter (in the first go-round) only the number of times you test your pathway for D1G-B was both mildly frustrating and a minor let down.\n\nAll in all, if you enjoy puzzle games, Bounce is a great one to buy.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198020135537", "last_played": 1491976793, "num_reviews": 32, "num_games_owned": 96, "playtime_forever": 53}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1491978681, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498218", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1491978681, "recommendationid": "31091999", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
