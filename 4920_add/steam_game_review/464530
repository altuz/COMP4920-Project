It has a simple premise and isn't hard to play at all. For what it is, its not a bad game at all but is definitely not an award winner.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is relatively simple. Your goal on each stage is to get to the exit at the opposite side of the screen opposed to where you started. All the while you have to avoid death via cliffs, water, spikes, blobby lava guys, falling meatballs, etc. To achieve this all you really do is run and jump while waiting for the correct time to do both. There are also gems you can collect that give you score but they don't do anything and might as well not be in the game. You start out with nine lives but their doesn't seem to be a way to earn more which is made worse by the fact that you can't save and that every game over means you need to restart the entire game. Other than that though the game is pretty fun.\n\nOverall Score for Gameplay: 7/10\n\nGraphics: The graphics are simple and cute looking. There are some nice backgrounds and the characters and foreground are pretty detailed. The effects in the game such as the meteor animations look pretty nice too. \n\nOverall Score for Graphics: 8/10\n\nSoundtrack: There's only two tracks in the entire game, the title theme, and the one that plays during the actual game. There alright sounding but get annoying to listen to pretty fast.\n\nOverall Score for Soundtrack: 5/10\n\nSound: The sound is pretty minimal and that's okay in a game like this. There's a jumping sound effect, cannon sound effect, death sound effects, etc. It gets the the job done and makes the game feel like a classic SNES or Sega game.\n\nOverall Score for Sound: 8/10\n\nThis game is alright, there are certainly better games like it, but it's not bad. The one glaring issue is the lack of saving which makes playing a hassle and repetitive but it's still a fun game. With just a few changes however, it could really be something special. For $0.99 though, how could one reasonably argue?\n\nOverall Score for Game: 7.0/10\n\nIf you have any questions about the game, comment on this review.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198320546773", "last_played": 1494137821, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 120, "playtime_forever": 62}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1497886165, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508490", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498548264, "recommendationid": "32568095", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So does this game actually have an end to it or does it just keep going? lol", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043938050", "last_played": 1497761222, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 210, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1494151885, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499928", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1494151885, "recommendationid": "31600756", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Woooooo! This will go over well.\n\nThis is a short game from what I can tell, hard to really say without beating the boss, but presumption would make me believe this is the end. It takes around 10 minutes usually, depending on how long the meteors decide to be obnoxious walls of wait time. \n\nThe platforming is pretty easy for the most part, with one shot attempt layouts and trap rooms, where if you try to examine the room and don't immediately know what to do, will require you to suicide. Besides that, replays of the game will find most of it to be easy.\n\nThe thing that complicates it would be the meteors. They are completely random. They tend to be pretty pointless for the most part, either doing absolutely nothing to you or causing you to just stand there, waiting for you to be lulled into a sleep so they can ambush you! Worst thing they can do is basically cause you to be trapped into a death status. Just went off that one time block up somewhere that takes about 10 seconds to complete? Well, the game spawned a slow moving fireball, either crash down below and possibly live to suicide, or die by fire. Pick wisely, a man chooses, a slave obeys!\n\nThe boss is just horrible. Even getting to it with 9 lives, it didn't help. One of my attempts went pretty well, considering the bs  that the boss is, landing 4 hits. Didn't die, fell into the water. Didn't even get close after. First issue would be how you hit the boss. You are required to hit the boss in the head, with a slow moving dropping platform, that requires you to make a falling platform jump. If you don't get as far as you possibly can, you'll slam into the structure, then most likely die. Even when you get the area you need to be at down, the meteors will just block the shit out of you, preventing you from even attempting a hit. The bosses square hitbox isn't helping any either. This also has a glitch where the falling block doesn't respawn.\n\nAdded at the end of the video when continuing that prevents you from leaving the first screen, gotta restart to fix. \n\nMost people don't seem to really be going much of anywhere from the videos here, so that doesn't help much on that front. It's not even really the dollar that is the issue, it just really isn't worth the general time investment to actually beat it. Go get a candy bar or something, at least that'll taste good. \n\nI also happened to run across a weird glitch when using the controller. It would either work fine with the directional input, or would just stop working all together after restarting it, forcing me to use the analog stick.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVaBxAUad78&t=25s\n\nOne change would really help out alot in this even with all the meteor wall bs and such. Make the whole model able to be hit. Then you don't need the perfect moment to land the hit, making everything else less of a obnoxious design. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197966489900", "last_played": 1492883995, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 1259, "playtime_forever": 158}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1492889556, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495390", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1492889556, "recommendationid": "31304171", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Cat Meat: A cute game that makes you truly understand, how irrationally angry pixels can make you.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994050696", "last_played": 1492801830, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 312, "playtime_forever": 66}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1492798575, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498448", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1492798575, "recommendationid": "31280557", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "You have nine lives and that is it.
