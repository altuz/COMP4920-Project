It's quite good & is definitely worth the price as the developer worked hard sorting out bugs & imbalances. I personally never played the Dungeon Warrior Monsters series of games that are a big influence for this & the first Siralim. I was drawn to these two games from a post on reddit when the first game was only a demo. I played & enjoyed the first game & was thrilled to hear the developer was making a sequel that built off the first. \n\nThis game is all about exploring the different realms (dungeons) & extracting cores from all the different monsters you come across to either spawn them as they are for use in your team or breeding. Breeding is awesome because it allows you to get stronger versions of the monster or cross breeding them with other monster types to get something new. All your monsters can be equipped to cast spells & can also carry artifacts that increase stats or give other attributes.\n\nIf you've played the Dungeon Warrior Monsters series & enjoyed that or the Pokemon series then give this a go. It takes things from games that introduced ideas & adds to them. The repeatability is endless as you can try different team builds each time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "steamid": "76561198036795107", "last_played": 1506988188, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 87, "playtime_forever": 611}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1500153272, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483286", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500153272, "recommendationid": "33569032", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Just perfect.

I'm majorly impressed by Siralim 2!\n\nI used to play Dragon Warrior Monsters when I was young and have been searching for a game like it in recent years.  This game ticks all of the boxes for me.  \n\n-Monster Breeding (very similar to DWM, you get a more powerful monster based on the parents type and stats)\n-Fun Dungeons (useful loot everywhere and objectives for each one, the diety system is brilliant and engaging)\n-Buffs and Debuffs Matter (contrary to some reviews, this is NOT a press E to win game, it takes careful thought and planning with monsters inherent abilities and the many spells and weapon effects to achieve that kind of gameplay)\n-Resource System (meaningful loot and gather system allows you to improve every aspect of your gameplay without feeling grindy)\n-Fantastic Soundtrack (usually i play games with a YouTube video or music playlist but not with this title)\n-Solid Progression (some of the fights at first seem unfair but when you think about what the game has given you, you can find some fun and diverse ways to overcome those obstacles.  I think their purpose is to push your own limits in the game and not just mash E.  Critical thinking is big here)\n-Excellent Performance (no framerate issues, bugs, glitches that I've seen so far)\n-Excellent Developer (no bs here, they made a great game and are selling just that, no microtransactions, great customer support, great website FAQ, and interaction all around)\n\nTLDR: \nFantastic game that brings all of the Dragon Quest Monsters nostalgia and more!  The developer deserves a ton of credit for making an honest good game that's too overlooked in a sea of steam microtransactions, asset flips, and hot garbage.\n\nSiralim 2 has restored my faith in modern game developers!  I look forward to many more hours of Siralim 2!\n\nEdit: \nThere is a minor microtransaction service in the game, but from what I can tell it is purely cosmetic.\n\nI did have a bug that deleted some of my spell gems, one of which was key to my strategy (highest speed creature lost his all enemy curse gem D: it's okay though, I found new strategies to continue on)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198092633554", "last_played": 1503093636, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 148, "playtime_forever": 1249}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501656221, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492334", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501752909, "recommendationid": "33965032", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Monster fighting game that throws in RNG artifacts, spell/skills, opening up the potential for mad synergy.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017127434", "last_played": 1502476361, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 166, "playtime_forever": 3995}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501521073, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500567", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501521073, "recommendationid": "33931613", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Solid game, and it's worth checking out the new game from Thylacine Studios, it looks like it'll be great.\n\nGood price (and it does go on sale), and it's nice to have a game like this available on steam.\nIt's like Dragon Warrior Monsters, but with less hassle and more features (and deeper team synergies possible).\n\nMy favourite moment was when I got my Mana Vortex creature to start multi-casting spells, it would cast so many spells in a row that I lost track of why it was able to cast that many.\n\nThanks for your time", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198076132181", "last_played": 1505190580, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 93, "playtime_forever": 8638}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500619318, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503181", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500619318, "recommendationid": "33689956", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Loved Pokemon and DQM but this game? ...\n\nFor one the pacing is a bit fucked.\nThe game has tons of content (wich is good) but all the options are there from the beginning (it tells you you cant use it until later) and it just feels overwhelming and not in a good way. \n\nCouple that with some bosses that require you to finetune your team before you even have all the options available (fucking king andrick) and i lost interest quite fast. \n\nWho knows maybe ill pick it up again later but for now im done with it", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "steamid": "76561198048832551", "last_played": 1506716623, "num_reviews": 81, "num_games_owned": 838, "playtime_forever": 230}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1500660499, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479315", "votes_down": 14, "timestamp_updated": 1500660499, "recommendationid": "33702333", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
