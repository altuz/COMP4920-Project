The music is catchy and the platforming is tight, with enough to keep it constantly interesting. It also features a host of cameos of characters from other games who are playable (although sadly they offer no real gameplay differences). Also the little quips the game gives whenever you die can be outright hilarious. \n\n Definitely worth your purchase.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198023175868", "last_played": 1501409602, "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 165, "playtime_forever": 180}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1501409146, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507202", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501409574, "recommendationid": "33901249", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "this is quite possibly the most underrated game on steam,  Extremley alot of fun and alot better than speedrunners", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198124415282", "last_played": 1501380601, "num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 106, "playtime_forever": 129}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1501285647, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504451", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1501285647, "recommendationid": "33868412", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
