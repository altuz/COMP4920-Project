Most core features are all there, but everything is simplified. You could call it streamlined, if you want to give it a more positive spin. \n\nThe elephant in the room is Masters of Orion 2, to which everybody compares SIS and rightly so. SIS does not offer much improvement or any game changing ideas to the grandfather of space 4X. But on the other hand, there is a reason why MOO2 is considred one of the best 4X games ever made, and as clones go SIS, is one of the best.\n\nThe biggest weakness of SIS, in my opinion, is the AI. While tactical battle AI is OKish, the strategic AI is just not up to modern standards and prone to very poor decission making. \n\nStill, SIS offers a enjoyable, slightly more casual 4X experience. It is definitely recommendable, especially during any steam sale. \n\nPS:  The DEVs seem to be quite friendly and respond frequently to questions and requests in the (steam) forums. I'll gladly support anyone with that attitude,", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1168, "steamid": "76561198006991494", "last_played": 1506480341, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 235, "playtime_forever": 3439}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506583355, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500217", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506583525, "recommendationid": "35256443", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
