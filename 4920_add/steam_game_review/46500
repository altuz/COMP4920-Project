But which part outweighs which is the real question. Well, let's break it down.\n\nYou play as an American lawyer Kate Walker who's on a trip to a fictional village in France to sign a contract for a toy factory takeover. Unfortunately, its current owner passes away and there's only one person left in the family to give her the signature. However, their whereabouts are unknown and so Kate's journey across Central and Easter Europe starts. \n\nGoing further into the plot would reveal major spoilers so I'll leave it at that. The locations in the game are built around the steampunk aesthetic and come with a huge attention to detail. Highly immersive ambience and a beautiful soundtrack. As you traverse the areas, you stumble upon several characters, documents and of course occasional puzzles that progress the story. Nothing groundbreaking about the dialogue and not only do you have to read A LOT, you also have to memorize certain bits as they hold clues to some of the puzzles. For someone who loves to read, this isn't a minus but it does extend the playtime artificially. The game ends abruptly with a cliffhanger and leaves just enough room for a sequel. \n\nNow, since this is an interactive adventure and not just a movie, I have to address it's problems in that department. First of all, the pacing. It really puts your patience to the test, running between interest points takes forever...and you will hate the stairs here. Absolutely everything takes too long to execute. There is another game made by the same developer, Still Life, which shares some similarities with Syberia, except that it never felt like a drag. This is a huge deal and I don't need to explain how awful it becomes when you get lost or just can't find the next clue. Speaking of, the puzzles range from simplistic \"use the items you found along your path\" to frustrating \"how in hell would you figure that out\". As stated earlier, the solution is sometimes to be attained from the found documents, but you never really know when you make use of it. Which again leads to thinking whether you could have missed something when in fact it's right there in your inventory. Another issue I didn't have to deal with in Still Life. \n\nAll things considered, if you are up to experience a memorable narrative taking its painfully dull and slow progress into account, this might be a good pick for you."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505701962, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497668", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35037365", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198030245310", "num_reviews": 40, "last_played": 1390543553, "num_games_owned": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 42}, "timestamp_updated": 1505701962, "received_for_free": true, "review": "I just couldn't get into it.
