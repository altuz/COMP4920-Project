Im going to edit my review to be more helpful on how to improve this game. Still love it though.\n\nCombat:\n*Gain 50-ish% more XP from combat. Honestly getting to level 100 in this game will take a loooong time without all the XP upgrades and a buff to it.\n*Add an option to remove the cursor in combat and fire with a mouse. I say \"remove the cursor\" because it gives you an idea of how on target the enemy ship is.\n*Fix the cloaking device, A.I. ships will still try to fly away from you when cloaked, they just wont shoot you.\n\nHarvesting Planets:\n*Add back Temperature, Hostility, and I think Atmosphere, however, make them affect your sucess rate when harvesting. For example, a Hostile, Hot, and Thick Atmosphered planet would have a relatively low change of success.\n*Add a range of success, I.E. it tells you that you have a 40-60% chance of sucess, if you could randomly generate it of course. Other stick with a single percentage.\n*Change sucess rate to not go down drastically, but still have them go down.\n\nFor Example.\n1st Scan: 50-55%\n2nd Scan: 47-53%\n3rd Scan: 45-52%\netc...\n\n*Allow rarer items to be found on Terrestrial Planets\n*Allow Starships to be found on Terrestrial Planets, however, give them a low chance of being recovered.\n\nShops, Trading, and Prices.\n*Increase prices of ships by 5-10%\n*Sell items for 90% of the price they can be bought for.\n*Sell ships for 75% of the price they can be bought for.\n\nLevel Tree:\n*Add a short branch \"Reduce the restock time of items in the shop\"\n\nUpgrade 1: Reduce restock time by 10%\nUpgrade 2: Reduce restock time by 10%\nUpgrade 3: Reduce restock time by 30%\n\nThats all i can think of adding. If you feel these updates shouldnt be added, then please just update the game so that you do not need to grind as much.

I had the mobile version years ago and I put easily 200+ hours into this game. But, I really think there needs to be lots of pacing changes that need to be made. I think  the difficulty should be greatly reduced near the home star base, the amount of exp gained after a battle should be increased or the amount of exp needed to level up be decreased, and please please please stop trying to make everything balanced. Balance is no fun in a single player game, it should always be in favor of the player, especially when it\u2019s 5 to 1. \n\nThank you for your time,\nOutlandly", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "steamid": "76561198314454160", "last_played": 1506695972, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 20, "playtime_forever": 928}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1498613112, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498222", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498613112, "recommendationid": "32902951", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
