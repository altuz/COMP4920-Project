With decent controls and lots of ship customization options, this is a great game to have.  I recommend this game to those that are interested.\n\nThe game plays like a standard shoot-em-up, move around and shoot.  What differs is that this game has skill slots where you get to use different abilities at the cost of cooldowns.  There are 9 slots as of now and as you play the game you may unlock more and equip them. \n\nThere is a campaign, which has missions you need to complete.  It is not all linear though, you are free to complete as many side missions as you want which consists of \"defeat X number of enemies\" and at the end you can earn money, ship parts, or xp.\n \nThe other differences are the enemy encounters, you don't fight hordes of enemies, there will be  a much smaller amount like 1-5 depending on the enemy ship type.  Battles feel more \"tactical\", as in you have to dodge enemy attacks, counter attack, and defend.  This gives a feeling of accomplishment and that you earned your victory.\n\n\nThere is also ship customization which I feel is the bread and butter of this game, it is fantastic.  As you play the game you find ship parts that you can use to build and customize your own ship.  You can make it look like anything you want to.  Ship parts also have randomized stats on them that can either boost your damage, defense, or others, this gives the game a lot of replayablity.\n\n\nA gripe I have is the current movement system.  It is a bit \"Jerky\" and doesn't feel to smooth.  But this is minor and is subject to change in future updates.\n\nFrom a hours to price ratio, you will definietly get your money's worth, or at least break even.  Enjoyable game with loot and ship customizing, can't really go wrong.

Upgrading your ship's modules and weapons has enough depth to serve the greater purpose of the game without being overwrought or limiting. In fact, major credit to the developers for allowing the player to downgrade a previously upgraded weapon and assign the upgrade points to a different weapon at no penalty. This flexibility really encourages the player to try various play styles and strategies mission to mission, which really keeps things fresh. \n\n          As for the main course, the shooting is satisfying, the controls are sublime, and the enemies are nicely varied in both attack and defense. Visually, the user interface and menus are well done and easy to navigate. While the in-game graphics may lack a lot of flash, the minimalist kind of look works well here in spite of the abundance of brown.
