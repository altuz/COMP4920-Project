I had a menu straight up freeze on the overlay and it wouldn't go away, about how to insert upgrades. So not being able to clear this error or see the menu itself I didn't bother to use the upgrade system yet, and the overall UI / menu navigation of the game could use a redux. The game also crashed on me a few times as I was clicking around rapidly in options, but once the game itself was running I never ran into any other crashes or issues with its performance. \n\nThese issues could be resolved in future patches, as the game is still in early access as of May 2017. The developer(s?) seem to care about the product, however, as they have bothered to make cutscenes during the game and presented a \"full game\" despite its budget and scale, so I would hope they release a future patch / update of some kind as what is present is cool.  \n\nFor its cost and what the game offers I think it presents itself really well if you're looking for something with some violent edge, cool guitar riffs, and a distinct visual style. I'm happy with having purchased it, though I also view the game as being very simplistic in its user interaction, more akin to old arcade games.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "last_played": 1501207511, "num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 800, "playtime_forever": 41}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1495924904, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507067", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1495924904, "recommendationid": "32007066", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
