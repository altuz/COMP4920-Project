If you like thinking about what you are doing and how you can do it better, this is a great game.  If you just want to shoot stuff and dodge bullets though, this game is hard to recommend.\n\nMany of the attack waves don't really do much, or have hard to reach hit boxes that don't make sense just shooting at normally.  Instead, look at your ships attack type and how it gets bonuses, and how you can maximize each wave.  There's a way to kill even the trickiest of enemies, and there's likely a different way to do it \"well\".\n\nExzeal has five ships to try out and they all play differently and have different solutions to the game's many puzzles.  The XII Stag ship in particular is a nice addition for those who are familiar with it, and burning up enemies with your exhaust never gets old.  Note: to play the hidden fifth ship, select type 3 with exactly 13 seconds left on the timer.\n\nThe biggest downside to this game is, oddly enough, hand fatigue.  Two of the ships have a charge up mechanic, which can be sped up by rapidly rotating your joystick / thumb pad / keyboard fingers.  The XII Stag ship has an auto-rotate button, however the others do not (this would have been a great addition).  It's not as bad as Psyvariar games, but I definitely feel the burn after longer play sessions.  I can just envision an arcade owner getting frustrated as players wear out the joysticks every week from spinning circles non-stop, hehe.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976755967", "last_played": 1473732377, "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 489, "playtime_forever": 188}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1473702912, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1473702912, "recommendationid": "25482249", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
