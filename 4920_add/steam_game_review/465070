Most definitely bullet hell and does a pretty good job with it too. Looks and plays great on my ultrawide, scaling is perfect, huge plus in my books. This one may only be 720P, but it does a really nice job of it. The graphics and game style reminds me so much of Raystorm for the PS1 or Raiden III, for myself, thats nice trip down memory lane. Very interesting concept of being able to choose your shot style, lasers, wide bullets or guided missiles, with just a press of a button. But like all shmups like this one, you still have to pick up powerups to level up your shot. Its not ground breaking, but its got good value if you love shmups, well worth the asking price.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197987999692", "last_played": 1468115482, "num_reviews": 200, "num_games_owned": 1532, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1468125650, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513443", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1468125650, "recommendationid": "24223335", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a great game that should please most fans of the genre.  The game appears simple on the surface but there is lots of depth that slowly reveals itself upon repeated plays.  The power up system allows for lots of customization and the stages offer branching paths that open up harder routes for good players.

I'm pleased to say it plays nice and smooth on PC, and although the graphics were never really designed with higher resolutions in mind, they are crisp and clear so visibility isn't an issue.\n\nI'll be honest, Trizeal doesn't make the best first impression.  As with all Triangle Service games, the first level is more of a tutorial on the scoring system and not much interesting happens.  And yeah, even 10 years ago it wasn't exactly the prettiest shooter on the block.\n\nGet to stage 3 though and things heat up quite a bit.  By the time you get to the ending, you'll confront some interesting puzzles to work out.  Pay attention to your weapons and how to use them, and the correct path will appear.  Good luck!\n\nThe scoring system is based around medal chaining, however done mostly in short bursts of opportunity than a full-game run of perfection.  Nothing too over the top here.\n\nThe Powerup system is pretty great once you figure out how the mix and matching works.  When switching weapons, pay attention to how many items you've grabbed with that primary weapon, and how it becomes universal once you collected enough.  Experiment a bit and it'll become clear.\n\nI'll recommend this game to players who want to spend some time learning and conquering the game.  For players that just want to load up a new game and blast stuff with instant gratification, honestly this is probably not the best game to get.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976755967", "last_played": 1480140090, "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 489, "playtime_forever": 319}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1472979941, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1472979941, "recommendationid": "25341831", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very nice game ! it would be nice although to be able to customize / select another background, even to disable it to have a 100% black background because this one doesnt look very good (too dark and not very interresting).
