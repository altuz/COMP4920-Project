Very shallow and flat,\nthere are hardly any responses from Kate about the things she sees or does, \nShe keeps repeating the same sentences,\nAnd it's really hard to understand her motive in this journey, \nand her patience for people around her that are really mean and unhelpful. \nEven Oscar is a bit annoying and everyone is so passive.\n\nThe game-play was fun, varying from easy to pretty difficult in the end.\nSome cool puzzles. Lot's of walking around and pixel hunting.\nStill, it's lovely and the Youki is the cutest."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500153332, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33569061", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198386076132", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1500153029, "num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 620}, "timestamp_updated": 1500153332, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Really nice continuation and closure to Syberia I. I loved all of it - from the amazing set design, to the puzzles and the awesome story! It felt a bit slow, like the first game, due to having to walk around great distances with a slow moving character, but it certainly improved on the first one. I definitely propose it to anyone who likes point-and-click adventre games!"}]}
