Sure it costs less than a dollar, but this game is downright barebones. The enemy ships (and there's only one kind) have next to no AI - they just aim themselves at your ship and crash into you. They also respawn right after you kill them, which means there's basically no reason to do anything but fly in a circle. As far as I can tell there's only 2 controls, left and right mouse buttons. Although I can't be sure, since there's no tutorial. There's also almost no options whatsoever, not even difficulty. Even the first level is almost impossible.

The game is broken up into phases, with each one requiring you to survive for 5 minutes.  If any of the orange enemies touch you, its game over, and you have to start from the beginning.  You move with the right mouse button and shoot with the left, and where you point the cursor determines where you move and shoot.  You can also hit Q to switch your weapon to one that takes up more energy but fires faster.  \n\nGood:\n- Interesting concept\n- Has a lot of potential\n- Buying it supports indie game developers\n\nBad, or what I would improve:\n- While the game features no checkpoints and no saving as a highlight, its honestly a negative aspect.  The lack of a story mode and checkpoints leaves the game feeling a bit pointless at times.  \n- There is only survival mode; add more variety.\n- The system requirements don't seem to match up to the gameplay.  I have more than the recommended requirements and find myself lagging at times.\n- The enemy tails of light last too long and probably help cause some of that lag.  \n- Make it an option where you can turn down the size of the explosion created by dead enemies.  When shooting into a group of enemies, it is hard to tell where any of them are after the long, large explosion of the first one.  \n- Check the hit boxes.  I'm not positive, but the hit boxes seem a bit off.  \n- Allow the player to modify the controls.  I personally find the most complicated part of this game the controls.  If you add in WASD support for moving and just leave the mouse for shooting, I feel like this game would be much more simple.   The reason I say this is because I find myself moving instead of shooting and vice-versa.\n- Phase timers.  5 minutes leaves players feeling like they accomplished nothing.  If you were to make the timers 1 minute, players would feel more accomplished and like the game is actually going somewhere.\n- Score.  The score is completely messed up at the moment.  Every time you die, it resets, so you don't have any idea of how well you are actually playing the game.  I would add in an ability to make a name in the main lobby or a profile and then have the score with your name on it flash up after you die.  Something like \"Alex recieved 12900 points\".  \n- Add a leaderboard to complement this new score system, whether it be personal or worldwide.\n- A personal suggestion you could play with is an exclamation point or something indicating where a new enemy is going to spawn.\n\nOverall, the lack of \"unnecessary stuff\" that this game gets rid of is more harmful to the gameplay than helpful.  The game doesn't feel like you are getting anywhere without all of it.  That being said, the game is still being developed and there is still hope for it.  If this was the final iteration of the game and it wasn't being developed, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but for 66 or 99 cents, its not a horrible buy.\n\nRight now I would rate the game a 4/10, but if the game developers implement more features, I feel like that rating could quickly rise.  I'm only recommending this game so more people are attracted to the game through higher reviews, causing more people to purchase it and hopefully allow the creators to make changes for the better.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198184530759", "last_played": 1466689488, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 101, "playtime_forever": 30}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1466691585, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503400", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1466691585, "recommendationid": "23727276", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Yes, I am aware that I have barley played this game, But there isnt much content to play at the moment\n\nWhat I feel about this game:\n*Feels as if it was slightly rushed\n*Feels as if this is supposed to be an early access\n*Feels as if this should be patched up a bit more\n\nHow did it entertain me?\n*I like the concept of the easy and smoothe game\n*It takes your mind off anything really going on\n*I love blowing up things.\n\nWhat I would like to see\n*More gamemodes\n*Better music (Main Menu)\n*More Game Options\n*Bug fixes\n*Possible co-op mode?\n\nOtherwise, For an indie game that was made only two days ago, I feel like it could have had more put into it before it was released, But I feel like from the point this game is at right now, It could go way further and better than it is, And please decrease the explosion when you destroy ships because its hard to tell if other ships are getting near you.\n\nOverall rating\n8.2/10 For an indie game to take your mind off", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198112216399", "last_played": 1472691248, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 56, "playtime_forever": 54}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1466642779, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503816", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1466642779, "recommendationid": "23717105", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fun, clean, crisp and simple and not damn pixel art.
