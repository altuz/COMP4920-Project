Some of the level designs and AI mechanics quickly, however, turned it into a true test of patience. Enemy cars frequently crash into each other and steering is stiff and often hindered by the environment. Trying to navigate the pause menu with a controller was a nightmare and unresponsive most of the time.\n\nOn the plus side, the path to a 100% achievement rate was one of the most satisfying I've encountered yet."}]}
