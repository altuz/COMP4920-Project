It is one of the better wave shooters but I can't say it's the single best one. Before Sam, I would have said Brookhaven was the best and Sam does do some things better than BH but BH still does some things better than Sam so there's no clear winner. Both are pretty good.\n\nThe main difference between Sam and BH is that this is a bit more \"action hero\" with dual-wielding miniguns and firing from the hip with inifinite magazines while BH is a little more realistic with having to aim-down-sight, rewarding careful aiming and having to reload. (Also, the gun models are stupidly oversized in this but thankfully there's a scaling option. Set them around 75% to get them about normal.)\n\nOne thing Sam has over BH is the monster variety and level design. Each wave here is a different map while in BH you use the same map for multiple waves. There are also unique monster types for each level in Sam while BH carries over most enemies throughout the game.\n\nOne thing Sam does worse than BH, though, is the weapon purchasing system. You have 4 waves per level and you carry your purchases through the waves but not between levels so you always start wave 1 with starter gear and JACK ALL else then you buy one decent weapon for wave 2 and then it's wave 3 before you're actually outfitted in an over-the-top badass way that the game is going for. Hip-firing dual miniguns: awesome. Being forced to dual-wield little garbage pewpew pistols for half the game: not awesome.\n\nOverall, it's a great wave shooter but it's still just a wave shooter.

I want to give this an \"eh?\".\n\nThis is yet another VR shooting gallery. Yes, I know. However, it might just be one of the slickest in existence, with slick graphics, beefy guns and even decent use of vibration. It's very impressive. Moreover, dual-wielding miniguns is guaranteed to raise a smile, every time.\n\nHowever, there are some downsides, that prevent me from honestly giving this a thumbs up. Here come the cons!\n\nGimmicky weapons. While the shooting is lots of fun with most of the weapons, there are stages where your weapon choice is artificially constrained to some terrible, annoying, gimmicky weapons, which are wonky and tedious to use. Specifically, the worst offenders are the terrible sword and awkward bow. The sword is clunky and inaccurate, intended to be used as a ranged weapon, firing off \"waves\" of energy. It's flaky and frustating, making little sense.. The bow suffers from the inaccuracy of VR bows (worse than the Valve bow in The Lab). It's even more annoying to use than the real thing. Two-handed weapons in VR always seem like a good idea, until you try to use them.\n\nOn levels when you're forced to use the bow, I find myself not looking forward to the next wave, but hoping that it will be over soon, as it's so tedious. That's a really bad sign. Luckily, you're forced to use the sword a little less, but it's still crummy.\n\nI found the audio quite grating, it sounded like there was way too much dynamic compression, for loudness, a very tiring effect. I also couldn't find a separate voiceover level slider, to turn down the \"hilarious\" shouty narration. This was just clumsy.\n\nFinally, it's expensive. It's a relatively short and largely static shooting gallery, priced similarly to many AAA games. That's just too much. I'd suggest skipping this until it goes on sale- at a bargain price, it'd be fun enough to be worth a punt.\n\nSo, while there are some things that I dislike about this game, and I certainly feel that it's overpriced, it still has its upsides. It's relatively slick and polished and.. two miniguns! \n\nHowever, the stupid wonky sword and clumsy bow are a tedious buzz kill. Without being forced to use those, I'd probably replay this game enough to get good at it on higher difficulties as it's slick and intense. However, as things currently stand, they make it a lot less fun. I'd probably mind a lot less if it weren't so expensive- it feels like a waste of money, and I don't think I can even refund now.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 103, "steamid": "76561197970650403", "last_played": 1506202915, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 186, "playtime_forever": 165}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506203817, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500311", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506362584, "recommendationid": "35164849", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Swords are so OP!!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984547963", "last_played": 1505952648, "num_reviews": 64, "num_games_owned": 233, "playtime_forever": 115}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1506012035, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498542", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1506012035, "recommendationid": "35108721", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not that its neccessarily a bad game.
