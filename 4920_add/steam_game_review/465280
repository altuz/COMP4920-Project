The story is much richer this time around, with many flashback visits to the early years of John's centuries-long life.  I did not see that ending coming -- and yes, it is one that actually satisfies, while at the same time providing enough new occult mystery for a potential third game.  Puzzle difficulty is in line with the first, which is to say moderate.  If you haven't played the first one yet, definitely do that one first; lore-reviews are plentiful, but I can't imagine it would have the same epic feel if you went into it cold.\n\nWhat didn't I like?  The Steam achievement programming was buggy and annoying, occasionally showing up as red text over the game.  And I know that crazy bastard Henry White is still out there -- I was disappointed I didn't see him in this one beyond a lore briefing.  I'm really hoping he's a playable character in the third game, if they make it.  \n\nPendulo's adventure games are the most consistently enjoyable in the biz, and I think it's because they truly enjoy [i]making[/i] them.  One definite sign of this is how even the most minor of characters is interesting to look at and talk to; the developers are so invested in their creations that they simply can't stand to waste space on pasteboard cutouts!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198072182182", "last_played": 1499487979, "num_reviews": 171, "num_games_owned": 1626, "playtime_forever": 796}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1499490634, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508776", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499490779, "recommendationid": "33363690", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[h1][b]Yesterday Origins[/b][/h1] is good adventure game with a different style of point & click interface (when playing with mouse) compared to most classic style point & click games, there's also an option to play with a game controller.\n\nThe game looks quite good visually and the voice acting is quite good, it features a quite interesting story, and while it is better to play after playing the first Yesterday game it features an in-game summary of the previous game for those that skipped it.\n\nOn the technical side, personally I only had one bug throughout my entire playthrough and it was fixed by restarting the game, it was a minor issue where some overlay buttons remained on screen permanently until game restarted.\n\nThere is one thing I didn't much like, but that can also be said for the first Yesterday game, there's no save system, the game relies on autosaves in specific places, times & after specific actions so it can be frustrating if from some reason you have to quit after progressing since the last autosave and without a new autosave in place since you have to re-do your progress.\n\nAlso, a-lot of the puzzles in the game are quite difficult or obscured, it's not an easy game to solve.\n\nThat said, Overall, Yesterday Origins by Pendulo Studios & Microids is a very enjoyable adventure game and good sequel to Yesterday (released 2012) and I would recommend it for hardcore adventure gamers mostly", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969961000", "last_played": 1499958936, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 56, "playtime_forever": 468}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500024563, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500024642, "recommendationid": "33532136", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
