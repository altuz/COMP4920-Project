In other point N clciks, I have much more areas to explore and freedom.\n- the game is very dark and despite me notching up the gamma, I still find it hard to find items since some items blind in too well with the scene.\n- many areas are lacking NPCS and chat encounters.\n- For being in Paris French, they're no accents at all and the ones attempted are HORRIBLE.\n- The voice acting in the game is monotone, no emotion shown at all. One scene a character slams his fist on a desk in ANGER and there is no anger in his voice at all...\n- transitions between scenes are worst than the scene where Herimone & Ron kiss in the chamber of secrets to Lord Volemort Screaming some random jibberish and summon a whirlpool in a ocean somewhere.\n- The story started off a bit interesting to be ruined by some silly goosebump style plot which was executed very poorly!\n- Cannot skip chat dialouge if you wanted too!\n\nLike I highly resect that this game gave gateway to the creation of the Still Life Series which I adore yet the developers ruined poetional story here and this game desperately needs to be remade. If I were a developer of this type of product, i would look back and cringe at my creation. Seriously, remake this game, you the developers, whom made this game at the time botched it. No, quite frankly, you just took a nasty dump at the time on your product and let it soak in on a possibly good dectective master piece."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1497545898, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504505", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32443768", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198274673939", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1497545220, "num_games_owned": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 349}, "timestamp_updated": 1497545898, "received_for_free": false, "review": "First I need to say that I didn't finish the game yet.\nThough, the story seem interresting.\nBut, there is a reasons why I haven't finished the game before comment it :  I'm blocked even with the help of guides and walkthrough ! I tried to begin a new game in order to follow a guide but if you don't save everytime you finish a action, you might make a mistake that will make you unable to continue the way the guide is going (yeah I didn't save the game before knowing it --'). Plus you can't skip the dialogue. \nSo it may be a good game, maybe there are a lot of thing I didn't understood that could have helped me but I tried during too many hour and it becomes tiring and boring so as I do not wish to continue now.

It was the first adventure game I had completed 100% by myself and felt very proud about it! I had found the story engaging and the atmosphere accordingly suitable.\n\nFast forward 15 years later, it seems my mind spins in a different direction and had to consult a guide in a few bits. Still, the various puzzles make perfect sense, but I mostly didn't have the same patience to solve them by myself. I think the story pretty much holds its own and I never felt lost as to what happens next or what to do. The game even provides you with alternate paths to approach the story, either in the places you visit or the dialogues you choose. ([i]And[/i] has 3 different endings!)\n\nA minor inconvenience is the resolution, which is stuck at 800x600 and in some scenes it's ok, and in others it's a strain for the eyes! :)\n\nBut my only major qualm, and a reason to [i][b]not[/b][/i] recommend the game is that Steam offers it \"as-is\". On my laptop (at least), with Winows 10, the game \"as-is\" does not start. The obvious solution is to \"wrap\" it with dgVoodoo (or any other DirectX emulator, if there is one). Well, with the latest version of dgVoodoo the game didn't start, with an older one the game started but the hotspots were pitch black and couldn't solve puzzles, and about half-way through I decided to try another [i]random[/i] version, that turned out it worked fine! [i]Phew![/i] Well, in all honesty, that's not a way to sell a game. Why couldn't these games come pre-packed with a DirectX wrapper, like even older adventures are with ScummVM or DosBox?"}]}
