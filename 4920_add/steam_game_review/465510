I don\u2019t know why this game has many negative ratings but my rating is obviously positive. Although the story progresses through a semi-fantasy method about how to impress girls by a guy, yet the basic is perfectly right that get hassle free money and give them gifts\u2026 yes, money is the only thing that impres the girls\u2026 no matter how much ridiculous it sounds but that\u2019s the ultimate fact deep in a woman's mind... whatever the reason is \"money is sweeter than honey\" for them. :XD\n\nAnd yes\u2026 this is an easy game just for very light entertainment.. maybe that\u2019s another reason why cyber-hardship lovers [who lacks hardship in their real life and so searchs in games] rated this game not so positive.\n\nThe only cons I found there should a button to exit [instead of Alt+F4] and reload game at any point.
