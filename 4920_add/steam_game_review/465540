More like a typical open-world CRPG in setup, the main character Alisa has the ability to travel more or less whereever she chooses, explore dungeons, take randomly-generated sidequests for money or for morality points, fight in rock-paper-scissors-style duels in the gladiatorial arena, or recruit random NPCs in town to follow her, or beat them up and take their money or sell them into slavery.\n\nIt's actually a fairly decent setup, though weighed down by not being very in-depth in any given area. NPC allies aren't very useful, and there's not much reason to care about your morality unless it's gotten very low from beating up NPCs or from bad random events. Likewise, the combat system provides Alisa with 9 active skills, but I found a grand total of one of them (Earth Splitter) to be useful, as the ones I tried all did similar damage and Earth Splitter was almost certain to hit all of the enemies. Admittedly, I never really tried using the magical attacks, preferring to conserve MP for healing myself and my NPC sandbag, but fights basically just came down to footwork poking matches vs. melee enemies or hiding behind my shield and poking vs. the rest of the enemies, as it's impossible to avoid their attacks with footwork.\n\nThere's also a few baffling choices, like a consumable item that reveals what's coming up in a dungeon, but not in a way that is very useful - it doesn't show you what room contains the ladder to the next level, and when you've entered a room, the only way you can avoid any of the three encounters in it is if one of them is a secret passage, and you can almost always see whether or not to take a secret passage even without the detector item. As well, there's a vague feeling of emptiness often, less because of Adventure World's open world nature and mostly because of its origins as an erotic game. As an erotic game, players were encouraged to explore and do things which were harmful to Alisa because they would result in an erotic scene, but in the Steam version, a lot of things you can do should just be avoided entirely, as they are harmful to your progress and don't result in anything except maybe a funny event picture.\n\n(Admittedly, the event pictures for losing to the various types of enemies are pretty funny.)\n\nIn summary, I'm not really sure I can recommend Adventure World, simply because it's not very good, but there's at least some good ideas here that could be expanded upon. If you're interested in this, I would recommend playing a CRPG such as Avernum or The Quest or something instead. Unfortunately, most of those are lacking in anime girls, but the game itself will be much more entertaining.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988663774", "last_played": 1499639122, "num_reviews": 182, "num_games_owned": 2229, "playtime_forever": 197}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499640111, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499640111, "recommendationid": "33416782", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
