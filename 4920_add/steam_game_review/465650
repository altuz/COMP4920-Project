I reccomend taking the game slowly at first by using an MLB team to learn the basic principles of how the game works.\n\nThe Potential:\nCurrently this game has 3D stadiums for all the current MLB franchises, and the modding community here has some they have created too. The Dynamic Crowd is a great idea and I feel like if the developers took a little more time with the next game we could potentially move away from the low poly crowd and pawn characters in the actual games. The models and animations don't even need to be that good, I just think that if they existed the game would be that much better. \n\nFinal Score: \n85/100\n \nGive it a shot.\n\nThis game is promising and a great buy for baseball and managment simulation fans, curve your expectations, this isn't MLB The Show, this is something that has much more depth, strategy, and customization. So why an 85? Games are not perfect, and this one is no exception, there isn't much to complain about, just some missed opprotunities.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "steamid": "76561198072497799", "last_played": 1506102626, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 216, "playtime_forever": 2759}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1505409628, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515761", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505409689, "recommendationid": "34953059", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A baseball management game with amazing depth and customization options.

I recommend THAT game.\n\nIn OOTP 18 they messed up the way the screen size auto-adjusts at first launch, so you have to do it manually. That would be no problem but when you do it manually it messes up the FaceGen (because you surely want to play on full 1920x1080 but that option makes the screen resize--as it should--and when it does it messes up FaceGen). The devs keep telling people it's them, but it's not \"them\", \"you\", or \"me\". It's the devs. They messed up and they don't know where.\n\nI went to Google and I fiddled with the initial game setting options regarding FaceGen and that sort of worked. So now my team has pictures yet new pictures that are made appear in the profile page but don't appear on \"hover over\" anywhere else unless you have sex with them, or so it feels like it, I suppose I could just ask it to make ALL pictures and be done with it but I see no need to have Minor League pictures and I'm not into fixing their problems. This part worked just fine in OOTP 17.\n\nThe old problem of a custom made character's fielding stats (all of them) abruptly changing from 250 to 200 is still present (even at change set to 1). You have to check your custom made character every in-game month and then save outside the save location (you need a backup you can throw into the current save game location just in case it borks up on you). This is in Commisioner Mode and you should play that way if you want to fix odd things that WILL happen. You should also auto-save every month.\n\nIf you don't care about FaceGen or the 3D (which is really poorly implemented--they could do the 3D better in 1986) then the game is okay. But this game IS about the FaceGen AND the 3D so just buy OOTP 17. The FaceGen is actually better in OOTP 17. It works as intended. You don't need what the devs call 3D.\n\nOOTP 18 is just a slightly modified verion of OOTP 17 and made only for profit while the devs tackle the problem of how to make 3D more than just matchsticks moving around the field. And those matchsticks sometimes make catches while the voice says \"it drops in for a hit\". The Devs have always been good and \"on top of things\" but they bit off a bit more than they could chew here. They still try to help though. I give them credit for that. I suggest they actually buy the game on Steam on a high end PC, install with Steam and see what happens.\n\nI have both games. OOTP 17 is the MUCH better game (unless you don't care about FaceGen). But the FaceGen is still better in OOTP 17.\n\nNote: Given the amount of positive reviews it's possible that some or even most people will have 0 problems with OOTP 18. And yes, I did reinstall, restart, and ran Steam in Admin mode and had sex with the FaceGen settings. And yes, the game itself works just as well as OOTP 17 but my FaceGen is a bit off, which is not the end of the world. By all means buy this game if you wish to support the Devs. It's just that OOTP 17 works the same and FaceGen works as intended. It just doesn't have the matchsticks running around pretending to be baseball players.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198232209448", "last_played": 1505727910, "num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 56, "playtime_forever": 1028}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1505779267, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479598", "votes_down": 14, "timestamp_updated": 1505780599, "recommendationid": "35055100", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
