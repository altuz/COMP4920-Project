OOTP 18 runs so smoothly and doesn't lag/crash until your file size is so big that it could be a game of its own.  This game, however, can't even load properly.  I tried to set up a custom league with just TWO minor leagues. Just two! And it crashed while making the game (twice because I tried it again.)  I can see why this is only half of the price of OOTP 18.  I tried doing a historical league but it crashed too.  I made another custom league with 20 minute OTs and simming the OT in game crashes everytime.  I stopped trying to do that.  The only way to ensure nothing is lost in this game is to save every ten seconds which removes the fun factor entirely.  I still gave the game a chance after all of this by playing the \"Road to Glory\" mode.  It started off well but then it randomly crashed in the middle of games, trades, and even the frickin' menu screen.  This was a waste of money and I've never seen this combination of contrast between two games made by the same DEVs.  I think they just had success with OOTP 18 so they used their brand to get people to buy this nonsense.  Don't waste your money.  Please.
