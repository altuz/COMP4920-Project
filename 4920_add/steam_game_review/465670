It could do with a tutourial to explain a few things it took me a minute or so to get my head around certian things but through trial and error i figured them out. This is a game i would strongly feel would do great on a moblie platform as well as PC. Overall sine its brand new and only just out its still a fun game and its defitnitly a game i could see my self coming home playing it for half an hour then doing something else.
