Now I've played the second game - [i]Demon Hunter 2: New Chapter[/i] - my suspicions are proved right. This really is a bad, bad little HOG, with an equally unsatisfying storyline compared to the first. You are welcome to try though, at least for the sake of some easy achievements, maybe?\n\nIts 20 years after the events of the previous game - in which case, Dawn should be at her 40s, right? \u2013 And another scientist associated with the late Professor Ashford disappears. By now, Dawn is a world-famous paranormal detective with no small reputation. Worried that this recent disappearance might be the work of our previous nemesis, a sign of Ragnar's return, Dawn decides to investigate. From thereon begins an unnecessarily complicated tag game, with ever changing culprits. Even after all the unnecessary complications, the actual culprit is revealed to be the most obvious one. Congrats, developers! You've just managed to make people run after a series of hidden object scenes and puzzles without any decent story revelation! This wouldn't be the first time in HOG history for that anyhow, but it should be a first under Artifex Mundi label. The story inconsistency is basically humongous with this one.\n\nVisuals and CGs are a bit improved compared to the first game, but they are more on the creepy side rather than being appealing. Also, there is some kind of both visual and gameplay inconsistency between the first and the second part of the game. Visuals are somewhat okay in the first half, with near alright animations and downright creepy in the second, with odd stopmotion-like movement breaks. It\u2019s as if they've been prepared by completely different teams. Voice acting is often somewhat decent though \u2013 which is the only consistency we\u2019ll be seeing in this game.\n\nDuring the first half of the game, we encounter various different puzzle and HOG types, with a nearly elegant mise en scene arrangements. They sure are not revolutionary but they kinda signal that this game won\u2019t be that bad. That signal is a lie though. As you come to the hospital part, it all becomes dull and ordinary, with the millionth really basic HOG scene without any elegance or challenge. There is nothing tricky about any of the puzzles either. Also, this second half comes with one plot dump revealed after another, completely ruining what's been left of the originally intended game pace. Oh, and there is still no explanation about this mysterious \"demon hunter clan\" and \"wtf happened to them in the first place\".\n\nBrave Giant LTD sadly doesn\u2019t deliver in this game either\u2026 All over, it is below average. I wonder if the last game would manage to wrap this whole mess up, or further sink the name of the franchise. Well, we\u2019ll see that a bit later, won\u2019t we? I sincerely recommend choosing another game from Artifex Mundi catalogue, a title that\u2019s been developed by them rather than being only published by them.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198139328230", "last_played": 1502220485, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 1770, "playtime_forever": 262}, "votes_up": 33, "timestamp_created": 1502646500, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570914", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502646770, "recommendationid": "34219075", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "An awesome point and click/hidden object adventure!\nPlay this in English, as always the translations are crap..\nApart from this and some \"too bright and full of things\" screens, it's a really nice game :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198356141989", "last_played": 1503687461, "num_reviews": 114, "num_games_owned": 225, "playtime_forever": 297}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1503432647, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515561", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1503432669, "recommendationid": "34423146", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The puzzles are too simple, not connected with the object you receive as a reward.\nThe story is also too simple with some ridiculous elements.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198056562082", "last_played": 1502633677, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 92, "playtime_forever": 270}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502633660, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502931", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502633660, "recommendationid": "34214770", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
