With \"Tank Battle: Pacific\" no doubt to come, it's a turn-based strategist's Golden Time.\n\nIncorporating additions made to previous HexWar games, with a zoom feature now added the battles are turn-based and the decisions played out in real time. With HD graphics improving on the looks from the IOS version, the game tackles the rugged and sand covered battlefields of North Africa in 1943. With an 8 part tutorial, the game depsite being a mobile port, which is now a common and sometimes popular choice it, feels more like \"Battle Academy\" than simpler titles such as \"Frontiline: The Longest Day\" or\"Road To Moscow\". The maps are just smaller, and the AI not perhaps as viscious even on Hard. It will give you a challenge, though. \n\nJust don't go expecting \"Panzer Corps\", \"Unity of Command\" or a remake of \"Steel Panthers\".\n\nAs with the previous title \"TB: 1944\", the game focuses on one front, the North African front where the USA and Great Britain fought the German Afrika Korps (as did our boys, the ANZACS who usually always get left out, but proudly adopted the intended insult with the German label \"Rats of Tobruk\"). While you may at first think you have quite a strong force to take the objectives, you'll be often surprised at having 3 Panzer III's suddenly arriving to block you from three sides. That's Rommel for you, not a cheating AI. Then again, you will often have off-map air and artillery support so it all balances out.\n\nThe graphics are seviceable, with my only gripe being the Allies having their units 'painted' in European green (even tan and blue would have been more historically authentic, even if it were only the British who sometimes used that scheme). Might help distinguish Axis from Allies, but if you're a history buff you'd do that by looking at the unit up close. Besides, your units are highlighted with each term. Still, a monor gripe.\n\nThe price point is right, and if you are in the mood for a strategy/tactical turn-based game and have any interest in this period, and don't want to spend the extra dollars Slitherine/Matrix demands for it's titles. Then again, if you are totally opposed to mobile ports, which is a bit strange in this day and age (move with the times, or stand still in the past) then it won't be for you, no matter the quality.\n\nIf though, like me you enjoy mobile ports like this that fill that important niche where games lasting no longer than 15-20 minutes fit well with real life demands...grab it.\n\nEDIT: I really don't understand people rating reviews as \"funny\" when they aren't especially.

It plays like tabletop wargames of the late 80s and 90s with different ranged fire depending on the unit firing, lethal artillery which can take out a whole unit of infantry with one doom delivering salvo, line of sight and environmental defensive cover. Having the terrain look deceptively peaceful only to move my infantry over a hill and see three or more enemy tanks suddenly appear in the distance is thrilling and fear instilling as my infantry scramble back down the hill into any thick patch of woods for cover.\n\nMusic has a 1990s midi feel to it making it relaxing to listen to while motivating me to keep on playing. Sound effects put me into the bomb blasted bullet scarred battlefield with the sound of tank treads and infantry marches going ever forward to victory. At any minute i expect to hear, ' Its A Long Way To Tipperary' by John McCormack playing over the air waves. Oh but wait a minute that was.. another war.\n\nGraphics are well done with a sharp crisp detail and the finest tabletop cardboard piece quality coming to life with fluid animations. I especially like the marching infantry.\n\nTANK BATTLE: NORTH AFRICA for those such as myself who enjoy the likes of Slitherine's epic BATTLE ACADEMY along with many a 1990s classic on pc such as THE PERFECT GENERAL this is a must buy that will bring endless gameplay and tense strategic joy with a sweet release akin to the climax of lover's coupling.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972445514", "last_played": 1488940494, "num_reviews": 75, "num_games_owned": 601, "playtime_forever": 63}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1468975483, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513069", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1468975483, "recommendationid": "24417439", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you are looking for historical accuracy then this will be a stretch, but if you want a fun game, easy to play with some interesting challenges then I recommend you pick it up!
