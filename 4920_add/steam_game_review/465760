BUT  you do get some (extremely easy) physics puzzles, switch puzzles, beam direction puzzles, etc, here and there, which does help keep things fresh.\n\nThe narration and NPC voices are extremely corny, which may turn some people off (but may just remind other people of the 90s!). They can be skipped, but this may sometimes leave you confused about what you need to do to advance.\n\nTLDR: Might feel a bit too rough for people who aren't super enthusiastic about the genre, but if you have a lot of nostalgia or enthusiasm for 3D platformers, this game is good enough quality to give you a pleasant little fix---especially if you've exhausted all other available options.\n\n7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is absolutely worth full price.\n6) A solid good game that is worth the full price.\n5) A pretty good game that may or may not be quite worth full price.\n[h1]4) An alright game, but opinions are likely to strongly differ on the game's value.[/h1]\n3) A bit rough, but with some interesting or redeeming qualities.
