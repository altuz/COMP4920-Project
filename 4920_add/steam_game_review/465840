Do not ask me why this game was chosen over the much more popular and overall superior The Last Blade 2. Still it is nice to see the first game get some appreciation.\nExpect the usual DotEmu port problems but I will recommend this because it is very functional and never gave me bad frame rates in the couple of hours I played and it is a game.        I apologize once again for lack of experience with online play but given the usual folks working on this port you can expect a functional but pretty bad time where as local play and arcade work just fine and if you are into fighting games mostly likely you are fine with local play anyway.                 If not well I guess I cannot recommend this. Now I like giving SNK my dough but for the asking price of a game that is not hard at all to play by maybe-not-legal means and is less popular than it's sequel maybe the other form of critism I have for this game is they can tone the price down to 5-6 units of your local money as opposed to 10.                                                                          That's all I have. Big SNK fan and this game works even if not my preference.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053933392", "last_played": 1498366016, "num_reviews": 76, "num_games_owned": 249, "playtime_forever": 385}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1495509649, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519354", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495510020, "recommendationid": "31911588", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
