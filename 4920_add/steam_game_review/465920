You can probably guess the plot just from the title of the game.\n\nGraphics - nothing amazing, but very crisp and clear.  There are also special animated touches (like a cat statue whose eyes periodically open and watch you), that really add to the atmosphere.\n\nSound - the music was strangely addictive in this game.  There are some voice animations, but not much, as you don't interact with very many people.\n\nHOP's - a really nice variety here.  You have your standard list based ones (with some interaction of objects to find what you are looking for), and some where you take the objects you removed from one HOP and put them into a different HOP.  There are also some that involved making something.  For example, you need a book whose pages have all been torn out.  After you find all the pages, you need to use a string from your inventory to bind them together, then as you close the book, you discover all the gold letters on the cover have fallen off, so you have to find those.  In the end, you really feel like you reconstructed this book.  All HOP items were properly named, and not too difficult to find.  I never had to use a hint to locate something.\n\nPuzzles/minigames - this is where the game really shines!  It is absolutely packed with puzzles and minigames, of a tremendous variety and originality.  A great many of these puzzles/games I have not seen in HOG's before.  Most of them take a lot of thought to puzzle through, but I never got frustrated, and I never had to use a hint or strategy guide, making them just the right level of difficulty.\n\nFeatures - The game does have a hint system and a built in strategy guide, but I never used either, so I can't comment on these.  There is no map (and thus no indication of areas with stuff left to do, or instant travel), but I found I didn't really miss the map all that much.  There is a decent sized bonus chapter at the end, with all new content.  There are 3 different difficulty levels.\n\nGame length - Playing at the advanced difficulty level, the main game took around 6 hours, and the bonus chapter took around 2 hours.  This makes the game almost twice as long as your average HOG.  If you use hints and/or a strategy guide, it will, of course, be considerably shorter.\n\nOverall - one of the best HOG's I have played, since I love puzzles and minigames, as well as interesting interactive HOP's.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198076381670", "last_played": 1484009927, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 301, "playtime_forever": 505}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1483252501, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502191", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1483252501, "recommendationid": "28893115", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Just finished it. It's good, don't get me wrong. Large variety of puzzles and such. Just the hit detector was a bit off and I would find myself clicking on things more then once. Also some of the stuff is not as intuative at it should be. If the game had a map feature like most modern games I would highly recommend it. As is I would say buy it if it's on sale.
