Tries very hard to be Limbo and take the creepy to the next level, doesn't always succeed. I played OddPlanet before I played Limbo, and ended up playing Limbo just because all the reviews mentioned that it was better. They were right. Whilst Limbo is a few years older it's held up better than OddPlanet has, and was executed with much more finesse.\n\nMy big criticism of OddPlanet really comes down to the controls. The jump mechanic is clunky, leading several of the puzzles to be more about getting the timing of your jump absolutely dead set perfect rather than having the challenge be about solving the puzzle itself. It's often a case that you work out what you have to do, but it takes 60 tries to get it right. If I want that I'll go buy a platformer and smash my controller up when I get mad.\n\nIf you loved Limbo and are looking for more this is a reasonable substitute, but don't expect it to be as good.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198122391942", "last_played": 1495268020, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_forever": 19}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1497570334, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529226", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497570334, "recommendationid": "32457377", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
