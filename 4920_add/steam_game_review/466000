You don't even remember how you managed to get stuck in a such scary, trapped, dark, sinister place, with a little girl that taunts you. You have to face your fears but the truth... the truth is something you never expected. You don't have a choice but to survive long enough to save yourself...\n\nMaze: Subject 360 has a warning of psychological intense thriller. I was kinda disappointed because I was really expecting something way more scary or with real fear but I suppose that I've expected too much for a casual adventure game. Yet, the psychological side is present and well, Maze: Subject 360 isn't really set for anyone, I understand better the warning: the game isn't really \"safe\" for children, with the darkness and the twisted beginning of the game.\n\nAnd the disappointment is also due to the twist after the first part of the game, which ended too soon for me. But well, similar sequences are happening after but you're just missing then the real beat you had first. However, the story is well written.\n\nThe gameplay is quite the standard here: use items, find objects, solve puzzles, etc.. The driven by choice mentionned in the description isn't really present, which is a shame. It would have been great to have more of that. However, the rest of the game is quite easy and I must say that I really enjoyed to find how to get past traps. Hidden objects scenes are easy too, which isn't a bad thing in the end (I've finished Mystery Cases Files: Hunstville and it reminded me how it was in the early era of hidden objects games: challenging but sometimes too much).\n\nThe graphics are great: it's really fitting to the ambiance of the game, like the soundtrack. \n\nAnyway, Maze: Subject 360 is really a good game, though the description can set higher expectations - it would have been really a true new experience if you could have more choices, more paths. But hey, it's a casual adventure game and it's probably a choice not to get further. Go ahead, the game is worthy of your pennies.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "last_played": 1496684963, "num_reviews": 352, "num_games_owned": 2214, "playtime_forever": 267}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1500884994, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525254", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500884994, "recommendationid": "33761239", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
