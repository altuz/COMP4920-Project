I really enjoyed it.  The best part was the bonus game and the bonus bonus game.  It was fun to go back to find objects I had missed and redo the hidden object sections I did not do well in.\nI have now played two madhead games and they were both very good.

For instance in some of the HOPs to even get the clues you have to find say 4 objects that will then open up the HOP list. \n\nAlso I liked the story and found it very possitive, as opposed to so many other games in this type of game.  No vampires or sick evil nemesis. Refreshing really. \n\nIt has collectables and morphing objects, which is always nice and a good map and a Strategy Guide if you get stuck. so you don't have to leave the game. \n\nEnjoyed this one.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198033102868", "last_played": 1482015096, "num_reviews": 45, "num_games_owned": 279, "playtime_forever": 541}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1482015604, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497463", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1482015604, "recommendationid": "28435514", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
