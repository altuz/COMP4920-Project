Linden Shades was an orphanage that was abandoned because a mysterious figure in red was scaring everyone. Nobody took the headmistress seriously when she had proof of a malevolent act. Now, it's time to set up the truth...\n\nI must say that I was quite happy to see this game arriving on Steam, because days before of its release, I added its profile on Neoseeker. I didn't really knew about Eipix, the developer, but they were given some known series on Big Fish Games, which is a hint about their quality.\n\nThe story is very-well written. I didn't really expect some twists of the story but the most shocking truth is in the bonus chapter. It's reminding me of an Artifex Mundi game (well, at least, those they've developed).\n\nThe gameplay is the same as any casual adventure: you find item, you use them, you clear hidden objects scenes and you solve puzzles. The good thing here is that the objects are easy to find. And you have even some items to assemble (like a box of chocolate, dominoes, etc..). As for the puzzles, they're easy apart for some of them that I skipped - but only because I knew about the ingame achievement of skipping five puzzles. Another good side is to find special items: pencils in each location, toys and letters (which are used in the menu itself!).\n\nThe graphics are quite good, even if the characters look weird in the dialogues. However, I like the cutscenes: real people were acting (and they're members of Eipix according to the making off included in the game) and it was very nice, even if the headmistress in the movie doesn't really look like the drawings when listening to her tapes.\n\nThe soundtrack is also very good, while not really fitting. But well, I enjoyed that part.\n\nThe bonus are also interesting: BTS (behind the scenes), a making of, wallpapers, music, hidden objects scenes and puzzles, the bonus chapter, even the trailer of the game.\n\nOff the Record: Linden Shades is one of the best casual adventure games you'll find on Steam, with those from Artifex Mundi. And it has the same quality as what you can find in Artifex Mundi's catalogue. In other words, everything is reunited to pass an agreable moment. However, I think that it would be great to have Steam achievements and trading cards, not for being more popular but because the game has potential for good smileys and epic success.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "last_played": 1496488077, "num_reviews": 352, "num_games_owned": 2214, "playtime_forever": 281}, "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_created": 1464201469, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533949", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1464201469, "recommendationid": "23206039", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "-Short Review-\n\n+ Pros:\n\n*Good art style\n(The backgrounds range from farmlands, a mysterious orphanage, to a dark mine; plus some cutscenes include FMV and the actors can be entertaining to watch)\n\n*Cozy, relaxing atmosphere\n\n*Good music\n\n*Interesting story\n(Pretty basic detective story, with an eerie phantom scaring people away, but it's not a bad trait)\n\n\n- Cons:\n\n*The bonus game - which is unlocked after completing the main game - is found in the Extras menu.\n(It would've been nice if this was showcased on the game's main menu for ease of access, it felt kind of hidden)\n\n*Some puzzle instructions are a little vague, which can make them a bit more difficult to play with.\n(I ended up skipping a couple because I just didn't understand some of the concepts)\n\n\n**Overall: A fairly nice HOG with a charming storyline and aesthetic; wonderful to play on a lazy day. \n$10 does seem a bit much for roughly 4-5 hours of gameplay, so, buy on sale if you prefer to do so.\n\n+ . + . + . + .\n\nI had been curious about this game for awhile, and after watching a couple of videos to sample it, I decided to have a go.\n\nYou play as a young investigative reporter who picks up an old case involving an abandoned orphanage, which closed down shortly after the children began seeing an eerie figure dressed in a red robe roaming the property.\nIs there really a ghost haunting Linden Shades, or is there something more sinister going on?\n\nI admit, the story isn't anything new, but the aesthetics of the game were wonderful and relaxing, and the puzzles were unique and enjoyable enough. And, some of the AMV cutscenes were fun to watch since the acting was rather cheesy, but nice for what it is.\n\nMy only complaint, however minor, is the fact that - after finishing the game - the bonus game (a small epilogue chapter to the story of Linden Shades) is kind of hidden in the Extras menu as opposed to being in plain sight in the main menu.\nAlso, I was a little disappointed that it was only a half-hour long, but it was still enjoyable.\n\nThe game was fun, and I do see some replay value, so I'm pretty happy with the results.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067758778", "last_played": 1468059265, "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 347, "playtime_forever": 244}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1468061531, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501899", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1468061531, "recommendationid": "24204260", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fun game.
