I thought the story was good but the 'menacing shadow' might be a bit scary for small children or the easily frightened. \n\nI didn't find the game hard even on the hardest difficulty. I finished it in one sitting in less than 4 hours. \n\nSpeech: The voice acting was good. Everyone was easy to understand and the speech seemed to fit the person talking.\n\nNo comment on the music. I have a hearing impairment and always end up turning the music off in every game I play so I can hear the other sounds. But the soundtrack is included in the bonus section of the game so if you find a piece you really like you can listen to it without having to replay the game.\n\nPuzzles: Some were more difficult than others but I did not need instructions to figure any of them out.\n\nGame played all the way thru with no crashes or lock-ups.\n\nAt no time did I feel a desire to go look up a walkthru.   \n\nThere was a bit of backtracking at times, but it wasn't the annoying kind where it sends you back fifty steps. Usually whatever you needed was only a few screens back.\n\nI did not have any trouble identifying any of the items I was supposed to find in any of the hidden object scenes. There are only two or three word list kind of hidden object scenes, the rest were find 'x' number of something or it'd show images of the things you needed to find instead of word lists.\n\nThe game has achievements, but they are not Steam Achievements. I kind of wish they were, but that's ok. \n\nIf I had to say something bad about this game it would be that the animation was a bit lacking. It was more like moving still shots than actual animation, but it did give visuals to the story, so it was adequate.\n\nI will play this one again.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198026294253", "last_played": 1499519549, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 754, "playtime_forever": 770}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499414566, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504009", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499414566, "recommendationid": "33336107", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
