The three users with you seemed to come from another times and only you and your dog seem to be real, as when arriving to a cemetary, the persons became ghosts. Hina, the keeper of the place, kidnaps your dog, only for you to help these ghosts to find peace by changing the outcomes of the events tormenting them: a gone too soon journalist, a dam worker left behind and a falsely accused of witchcraft young woman...\n\nI must say that it's probably one of the rare casual adventure games without a precise villain. Hina, the keeper, is a kind spirit, your dog is just kidnapped for making sure that you'll help her and the ghosts, lamenting themselves and feeling responsible for the death of others (though the zookeeper is the only one that wasn't driven by selfish reasons and could have save the journalist if only these keys weren't stolen). In fact, the enemies are mainly in these events and are merely humans, none being of supernatural nature. If you want to find the latter, it's in the bonus chapter, set after the main story.\n\nI liked being sent in time and save the life of those who shouldn't have died, tormenting souls for eternity as they're regretting their choices (but again, the zookeeper felt guilty as he was a genuine man that did everything he could but it wasn't enough, I'm pretty sure that given the storyline, you'll be agreeing that he shouldn't have  be in this limbo).\n\nThe gameplay is quite the standard one for that kind of games: find items, combine them, use them, solve puzzles and clear hidden objects scenes (list of objects or find objects of the same type). I'm rarely negative for that aspect, however, here, I feel that I should perhaps warn you about some puzzles being long and kinda frustrating or that some hidden objects scenes are just annoying.\n\nThe graphics are nice and the soundtrack fits really in the game.\n\nYet, I was a little disappointed by this game, maybe because I was imagining something else or because I was expecting something else from ERS or because having added its profile to Neoseeker (and the whole series), I misunderstood the concept behind Redemption Cemetery (unless Salvation of the Lost was softer than the other games, as I didn't play them).\n\nThe good surprise is probably the letter let by ERS for the gamers and the puppy's room, where you can play with the puppy, if you find medals scattered in the game. It's also the only place where you'll find \"achievements\". The rest of the bonus are just classic: music, movies, wallpapers, minigames, concept arts, etc..\n\nShould you buy the game? I would say that better games of the same genre are outside. However, it's still enjoyable if you don't encounter the same crash I had on Windows 7, making me switch to Windows 8.1 where it ran perfectly. However, while the price is kinda something normal for Big Fish Games, I would still advise you to buy it when there is a discount.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "last_played": 1496606433, "num_reviews": 352, "num_games_owned": 2214, "playtime_forever": 293}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1496608066, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524937", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1496608066, "recommendationid": "32184475", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
