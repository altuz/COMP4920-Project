Kinda of a paint by numbers plot. Decent HOG though some of the scenes can get annoying when you click on something and it doesn't take. Some of the puzzles are easy while others are a bit frustrating if only because you don't know what to do/find. Bonus chapter sums up the storyline nicely. It's tacked on but it completes the unfinished buisness of the main game. I'm recomending it if you like HOGS but maybe wait for a sale.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972999224", "last_played": 1498094908, "num_reviews": 78, "num_games_owned": 2463, "playtime_forever": 197}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1498095078, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498095078, "recommendationid": "32631763", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
