At the same time, it also has a new game sorta vibe, it's very fresh in the movement and play, so when I say golden era I don't mean it plays like an old game. This is tough to put to words.\n\nIt plays like an arcade classic. In its current form, it has a tournament mode.\n\nGame has a ton of charactors, ton of moves, killer stages, awesome music. I can't begin to imagine what the final completed game will be like.\n\nThis game is a 4 button fighter with directional movement to adjust hit strength. A lot of crazy combo possiblities and exciting action when you are really getting in there.\n\nIf you are a fan of classic (also golden era) Kung Fu films, and you are into fighting games, this could be the one.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198159826794", "last_played": 1505684117, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 49, "playtime_forever": 171}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1505681565, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507896", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505681565, "recommendationid": "35032948", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Shaolin vs Wutang...\nHow can I describe this product?\nThis game is simply the best proof of love from the developer to the old kung fu chinese movies of the past.\nWe have now a 23 character inspired by the fighter of that universe, they have no name and we know them in the game by their combat style, so we have \"jeet kune do\" (who?) \"wing chun\" (a certain master) \"drunken fist\" (:).Basically this is the second chapter of \"king of kung fu\". they share the same concept, but this one improve the gameplay in a massive way, the graphic is cool and realistic, the music is original from the 70's movies... the developer keep the game updated adding characters, stages and fixes, he ask a lot the fans and try to make they happy with very cool stuff every month...If You are in love with the old kung fu movie style, you must purchase this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038958204", "last_played": 1505080247, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 232, "playtime_forever": 2408}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1504605146, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502527", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504605146, "recommendationid": "34753125", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Holy crap thank you this game is incredible so far, and obvious work of passion!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 251, "steamid": "76561198084094637", "last_played": 1506831021, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 424, "playtime_forever": 251}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506281640, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506281640, "recommendationid": "35189167", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "really good fighting game that alot of people slept on.CHECK IT OUT !!!!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "steamid": "76561198070027221", "last_played": 1506827242, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 175, "playtime_forever": 146}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505477160, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505477160, "recommendationid": "34970197", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is totally awesome", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197968804077", "last_played": 1502675683, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 305, "playtime_forever": 63}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504753116, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497275", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504753116, "recommendationid": "34787127", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
