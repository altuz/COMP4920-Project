Actually, very pleasing. Facial animations are fantastic.\n+ Swimsuit DLC makes the game less scary. Unless it's swimsuits on janitors. Which make them more scary.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n- Janitors are... not scary. Mostly annoying.\n- Some bugs here and there. Most are probably fixed by the time you read it, but during my first playthrough, met some scary bugs.\n- Puzzles are interesting, but some are quite obscure and could use more explanation. And yes, I did run out of ways to integrate \"scary\" into these sentences...\n- Jumpscares. It's kind of a cheep way to scare. Quality also varies, from \"holy ****, don't do this again!\" to \"meh... saw that coming\".\n- Must play on hard or above to see all the scary content\n- Grindy achievements (die 100 times, use 100 medkits etc.)\n\n[h1]In-Depth:[/h1]\nOk, so... I really [strike]love[/strike] [strike]hate[/strike] [strike]love[/strike] enjoyed this game. For the most part. But let me start with the most obvious thing that I hated about it. The janitors.\nThe janitors are not scary. The janitors are not fun. The janitors are annoying as ****. This game would be infinitely more enjoyable, interesting and scary without them. The only purpose they serve is to artificially prolong the gameplay time, because they stand between you and exploration, scares, story. If anything, I think they actually ruin the atmosphere of this empty creaky haunted school. You know, when you are exploring the dark corridors, about to **** your pants because of creepy music, something knocking on the window of the fourth floor, stepping on creaky floor... and then suddenly a guy with a flashlight and baseball bat shows up, limping towards you, whistling with his whistle and you have to run to the nearest toilet (since it's the only place you can reliably lose him)... the only thing missing is Benny Hill music. And you don't think \"oh no, so scary, he's gonna catch me\", you think \"Oh ffs, again? I was literally 2 meters away from objective and now I have to crawl through all this AGAIN?\".\nNot to mention that on harder difficulties their ability to hear and see you becomes just absurd, with them hearing you open doors 4 floors away.\nSure, there are a few creepy moments involving them and they are nicely integrated into some cutscenes. But it doesn't really justify their presence, in my opinion. They are simply annoying.\n\nOK, with that out of the way, let's actually talk about the rest of the game. I have never played the original myself, so this was my first experience with White Day. And I loved every second of it (that did not involve janitors).\nI consider myself rather desensitized when it comes to horror genre. Seen too many movies, played too many games, so it's pretty hard to find something really scary for me.\nWell, I stopped playing this game after the first 10 minutes to go and turn the lights in my room on. Because holy ****, the sounds are so creepy. The atmosphere overall is creepy as well, but it can vary, depending on situation. But sounds are always there. Just some random static, some footsteps in an otherwise empty hall, something knocking on your window, something screeching, something whining... the sound design here is absolutely amazing.\n\nThe ghosts are great. Just don't forget that you have to play on hard to see them all.\nOne thing I've noticed about a few \"let's plays\" of this game that I've seen - people often skip ghost stories they find and don't read them. HUGE mistake. These stories are amazingly creepy and add immensely to the atmosphere. So do yourself a favor and read them.\nAnd then, of course, the ghost design itself is awesome. But hey, what did you expect from Asian horror? Their ghosts are always top-notch.\nCould, maybe, use a bit less of jumpscares. The ghosts and their sounds are already creepy enough without this cheap trick of popping and screaming. Actually, my single favorite ghost in the game is the one that just stands in the room doing absolutely nothing. Scares me deeply and much more than the jumpscare ones. [strike]I also want her as my waifu.[/strike]\n\nExploration is fun (when the janitor doesn't stand in its way). I love finding some obscure things and figuring what to do with them. This game has a lot of these tiny missable things and it's pretty cool for completionists. Also has around 10 different endings, so the replayability is great.\n\nThe puzzles are... how do I put it... it's not that they are difficult, in fact, I only had troubles with one of them. But you need to have a certain way of thinking to figure some of them out. I'd say the game would benefit from giving you just a tiny bit more info about what it wants you to do. But then again, maybe I just suffer from being a modern gamer and too used to games holding my hand all the time.\nHowever, there are things that are stupid. To solve certain scenes you need to have certain items. However, you can not know that you need them until you encounter these scenes. So, you die, then you search for more items, play through the section again and then you win. Which can be frustrating. Especially because - yes, you guessed it - the janitor who doesn't let you explore every room in peace. Thankfully, even on hardest difficulty (where you can not save) the game's autosaves are placed smart enough not to put you into dead ends. So even when you die, you usually start relatively close to where you need to be. So it's not a big gripe. Besides, it's always fun to see your hero die in a new way.\n\nAll in all, I think this game is great. It's scary, it has replayability, it is visually pleasing (which is one of the reasons I bought it in the first place, I just LOVED characters' animations and facial expressions, huge props to people who worked on them). It is an Asian horror and an Asian game through and through. Which means it involves creepy lore, creepy sounds and music and unfortunately, a certain amount of wasting your time. If you've played many Asian games, you probably know that for the most part they involve a f-ton of grinding, text [strike]skipping[/strike] reading, random unavoidable combat or clunky UI. It's just part of the course. Thankfully, this game has none of the above. Instead it has the janitor who slows your progression, makes you run in circles, replay bits of level over and over again if he catches you or spend a huge chunk of game sitting in the toilet, waiting for him to leave your floor...\n\nBut if you think that you can deal with this part, the rest of the game is very much worth it. Honestly, it's an easy recommendation for anyone who loves horrors.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 200, "steamid": "76561198003771261", "last_played": 1506036522, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 408, "playtime_forever": 1739}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1505145314, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535243", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505483743, "recommendationid": "34885331", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "(Writing this review after just finished the game for my first time)\n[h1] This game is incredible!!! [/h1] I just finished for my first time! I always wanted to play this game, Ever since 2012, especially after seeing Cryaotic play it many many years ago. After hearing the remake was a thing, and that it was coming to pc, I was so excited! Set the day on my calendar and everything, then it was delayed. I was upset, but I stuck with it. \nI got the game 2 nights ago, and couldn't stop playing, I Always saw White Day as the \"Best Horror Game I Never Got To Play\" And now that I've played it, it's INCREDIBLE. :)\nSo, heres the review: Graphics: The graphics are Incredible. It's got the Anime aesthetic,  which I absolutely [b] LOVE [/b] It's done So well, I'd definetly say this game is how you do an anime style in 3D, It's amazing. Animation is also Awesome, All animations in this game look crisp, and well-animated!\nGameplay: The gameplay is really fun, a lot of the game play is Stealth, hiding from the Janitor, Etc, and when you're not hiding, You will be solving puzzles. As for the puzzles, They're not too hard, but intuitive enough to put thought into.\nThere are Multiple endings, that are affected by your choices, Talking to the girls, your likability, Etc.  The ending I got on my first playthrough, is [spoiler] Althaea [/spoiler] The sound design is great, I love the new sounds they have, and old ones they use from the original. The music is also Incredible. Sometimes it's odd or loud, but other than that, all music is Great. In total, I Definetly recommend this game, It is truly an amazing experience, and it's a great horror game for Everyone. \n(Note: The game is Still being updated by devs based on feedback! :)   )", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 481, "steamid": "76561198111288547", "last_played": 1506482408, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 192, "playtime_forever": 1071}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1506027249, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502514", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506027249, "recommendationid": "35113748", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I've been a fan of White Day since I played the original version ages ago.This is a korean survival horror game. You play as Hee-Min Lee, a high school student who gets trapped along his schoolmates inside Yeondu High School, a haunted school which is home to lots of ghost stories. You'll have to solve puzzles and even face some of the ghosts in order to escape.\n\nPros:\n\n-Multiple endings: The ending is determined by how you interact with the characters (whether you are nice or mean to them).\n-There's a new playable character (Ji-Min Yoo): She didn't appear in the original or the mobile versions. When playing as Ji-Min, you can get two new endings (depending on Hee-Min's choices when meeting her).\n-Graphics: The game is similar to the mobile version, but it looks much better.\n-Music: the music is great and fits the game perfectly.\n-The school: you'll be able to explore most of this creepy school and learn about its past through various documents.\n-Ghosts!: There are 20 ghost stories you can collect around the school. However, you'll have to play on Hard or Hell modes to see most of them.\n\nCons:\n\n-The janitors: they are the main threat in almost every phase of the game. They're very frustrating in harder difficulties.\n-The story is a bit short: You could complete the game in 2 hours or so (even less if you speedrun or don't look for secrets/documents).\n-Some of the ghosts are just jumpscares. Not scary at all.\n-Other minor bugs.\n\nDespite everything, this is still one of the best horror games I've played and one of my favourites.
