The story and dialogue are very well written, and the combat system brings enough new ideas to the table to seem fresh while sill having that nostalgic feel to it at the same time. While the graphics may be lacking that one final layer of polish that all the big AAA studios can afford, they are still very well done, especially the character portraits and animated monsters you face in battle.

I hear Dragon Slumber worked over five years on this game, even writing his own engine. The characters are engaging, the story pulls me in, and the combat is fun and rewarding. Smithing your own equipment is a welcome feature to the game, and though I've just gotten started, it looks to be an in-depth system. This game is worth your money and your time if you're a fan of RPGs, or even if you're not, Arelite Core can get you started in the genre.

My review!\n\nStory: Traditional RPG with terrifyingly powerful supervillain who wants to bring about utter destruction of the world. You play a blacksmith who has made up his mind to journey across the world seeking out all other Master Blacksmiths to learn from - you want to become the greatest Blacksmith who ever lived. Oh, and it just so happens the most powerful sword in history is needed to kill the supervillain and guess what Blacksmiths do? CREATE SWORDS! Along the way cities are razed, friends die, levels are gained, and fun is had.\n\nMusic: Fantastic. 8/10\n\nCombat: Simplistic yet fun. You use a point system to make certain Moves of your choosing more powerful/more effective. These points can be subtracted or added anywhere on the map - no Inn or anything needed. Your healer can Parry and heal your entire party for some HP. There's a \"Stun\" system which the more you hit the enemy the better your meter until you fill it and the enemy is stunned for a turn or two. \n\nGameplay, Mechanics, Funness, Overall Enjoyability: I mean it's an Indie SNES-era RPG released in 2017. It's done very well. I noticed some typos which I wasn't fond of, but there were only a few. I think the game is worth $19.99.\n\nOverall: 7/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197975932211", "last_played": 1501218973, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 114, "playtime_forever": 3719}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1488241232, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504396", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1488241232, "recommendationid": "30230842", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Only played for a short time, but so far so good.
