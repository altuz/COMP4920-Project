This game is a chapter book series. It doesnt require art. It doesnt require animations. It only requires mind (which quite a few of you dont have, if youre critisizing this.)\n\nThis game makes you think. It makes you WANT to become better. It makes you feel good if you unlock a whole new set of features. YES. THIS GAMES IN APP PURCHASES ARE INSANE. Unpopular apps often raise prices to regulate currency. And they know it could work because this game hooks you and gets you playing (as long as you can read)\n\nI became elated when i defeated diana and unlucked the monuments. Every step i take brings me closer to defearing the main god, Baal. Its fun. I love to read, i love to customize, i love to visualize, i love to think. So if you love to do these things, this game is for you\n\nAnd some people are wanting solid weapons and armor. This game is about gods, not humans. Us weak humans dont have the power to use our aura to block attacks or to explose things. Thats why we need armor and swords. God can blink and a bomb can turn into a kitten. So thinking you need armor or weapons is pretty crappy because i mean you can literally create a planet and make your own humans, and massacre all of the gods, even though you were once just a poor human dealing with the stress of history. \n\nThough im against complaining about people wanting more animations and better art, this game would be better with it. Itd please the eye more. But like i said i would never complain because i pay attention more to the story than what my character looks like. The mechanics and story is perfect and if i had to choose between a 30 dollars game or this, id pick this. \n\nSo to those of you thinking of getting this, as long as you like to read and using your mind, you can probably get addicted to this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198342289851", "last_played": 1491561026, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_forever": 10400}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487392384, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487392418, "recommendationid": "29999850", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I first downloaded this on my phone and played for quite a while. At first i had no idea what i was doing after the tutorial finished, mainly because i didn't pay much attention. But i quickly figured out what i had to do. This game isn't like other clicker games where you just sit back and let the game run itself after a certain amount of time, instead it actually makes you think about what to do next, and how to go about doing it. \n\nYou won't get anywhere near the end of the list of gods in only a few rebirths which is nice because you won't have to be bored clicking in the same spot for hours just so you can get bigger numbers. It will take time, and you will have other stuff to do such as fighting monsters, training, or even reading the story. \n\nThe story is nice and detailed, especially the battles between you and the gods. It gives your character some background and 'character'. In my opinion it's one of the best things about the game. It's easy to imagine the scenes taking place and is exciting. Being able to follow along the story alongside your god/goddess is pretty neat.\n\nNo doubt the artwork will improve in the future. The character art isn't the best but it is FAR better than anything i can do. And besides, every game has to start somewhere.\n\nSo yeah i'd recommend it to anyone who wants a good clicker game to play.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198070483987", "last_played": 1485494016, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 39, "playtime_forever": 1790}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485149545, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485149545, "recommendationid": "29437124", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you want a game for managing resources and mostly-passive play in maximum of five-minute bursts, this is probably for you. If you want something that's played mostly actively, maybe not. {there are exception strategies, but not *that* many.} It's also rather complex, though less-so than some of the reviews make it sound. \n\nThe game has a lot of different elements to micromanage, but none of them are, on their own, immensely complex. This game has only two clicker analogues/minigames as far as I've gotten- the special fights and the baal slayer. I think ultimate beings V2 are going to be a third, but it's not viable for me yet. None of these is incredibly neccessary.\n\nAnything else's gameplay is micromanaging in some manner. Progress bars will fill with you or without you, but you can optimize through micromanaging or reset to restart building with an exponentially increasing starting multiplier. This is a very reset (rebirth in-game, at least for the simplest kind. Challenges are a higher-level kind.) heavy game, by the way. Active players might \"rebirth\" as often as every 1-2 hours for optimal progress. \n\nI enjoy this game, you might not. Still, one word of advice- either read the built in FAQ guide or look for a user-made guide. This game might be less complex than people are selling it as, but it doesn't start as simple as most idle games.\n\nAnd don't pay attention to my playtime, I run it in the background. I spend between 1 and 5 minutes on the game per hour on record, usually, and when it's dramatic in either direction, it's usually less, such as 0 minutes per hour. A more relevant unit is when I started- which is less than six months ago but more than 3.\n\nPS. ignore the people who complement the story.
