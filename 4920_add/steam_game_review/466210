I mean what else can you buy for 49 cents nowadays? 1 french fry? If given the option, take the fry but since that isn't available buy this game instead. Hours of action packed racing, demolition derby, and much more fun come with this game.\n\nMy favorite part however was possibly not intended, or could just be considered an easter egg. While on the well designed suburban map (one of 3 glorious tracks that come with the game), I found that there is a hill you can drive up if using a Friereri. Once up this hill the game turns into a superman simulator, as you can drive through any scenery outside of the fences conveniently placed to keep you on the road and on track to finish ahead of your competitors. You can drive through rocks, plants, trees, and even fly by driving to the edge of the map, where you endlessly plummet into blackness like in that nightmere you keep having. \n\nSpeaking of comepetitors, the AI in this game is fantastic. They always crash in the same places, great consistency!\n\nAlso the added posters that look like google images posted onto high resolution textured walls in the garage of women in bikinis is a great plus. Tons of masturbation material when fatigued from racing!\n\nI give this game a 9/10, would buy again.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025066328", "last_played": 1483076769, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 33}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1483077171, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495319", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1483077171, "recommendationid": "28817633", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I had fun.
