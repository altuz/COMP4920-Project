There's a lot be done and there's a lot to improve.\n\nWith that said, this game has great potential.\nThe 8-bit artwork is marvellous, and it gives a feeling of nostalgia.\nThe developers work day and night, and there's weekly reports of what's been improved, what's been noticed.\nJust as Early-Access should be, the players and the developers keep a link of communication to make the game better and remove it's flaws.\n\nThis game will probably be very enjoyable in 5 or 6 months from now, if it keeps going at this pace.\nSo I recommend this game to people who want to support it in this very early stage of development.\n\nBy now, music and sound effects, playability and in-game content are, for me, very shallow and generic. But as I said, there's plenty of room for improvement, and we can see developers effort on a week basis.\n\nAfter all, it's up to you. If you're feeling adventurous, this game is a good option to put your money in.\nIf not, just wait some more time and check it again.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071915660", "last_played": 1501130925, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 334, "playtime_forever": 105}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1500306755, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506514", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500306755, "recommendationid": "33610485", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pretty fun for an alpha release, it certainly has a long way to go though. Not many skills to play around with yet, the loot is very monotonous and often the same junk drops with the same stats time after time. \nTypically the gear in the shop is stronger than anything you can find dropped right now. I've only seen one orange item so far multiple times which is a ring, you can find it more often in the newbie area than other dungeons.\n\nCompleting dungeons is not very rewarding yet, the difficulty and drops between normal and insane are not very different at all. You can gain exp and money faster running around lower level areas one-shot killing big groups of weak monsters. Your exp comes in the form of blue crystals dropped by monsters, so the faster and more you kill the faster you level.\nMonsters are all slow and dumb, no MVP or boss type monsters running around to give you a challenge.\n\nDespite the glaring problems this is bare-bones beginning of development, I look forward to seeing how this game turns out in time and can't wait to play necromancer class when it comes out.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198284469597", "last_played": 1500785520, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_forever": 5328}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1500318940, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502314", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500318940, "recommendationid": "33614476", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Credentials: I've played one character class to the current max level and toyed around with a few others.\n\nThis game has a solid combat and loot system, which are the most important parts of an ARPG.  Getting new loot drops can drastically increase your power, allowing you to venture into new areas and make faster progress.  Dungeons and gear both have level requirements, and leveling also nets you some stat and skill points.  Skill trees are straightforward and there's plenty of opportunities to move points around as you level.  Fighting above your level is appropriately difficult, and it is usually not productive without a party.\n \nThe various open world areas and instanced dungeons are well designed and interesting to work through whether solo or with a party.  Even in alpha they have a nice variety of enemies as well as levers, puzzles, and secret areas.  Checkpoints typically unlock progress and also keep death from being too much of an annoyance as they provide a place to respawn with no penalty upon death.  Dungeons are designed to be run multiple times, and each successful run counts toward unlocking harder and more rewarding versions of the dungeon - this is currently just higher level enemies, but there's other interesting things they could do with this.\n\nThe downside is typical alpha stuff - there's not a lot of content yet aside from going into dungeons, killing monsters, and taking their stuff.  The loot system is good, but it needs to be fleshed out with more uniques, sets, and interesting modifiers.  There's only one quest and it's standard collection fare, but it works pretty well and shows that the quest system is viable.  Harvesting and crafting are in, but they currently involve socketing one harvestable gem or one quest reward gem into items.  Not particularly interesting, but, again, it shows that these systems are working.\n\nControls are occasionally awkward with multi-key input inssues, but you eventually learn the quirks and learn to work around them.  Lag is sometimes a problem, but it has never been bad enough to cause me to quit a playing session.  It does occasionally result in death, but as I mentioned above, death is not a huge setback by any means.\n\nThe biggest positive for the game is that the dev staff are updating regularly, post regular articles about progress and future goals, and actively respond to community input and bug reports.\n\nIf you're looking for a finished game with tons of content, this is not for you, but if you're interested in a Secret of Mana MMO with Diablo-esque loot with a lot of potential, there's a lot of fun to be had.  The active community is small, which means it's easy to be listened to if you are willing to give thoughtful feedback.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992782092", "last_played": 1501863228, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 147, "playtime_forever": 1819}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499657359, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500052", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499657359, "recommendationid": "33421234", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very fun game to play with a group of people.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198416625218", "last_played": 1504701942, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_forever": 104}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504558413, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504558413, "recommendationid": "34743793", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I really enjoy this game and it is under constant development/improvement.
