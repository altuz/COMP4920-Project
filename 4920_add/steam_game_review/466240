The gameplay is such that you and your friends can totally mess with each other over in-game voice chatter and I think that's really the biggest attraction to this game.  \n\nThe maps are nice and well lit, and the art design is fantastic.  It creates a great atmosphere for the scenarios that transpire through the match with you and the other players with 2 (infected) trying to 'play innocent' with 5 other survivors.  It's a test of wits and cunning, and seeing if you can outsmart your buds.\n\nI don't know why the playerbase for this game sunk, there's not much wrong with it, and it deserves a way better fan base.  What a fresh and enjoyable idea and experience offered in this asymmetrical horror.  ...
