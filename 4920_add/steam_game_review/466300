I played and completed it in 1999, and never seen a game more intriguing. \n\nTorment never had the best gameplay elements or graphics. This is a game about a personal story. About beliefs that shape the reality. About personality. About sorrow and regret. About unimaginable atmosphere. About quailty but not overwhelming text. About strangeness.\n\nTorment is the pinnacle of story telling and atmosphere in a video game. This is why me and many others love this game this much. \n\nEnhanced edition brings forth some minor improvements.
