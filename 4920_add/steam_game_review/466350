Frustrating at times but rewarding when you get it right. Which is perfect.\n\nI love the soundtrack - pay for it - it is relaxing and very nice\n\nThe game is roughly 1 hour+ so buy on sale if you want value vs time. More time is added depending on your platforming / temple times. Temples are extra and hard. I compare them to shorter versions of Donkey Kong Country Returns temples. Once you know the moves you get them easily, but it takes tries to know whats coming.\n\nGameplay makes sense and progresses well. Several levels (and all of the extra temples) require trial and error to complete which is fine. There is nothing unordinarlly hard. I completed several levels avoiding active enemies trying to hurt me. I.E. my stealth sucked and I made it work.\n\nThe story leaves questions no matter how much you finish but it is interesting. I'm not sure what I accomplished as the main character, but I liked accomplishing it. And the extra achievements. Well most of them. No way I was going to beat the game and all temples without dying.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972366861", "last_played": 1500188940, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 49, "playtime_forever": 174}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1500190971, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488088", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500190971, "recommendationid": "33579079", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fossil Echo is a clever mix of stealth and platforming, with a touching, wordless story and a beautiful soundtrack to boot! A solid adventure well worth the low price tag, and if you're looking for a challenge, there are some very difficult optional areas that unlock additional story-related content. Although the platforming is certainly challenging, the process of restarting is near-instantaneous, with checkpoints from section to section, so you won't lose progress or need to slog too far through easier areas before you arrive at the hard spot. All in all, Fossil Echo is a brief yet thoroughly immersive adventure that I can heartily recommend.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049207626", "last_played": 1491784665, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_forever": 246}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502945363, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502945363, "recommendationid": "34300034", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
