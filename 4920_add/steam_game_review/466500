Per the tags, yes, this is a 'walking simulator' but there is some action. I thought the story was good, I don't want to spoil it so this is going to sound very vague, but when you watch the ending you make a connection that you're not sure was intended during the game.\n\nI liked the relaxed nature of most of the game (I did mention there is a little action). The game English translation is a bit rough but it's not bad; all voice audio is Russian, so you'll need to read the subtitles if you don't understand the audio. The graphics and sound are exactly awesome, but don't let that keep you from checking it out; it would have been nice with surround sound.\n\nSteam says I spent around 6 hours in the game on my first playthrough, I did look around quite a bit and die in some traps, so that might be a longer play time.

While certain breif moments shine with the kind of attention to detail that only passionate developers would bother to craft, they're so few and far between that this is too boring a slog to suggest to any but the most mellow potential players.\n\n[h1]Overall: 3/10[/h1]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971398029", "last_played": 1504949743, "num_reviews": 34, "num_games_owned": 146, "playtime_forever": 287}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1504950223, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502724", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1504950223, "recommendationid": "34833319", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I want to start by saying the game was hard to keep playing at first. It is slow ... very slow. Think the slowest Walking Dead episode ever minus zombies. But if you can chug past the first hour, the story picks up a bit and ends very well- with your heart being ripped from your chest and left in the sun/or rain.\n\nThe controls were clunky and not able to be changed- this I found a little annoying but I just made do.\n\nGraphics weren't bad, especially considering this was created by only one or so guys. Fine work.\n\nSound and music, again passable and aren't jarring.\n\nYes, I will state again, the game had points were it dragged; but the ending was worth it.\n\nThe little combat there was though is the game's weakest point. It is very clumsy. Thankfully, it is far and few between.\n\nThe food and medicine system is a bit useless and should had not been in the game. The screen blurring effect is highly distracting and makes game-play not enjoyable or tolerable at all. This is the biggest negative of the game.\n\nAfter all, if you are patient and forgiving ... the game is worth it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1063, "steamid": "76561198018981985", "last_played": 1506806616, "num_reviews": 44, "num_games_owned": 1134, "playtime_forever": 1063}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506807364, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506807429, "recommendationid": "35354980", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I got this game on sale (90% off I think) and I am definitely glad I didn't pay full price or even half price. Whilst the game does have decent graphics, good soundtrack and good potential in terms of storyline I really can't recommend this game. Granted this is not the sort of game I usually play but the lack of quality is what leads me to the conclusion of not recommending this game \n\nThis game is in Russian but has the option for English subtitles. Now subtitles are not an issue for me, some of my favorite films, games etc are subtitled; but the subtitles for this are among the worst that I have ever seen, Dialogue is poorly translated to the point where sentence structure is almost non existent and its like trying to read subtitles provided by Yoda. Words are also un-finished or badly mis-spelled.\n\nA good portion of this game will be spent walking/waiting/trying to figure out what to do but a first time playthrough should range somewhere between 3-5 hours. I suppose there is some replay value to this game if you were to purchase it. There are a total of three different endings, each slightly different and each will require you to play the game from start to finish. Cut scenes are un-skippable and there is no chapter select therefore you will need to do three complete runs of the game if you wish to see all endings/get all achievements. As for the title of this game; sure you have a camera but there is no purpose for it, during a cut scene it gets used once and you can whip it out if you feel adventurous, but there seems to be no relevance to this camera or its use despite the title of this game.\n\nAs you can probably see from above; I do not have much love for this game but hey; if you understand Russian and don't mind walking simulators; this could be the game for you.\n\nMe personally though; would not buy again, or for anyone, or even accept as a free gift.\n(Maybe it wasn't that bad but you get my point).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024197140", "last_played": 1505845061, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 258, "playtime_forever": 477}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505847214, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499587", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505847214, "recommendationid": "35070403", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
