You do have healers but they do not exist as an actuall army unit, they're more sit back at base an heal constantnly but slowly. Also the army cap is quite small, i think my biggest army was no more then 30 supply villagers included. The only clan unit that is different is the warchief, who has the same model except different makeup.\n\n[Map objectives]\nThere is objectives on the map such as holding an artifact gaurded by units, giving food to giants for them to join your army, or even killing a boss. But some of these feel quite out of reach in a 1v1, and it feels like fame victories are achieved quite easily and quicker then it would take to actually accomplish most of these on map objectives. I really enjoy this map objective system but I feel like it can definently use some fine tuning and tweaking but overall the idea and concept is gem.\n\n[Tiles]\nYou progress through your match in similiarity to civilization, you keep your clan happy with food, lumber, stone, and iron. To aquire these things you'll need to scout adjacent tiles and find resources this way. I actually didn't really like this system was presented in civilization probably because of how slow that game was, but this game actually pulls it off quite well in my opinion, and the seasons is a nice touch as well. Its not a perfect system, and can definently screw you over, but it works right now.\n\n[Overall]\nBut overall yes I do like this game, but being compared to leading RTS titles on the market and the standards they set for the genre I would give this game a 72%. I can tell you guys put alot on your plate already but In my own opinion this game is literally 38% of a game away from becoming a leading RTS and from becoming a sport in the world of online gaming. \n\n[Things I would like to see or would suggest in gamelay]\nI would like to see more units, bigger armies earlier, with stronger objective and victory condition balancing. If you could even add in units with abilities, more unique and lore intensive clans at the least change the color of the clothes. Also If you could try to make your unit responses more similiar to how blizzard does it, the constant grunt every click starts to drive me nuts over time. Also I know i'm going out on a limb here especially with the viking feel but if you could even maybe add air units idk maybe wyverns or something idk it would be cool.\n\n\n[Extra things to note]\nUnits respond like units in warcraft or starcraft, and not so much like age of empires or similiar game where the units respond in bulk and delayed. So yea if you make a square, the units within that square are selected, although i don't think you can shift click to add or remove to subgroup. Also you can hotkey your units and structures into different groups.\naxe throwers respond quick enough in which you can kite efficiently.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198102701566", "last_played": 1505034350, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_forever": 1790}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1505039240, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517921", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1505039382, "recommendationid": "34858474", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Northgard is an RTS with elements from like Warcraft 3 and Settlers, blending the best elements from both, that favors macro over micro.

It does a lot of things right and is easy to pick up.  There are some major faults though, which makes me wish there was some sort of middle-ground between a Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down rating.  \n\nIf you have any previous experience with city-building type RTS games, this will be extremely easy to jump into.  Which is good, because the game does a very poor job of giving explanations on what you must do to succeed.  There are no helpful \"advisors\" to tell you why your happiness has plummeted, or why your food production suddenly went from +10 to -25.  You need to know how to trouble shoot the problems yourself.  Seeing that the game is very simplistic in nature, with only about two dozen buildings or structures, it's usually not too difficult to figure out what you need to balance... but some times you don't have the time to sit their troubleshooting when your entire population suddenly starts starving to death.\n\nResource gathering is fairly simple and balanced, with the exception of stone... stone is used in the majority of building upgrades, which are very important in such limited confines as this game gives you.  The problem is that stone is a very rare resource, which seems kind of silly.  You can only mine small amounts from rare stone nodes you find in about 1 out of ever 4 land tiles.  And they worst part is, they aren't renewable... they give you about enough stone to upgrade 2-3 buildings before running out.  This alone forces you to do 1 of 2 things.... quickly expand your borders in a panic'd attempt to acquire more tiles with stone... or start mass producing as much \"Krown\" currency as possible, so you can pay the absurdly overpriced Trading Post prices for stone. There needs to be a much better way to manage this resource.  \n\nThe biggest and most dissapointing flaw with this game is THERE IS NO SAVE OPTION.  My friends and I like to play large drawn out games with heavy development that can span multiple nights of gameplay.  But thats not a possibility here, you can't save the game and rejoin it later.   And with the average game easily lasting a MINIMUM of 2-3 hours, this is a big problem.  On the other hand, the game is overly simplified... with little to no \"end game\".  You're army is small, consisting of 6-12 bland units that you drag into other borders to auto-fight the opponents.  You get one \"special\" unit, that represents your tribe... but they have no redeeming qualities... just a bit more health and attack than a regular unit. \n Your buildings only upgrade once, and there is no evolution to the types of buildings you can create as the game goes on.  You will be using the same Farms and Houses at the end of the game that you used at the beginning of the game.  There is no progression.\n\nSo is this game worth picking up?  Sure... but don't expect an in depth city management style RTS.  The bulk of the challenge in this game comes from the restrictions of how many buildings it will let you place in one land tile, and playing whack a mole with different world NPCs pelting your borders with attacks.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198033819045", "last_played": 1506907682, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_forever": 248}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1506000739, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503988", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1506000877, "recommendationid": "35104505", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "great   game   needs a  bit of patching  an absolute  must have  if you are  from  boring norway shitty sweden  smelly finland  or  dopey denmark  and  wear a  spikey  helmet  carry an  axe and never bathe .. very nice  game", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007669286", "last_played": 1505657493, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 257, "playtime_forever": 291}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505287745, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505287745, "recommendationid": "34914869", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
