I like it enough to recommend it at full price. But there are some flaws; which for some may make it easier to wait until it's down to about $10. \n\nThe bad stuff:\n\nMouse sensitivity! I really need this to be much higher. Even with it turned all the way up, I look around sooooo slooooow.  I would be beyond tickled pink if this could be updated. \n\nChase sequences! For the most part, these are ok. There are a couple that are a little buggy where the person/ghost chasing you moves too fast and instantly kills you. This makes a couple of the achievements incredibly hard. \n\nThe good stuff:\n\nStory! Some of the voice acting was a bit too dramatic for me, but I loved the story a lot! And I also loved all the little side clippings and info that I would find while I explored everywhere.\n\nSpoopy! This game is loaded with spoops. They wear off a bit on multiple playthroughs, but I think they are very well done. \n\nPuzzles! A couple of these were head scratching, but they are all mostly straightfoward and mesh well with the game. \n\nAtmosphere! I was thoroughly creeped out while playing. Spoops aside, an abandoned hospital is always an excellent choice for unsettling feelings.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game quite a lot and hope to see more from these Devs.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997678124", "last_played": 1503592033, "num_reviews": 89, "num_games_owned": 911, "playtime_forever": 1379}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1505220633, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509924", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505220633, "recommendationid": "34900430", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Game has great atmosphere and is generally really good with the scares but if you use a controller you have to use the click turning in VR which i can not stand as it totally kills the immersion.
