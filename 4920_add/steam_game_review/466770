Soundtrack is also nice, it gives me some feelings of nostalgia.\n\nI've played mostly in single-player mode. \n\nSo I've decided to give a few suggestions about it:\n1) At that moment, the main issue with \"arcade mode\" is random level order. It's ok for \"arcade mode\", but I would like to see some \"story mode\", where levels will go in particular order, so I will be able to feel some progress thru the game.\n2) This progress should be saved. The levels are hard and it will be very difficult to complete the game at once.\n3) Single player mode is very hard. It's ok foe me, but maybe it would be better to start with low-difficulty levels and then gradually increase the difficulty?\n4) It's easy to die and reroll merchant's items. Maybe he should have all items every time in singleplayer mode? I'm not sure.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing new singleplayer game modes!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989864371", "last_played": 1499812221, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 108, "playtime_forever": 209}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1473459782, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499164", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1473459782, "recommendationid": "25433251", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
