The overly simplistic HOMAM-like combat is the only additional thing this game has going for it, but it still has that rotten, annoying system where you have to constantly click to gather stuff to progress, and it gets tedious fast. \n\nUnlike other games from this genre, nothing gets collected when you're not playing, so it's required that you waste your time clicking a lot. It seems like the game has decent amount of content, but focus of the game is tedious clicking and micro-managing same things again and again, monotonous without any challenge or possibility to automate things. It's just not worth your time, let alone your money.\n\nBTW: The game is not a resource management simulator, because there would have to be some resource management to begin with. You just click, and numbers raise, you control everything. If you don't have enough resources, you just click some more. That's all there is to it.
