The music is good too.\nThe investigation part through conversations, trying to figure out who the culprit is while staying alive is rather interesting.\n\n[strike]The good parts are brought down by an English translation which leaves a lot to be desired.\nThe text feels dry, stiff and sometimes it doesn't make too much sense. Sometimes it's just a word missing, sometimes it is a typo, sometimes it's a phrase that feels disconnected from what the characters are talking about.\nConsidering what seems to be there of the story is quite intriguing, better care on the translation would have gone a long way into making this more enjoyable.[/strike]\n\n[strike]Another issue I found is with the skip function. Given the 3 chances mechanism in the game to unravel the mystery before it is game over, the skip option is important to jump over what has been read already, but the skip option only seems to work up to a certain point. A little bit after the [spoiler]first death[/spoiler] it seems like the skip option does nothing for the text I have already read.[/strike]\n\n[strike][b]I'm conflicted about the game[/b].\nI feel this is a nice game for the price, but the English text doesn't make me want to give it a fully positive recommendation. After all it is a Visual Novel, reading is pretty important and if the text doesn't flow well and actually works against you by taking you out of the immersion, then most of the experience can fall apart.[/strike]\n\n[strike]I can only say Yes/No and the experience hasn't been negative enough on the whole for me to say No. Translation aside, I enjoy the other parts of what's there.\nFor everyone else though, [b]unless the English translation gets updated, I'd suggest to get this only if you can look past what looks like a shoddy English translation or if the game is on sale[/b][/strike].\n\nThe English translation felt lacking on release but the developer quickly aknowledged the issue and got to work on fixing it.\n\nWhile the translation present in the game now is not the final version, it already reads better and erased the doubts I had on release about fully recommending the game.\nNow the package feels pretty complete for English readers, with a good reading experience along the beautiful art and pleasing music. Considering the developers are still improving the translation, adding some features and fixing other issues I think the game is fully worth the asking price.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198055770803", "last_played": 1501082966, "num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 4902, "playtime_forever": 134}, "votes_up": 26, "timestamp_created": 1500052361, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547811", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1501084447, "recommendationid": "33540311", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "'Cause I'm so bored with Kawai VN games, this game is definitely the one I'm look for.
