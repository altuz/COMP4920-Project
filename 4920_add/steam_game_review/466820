Although Zenodyne was originally released as a freeware title, this remaster/remake irons out many of its rough edges while also taking valuable lessons from team\u2019s previous release, Zenohell and even adding some new ideas of its own. All this while also staying true to creators\u2019 vision of rampaging 90\u2019s shoot\u2019em up action \u2013 but not without some baggage.\n\nFrom the get-go Zenodyne R greets player with a vicious demeanor: waves upon waves of small popcorn enemies firing blindingly fast volleys of aimed shots at the player, larger enemies covering the screen with more elaborate, fixed bullet patterns\u2026 Even sniper tanks make an appearance, taking out less cautious players at the moments notice. It\u2019s no big surprise players are constantly encouraged to burn through their ever so precious resource of screen clearing bombs when things get too hot to handle.\n\nGenre purists immediately recognize these design choices and nods towards more older, especially now long since ceased arcade developer Toaplan\u2019s shooters. That\u2019s not to say Zenodyne doesn\u2019t take some influences from the more contemporary bullet hell shooters, such as their focus shot system that allows player to alter between more wide/focused shot and faster/slower movement speed. All this is rounded up by precise controls which make sure Zenodyne\u2019s core gameplay feels almost as tight as its role models.\n\nAnd that\u2019s pretty much a necessity for a good reason too. \n\nZenodyne R offers a potent challenge even for the most seasoned veterans of the genre. Intermediate and new players will most likely have to either resort to continues just to be able muddle their way through the game or fully embrace the game\u2019s relentless cycle of life and death in order to reach the fabled \u201d1 credit clear\u201d some day. The challenge is certainly intended although not always executed in the most efficient or elegant matter. \n\nThere is this strange duality to Zenodyne\u2019s difficulty. While enemy variety and behavior are a step up from Zenohell\u2019s, there is still too much reliance on quick aimed shots that, once memorized, only provide challenge when they tend to blend with the backgrounds. On the other hand most enemies and bosses often have patterns that are either completely fixed or completely random. These result in some uneven difficulty curve where certain sections can be cleared almost solely through series of tap dodges from side to side while boss patterns can range from laughable to extremely dangerous depending on the amount of randomization present. This becomes more and more apparent towards the later parts of the game. Some smoke and mirrors can lead to rewarding feel of the conquering seemingly insurmountable obstacle but as it stands this aspect feels too prevalent in Zenodyne and it feels especially punishing towards inexperienced players who are not that familiar with the genre. \n\nSome amends have been made towards newcomers. Through playing players accumulate Technical Points that work as an unlock system for extra credits, lore logs and even new playable ships. These offer a nice incentive to keep on playing and since more Tech Points are awarded depending on player's performance, the game delicately steers rookies towards more efficient playstyle. The level design tries to accommodate different skill levels as well in form of  new branching paths. These appear usually at the middle of the stage and are divided to EASY and HARD path. \n\nThese additions are more than welcome but both suffer from the lack of polish. Unlock system is too rigid since everything is unlocked in a certain order and some rewards feel underwhelming. Extra credits are a nice bonus but the lore entries come of as an ham-fisted way of handling the game\u2019s story. New ships are the highlight although their unlock order could\u2019ve been tweaked a little. The first secret ship feels a bit too similar to default one, while second and third ship both have very focused shot type. Maybe Technical Points would\u2019ve worked better as a currency which players then could\u2019ve spent on whatever they are most interested on.\n\nThe bigger problem lies within branching paths which at first seem to add some nice replay value to stages and even dynamic difficulty. However the game never really takes off with this approach. The paths feel all too similar, the biggest chance being enemies shooting more and faster bullets. At least bosses gain more aggressive patterns and even some completely new adversaries show up in the harder paths. But even then around half way through the game sort of forgets the branching path system and railroads player to certain level of difficulty. \n\nThe branching paths present another dilemma as well. As an average player I often found the hard routes a bit too much for my taste. However harder paths naturally offer more scoring potential. Many players may not be that interested playing for score but whenever I chose the easier path I had this nagging feeling that my score potential would stay considerably lower for the rest of the game. This is even more demoralizing when you realize that there\u2019s no differentiation between easy and hard paths on scoreboards. So if you wish to play for score, your only option is to go for harder routes regardless of your skill level. Overall the branching paths are a good idea, they just need better implementation. I\u2019d like to see different paths offer different scoring potential depending on selected ship but this obviously rises its own set of issues such as balancing the score properly for each path. \n\nVisually things have staid more or less the same with small upgrades sprinkled all around. Explosions look still satisfying and all sprites seem to have more detail to them. Besides player ships, animations are still on the sparser side and there is some disparity between enemy, background and boss designs but when things get hectic there rarely is enough time to pay attention to such details. Unfortunately backgrounds can at times look rather hastily constructed and at worst the garish colour choices blend backgrounds with the foreground objects in a distracting manner.\nThe new soundtrack by Hal \"HeavyViper\" Binderman is probably the most noticeable change from the previous game. This time the soundtrack is powered by YM2612 soundchip which brings forth immediate memories from the golden heydays of Sega\u2019s Mega Drive/Genesis. Whether you enjoy this change is purely up to taste but nevertheless the music still perfectly fits the manic pace of the game.\n\nAt its best Zenodyne delivers a distinct adrenaline rush that manages to carve out its own niche somewhere in the middle of slavishly retro and modern danmaku shooters. However the uneven difficulty often comes across as either unsatisfying or frustrating. The new unlock system and branching paths could\u2019ve used more time and care to really shine through. Despite this Zenodyne R shows a notable leap in quality when compared to its predecessor and I\u2019m sure a similar leap will await us in the future when inevitable sequel arrives.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198119306442", "last_played": 1477906010, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 36, "playtime_forever": 1064}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1466774443, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528980", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1466774574, "recommendationid": "23755815", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A high-octane and enjoyable arcade shoot-em-up romp reminiscent of the '90's.  This type of game has been my go-to bread and butter forever, and Zenodyne R absolutely delivers.  The gorgeous 2-D sprites and pixelated soundtrack are enthrallingly nostalgic, and the gameplay is straightforward and flies by at a fast pace.  While Zenodyne is not innovative, it doesn't need to be.\n\nWhat is a little innovative and modern is the progression of unlockables.  As you complete missions, you earn Technical Points (TP).  You use these TP to unlock new ships, extra credits, and lore.  Compared to the past where you simply die over and over to farm the continue credits necessary to complete the game, Zenodyne rewards you for performing better during the mission, choosing Hard mode, and not losing lives.\n\nAlso innovative is the ability to choose easier or harder versions of the second half of each mission.  At the halfway point, you're given the decision to pick either Easy or Hard.  I thought this was a cool addition because it doesn't force you to suffer quite so harshly against a boss you find especially difficult.\n\nA couple minor qualms: the Medals that you collect on-screen are obnoxiously large and distract you from enemies' shots, and the menus are needlessly difficult to navigate as you can't press B to go back (you have to move up and down on the d-pad and select \"Back\").\n\nNonetheless, that's not nearly enough to stop me from recommending Zenodyne.

Zenodyne strikes the right balance of filling the screen with things to dodge, but not so much that you can't get out of most situations with good reactions. Each stage will start you off with a bit of a warm up, throwing smaller enemies until the game asks you to choose to fly through the easy or the hard version of the level, allowing for a branching pathway and letting you decide how confident you feel on the fly. The boss ships attack patterns are particularly well done, forcing you into uncomfortable positions while you wait for an opening to let you get back into a position where you can start shooting again.\nGraphics are crisp and the things that kill you stand out well from the backgrounds, very reminicant style to that of early Genesis shooters.\nThe soundtrack is excellent, I believe rendered on an actual Genesis sound chip, using a lot of the same tricks and sounds that will be very nostalgic to a lot of people.\n-\n(Edit: The game has been patched to give out more tech points than before, fixing the following issue.)\nI find the progression system that is used to unlock things like more continues (eventually a free play mode), extra ships and additional flavour text to be a bit stingy in handing out the medals used to unlock these things.

A lot went into this fixing the flaws of Zenohell and expanding on new ideas.  For starters, the game is overall more fine tuned for balance in difficulty and the ship choices than Zenohell imo.   The game adds easy and hard routes to take so that less experienced players do not have to get crushed by the hard route.  As the player has a choice of difficulty along the way, the game doesn't feel very cheap or unfair, and is not too overbearing or too much of a cakewalk.\n\nThe game also gives a good sense of rewarding the player.  Complete stages, beat hard routes, get through stages without dying, and other tasks will give you additional tech points that go towards unlocking additional content.  The game starts you off with limited continues unlike Zenohell, but you can earn more.  The better you play, the faster the unlocks will come.  Even if you credit feed with what you have to the end of the game you still get tech points so it gives everyone a chance that is not a hardcore shmup veteran.\n\nSeveral new animations added to the player's ship for movement and ship banking are implemented as well, making them more visually appealing while playing.  I feel that the detail of enemy sprites has gone up as well, especially one that I can't spoil in this review from it's predecessor.  ESPECIALLY this one because it gave me chills seeing how much more menacing it appears this time around.  Makes the one in the previous game look like a baby.\n\nAs many people pointed out with Zenohell that it's soundtrack was nice, the soundtrack for Zenodyne R is once again fantastic.  A different approach is taken this time to the tune of a Sega Genesis sound chip.  The way the visuals come together with the music, it really is incredible.  It truly makes me feel like I'm playing a retro game, especially since this makes nods at a few other shmups along the way.  It's enough to make me wonder how well this game could be imported to an actual Sega Genesis cartridge.\n\nI really hope that other people have as much fun with this as I am, and that they also hold the same opinion that this is a step in a better direction than Zenohell.  I'm not saying Zenohell was particularly bad, it's just this game feels more \"right\" with game mechanics and atmosphere.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198128371609", "last_played": 1467856751, "num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 458, "playtime_forever": 360}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1464587975, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502977", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1464587975, "recommendationid": "23286009", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This was easily a day 1 purchase for me and I wanted to wait til I've had at least 5 hours of playtime before reviewing. As someone who grew up in the 80's and 90's on cartridge based consoles, this easily brings that old feeling back: Starts out tough as nails, but as you get further in the game, the earlier stages become easier (and that was hard for me to believe at first). If you favored the type of music that the Sega Genesis punched at you, then your ears will definitely be feasted in this. There's been a slew of anime based bullet hell shmups popping up on steam lately, so this at the same time felt like a breath of fresh air.\n\nThis is pretty much a straight up in your face vert shmup. There are 5 ships in total, but you start with one. There's a point system that rewards you after beating the stage boss. Those points add up and you'll eventually unlock the other ships as well as extra continue credits. This game has 5 stages, but don't let that fool you.\n\nOne interesting feature this game has is that you're asked mid-stage if you want to take the harder route. I don't really feel like it makes the game harder? But there is an extra boss to fight after the main stage boss. \n\nWant tate mode? This has it.\n\nI do feel there needs to be some balance adjustments. For example, the first boss has 3 phases while the boss of stage 2 only has one. I felt it should be the other way around. Sometimes it just seems overbearing with all the activity on the screen followed by a quick moment of nothing. Again, these are brief. Enemy bullets are FAST, so you can't ever turn away, not even for a microsecond. This game defintely keeps you on your toes.\n\nI will continue playing this game even once after I've beaten it.
