This game kinda feels like the creators had a lot of half-finished CG models floating around on their hard drive that they decided to mash together into a mediocre platforming engine and make a \"game\".

The platforming just feels awkward, there are some nasty bugs around and the scene transitions (as is said in other reviews) are of the worst.
