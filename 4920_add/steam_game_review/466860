I was even more excited when I saw this game got released in early access a couple days later so I immediately grabbed it. Well, it was a bit too fast.\n\nMajor con: game is [b]ONLY[/b] in Chinese. \nYep, it was stated in the store description. Here, its a bit of my own fault: I admit I was so excited that I only looked at the promo video (which is in English) and the screenshots. The reason why I'm gonna ask for a refund and why Im writing this review is because devs give themselves another 3 months to release the English version. If they wanted feedback from so few people they should have used another mean of distribution (like a beta or a demo) since they're coming from kickstarter they already had a list of dedicated players for that.\n\nDont get me wrong, I still think this game looks great and Im looking forward to buy it again when the English version get released. I just think they shouldnt had released the game at this stage, even for an early access.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013486414", "last_played": 1488892062, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 1501, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 85, "timestamp_created": 1488892106, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536840", "votes_down": 57, "timestamp_updated": 1488892107, "recommendationid": "30372124", "votes_funny": 29, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "15", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It is a promising sim&management game. However, repeation of clicks makes game play somehow boring.\n\nI think it is neccessary to simplify some of orders or actions so that players don't need to waste time on those things.\n\nSuggestion: 1. it is good if we can set a schedule for prisoners\n\n                     2. cancel the confirmation to receive cargo or products\n\n                     3.
