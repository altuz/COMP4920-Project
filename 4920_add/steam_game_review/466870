Although I did learn some and there was some interactiveness, I don't feel like the game was interactive or informative enough to promote.\n\nIn order to learn about the constellations, you have to connect the stars that are a part of each constellation. You do that by clicking each star included in the constellation. One you connect the constellations three times, you earn three stars and can learn everything about the constellation in the encyclopedia section of the game.\n\nPros:\n- Simple educational tool.\n- Approachable for anyone wanting to learn about constellations.\n- Text is easy to read.\n- Relaxing.\n- Takes little time to finish the constellations.\n- You can turn lines for constellations on and off.\n\nCons:\n- Only includes constellations in the Northern Hemisphere.\n- Stars don't match real brightness.\n- No replayability.\n- Constellation selection map is too large for the screen.\n\nI wish I could recommend this, but without all the constellations included, I feel a little cheated. The game is cheap though, so others might find the experience enough.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198120437431", "last_played": 1505682804, "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 391, "playtime_forever": 27}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505683398, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505683398, "recommendationid": "35033470", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you get it cheap with a coupon, it's worth it, otherwise avoid\n\n[u]The good[/u]\n\nEasy to get a perfect game\nSome educational value\nPleasant music\n\n[u]The bad[/u]\n\nShort, all over in less than an hour, even after idling for cards\nStars don't match their actual brightness\nZero replay value", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009393197", "last_played": 1505515580, "num_reviews": 109, "num_games_owned": 1011, "playtime_forever": 46}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505516163, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499554", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505516163, "recommendationid": "34983047", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I know this an educational software but it's really barebones.
