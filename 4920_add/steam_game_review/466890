I managed to find several flaws within the first 5 minutes of playing. The exposition text allows you to edit it all, No idea how that even works from the player side. As soon as I walk out of the initial tunnel you see various chunks of garbage spawn in the sky and fall to the ground. This includes every bit of trash, debris, car, everything thats not nailed to the ground essentiall falls at the same time. Even when these items fall, theyre still not nailed down as I was able to push cars on the ground and have them fly through the air, the same thing happens with brick walls. After laughing at everything falling at once, I climb ontop of the first hill visable and jump out of the playable zone to walk around in areas I'm not supposed to before falling through the world and having to restart. Venturing back into the world I quickly noticed that the models the developer used for the interior and exterior of the buildings are completly different. Youll walk into a narrow but tall apartment complex, but end up in a massive hospital thats far too big to fit inside the exterior model. There are times where collision detection is non existant as my arms go through certain buildings too. As far as the actual gameplay is concerned, its an objective based shooter sending you from point A to B. The only problem is that the enemies are nearly impossible to kill with the weapons/amount of ammo given. There will be times that you will have more enemies chasing you than you have bullets, and they will be shooting at you non stop creating the most ear shredding sounds. While inside the hospital you are 1shot by everything, and I really do mean everything. There is an animation where a zombie dies and his body explodes sending his guts flying out. As I attempted to walk past the body, my foot would touch on one of the zombies guts and I would instantly die. I played for 1 hour and I would say 45 minutes were me laughing at the game, the last 15 minutes were total frustration as my stream viewers pleaded with me to stop the terrible sound effects. I am giving this a positive score because nobody comes to something like this expecting a quality gameplay experience. If you like to laugh at terrible games than this is the most comedic 50 cent asset flip title I have ever played.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007706278", "last_played": 1489374233, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 247, "playtime_forever": 81}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1495090312, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498258019, "recommendationid": "31817401", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "In my opionion it is a realy poor attempt at a game (probably a first try by the dev). But still it was rushed onto steam way to early without being bug fixed properly. The game has objectives but no proper way of going about looking for them. The game also doesnt give you nealy enough ammo and I have no clue how to get more so when you run out the game is pretty much over after that. \n\n3/10 (cause it opened and could be played)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198107126911", "last_played": 1495433245, "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 53, "playtime_forever": 14}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1495434088, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496477", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1495434088, "recommendationid": "31896509", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
