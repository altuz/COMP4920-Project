I am recommending it on the fact that is is indeed a great concept, but just needs to grow before it is any good. I spent a fair ammount of time searching for another player, wasting time.  Once it grows, however, it will be a lot of fun. If you want to play, you may want to find a few friends to buy it as well, as so that you are more likely to have someone to play with. That said, it does indeed get boring after playing for a while. All in all; good concept, good execution, ruined by lack of other players.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198260927480", "last_played": 1501285179, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 54}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1501294480, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1501294480, "recommendationid": "33870486", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
