Honestly don't waste your time. The game help is anything but. It's has a good premises but it doesn't look like it will be pulled off even though it has potential. If you do end up buying this, trying to figure out how to move is your first road bump. \nMy advise to devs; take the game down, back to the drawing board but with this as the starting point.
