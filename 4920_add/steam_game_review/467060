Having played the very basic (hope this is expanded on a little as otherwise it serves little purpose) 'Tutorial', and then made a start on the prologue here are my thoughts so far:\nControls are easy enough\nGraphics functional.\nSound does the job.\nFairly basic so far, but as it's a prologue then I would expect a nice gentle build up.\nIt has a story so which is interesting enough so far.\n\nBiggest issue so far the human AI is less than that of your everyday zombie. No one seems to flee, they just wait, terror stuck maybe, whilst your hoarde devours them. Soldiers whilst they do shoot back are the same waiting for your approach.\nUsing the age old 'tank rush' sheer weight of numbers has meant no challenge thus far.\n\nThis however is the only real flaw I would offer up currently.\n\nSo Early Access, cheap as chips, well fish and chips any way. So time yet to improve and build.\n\nI'm happy eith my purchase, as such thumbs up, to any one who likes to dip their toes in early and whatch things develop, go for it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197975831685", "last_played": 1484434359, "num_reviews": 34, "num_games_owned": 6099, "playtime_forever": 75}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1476390821, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502700", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1476390821, "recommendationid": "26018682", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A different game, where you control the zombies.

As a Early Access game the package is quite good, with many levels in the history mode that is not that deep but is interesting. Visually the game looks cool, with a mix of old school with modern graphics that makes the game unique and interesting, although some of the textures are not that great. There are also some homages to the zombie genre that are fun to find and try to guess where it was inspired from. The gameplay and camera movement is a little stiff and requires some getting used to, but it works fine and doesn't compromise the experience. The price is at a fair point and It is worth the buy, especially if you consider it is an Early Access and improvements are being made very often.
