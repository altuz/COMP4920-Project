Hopefully a more complete review will follow soon.)\n\nA Game of Changes\u2026\u2026where to begin. How about 2,500 years ago? The I Ching, or Book of Changes is one of the most influential texts in the history of the world, studied by countless millions to this day. As such it's a natural to be the basis for a quite simple (but sometimes quite complex), interesting and generally relaxing modern game. (Please, bear with a brief but necessary history, then this reviewer will try to relate that history to an understanding of this fairly simple (HA!) game. I assure the reader, the game is more interesting and fun than this part of the review. It won\u2019t hurt much, I promise.) In brief, the I Ching is a sort of system for understanding the world surrounding all mankind, and even a form of fortunetelling based in a very computer-familiar binary system. There are hexagrams (or groups of six lines) in the I Ching, each of the six being either a complete or a divided/broken line (essentially either a \u201czero\u201d or \u201cone\u201d), so there are 64 I Ching hexagrams in all (2 to the 6th power.) Each I Ching hexagram has a name, and information attributed to it that may be of specific importance to the individual (or gamer) doing the research at that time and place. This is mentioned because these hexagrams will appear regularly throughout this game, as will the chart of all 64.\n\nA Game of Changes (AGOC) is more than one thing. As far as Steam, it\u2019s substantially a puzzle game, growing in complexity as the gamer progresses. The protagonist finds himself (the character is a bearded \u201che\u201d) in a landscape to be traversed, and then exited once an I CHING hexagram has been created by chance or choice, based on the path taken. The field is made of pillars, many displaying symbols which can be utilized to raise or lower OTHER pillars for access. As mentioned, travel requires the player to choose an I Ching hexagram to help determine where his journey will next take him. Once achieved, the exit gate will open. The next destination\u2026\u2026?\n\nThe I Ching allows users to throw straws as a method of divination (or fortunetelling) and AGOC allows the same by permitting either chance or conscious decision to choose his journey for him. As such, AGOC is, in addition to a puzzle game, a method of looking at life with the goal of a greater understanding of the HOWs and WHYs. How all 64 hexagrams/landscapes come together in one greater puzzle has yet to be determined by this player. Just as in life, there is little handholding in AGOC.\n\nA Game of Changes has such lovely music and endearing graphics, and the game play is so intuitive and simple, I think that rage is pretty much out of the question. Any time danger is near (such as falling to one\u2019s death), an exclamation mark shows above the player. But if life still goes awry, pressing the backspace key will return you to your prior safe point (usually. Since sometimes the result is a \u201cdeath loop\u201d each short landscape can easily be restarted with little lost.) AGOC can be played with the mouse and keyboard, but this reviewer really doubts you\u2019ll want to. Movement can require multiple keys, and sometimes sequential movements need be done rather (but not overly) quickly. Considering that camera movement likely will need to be controlled at the same time, the mouse/keyboard can be pretty awkward to use in conjunction with the sometimes limiting camera angles. FORTUNATELY, a gamepad-type controller can be used for great simplification. Unfortunately, nothing this player saw on any screen indicates this option. Had I not seen the controller reference on the Store Page, I might have given up on this interesting game for that reason alone. Also, screen instructions are specific to mouse/KB, with no instructions as to rebinding, or how the controller usage may compare to the keyboard keys (which might be a very handy feature for the immediate future. Hint, hint.) It may be necessary to experiment a bit. Or like this player did, just give up and use KB keys when in doubt.\n\nA Game of Changes may come in at a price point about double that of the average Steam puzzle game, but please consider it as something more. AGOC may actually provide fun AND a chance for personal growth. If you have had any interest in eastern philosophies, you may wish to treat yourself to something a little special, in which case the few dollars extra really won\u2019t matter. As such, perhaps a niche market, but a very special niche indeed.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198140299850", "last_played": 1502910527, "num_reviews": 112, "num_games_owned": 1211, "playtime_forever": 93}, "votes_up": 31, "timestamp_created": 1465159094, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1465197249, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550469", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1465171401, "developer_response": "wow, thanks your comments.
