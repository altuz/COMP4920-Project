Derivative. Outdated. Functional. Lenghty. Boring. Grindy. Tedious.\n\nYou know those warcraft 3 scenarios where you controlled the minotaur king and did mini quests and explored around? Kind of like a precursor to world of warcraft, blizzard trying its hand at rpg elements. Well this is just like that except without the playtested balance between player and environment, randomized loot, worse voice acting, somehow poorer looking, and none of that cool warcraft lore to keep you invested\n\nEven on easy difficulty only way to progress is to kite ennemies one by one sometimes, perhaps it improves as game progresses and you get more loot and higher powered abilities. Story seemed rather generic warcraft clone style thing with orcs(firbolgs) and humans being at war, playing a knight doing errands for the king.\n\nNot to mention user interface feels somewhat clunky"}]}
