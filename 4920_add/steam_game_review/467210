It's not short, and quite challenging!\nWhen I review games on Steam I seldom make -comparations- with other Flash/free/Kongregate games, but I still think that one can not say (as other reviewers do) just like \"this is a copy of that game\". If this game is beautiful and it's not, of course, an illegal plagiarism, I rate this one and if you want to go on Kongregate (where I'm at an insane level and have been playing there since 10 years btw XD) and play the other one you're free to do it, but I don't think that this could be a reason to downgrade the Steam game.\nEven because as I was saying there are of course many optical illusions/puzzles/find-the-path games, but this one is unique and doesn't plagiarize anything. \nIf you can get this one maybe on discount it's relaxing and worth the price :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198356141989", "last_played": 1505683358, "num_reviews": 114, "num_games_owned": 225, "playtime_forever": 148}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1505675802, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516748", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505675802, "recommendationid": "35031153", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
