It's a nifty indy game with an interesting story line. As it stands now though the game is closer to an EA state than something I'd expect in a release.\n\nMissing Features/Bugs:\nMouse support - Control is keyboard only (arrow key style), no mouse even in menus.\nMutiple resolution support - Windowed mode at a small resolution only. Cannot modify resolution or play full screen.\nDisplay bug - When playing sometimes assets, like an enemy will not be displayed. Once this happens additional assets seem to go black. Currently I'm fighting a battle with only my party on a black screen.\n\nIt's also a bit pointelessly grindy, you can replay any mission you want as many times as you want to earn points. Those points can be used to increase the stats of any character. You end up grinding the same levels over and over to pump stats to keep getting 3-stars on missions. Go overboard and gameplay is pretty much broken.\n\nI'd hope the developer addresses at least the glaring bugs. The story line is nifty enough to make me ignore the grindy bits.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018756376", "last_played": 1501967172, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 304, "playtime_forever": 114}, "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_created": 1501967608, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1504054344, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545492", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1501967608, "developer_response": "Thank you for your feedback and the review!
