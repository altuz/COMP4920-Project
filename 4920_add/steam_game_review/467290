If you don't know anything about The Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy, and you don't like British comedy or point and click adventure games, than this game is not for you. If you do like Douglas adams's most famous book series, then you won't be disappointed.\n\nStarship Titanic starts off with you, the player, sitting in your living room when all of a sudden, a giant spacecraft crashes through your ceiling. A slender like man enters your home from the spaceship and tells you that something horrible has happened in the spaceship, and that he needs your help. You agree to help him and he begins to explain how the ship has been sabotaged and that all of the ship's robots, including himself, have gone crazy. You then enter a lobby and your adventure on the Starship Titanic begins.\n\nLet's talk about the game! Starship Titanic is a point and click adventure game where your goal is to find parts of the spaceship that have been scattered throughout the game. Almost every part represents a part of the human body, and they can be really hard to find without a walkthrough, which leads me to my first problem. You can't beat this game your first try without a walkthrough, trust me, I tried. Luckily, the game gives you 2 robots to talk to that will help you throughout your adventure, the only problem is, the A.I is limited to what you say to them. The dialogue system in this game is like a DOS text adventure game where you have to type in where you want to go and what you want to do, which could lead to problems. However, the A.I seems to respond to almost anything you tell them, even \u201cF*** you\u201d, so it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. If you get lost in the game, or you don\u2019t know where to go, then I recommend asking the elevator bot.\n\nIf you remember my first review, I covered Puzzle Agent. In the review, I talked about how each character had a unique personality, well this game\u2019s characters are not too different. The fact that the first robot in the game tells you that all of the robots on the ship have gone crazy is a good sign that you are going to run into some interesting people. I love how each character represents some sort of stereotype; you\u2019ve got the french robot who cooks good food and who\u2019s quote unquote romantic, you\u2019ve got the desk lady who doesn't like anybody, the guy who hates his job and loves anarchy, the butler who will help you 24/7, and much, much more. In short, if you are a fan of the weird characters it the Hitchhiker's Guide series, then you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re getting yourself into while playing this game.\n\nOkay we\u2019re almost done, just 2 more things until I give the game its score. Number one, you can\u2019t beat this game without a walkthrough. Now I know I mentioned this earlier, but I can\u2019t stress this enough, there\u2019s so many parts in this game where all you have is guesswork. If you have played Castlevania II, and know about the tornado, then I\u2019ll be happy to let you know that this game is full of things like that. Finally, Number 2, the game\u2019s plot and ending. The game isn't just about crazy robots, apparently there\u2019s an even bigger story that I\u2019m not going to talk about because it\u2019s just too big and complicated for me, and the ending doesn\u2019t help. The ending comes when you put the parts back together, and when you do, you will find out that the ship is being controlled by a big blue lady. Once you put here back together, she sends you home, only for you to find out that there is no point in going back home, it\u2019s been destroyed. You also find out that the captain of the ship now lives on earth and is spending the rest of his life fishing, making you the new captain, so yo fly away and that\u2019s it. Now the ending wasn\u2019t bad, but I\u2019m pretty sure that If I knew more about the story, then the ending would make more sense to me, but that\u2019s just my opinion.\n\nOkay, ratings time! I\u2019m going to give this game a 6/10, the reason why I\u2019m giving this game such a low score is because, you will get the same experience out of watching a walkthrough of this game, than if you were to play this game yourself. You know you shouldn\u2019t get a game if someone tells you that watching a walkthrough is no different, but hey, if you are a serious fan, than I recommend buying it. Anyway, I\u2019m giving this game the \u201cBest Robots\u201d award, just because I love the character design and the personalities.
