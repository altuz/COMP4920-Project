Occasional crashing.\n\nConstant asset recycling. Many ease of use features like holding click to move do not work or items that you can wear keeping their names red despite meeting requirements. No exposition, world lore, goals or anything. Game boils down to a tedious slow paced clicker to dispatch uninspired skeletons that you can aggro in one by one. No voice acting. Sound design and to a lesser extend the 3D models were somewhat acceptable if generic. Level design is mostly corridor like."}]}
