Of the five games available, God of Word looked the most appealing on the surface. When I started playing it, I wasn't disappointed with what the game had to offer.\n\nIn God of Word, the player controls a warrior battling through various monsters and beasts based on Greek mythology. In order to slay each creature, the player has to spell out words with the tiles the game provides. The tiles can be traded in for a cost, but for most creatures, trading isn't necessary. Tiles can be selected with the keyboard or the mouse.\n\nPros:\n- Controls are easy.\n- Game is easy to look at and read.\n- Goals are clearly explained.\n- Bosses are challenging but not impossible.\n- Many levels to play through.\n- Words already spelled are displayed onscreen.\n- Unlockable items add to the game and look good.\n- Some achievements feel like they have to be earned, but they're not unbearable to get.\n\nCons:\n- Little replayability after the story is over.\n- One or two achievements may feel like a chore.\n- Can get repetitive.\n- Story route is not a straight line. Map has shoot-offs that the character may skip over if left to his own devices.\n- Everything has timers.\n\nPeople looking for a fun word game with good achievements will find a fun challenge here. Others looking for a great word game will likely have a good time with God of Word.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198120437431", "last_played": 1499908661, "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 391, "playtime_forever": 555}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505074523, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505074602, "recommendationid": "34870365", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
