It's challenging, but not unfair. You play as a healer out for revenge after his party is killed by a dragon. \n\nIt has a unique soundtrack. I like it, but I've always liked weird indy music and weird indy games. \n\nUnlike many indy games, a controller works very well. I haven't even tried the keyboard controls. The hitboxes are perfect. \n\nThe game itself is simple but challenging. Most of the time your objective is to reach a certain spot on the map, collect a certain item, destroy a certain item, find a certain NPC or protect a certain NPC\n\nOnce you get past the difficulty curve, the game is a joy to play.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049733975", "last_played": 1495843608, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 463, "playtime_forever": 1981}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1492733242, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1492733242, "recommendationid": "31265667", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
