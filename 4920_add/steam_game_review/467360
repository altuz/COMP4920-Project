The game takes about half an hour to complete and has 2 slightly different endings depending on your actions towards merchants within the station that you explore.\n\nOff-Peak at it's core is a trippy dream like land that seems to follow it's own rules, and it's own narrative that has this strange leader whose name is peppered through conversations of the inhabitants within the world.\n\nAt the start of the game a person named [b]Luuke[/b] sends you out to find the pieces of ticket that he misplaced. You have 8 pieces to collect as you traverse through this wonderfully detailed station, speak with merchants and others who seem to inhabit this place.\n\nThe game is very deliberate in avoiding what the fate all of these people have, their motives for being there and even what Marcus's deal is, it's however done in a way that keeps you engaged. It's such an in-depth world with many people to interact with and it's worth going that extra way even once you've put your ticket together to see what random inhabitants have to say. \n \n[b]Graphics[/b]: Looks like a bit of an acid trip, but the detail to the art which it contains is amazing. Textures are very polished, character design is really good and it's just an all round pretty game. \n\n[b]Soundtrack[/b]: The music to this is by far one of my favourite things to this game. It's the perfect addition to it giving you that trippy atmospheric immersion. Thanks [b]Archie Pelago[/b]!!  \n\n[b]Menu[/b]: Text built into the start of the game to give you a rundown of it's basic controls and it works wonderfully to just throw you straight in. \n\n[b]Final Conclusion[/b]: I absolutely love this game. It's kind of like a fancy walking simulator but doesn't feel like one at the end of it all. The music ties perfectly with the atmosphere, the art is incredible and the polished pretty graphics help it be just that little bit extra. \n\nDuring the game, you tend to find putting the ticket together is a bit of an afterthought as you lose yourself in exploring your surroundings. Once you have completed your ticket, it's almost sad that you don't have anymore of the world to delve into. \n\nIt gives you a trippy dream like experience in which nothing feels real, nothing fully makes sense and even at the end of it all you have many unanswered questions.\n\nIt's very much worth a look at and play through. The developers clearly put a lot of thought and detail into this creation - it pays off and it shows. Very keen for the sequel called The Norwood Suite hopefully making it's way to steam greenlight soon!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198047266382", "last_played": 1487203188, "num_reviews": 63, "num_games_owned": 812, "playtime_forever": 90}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1487209037, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513100", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487209037, "recommendationid": "29953271", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[h1] Psychedelic Art Museum Walking Simulator at it's finest.\t[/h1]\n\nThe aesthetic of this game is easily the best part, at least for me. It made me feel like I was wandering around those CD-ROM magazines like Blender/Launch from the 90s that had weird point and click adventure style elements that led you to articles/videos/images. I just finished playing around with it and I can say that I'm really impressed. The music is definitely the main draw, it is incredible. The way it weaves into the setpieces (more on that soon) it feels like it is giving you context for what's being said around you. The imagery and all the various places you can find and explore is varied and well done. I can't say too much without spoiling things you should stumble upon. Pay attention to what you're seeing, what you're reading and what you're hearing to really get what is being shown to you. I first took my time just finding which areas triggered new songs just that is in and of itself a great time. \n\n[spoiler] There are two endings.
