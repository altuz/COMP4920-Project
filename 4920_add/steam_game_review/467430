Not bad, just not my thing.\n\nMy Farm Life is part sim (building up your farm over time) and part time management (timed levels with specific goals). I like the fact that you don't have to start from scratch every level, and overall the game's not bad.\n\nTerrafarmers is the most interesting, and was for me worth the ($.59 on summer sale) price of admission for the bundle. It's basically a sci-fi themed Farm Frenzy, with cute art and short levels with challenging time limits. The click-and-drag mechanic is a bit clunky, but nevertheless I really enjoyed playing it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198087834803", "last_played": 1500042113, "num_reviews": 144, "num_games_owned": 2810, "playtime_forever": 564}, "votes_up": 24, "timestamp_created": 1467250152, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556150", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1469514389, "recommendationid": "23941750", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Good mix of farming games. I already owned and enjoyed both of the My Farm Life games previously, but they were worth replaying, with some more value in the rest of the bundle.\n\nThe Virtual Farm games are quite basic farm sims with a trading element. I felt the first one was a clickfest but not a particularly fun one, while the second one had the opposite problem of requiring me to wait until trades were completed before I could do anything else. I could probably get some more out of these if I tried but didn't find them particularly appealing.\n\nTropical Farm is, well, I guess it qualifies as a farming game. Planting is limited to about a dozen pre-determined spots, with a few animals thrown in to boot. Not necessarily a bad game, but more an entry level game to the genre.\n\nTerrafarmers isn't exactly what I think of when I think of farming games, but it blends different game types into a fun package. For the most part, the animals produce products that you can then cook or blend to make more expensive products, all of which you can either sell for their standard price or to customers who pay based on how quickly you can service them. This is mixed with some pirate attacks to kind of throw you off, but I never found this as much of a turn off as I found the pests in Farm Frenzy to be.\n\nMy Farm Life and My Farm Life 2 follow a farm you build over the course of a 50 episode season as you must learn to satisfy an increasing volume of different products. This is more what I think of when it comes to a traditional farming game in which you plant produce, but along with Terrafarmers makes it well worth the rather cheap price.\n\nI bought this during the summer sale for 59 cents, which works out to about a penny per hour.

It's something completely different. It changed my life,  I think it's for the better. The emotional value this game has given is too great for me to fully comprehend.

I've invested so much into this game that my friends and family are starting to worry about me. I don't know how much more I can take. I've gone to rehab because I've become addicted to these games. Professional help has not helped me at all. If anything, my addiction has only grown stronger. I've lost almost all of the friends I have. The friends I do have remaining just don't believe that it can be this good, so I bought it for one of them. It has changed thier life, and I believe he might be falling down into the addiction that these games will bring. I can't bear to play any other game anymore. I've become to enveloped into this hell that I can't turn back. I believe that the only way for me to truly escape now is to end it all. So after I finish writing this review, I'm going to end it.
