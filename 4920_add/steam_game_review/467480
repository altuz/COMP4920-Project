So bare with me.\n\nThis is actually pretty cool. One of the more education based applications for the Vive that I've seen. I didn't spend too much time in it, as I had other obligations to tend to very briefly after purchasing this. You can explore either a plant organism or your own hand, and \"zoom in\" through the different levels (ie skin, cells, nucleus, subatomic, blood cells, etc) and explore the inner mechanisms of whatever organism you pick. There is very detailed explanation of everything you look at and even a cool little percentage to let you know how much of the organism you explored, giving it a game-like element. I really enjoyed it.\n\nPros:\n-Cool concept\n-Interesting and accurate science application\n-Game-like exploration factor\n-Great learning tool\n-Really awesome visuals\n\nCons:\n-Limited content, but it is day one\n-In-game controls shake a lot\n-Could be optimized better\n-It didn't bug me, but I can see how the \"zoom in\" animation could easily make some people sick\n\nRating: 8/10\nReally cool, educational application.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010243063", "last_played": 1471998029, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 849, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1470345968, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519576", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1470345991, "recommendationid": "24714864", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great potential, bad execution and progress.\n\nThe developer had grand plans for this application.

The concept, however, is excellent.
