The puzzles are passable, not so easy that you can solve them without thinking; at the same time not challenging enough to make you feel accomplished by completing them.\nThe game fall preys to the typical issues with point and click adventures, inept character, nonsensically discarding objects after a single use, roundabout solutions and lots of time spent clicking across a screen cluttered with objects to find the right spot to progress.\nThere is also no choices to be made on your part, with only a single solution to every problem and no agency on your part, making it feel like you are just along for the ride.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is it's tone, it's story is serious (or at least attempts to be), but it operates in the same way as classical LucasArts game does; but is completely devoid of the zaniness, humor and insane logic that makes those games enjoyable AND the characters actions and puzzle solutions justifiable.\n\nIf you are going to buy it; do so when it's on sale as it otherwise (in my opinion) is not worht the price.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198014218121", "last_played": 1502145832, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 235, "playtime_forever": 199}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502148372, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1502148372, "recommendationid": "34091686", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
