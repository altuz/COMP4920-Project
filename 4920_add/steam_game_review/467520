If done correctly, this would have beaten any Paradox game in terms of depth and immersion, but what you get is a buggy and unstable \"simulation\" that will make you lose support and get anti-capitalist riots if you dare to lower the taxes, where attacking terrorists that hide in the town with several fighters would cause the people to revolt against you instantly, and where things like private education or healthcare are unthinkable. Overall, I would love this to work. I love the system of interaction with A LOT of different characters - politicians, governors, military men, secret agents, famous people like writers or athletes or even your wife and parents. This could have been insanely good, especially after years and years of constant development, but failed miserably. Don't buy it, unless maybe on -80% or -90% sale. It's not worth 10$ and will make you furious when you lose your save for tenth time in a row and have to start all over again. \n\n[b]What works[/b]\n1. The great system of organizing meetings with different people, even though it gets repetitive after a while and there are not that many things to say. \n2. Military stuff is alright, not nearly as good as Paradox's games or even Supreme Ruler, but it's alright. \n3. Diplomacy is done alright and makes sense, but I would never call it \"realistic\". On realistic setting, in just a month, Afghanistan attacked Pakistan and Syria attacked Iraq. Almost every time. \n4. Map is alright, and I love how there are many different regions, like all the US states, although the regions are too random at times - I don't like how in Syria the regions don't cover the Kurdish areas so you could create a realistic Kurdish state. \n5. You get Wikipedia links to articles that describe issues that you have to decide on. That's a nice touch.\n6. The revolutions and riots inside your cities that you have to take care of are a nice touch. \n\n[b]What doesn't work[/b]\n1. The price and the DLCs. The game is WAY overpriced and the DLCs are really pathetic - the in-game editor that breaks your game after a while, every single time, and a modding tool that is buggy as hell and mods are usually unstable too. All that for a price of an AAA title. Go figure. \n2. 3D models of characters - there are just a few of them, excluding the leaders and in some cases some important politicians - you get Jeb Bush for example, but not Rand Paul, for example. \n3. Too few political ideologies - there are no proper libertarians, greens, and terrorists' ideology is \"royalist\". Seriously?\n4. Economy is broken. Signing like 50 good or decent contracts with other countries and lowering the taxes a bit will easily get you a 60% GDP rise in a month, which is hard to stop and makes your inflation fly off the charts. What's more, most of my contracts were simply to sell my pharmaceutics across Europe as the US, along with maize, pork, beef, and some other stuff, while getting resources that I need - steel, bauxites, robots, coal, fuel - I negotiated reasonable prices for each good, which I guess simulates the international trade fairly well, but no - doing that will destroy the balance and make the game extremely gamey. Why even bother with the contract system then?\n5. For whatever reason there are no real names and mods that allow them are buggy. \n6. There is no private initiative in most areas - no private education, healthcare, research, insurance - you get stuck with public one and high taxes. Not really good if you want to try a more conservative or libertarian approach.  \n7. Unrealistic reactions of your voters - almost every tax reductions end in popular unrest of anti-capitalists that somehow managed to get multi-million organizations in the US that can co-ordinate unrest accross America, you can cancel reimbursing people for doctor appointments and hospital visits almost entirely, but as long as you spend some more money on handicapped, emergency services and maternity care, it almost evens out. Bombing a town in the middle of Afghanistan with a few planes will result in an instant revolution. Is that \"realistic\"?\n8. Bugs and terrible stability - your game will crash often, especially if you want to use the god'n spy DLC. You basically pay money to destroy your game. Classy. \n\n[b]Summary[/b]\nThey couldn't make it work many years ago, they can't make it work now. It's an overpriced trash.\n\nEven despite all that, I till hope that this can some day become the next Pride of Nations - a great game with a lot of depth and an amazing military system, but one that was once unbelievably buggy and unstable, and was so sluggish on a high-end PC that it was impossible to play. It's a great game now and easily beats Paradox's famous Victoria and Victoria 2 in pretty much every category. They've been patching it for years now, and you can really see their great dedication to a title that never sold that well and people who trusted them, and really earned my respect. Hope that this would some day finally happen to Geopolitical Simulator as well. It can be great, just needs a lot of polish.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1403, "steamid": "76561198032776165", "last_played": 1507059169, "num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 428, "playtime_forever": 1403}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1506966332, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519702", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507029399, "recommendationid": "35424735", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The most realistic modern, grand strategy/political games to date in my opinion.
