Except of course they have added some new stuff, y'know..... units, buildings, research tree items etc. They have also fixed the treasury / resources problem of the first game. In MH1 you could not, even as a superpower such as the USA, keep your various resources stocked up, and as for your treasury, that just went down and down and down until you was at 200 billion in debt!\n\nHere in MH2 it is very easy to keep healthy stocks of all commodities, purely from your own domestic provinces - no need to even look at the \"world market\" or trade at all! Your treasury also is easy to keep up as well, as your not spending billions per turn on profane ammounts of imports!!!!!\n\nThe above is a good job though, as this time, here in MH2, the trading system is just not that well implemented. Most attempts at get another country to trade with you will fail, unless you offer only paltry insignificant trade quantities. Other countries will make you offers, but only rarely.\n The \"world market\" works, in it's own autonomous way, but try to trade with another specific country - forget it!\nYou also still cannot trade in military units neither, so if you wanted to replicate the UK's lend/lease of destroyers and tanks from the USA - then tough. The game no can do. All the units you have are what you can build within you own country.\n\nUnits are still fully generic units, eg \"medium tank\", \"horse artillery\", \"early bomber\" etc..... no specific units eg \"M4A2 Sherman\". Unit stats and combat mechanics are still way too oversimplistic.\n\nThe research tree is very topsy-turvy..... example, items that unlock WW1 era aircraft that should appear right at the game start, takes a huge amount of research to get to..... you'll be lucky to get to WW1 planes by the late 30's!\nAt least research points and industrial points are now separated from each other, it was bizarre to see (in MH1) a few universities using up all your physical industrial output, despite research being mostly \"brain power\" rather than physical industrial might. Here in MH2 research does not make demands on your factories!\n\nThat simplisticity is still what makes MH2 stand out from many other geopoliticals, just like it did for MH1. Players who just could not enjoy Hearts of Iron or Europa Universalis series may enjoy this. The turn based system also makes it even more stress-free to play. No having to juggle 30 battles across the whole world map in full real time!\n\nThe trouble is, whereas MH1 was bug-free (heh - mostly anyway) I'm afraid MH2 is not. The AI is terribad! It still does not seem to be able to conduct marine warfare. Don't confuse that with naval warfare, the AI will happily throw warships around, but it will not use transports to send armies to invade overseas territory. So, when under the AI, countries like Japan get nowhere at all in these Making History series!\n\nAlso whilst playing  a sandbox game that starts at the Jan 20th 1933 coming to power of Hitler, I found all kinds of bizarre world events going on. Tiny rogue nations that I've never heard of kept \"declaring independance\" of their dominate state and \"declaring war\"..... it happened several times with Quebec (of all places!!!!!) violently breaking free from Canada! Only to be quashed back into Canada a few turns later. One happened with a completely never heard of \"Nguniland\" suddenly appearing at Durban, South Africa. Within ten turns this seemingly powerless tribal nation had utterly destroyed all of South Africa, what should be the most powerful African nation in the game, completely!!!!! And beyond! They also occupied the entire southern continent - ecompassing not just South Africa, but modern day Botswana, Zimbabwe, Dem.Rep of Congo, Uganda..... well you get the idea.\nThe United States collapsed into a third world economy by 1936, all it's regions degenerated to only having a puny 1 or 2 \"industrial production points\", for no seemingly good reason! It was behind even Mongolia in the \"world industrial power\" rankings! Germany was doing nothing to attempt to rearm itself! The war against Japan, Korea and China was just not happening as in real life back in the early 30's.\nAnd even by 1936, every country was still stuck with WW1 -  early 1920's era technology..... none of the equipment commonplace in the 1930's was even close to being developed yet!\nEven the \"viewing angle\" of the main screen's map is just eye-bending, it's all done at such a crazy, oblique angle!!!!!\n\nSo, in sandbox mode, the game is just a bizarre fantasy of the world in the 30's and 40's!\n\nGood job there is an editor that you can make (and hopefully script the AI into having some vestige of nounce) your own world situations with!\n\nOverall 7/10..... yes I recommend it because of it's low price, and it being so, so, so the much needed, easy to play, antidote to brain exploding geo-politicals like HoI3..... and MH2 keeps the old \"turn based\" philosophy flag flying! But with all the quirks, retarded AI and 100% broken trade system..... I only just barely recommend it."}]}
