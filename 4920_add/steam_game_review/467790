I picked it up for 2 reasons tbh\n\n1.) \"Mods and Source Code\nWe are very happy to help you pull the game apart and explain how it was made, and what some of the lessons learned, design decisions, and insights from the project were. If you're interested in programming games from the ground up in C or C++, distributing for multiple platforms, or programming OpenGL computer graphics, or just curious about how the \"guts\" of these things look, then you will enjoy following along and chatting with us. We will most likely try a combination of written, video, stream, and forum content. We've kept the game really easy to mod, so if you want to replace the art, make new enemies or maps you can do so. You will of course have access to the source code, warts and all, so you can see how it was done and modify it.\" \n\n    I wish MORE devs would do this!!! i would love to learn how to make a game from you Guys/Gals this game is absolutely fun!\n\n2.) Ive been looking for a great challenging yet fun perma death game to fill my time until necropolis.\n   \n           This game has done that and more already. I know i only have 25ish minutes but thats cuz i have work in 7 hours and need a little sleep rofl xD but seriously here are my personal pro/con list for this game\n\n\n  Pros:\n+Awesome Soundtrack\n\n+Challenging enemies (plz dont change that aspect of the game, i loved the ambush in level 2)\n\n+Hidden doors!!!\n\n+3 diff weapons (javelin for ranged. i can hold 4. A Sword which is your basic and a golden warhammer that 2 or 3 shots captains)\n\n+Level/Story is well designed\n\n+LEVEL EDITOR\n\n+Devs might be teaching everyone how to make a game essentially by modding and explaining using their own game. genious.  (im so hoping i read all this right i am tired lol xD it would be amazingly nice and cool of you devs as its a dream of mine and many others im sure)\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Sometimes a stone door wont open and i have to die and retry to get it to open.( only happened 2 times now)\n\n-Controller options isnt very clear. example: instead saying. square is to jump its B2 in options. not really a big deal but it still bugged me :(\n\n-1 more controller thing. start doesnt start the game or pause. left trigger pauses and square (or x for 360) gets you off title menu\n\n-Attacks feel slow compared to movement speed for both you and npcs except the archers they shoot pretty fast\n\n-no way to block that i have found but that may be a controller option issue im not 100% will look at options again after work 2moro and update my review\n\nAll in all i would honestly recommend this to people and plan on buying it for a few friends as well so we can make levels together and challenge each other\n\n8/10! <3", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198133151090", "last_played": 1466135215, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 318, "playtime_forever": 30}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1465983119, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504882", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1465983325, "recommendationid": "23566768", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A puzzle game.... argh a dungeon crawler.... well... in the end the game turned into a runner for me.\nLets start with the basics a tactics, puzzle game where you have to get to the end of the level, the game gives you stats at the end based upon the time, kills and gold collected in the levels. Implying to myself that the game wants you to not only kills enemies but wants you to explore all of it, which is a problem and ill come to that soon. So what is competent about the game, the graphics looked alright for a top down game with the hand drawn style giving the game a cute paper cut out look which worked well enough for this game and all the models and textures seem to fit with each other this is good for an indie game and the feel of the game would not of been added to with any extra in this area would be wasted.\n\nThe game has a \"massive\" offering of 8 levels, of which given the par time offer a whole 20-30mins of play, but with the trial and error aspects of the game you could get 2 hours of play out of the game, want to try and be a completionist 4-5 hours, but you're not going want to try and do the all kills part and ill explain that soon. The game rotates around 3 main weapons, first being the spear ranged weapon you can carry up to 4 at a time, with a nice slow throw, the main sword and hammer with the only differences here being the hammer interacts with the environments so you can knock columns down. Opening great puzzle ideas? yeah probably but nothing worthwhile I found with most just being used in parts you that are just making bridges. Enemies on offer to you are close melee, ranged and surprise enemies which is enough variety to keep it fresh but the simplicity in the enemies is a mute point as I found the way to deal with all of them is just to keep moving and even better is to not to fight them. Items you find hidden around are either gold items or health items, there is no more levels of complexity offered through items, on top of that the game could of been offered some sort of customisation through this. Each time you start the game you get your sword and that's it you keep nothing from the previous levels their is no progression, no grind just a small few levels of which you have to learn to the layout of to get through once you know the layouts the game offers very little extra to keep you interested. There is some..... story? well there is green crystals around that offer some fluff lines and hints about the puzzles but as most extend to press this level and go back to that door then I think hints are pushing it a little too far.\n\nThe game fell down for me as the game turned into a runner this was due to the combat of the game being miserable and less imaginative then 2 Victorian gentleman slapping each other with gloves. With no dodging or blocking the game turns into I swing, you swing, let see who dies. This pushes the game dynamics toward move and hit which can be very enjoyable, which CAN BE, normally this would involve dual analog stick movement so you can control your angle as you swing, but this game as chosen not to offer dual sticks and only movement you have is that so you have to face where you are swinging and to be moving that way. The swings take so long to complete from command to hit with too many additional frames offering no sense of feel to the combat and boiling it down further into a game of guess swinging. \nAlso look at the par times in the game, this again implies to me that they wanted you to run the game as quickly as possible, make more sense to me if this was a target time rather than a par time, but it is the par time how are you suppose to find the hidden areas within this time, even speed running an area I just missed the \"par\" time.\n\nSo the most important dynamic in a runner is controls, keep them nice and tight and keep the frames down and this game decides like a 3 year old sticking his fingers in a plug socket they think they know best and the movement is not only floaty, it make jumping onto platforms that you do from time to time just aggravating, when you try to turn and corner quickly you end up caught on the edge of a wall then are forced to fight you should just restart the level and try again. As you turn seems to take an extra half a tile or so from command to turn to turning as you slide.\n\nWould I recommend the game?\nNo, the core concept of the game is just boring and doesn't work well together, I found myself not being offered a worthwhile challenge, nor did I find myself caring about the world or character. The game seems to be championing a map editor but while the core gameplay does not work in my opinion that being the battle system then please if you wish to make a game then look under the game development areas and pick something the is made to make games, not this game as the engine of the game is so poor.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/x_jW4rmgrS8\n(Video only)\nOf script.... map editor", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994868319", "last_played": 1467814077, "num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 128}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1467824803, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507636", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1467824803, "recommendationid": "24138425", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great top-down barbarian smashing action, with a really fun storyline and nods to many classic PC action games (you will chuckle as much as I did when you see them).  Crongdor is a no-nonsense, frequently hilarious barbarian whose main goal in life is to get his hairy paws on loot (it turns out he's rubbish with savings plans), and his modus operandi is to break into evil cult temples to steal their treasure - he isn't afraid to break a few heads to get it.  \n\nYou can leap straight into playing, but beware: there is always something unexpected just around the corner.  Cunning level design makes this a fiendishly challenging game, and I've found myself coming back again and again for just 'one' more attempt to crack it.  And if you run out of levels...you can always make some more with the editor!  There'll most likely be a community of players sharing extra levels soon as it's easy to use the editor.\n\nAlready the game feels polished and complete to me, but the developer is quick to respond all the same, and has even promised to help fellow game creators by showing how he made Crongdor (the source code is also downloadable).  Can't remember ever seeing that before on Steam!  \n\nIn summary: a ridiculously fun indie game which brings back the spirit of classic gaming.
