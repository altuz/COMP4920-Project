It has always been insane fun though, and it seems like the perfect game minus some things like the title screen (which I hope will be improved in the future) that just make it seem a little less... professional I guess?\n\nBut the main problem has come up in a lot of reviews so I'm sure you're already aware... almost no one plays it.\n\nWhen I say almost, what I mean is this; when I try to find a server, there are almost always none. However, there are ways around this. The obvious one is just to play it with a friend; that way there is an active server and people are very likely to join. Sometimes I just make a server and sit in it, maybe go on my phone or whatever, and, at certain times of the day, at least someone will join. This seems like an annoying thing to do, I know, but I still love the game nonetheless.\n\nI hope this was helpful, I wouldn't recommend it if you don't have any friends who have the game, but if you do this is one of the most fun games for the price!\n\n(although PS I think the price should be lower or free just until it has enough regular players :).)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198302119307", "last_played": 1503586187, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 13, "playtime_forever": 1976}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503236745, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503236745, "recommendationid": "34373979", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
