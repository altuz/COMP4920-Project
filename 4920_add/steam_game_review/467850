'nuf said.\n[*]The Controls are rigid, but decent.\n[/list]\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n[i](See Below for reasons)[/i]\n[list]\n[*]Level Design is beyond abysmal\n[*]Enemy Placement is shoddy at best\n[/list]\n\n[b]Detailed Review:[/b]\n\n(Sigh)...Where to begin...\n\nI mainly played on the 360 controller, which wasn't too bad if a bit rigid. So overall the controls weren't too bad, as most of the movement was relegated to the D-pad which considering it is how a game like this is supposed to be played. There was a few issues with getting the controller to work, but that was due to a HID (Human Interface Devices) issue and is entirely on my PC setup.\n\nAlong with the decent controls, the handling of the player avatar is pretty spot on with what you'd expect from a game in this genre. The jumping and movement are decent approximations of the older platformers in this genre of games, even the inclusion of a dash is quite nice to extend jumps and push through obstacles. It definitely channels the old Mega Man games well, but that's where that comparison ends.\n\nNow on to the really bad parts of the game and the stuff that made me start this review in the first place. The Level Design is possibly the worst offender in deaths and cheap moments in this game, but that's not to say that the theming and the atmosphere of the levels are bad, on the contrary they each have their distinct feel which is actually good.  However, when it comes to the construction of the levels and overall enemy placement it is clearly so far flung from what a good game is that it creates it's own level of hell for all involved to stew in. \n\nLet's back up a bit, the concpet of a decent level should have some Hazard Foresight/Telegraphing, where the player is put into a situation where they encounter dangers in a relatively solitary environment, then later on be thrust into a much more dangerous environment with multiple dangers coming at once. MetaGal does none of this, it basically throws caution and decent level design to the wind which results in a multitude of situations where the player is thrown into a situation where death is the only recourse for no misstep of their own. \n\nThis poor hazard telegraphing goes hand-in-hand with the amount of instant death pits and spike traps, the latter of which reminds me of a LEGO crazed six year-olds bedroom. It's nearly impossible to get around or through the levels when death is looming below numerous fall away and moving platforms. The worst part is all the levels are like this and make traversing them to the Boss room harder than the bosses themselves.\n\nAlong with these death traps, the enemies are a constant source of frustration and death which along with all the previously mentioned issues only ramp the problems up further. The basic enemies in MetaGal sponge up way too many shots and are so numerous that sometimes the screen scroll IS your worst enemy (Ex. Warp's Stage). Not to mention the placement of such enemies are often in front of instant death zones or in areas where a single hit can knock you into said death zone. \n\nOverall, I don't recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the genre or even looking for an alternative from other games (i.e. Mighty No. 9). This game falls so flat on what makes a platformer good and memorable that I regret adding this game to my library.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197967648745", "last_played": 1466963799, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 652, "playtime_forever": 145}, "votes_up": 35, "timestamp_created": 1466661665, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528530", "votes_down": 17, "timestamp_updated": 1466663468, "recommendationid": "23720519", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Upon re-evaluating the game, it's not as bad as I initially thought.

The level design is a little uneven, the dialogue is clearly written by somebody whose first or even second language is not English, but the challenge of the game is on par with most normal Mega Man games as are the controls. Originally you'll think that the game is a fun, if short little romp into something we've all been begging for; more Mega Man (but with mostly female characters for flavor). However, once you hit fortress 3, everything goes out the window and it becomes apparent that the person or people who made this stage hates your guts.\n\nThe first section isn't that horrible, it's a bunch of moving platforms and if you stick to the top then everything will be fine... but if you do fall then you're in for a world of instant death pits, spikes and tricky jumps. The next section is delicious cake and perhaps the only small mercy you will ever see in this place, it's just simple timed dashing. Then the next part is where the stage first lost me; blind jumps onto spikes, having to abuse the fire dash special ability to pass over multiple spike floors, water that will send you head first into more spikes with enemies whose respawn is beyond anything Mega Man had seen, and then another section of more blind jumps with spikes with a gravity gimmick over instant death pits. Oh, and none of this has a checkpoint, so you need to do this all in one life.\n\nWhen you do finally get a checkpoint it's just cruel sugar coating to the horror that the stage is half done; now comes instant death lava below you, sheets of timed screen filling instant death lava from above (which wasn't bad in the original stage you first saw them) and you have to use a property of a weapon never once explained to you to enhance your jumps to ensure that you can outrace a stage gimmick that has gone from fun to a waking nightmare. Then once the lava is done you get more spikes and fast instant death flamethrowers that never actually deactivate (see also Quick Man's instant death beams from Mega Man 2) that require more use of the weapon property nobody told you about and reflexes of a god which, even if you were a deity, would be tired by this point as you've died about 30 times from the horrible instant death nightmare.\n\nOnce that's done, however, you get an insulting easy boss, as if to pat you on the head for not throwing your PC out of a window in a fit of anger from the horrors you just experienced.\n\nFortress 3 is draining mentally and is out to crush your will to ever finish the game. It is there not to challenge you, but to torment you, to beat you down and try to break you. There is no fun in this, only mind numbing tedium, the kind of thing you find in I Wanna Be The Guy, only jacked up just a little more. Somebody wanted to outdo them and claim the title of worst possible stage design from Mega Man X6... and they did.\n\nThis game goes from scratching an itch you so desperately need to crushing your will to live within a few hours, and I am sadly beyond the point where I can get a refund. I cannot in good conscious condone this sort of thing, where the designer of this stage missed the point of Nintendo Hard so much that they went into territory that even the most horrid of ultra hard nonsense fan hacks (collectively called kaizo even though the meaning of the way has no inherent inclinations toward soul murdering difficulty spikes) would be jealous of. Do not, for the love of all that has ever existed, subject yourself to this unless you are masochistic enough to enjoy these sorts of things.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034116281", "last_played": 1484252563, "num_reviews": 40, "num_games_owned": 738, "playtime_forever": 360}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1467557541, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514466", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1467557541, "recommendationid": "24050881", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "You already know what you're in for when looking at this, right? Like Legend of Dark Witch (another highly recommended Mega Man-like Run n' Gun for super cheap) this is a basically a gender swapped Mega Man. It's a retro-style run n' gun platformer pitting your mechanized heroine against a bunch of Android \"Gals\" vs. Mega Man's various dude Robot Masters (excluding MM9's Splash Woman).  Unlike Dark Witch, which adds in it's own ideas (like a Gradius style upgrade bar) this one sticks to the MM formula pretty much exclusively. But it does pretty well! \n\nVisually it looks fantastic; the pixel art here and the color palette used is as good as, or better than, genuine SNES/Genesis/Amiga quality. The chibi character art really evoke cute, Japanese sidescrollers from the era. The quality of the chiptunes is great too. Controls are absolutely on point. They're super responsive and tight; it feels great with a 360 controller. The levels are very well designed, with areas being themed around various classic MM stage hazards like timed drop platforms, flame throwers and conveyor belt sections. Once you defeat the four main Gals and move onto the levels beyond, they even start making great use of your powers! See a wall you seemingly can't get passed? Fire the black hole-thing at an enemy on the other side to switch places and warp over there! See a gap that's too large for a dash jump? Jump anyway, then use Magma Gal's Flame Dash to cross to the other side! A ladder you can't reach? Shoot out your Mines, then jump on them to use the explosion to give you a boost! It gets REALLY GOOD once you have all these powers; the levels know that, and are designed thusly. \n\nMeanwhile, enemies are positioned in ways and combinations that almost resemble an \"action puzzle\"; they'll shoot bouncing projectiles to get you to move to certain safe spots or you'll be able to perfectly take them out one-at-a-time from certain vantage points. It's just like the good old days! Speaking of, the difficulty is tuned to be \"NES Hard\"; really difficult, but never impossible and rewarding when conquered (and able to be more speedily conquered after you get it down). Sit there and watch patterns, try different weapon & ability combinations, or die and learn from failures when you try again: you WILL make progress... most of the time. \n\nThere are *some* issues that affect the difficulty. The timing windows on some of this stuff is absolutely brutal (particularly the fullscreen flame throwers in the second half of Magma Gal's stage and the explosive, timed platforms on Buster Gal's stage), enemies respawn THE SECOND you leave their \"screen\" (there's definitely places you can stand still that will cause them to continuously fly in from the edge of the screen, one after the other. Kind of good for grinding, but awful for combat where you have to maneuver in the air while jumping).\n\nEDIT: The developer is doing a good job currently of patching and otherwise updating this game constantly. Issues I had a week ago (I previously mentioned no way to change the controller config here) are no longer here! Meanwhile, the balance on things seem to be constantly tweaked for the better. I definitely have to give a shout-out to the devs for continually polishing this up! \n\nIn the end, I just have a tiny issue with everything. Namely, the music compositions are a little repetitive (they all seem to be variants of the same song to me). But this game is $4 so I know its petty to bring up. What's here sounds good, but it bares mentioning anyway. \n\nThat's it. Every other little issue I had is now gone :D   \n--\nOverall, it's definitely recommended if you're looking for a cheap Mega Man style run-n'-gun retro action game. This is an extremely well-crafted little game and definitely provides the fun and challenge you're looking for. This title could absolutely go for $10 and it would put some other games in that price range to shame. RetroRevolution has a quality game here for the price of a sandwich at Burger King.

Nothing special or unique, and not very long, but not really that *bad* either.  There are positives, though for each positive there's a counterbalance;\n\n - The graphics are not bad at all, evoking a kind of 16-bit Megaman feel, and the character designs are pretty cute, but there's nothing that really stands out;\n - The music is quite good, sometimes rather great even, but most the game uses a singular motif that can get tiring, and the sound effects are stock trash (with especially bad mini voice clips in the cutscenes);\n - The story is... okay, servicable for this type of game, but the Engish translation and even the formatting of the text in the boxes is embarrassingly bad;\n - The gameplay overall is fine, and satisfying enough for a Megaman fan, but there are some very annoying aspects such as even your default pea shooter taking ammo and shooting only in three-round bursts for some reason (though these problems are SLIGHTLY alleviated via the hidden powerups you can find).\n\nThere's also a weird lack of polish that I feel somewhat bothered by, with things like very swift screen transitions with no boss intro or 'got a weapon' outro to the stages, and how SOME dialogue scenes are skippable while others aren't.  It's also a painfully short game, with four challenging, but quick normal stages each with eactly 1 hidden powerup, followed by 4 'fortress' stages, and that's it, that's the whole game.  Very cut and dry.\n\nStill, though, all things considered, and especially with the price being so low frankly, for a Megaman fan this just barely, [i]baaaaarely[/i] makes the cut to be worth checking out, especially with the promise of more content such as various playable characters later on.

Does that make sense? Because I literally sat here and spent about six minutes trying to figure out how to begin this.\n\nSo. Straight out of the gate. is Metagal worth a buy? Yes. Is Metagal the shining successor to Mega Man? No. But it's still fun.\n\nI feel bad for Metagal because it journeys into the ever dangerous territory of \"Clone\". It's a Mega Man clone, through and through, but it still does enough on its own to merit its own accolades. But because it's a clone, the Mega Man fanbase will sink their claws into this and tear it apart. Follow me now...\n\nMetagal's story is classic Mega Man: scientist makes robots, bad guy repurposes them. Metagal is the only bot in town to save the day! There's some ProtoMan flavored subplots thrown in, but it's all just whatever. You shoot bad bots. That's all you need.\n\nAt it's core, Metagal works. You jump. You shoot. You use special attacks to defeat enemies and traverse the stages. Cool. Just like MM. Nearly everything about the game is a direct lifting from MM: level design, ladder climbing, doors opening, enemy design, using certain weapons against bosses due to their weaknesses, etc. There are some differences, though: Metagal fires in three shot bursts. No single shots, no charges. Just bursts. Different, a little weird here and there, but pleasantly different. Instead of finite weapon ammo, Metagal gets an ever recharging gauge. This adds a nice touch to the tried and true gameplay we know from MM, so I welcomed it. There are only four bosses to gain special weapons from, two of which are incredibly useful, so not having to worry about finding ammo power-ups was a nice change of pace.\n\nHere's a big deal: you have infinite lives. You have. Infinite. LIVES. For anyone that writes this game a negative review because it's \"too hard\" or because \"Fortress Area 3 is too hard\", please remember that you have infinite lives. You do. Granted, you respawn back at every check point you pass, and you can techinically earn lives (Rebirths) that respawn you at the exact room you died in, but listen: infinite lives, infinite continues. For anyone who grew up playing OG action games, you'll know what that actually means.\n\nAnd really, Metagal isn't that hard. I beat it in a single two hour sitting, even collecting all of the hidden power-ups. Died a few times here and there, took me a while to figure out to beat the final boss' first form, but I did it. It's doable. The graphics were colorful and the music not terrible. so it was a pleasant ride. If you can find this on sale, give it a whirl.

Other minor nitpicks was that I was unable to fire single shots with the 360 controller (pressing the shoot button fired a 3-round burst which prevented me from shooting again until some shots impacted an enemy or left the screen) and that the control was way too floaty for the amount of precision expected.\n\nThe one boss fight I made it to was...okay...at best.

I won\u2019t say I raved over the music, but it was alright. One thing you can definitely tell is that it was built with the control pad in mind. Movement is stiff on the keyboard and noticeably better with the 360 pad. You can use the stick but I prefer the D-pad for that authentic feel.

Expect Mega Man, for the most part.\n\nI did like how abilities work, and anticipated getting a new one due to the fact that a lot of them help you get around the stages (like Warp Gal's weapon swaps the places between you and an enemy it hit).\n\nI liked the sprite work, although felt it lacked color, but this might be my own preferences toward the 8-Bit Mega Man games.\n\nThe story is pretty basic, although I liked the attempts to give it color by injecting humor, although I'd have referenced some common Mega Man oddities (like why do they all have a Fortress?). The English was also a bit wonky, but the devs said English isn't their first language, so I can't criticize that.\n\nThe difficulty was hard, as a Mega Man throwback usually is, although sometimes I thought the game got pretty unfair, although those are usually late-game (the pseudo-Quick Man lasers particularly annoyed me in the third Creeper stage). I might also suck at platformers.\n\nI'd check it out, since it's at a pretty low price, and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing the new playable characters in later updates.\n\n...And it also still released faster than Mighty No. 9.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198051740153", "last_played": 1479757779, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 131, "playtime_forever": 397}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1464023615, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496010", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1464389656, "recommendationid": "23158588", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ok before we begin I want to say the game is good. However there are some problems\n\n1: The weapons you get are usefull but the fire dash is flawed.You  expect a fire dash to go through enemies but its not the case here. If the oppenent doesn't die with the dash you will get hit. However you want to get this weapon highlighted all the time cause you never know when you are gonna need it in the final stages.\n\n2:The level design is okay for the most part but the gravity girls stage is broken. Help yourself and get the fire dash before this stage you are gonna need it.\n\n3:Checkpoint system in this game is really stupid. I hate it. You see how it works is that there are 2 types of checkpoints.One is visible on the screen one is not. You only get to use the invisible ones if you have these gold  gears that you can find in the stages. Its a pointless comcept in my opinion because if you run out of these (especially in castle level number 2) you will have re-do a lot of the level again. If they just made the invisible checkpoints like the visible ones this problem would not exist.\n\n4: The music is good but not memorable. It does its job but I don't think I will ever listen to these in real life.\n\n5:Some of the enemy placements are kinda bad.By that I mean they are in your way when you are about to land on a platform or worse a platform that closes and opens.(gravity stage I hate you)\n\n\n\nMY BIGGEST PROBLEM:\nYou see in this game shooting is kinda weird. When you press the attack button you will automaticly shoot 3 shots. This is a problem because I can shoot faster than this. I know its sounds stupid but trust me you will notice it while playing it.Aiming with this when you jump is kinda hard.And again you can shoot faster than this so lets say you are walking to an enemy and you are confident that you can shoot fast enough (just like in megaman) and kill the enemy but that wont happen. Most of the enemies take at least 2 sets of shot too.\n\nOther than these the game is pretty good. Nothing amazing though. As a technical megaman player I rather play something like Mighty no 9 I won't lie (though I know I am gonna get a lot of hate for saying that).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198203412952", "last_played": 1480704779, "num_reviews": 34, "num_games_owned": 58, "playtime_forever": 395}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1466990046, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502186", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1466990250, "recommendationid": "23847496", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Quite Hard, But I like it.
