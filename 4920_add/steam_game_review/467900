It is a lot of fun with a few controllers and a few friends. \n\nI get that it is early access and not all the content is there but my friends and I would play this game for a bit, play something else, and eventually end up coming back to this one because it was just too much fun.  \n\nIt's great to practice all the different weapons ranging from hammers, axes, swords, daggers, spears, and flails.  Each one plays differently and requires a unique tactic.  \n\nWe got fairly bored of the \"kill everyone\" game so we came up with our own ideas for keeping the game interesting.  \n\n- Give one player armor and two weapons.  The other players do not have armor and only weapon.  Juggernaut versus everyone else!  \n\n- Nothing but hammers.  Everyone brings two hammers into the arena.  The catch is you can only use them by throwing.  No meleeing allowed.  This was by far my favourite game mode.  \n\nFun little made up game modes like this kept things interesting and we kept coming back.\n\nThe physics works fantastically, the graphics worked well for what it is, and I never had any problems with the game crashing. \n\nEven though it is early access I would recommend this game if you are looking for a fun little brawler to play with friends on the couch.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035140839", "last_played": 1488089284, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 289, "playtime_forever": 317}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1500516111, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507365", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500516111, "recommendationid": "33663321", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "(DISCLAIMER: I played this offline on my living room PC, so I probably have about 2 hours in this game.)\n\nSWORDY just has nothing to offer you after the inital goofy-ness of the combat wears off. It is fun to try everything out, but that will maybe take you a half hour. I get its early access, but there just really isn't any content right now to warrant a purchase. I do hope that this game gets more fledged out and has more things to keep you playing. If that happens, I would gladly re-purchase this game. However, I will have to refund it for now since I know it will not make it into my couch party line-up.\n\nIt really is a shame, because I have nearly 100 couch-multiplayer games in my steam library. This game is a fun idea, and I really want to support couch-multiplayer games that are not just 2D Smash-esque fighters. I'm hoping the best for the devs of this game, but to the consumer: Hold off on your purchase for now.
