The only thing i hate is that magic items or spells can only be used a certain number of times.

The opinions contained herein are my own, and are shared here to attempt to give an accurate and comprehensive picture of my experience with this game. I omit commenting on the plot itself, as I don't feel I have enough information at present to comment accurately on the componant, and won't bother giving input on the multiplayer since I live a ocean away from everyone I've tried to play with. That said:\n\nEPOCH is a 2-D adventure game with a strong influece from the BloodSouls series. The mechanics are inspired by those found in BloodSouls games, in which the player is encouraged to pay close attention to attack animations, enemy traits, and one's environment while reacting appropriately. Much like BloodSouls games, the strict difficulty of the game is just lenient enough to convince the player that difficult obstacles CAN be overcome given the correct strategy. This draw to overcome challenges serves as an excellent hook that leaves one fuming at seemingly 'unfair' enemies and puzzles, only to return to the game minutes later as a potential solution claws at the player's mind. Whether the solution lies in upgrading a weapon, reconfiguring one's equipment, or approaching the obstacle differently; EPOCH continuously offers the player a sense of challenge, with the proper tools to succeed lying in wait. This balance between difficulty and mechanics is exactly what makes the BloodSouls experience so engaging, and it is just as well implemented in EPOCH.\n\nThis drive to overcome obstacles lends itself to EPOCH's unique approach to exploration. The player levels up by acquiring  'Essenses' hidden throughout the game. Each essense gained earns the player 1 experience point, which can be allocated to improving the character's stats, upgrading equipment, or gaining new skills. Some of these are left directly in the player's path, some are neccesary for progressing further into the game, while others are more subtly hidden in nooks and passageways. This encourages players to actively pay attention to the environment, and serves as incentive to revisit previous areas in the hopes of uncovering more experience. Many have alluded to this mechanic as remeniscent of 'Metroidvania'-style exploration, and in a sense this is not inaccurate. However, by giving the player the agency to decide how this experience will be used, one never has the sense that their efforts are wasted on perks which aren't beneficial to one's character. In this sense, exploration in EPOCH very much feels like a hunt to complete a jigsaw puzzle, with the final picture looming ahead of the player as they try to conform the game's mechanics to their own style of gaming.  \n\nThe levels themselves are divided into about a dozen areas which are interconnected by small hubs populated with NPCs. The levels themselves are not terribly large, and new avenues open up to the players as they progress through the game which allow for more convenient passage between hub-areas. That said, navigating these mid-ways can be confusing at times as one struggles to recall the path to a particular landmark. The areas themselves are visually unimpressive (with noteworthy exceptions in the form of pixalated statue-art) and contain countless corridors which can be difficult to distinguish from each other in one's mind, save for trace color cues. Further, at the time in which this review is being written, the game features no over-world map which might alleiviate this frustration. While these shortcomings are cetainly forgivable given the nature of the game's engine, it's unfortunate that the environments themselves are rather bland when one of EPOCH's greatest pulls is it's incentive to explore. \n\nYet EPOCH compensates for it's visuals with a well-utilized soundtrack. While the environments may not be visually impressive, each boasts distinitive, memberable tunes from the sombre tones of the game's main theme at The Tower to the sharp, unnerving notes of the spider-infested tunnels of  Bloodrood. The tracks also compliment EPOCH's sprarce, yet compelling, plot as each evokes feelings of anxiety, drama, awe, and tranquility at the appropriate moments. The quality of the soundtrack is one of Epoch's strongest assets, as it manages to engage the player's imagination with EPOCH's melancholy reality.\n\nMaybe I'm wrapping too many words around my experience, and appear overtly partial to the game. In closing, I'm happy to promptly list a number of things I dislike about the game. The dodge rolling mechanics can be unresponsive at times, which sometimes hamper combat; there's a lack of diverse end-game equipment; the inability to respec experience can lead to frustrating handicaps that compromise the player between restarting a character 50 lvls in or bearing one's past judgements; bugs are quite common; &c. \n\nAnd yet, I insist that EPOCH is a worthwhile and unique exeperience. Rather than a 'rip-off' of its insiprations EPOCH is more appropriatly a tribute to these influences. It is one of the few games of its kind that manage to manipulate its constraints while providing enough original content and ingenuity to distinguish itself from the crowd. Despite its constraints, it manages to deliver a genuine, underivative BloodSouls experience tempered with its own individual aethetic and passion. Further, the growing community coupled with the developer's drive to improve the game promise to help the game steadily improve in the future. EPOCH is a must-try for avid dungeons crawlers, lore hounds, and retro 8-bit enuthisiats alike.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198256797577", "last_played": 1491140631, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 39, "playtime_forever": 2435}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1463904293, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498648", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1463904293, "recommendationid": "23132718", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It would help if there was a tutorial that shows us how to work multiplayer, its a good game, but i feel it would excel if only i could play with my friends", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198134608018", "last_played": 1471690682, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 78, "playtime_forever": 135}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1464549127, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499329", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1464549127, "recommendationid": "23278619", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It is intentionally bad. It's marketed as \"dark souls-esque,\" but really, it's just a big fuck you. Everything is wrong with this game. I didn't enjoy a minute, I muscled through thinking, \"Oh, it will get good if I can only find _______\" and it just never did.\n\nThere are fights that are designed for you not to win. Not just like... \"can't win now, come back later\" kind of thing. \n\nThe one that stands out to me is that there is a repeating rival you have. The first time, cake walk. Second time, not awful. The third time, he starts speaking while he's attacking, and your attack/roll buttons are in charge of the speech bubble. So you have to close out of the text box to attack him or run away. The next time, the room is barely big enough for the two of you, he speaks multiple speech boxes and you can't do anything until they are gone, so he will kick your ass over and over again. And that's not a fun challenge. There's no skill to be had there, there's no learning curve, you can't improve on your skipping speech skill. It's just mash the exit button and hope you don't get killed. And when you finally beat him, you don't feel accomplished, you feel like you wasted 30 minutes on a giant middle finger.\n\nAnd I found almost every fight to be some sort of bull shit like this. Just over and over again, things designed to kill you, but that there is no sense of accomplishment in overcoming. At the end of each challenge, I would just say, \"oh, well I'm glad that's over,\" and was never once excited to see what came next. \n\nAlso, level up system, you can only level up a hand full of times, so good fucking luck if you level up the wrong thing, you won't get another chance.\n\nAlso, the inventory management is SUCH trash. I have always thought that inventory management shows a developer really cares about the experience of the player. It shows how poorly this was slapped together. You can deposit your extra items in a chest that you can access anywhere in the world. But if you put more than 20 things in, they start filling over the other slots. Not deleting the items mind you, but overlapping. So lets say you put in 5 items, but there isn't any free spots. And then you realize \"Dang, I need that ONE gem back.\" If you want to get a gem now you need to withdraw the sword, the hat, the staff, the other gem, that other gem, the money, the other sword, and THEN you can take out the gem you need. Then you have to put all that shit back in. Their inventory management system is basically, \"Fuck you, you deal with it.\"\n\nAlso, there is not a fast travel option. So you have to run around this fucking obnoxious world. You miss something in the north? Well looks like you will have to cross 2 different biomes to get there again. Oh, still not accessible? Better cross another 3 to find what unlocks it.\n\nIt's work. I don't play videogames to work this hard for this little pay off. There are so many gameplay issues.

Don't bother.\n\nPs & Cs:\n+ Lots of secrets and hidden paths\n+ Graphics work fine for the game\n+ Story seems interesting\n- Very imprecise controls destroys the Souls-iness\n- Controls are very bizarre and unintuitive\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but it's so slipshod.  The inventory / crafting system is extremely poorly implemented.  The game tries to be like Dark Souls, but without the tight controls it really just comes across as cheap.  The game supports controllers, however I was never able to get a spell to work.  They're also missing very basic functions like a close button.  If you can find it for < $5, and you're a Souls fanatic, it might be worth your time, however for everyone else I can't recommend it.  As an aside the dev did say he would address the close button which shows he's at least a good dude.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197981588360", "last_played": 1481591396, "num_reviews": 80, "num_games_owned": 444, "playtime_forever": 108}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1482114984, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497478", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1482114984, "recommendationid": "28460121", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ehhhh, es pretty good.
