Using the spacebar you can flip your battleship 180 degrees to take the fight to spawning waves of alien ships trying to take you down. Control one of 5 battleships, each with their own unique features and passives. Level up your ships with mastery points to increase its combat effectiveness. Grind through 50 levels of bullet dodging. It comes with 5 bosses. \n\nIt has gimmik options for fortress modes and endless wave modes for endgame play for those who need kill achievements or wave clear progression. It features steam achievements and badges for those who are into that microfarm. Fun enough for what it is. It will take at least half a days worth of hard grind, but a very easy 100% for that perfect game list.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044229474", "last_played": 1495039483, "num_reviews": 161, "num_games_owned": 1376, "playtime_forever": 1509}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1494969403, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513947", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1494969403, "recommendationid": "31794676", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "kind of garbage. i paid a dollar and got 11 pieces of garbage. \n\nat least the cards paid me back\n\n\nif you are a person who unlike me, doesnt like to waste their time on crap... avoid this publisher.\n\nfeatures:\n- Boring electro music\n- Cringey voice acting\n- Too talkative main character\n- Embarassing graphics\n- Same old space-rogue story\n- slow combat..", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198089053989", "last_played": 1496214509, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 177, "playtime_forever": 18}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1496214910, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500124", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1496214910, "recommendationid": "32079707", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
