[/h1]\n\n[b] TL;DR, pros and cons at the bottom. [/b]\n\nFirst, let me say that the majority of the negative reviews stem from bugs that the devs have since patched out (i.e. a lot of reviews are now out of date)\nSecond, let me warn you that a game controller is highly recommended due to a bug (this is coming from a hardcore PC, keyboard and mouse person who happens to own and XBox 360 controller).\n\n\n[b] The Crafting [/b]\n\nUnlike other survival games, you don't do any of the crafting yourself. You're simply the person who finds the required materials and then your team of 4 undertakes the crafting once you've collected all the necessary items. Each of the 4 team members has their own unique role to play: one is a chef, one is a car mechanic, one is a survival expert, and the last is an electronics/computer expert/hacker. The chef can turn basic ingredients into complex meals that are much greater than the sum of their parts, offering more sustenance and possibly a much-needed morale boost to those who eat them. The mechanic, amongst other things, can build upgrades for the church that help to keep the team and its belongings safe from looters, and stave off the freezing temperatures outside. The survivalist will craft you items that will make your solo expeditions into The Void easier and safer, and the hacker will upgrade your robotic companion making it even more useful.\nOn top of this, each team member has their own story line to follow. These are all completely optional, but are recommended to pursue, as completing their missions will unlock further upgrades and crafting options along the character tech trees. These unlocked craftables not only increase your chance of survival, but also improve the quality of life for each of the survivors and even you the player. Yes, the game can become less of a chore for us playing it at home. For example, you start the game with a very limited inventory space for loot. Completing the first story mission for the computer hacker gives you the opportunity to increase its size. This means that you can then carry more, and so have to make fewer trips between a particular loot location and the church to transfer all the goods you feel you need to have to survive.\n\n\n[b] The Survival [/b]\n\nThe survival is pretty standard fare for the genre with a couple of exceptions. Stave off hunger, keep thirst at bay, sleep whenever you're tired, and keep the fire burning. However, there is no base building (just base updgrading), and there's no hacking away at trees and rocks. Food can be found by looting abandoned buildings and by hunting. Drink is found through the scavenging process as well. \nBeing in a post-apocalyptic \"nuclear winter\", hypothermia is also a permanent threat. But in reality, unless you spend a ridiculous amount of time in a very cold area (e.g. -30 centigrade) it's not actually a problem for your character. The cold is principally a problem for your companions back at the church. If you fail to keep the base camp fire burning at all hours, they'll quickly become cold, their morale will drop, and they could end up abandoning your party.\nIn addition to the hunger, thirst, warmth, and morale meters, each character has an overall health gauge. This depletes when attacked by a hostile creature, or when someone is dying from starvation, dehydration, or hypothermia. The health bar replenishes when each of your needs is sufficiently met.\n\n\n[b] The Management [/b]\n\nIn addition to assigning crafting/cooking tasks to your fellow survivors, you also get to assign them a particular role, and have to ration their food and drink supply. They have ration boxes that are separate from the church's main storage area.\n\nEach available role can be taken by only one survivor at a time (that's worth noting right now, as I thought this was bugged when I was trying to assign the same role to more than one person), roles can greatly assist in your team's survival (someone assigned to hunt will bring in a very nice stash of raw meat), and each role has a positive and a negative effect. Not only do you have to weigh up the pros and cons when assigning a particular role, but you also have to decide when the best time is to allocate that role. For example, it would be a waste to designate someone as a hunter if you're urgently waiting for them to finish crafting a vital upgrade.\nThe ration boxes are a very important way of ensuring that your team members remain hunger-free, well hydrated, and happy. Plus, you can assign a specific foodstuff to just one person if you know that person happens to love it and will get an important morale boost from consuming it. Keeping a happy team will ensure that it's productive, and will keep depression at bay. A depressed member will lose faith in your leadership and will wander off away from the church and disappear, thereby permanently depriving you of the strengths they brought to the group.\n\n \n[b] Ako Light [/b]\n\nIn addition to being your portable inventory, your robotic companion acts as a source of light, and can scan and dig for buried caches of loot. You must use good judgement of where and when to scan for such an underground anomaly, as every scan drains the battery, and battery life is limited. Once having found a buried treasure trove, you still need to decide whether it's worth Ako Light using the energy to dig for it there and then, as running out of battery disables Ako's radar, causing you to lose your only immediate means of navigation. You must then find your way back to the church to safety with no asistance. Returning to the church recharges Ako Light immediately.\n\n\n[b] PROS [/b]\n+ Excellent survival game in which you have to scavenge for every last scrap of food, every last drop of water, and any items which could be of any crafting use.\n+ Very nice crafting progression system, which truly does reward you for keeping a keen eye out for potentially valuable items.\n+ Excellent visuals that immerse you in the post-apocalyptic world.\n+ The game provides you with a rather large map to explore with a good variety of looting locations. \n+ On top of the \"open world\" freedom for exploration, the crafting unlocks and progressions of each of the other 4 survivors allow you to focus on what you feel is most important for your team, and how you want to play the game.\n+ Good team management aspect that adds a meaningful extra layer of gameplay to what could have been \"just another ordinary survival game.\"\n+ Good soundtrack that adds to the atmosphere.\n\n\n[b] CONS [/b]\n- Impact Winter still has several bugs that persist even after all this time, and after several patches e.g. getting stuck on terrain and having to reload your game from the last checkpoint.\n- The game involves a lot of hiking back and forth between the church and looting and mission locations. This could be a big turn-off for some people. There is a snowmobile in the game for high-speed travelling, but you have to advance quite a way through the crafting projects for it to become available to build.\n- A controller is highly recommended, and does work very well. The keyboard and mouse support has improved a lot since launch, but still contains some bugs that could negatively affect your game. You have been warned!\n- The weather seems to be rather clement too much of the time and so the world itself never truly feels threatening. Not once have I found myself stranded because of a whiteout or at risk of death due to hypothermia.\n- Only one real level of difficulty. An option to choose how many days you have to survive to complete the game would be very welcome, as 30 days can pass rather quickly. \n\n[h1] Summary [/h1]\nAn excellent wintery survival game with good team management elements. Any enhusiast of the genre will enjoy it immensely, but do expect to be hiking back and forth a lot, seeing the same places over and over again.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1786, "steamid": "76561197986955769", "last_played": 1506706848, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 428, "playtime_forever": 1915}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1506295764, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512537", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506295764, "recommendationid": "35192800", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very poor responses from dev's to questions in the forum.
