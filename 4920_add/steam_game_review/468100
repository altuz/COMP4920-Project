There's nothing in the actual feel of the racing here to suggest that the rider (or the jet) is actually racing on water, despite everything else on the screen telling you otherwise. Everything is extremely rigid, and has no flow. There's no depth here, despite some valiant attempts at it. The trick system, too, is fundamentally flawed. Not only do the moves lack pizzazz, they're just not satisfying to use at all.\n\nI have a massive, massive soft spot for b-grade arcade racers. Loved them through the 8/16bit generations, and that love was cemented in the Saturn/PSX/64 days. You don't need a massive budget to create a racer that feels right. The surface similarities to Wave Race 64 and Blue Storm do more harm to Utopia than good, as the game really can't match the sublime controls of either title.\n\nI was really, really hoping that Utopia would deliver the goods, but I can't in good conscience recommend the game. Riptide GP 2/Renegade are, right now, the far better option if you have a water racing scratch to itch. And in saying that, I honestly hope the developers go back to the drawing board and re-think their approach to the controls, animation and overall feel. The game has the content, and it's got the glitz, but without the core gameplay, it'll always just be a pale imitation of what's gone before.\n\nI hate writing negative anything, but it's my sincerest wish to see this game evolve and be the game that the devs, and we want it to be.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013554886", "last_played": 1502795937, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 413, "playtime_forever": 157}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1501564233, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501564344, "recommendationid": "33942293", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
