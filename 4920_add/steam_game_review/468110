But hey, it makes fun to catch stuff and to throw it. That's how we guys are made. Just imagine it like catching a ball and then you have to throw it in a net. That's all. Here you get some more variation in levels and difficulty.\n\nI had fun with the game I got in a cheap bundle and therefore I am more than happy that it is not one of those trash games - actually I was expecting it, but it is neat, ironed out arcade VR game. Good for some VR session with the family, the girlfriend - catch the baby - hahaha - or whatever. Sure don't play it with your buddies. \n\nRECOMMENDED ON SALE OR IN A BUNDLE.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198064106555", "last_played": 1500319108, "num_reviews": 221, "num_games_owned": 2776, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1500328744, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507689", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500328744, "recommendationid": "33617280", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
