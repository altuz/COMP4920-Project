This game's single player is horrible and is not worth the price of the game at all. I wasn't looking for a game to play with friends. I was looking into a game that plays well single player. And the fact they need you to sign in to your steam account to prove you have the game to play with other people... That's beyond stupid. This game is bad unless you live in a condensed neighborhood where all your friends live within 4 miles of you. Then you might MIGHT get some enjoyment out of this game. Go get better versions of this game. This is a common genre on Steam and I suggest you look into better ones.\n\nWithout online multiplayer this game has you rely on hooking up gamepads and playing with local friends. Not to mention it forces you to create/sync up a steam account. Which can be good but without an online mode this seems rather pointless other than character looks. Main issues is that it's not very user friendly and what if you don't have any local friends? Well you have the AI but that does get boring quick. I'd not recommend it until some sort of online feature is implemented.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065216961", "last_played": 1478015001, "num_reviews": 52, "num_games_owned": 636, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1478015012, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483714", "votes_down": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1494460954, "recommendationid": "26356851", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
