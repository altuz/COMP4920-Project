When I first started I had no sailing experience whatsoever yet after a minor tutorial I was still able to catch on and get sailing on expansive bodies of water (with sparse object collision) in no time.\n\nThe steering is done by gripping a rudder behind you in with one hand and the other hand controls the rigging/rope for the mainsail. Get yourself at the right angle to the wind direction and you're off! It is a pretty slick and engaging system that, somehow, managed to never give me motion sickness.\n\nThis game has come quite a ways since it was first out in early access and the developer seems to be adding and improving it on a regular basis. Models have been upgraded, a new beach bungalow to start out in and select races or sailing experiences from (I like the relaxing open sailing mode personally), a random sheep, and a big ol yacht. The yacht did cause me to need to lower my supersampling levels for performance but it was worth it.\n\n\nI highly suggest VR Regatta, it is an immersive and relaxing experience that is only bound to get better.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "steamid": "76561198143490330", "last_played": 1506266005, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 79, "playtime_forever": 225}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505254085, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505254085, "recommendationid": "34909285", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
