In terms of pay to win for a free to play game, I've noticed none. \n\n-You units/vehicals/skill(airsupport) that can counter a troop/vehical your enemy has on the field instantly and change whether your enemy decides to make an assault for territory. \n\n-In terms of troops/vehicals, they are all customizable. You can change the gun from infantry, change their vests, their unique skillset, and their skin to fit the field. Same goes for vehicals, tanks, humvees, APCs, you can change their ammo, gearset, camo, all this to give a push to fit your build. \n\n**Servers are now working since last update** (Too many players = SERVER CRASHED FIRST HOUR :P)\n                                                                             \"NOW FIXED\"\n\n\nDownsides:\n1.

Not really, if you compare it to other strategy games or the other Warfare games on browser, but it isn't boring. Yes I said the older Warfare games were more fun, but those are finished games and this is early access. The older games certainly didn't have multiplayer but the missions were fairly interesting, and had some more units like the man-portable mortar and the officer, as well as a morale system that let you win in a battle of attrition instead of merely destroying their base as a win condition.\n\nThe existing units do have some interesting customization going on though, as you can tweak them to fit a slightly different role, but there are no stat numbers on the table, and I don't read stats, but there are people I'm sure who would prefer numbers over green and red words.\n\nIs the game interesting? Yeah, I'm interested. It's free so, there's no investment other than time on my end, though there are those Supply Box things...\n\nSTORY TIME!\n\n-Convinced friend to play game\n-Realize there's no way to play with friends\n-Complain about it to each other for a few minutes and then joining our own games\n-At my second game, as i was winning, friend sent me a steam message\n-\"wtf stop rap*ng me you c*nt\"\n-Realize i was playing with friend\n-proceeds to r*pe friend\n-game crashed after winning", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198032635996", "last_played": 1486724774, "num_reviews": 38, "num_games_owned": 114, "playtime_forever": 108}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1486662134, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502569", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1486725483, "recommendationid": "29806376", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Actually a pretty solid game.
