It was a unique time, filled with unique vessels and amazing variety. The ships here are few in number and similar in characteristics. A little more inclusion would have given so much more flavor! The Russians... well, their navy was a bit more limited, but they also had some interesting vessels.\nThe game engine is very simplistic with few options for action. The time complession is completely inadequate for the vessels and their speed of advance. The AI is almost intelligent as Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon and has an annoying tendency to ram any moving object nearby... particularly when they are flying the same colors. At least the gunnery is historically accurate; gunners cannot hit the broadside of the enemy ship unless they are < 100 yards away.\n\nAll in all, it was worth less than the $3 or so I paid for it."}, {"votes_down": 10, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1394553401, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "9420446", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198075217857", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1490665969, "num_games_owned": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 458}, "timestamp_updated": 1394553401, "received_for_free": false, "review": "it is really a fun game, but the battles take forever. there is no such thing as a quick battle, but most battles are fun battles"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1455693521, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501877", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "21269137", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198038466696", "num_reviews": 57, "last_played": 1455691473, "num_games_owned": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 23}, "timestamp_updated": 1455884163, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Well this is a bit of a strange one.Started playing with a fleet of Ruski Warships that I have  got to say aren't quite as pretty as Fall of the Samurai's rather splendid ships.Or as easy to control either.Or setup..Anyway sailed along through the Black Sea and there was no sign of those perfidious Brits.

There aren't that many tactical naval simulators around unfortunately, and the few that do exist tend to leave a lot to be desired. I'm sorry to say that this one is no exception. \n\nThe biggest let down for me was the graphics, which could have been this game's redeeming feature. Had they been really good, or at least on par with Empire Total War Naval Battles, with similar camera controls, this could have been a neat, immersive tactical simulation. Unfortunately, its graphics look like they are based on the video card technology of 2003, and the camera controls are clunky.\n\nOn a more positive note, I found the physics simulation of the ships and ballistics to be spot on, but I do wonder if the realistically slow-paced nature of the game has been a problem for some players. Without immersive graphics to look at, it can become tiresome. I mean, these ships were beautiful! \n\nThis is definitely an improvement on the earlier series, and I hope the developer continues to improve the game. In particular I'd like to see much better camera controls in the next iteration. I'd also like to see some progress towards better graphics, and the addition of weather effects and crew morale to the game. \n\nI'm dismayed to see so many down voters for it here on Steam, as there are so few games of this genre available. This simulation this isn't at all bad. It's an indie game made in an almost dead genre and developers like these ought to be supported, in my opinion."}, {"votes_down": 13, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1390760371, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496712", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "8859124", "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198038759225", "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1421043993, "num_games_owned": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 96}, "timestamp_updated": 1390760371, "received_for_free": false, "review": "the ships are sooo slow very realistic i guess but damn they are slow"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1477598674, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "26250682", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197967356461", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1464593202, "num_games_owned": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 64}, "timestamp_updated": 1477598674, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Really just a bad game with annyoing \"combat\", weird \"physics\" of the ships.
