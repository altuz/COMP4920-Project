It should not be compared to Plants vs. Zombies, since that is a much better game.  That had strategy.  Zombie Pirates is basically killing zombie ships and furiously clicking what they drop before it disappears.   A dead ship drops a parrot, which can purchase ships, grop, which heals one ship, or a bomb which can blow up an area and may destroy several ships.  It's just too hard.  Try moving ships and using strategy in your spare seconds.   While you're clicking on loot, you may miss healing a ship and it sinks, very easily.  Or you miss picking up everything, and even if you do, you may not get a strong enough fleet.  The worst are the birds which come out in flock to sink your ships, yet drop nothing.  You run out  of bombs, grog, or parrots and there's nothing to do but wait for another long load screen to try again and again.  You can purchase upgrades, but they are so expensive, it takes a ton of grinding to earn enough gold, which is a sick attempt to extend the length of the game.
