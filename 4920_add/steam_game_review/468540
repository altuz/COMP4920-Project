I haven't tried the online mode, but it seems to require some sort of account registration to play.\n\nThe content in its current state is a bit bare, but if you like to play tic-tac-toe with your friends, then a buck for this isn't a terrible price overall.\n\nSide note: The game was not playable for about a month, which explains the sparsity of reviews as of this writing. The devs addressed this as soon I wrote my first version of this review, though, so good on them.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024953074", "last_played": 1486492393, "num_reviews": 102, "num_games_owned": 5749, "playtime_forever": 25}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1486456445, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1486480484, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504891", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1486492643, "developer_response": "We changed the configuration on Steam workshop and the game should be playable now.
