I'm afraid that I have to hesitate a little bit to call it a game. The potential for a game is here, but the technical hurdles involved in getting this to work, combined with the incredibly short amount of content really makes this more of a proof of concept than a game, per se.\n\nThe largest issue, by far and large, is that this game does NOT support Internet play. When hosting or finding a game - it's all done across the Local Area Network. So if you and your co-player of choice aren't on the same network (at home, in a dorm, at work, etc) - you're going to need to setup a VPN service to make this work. Some people have reported success with services like Hamachi - that didn't work for me, but I was able to setup a VPN on my particular brand of router, and get myself and a friend connected.\n\nOnce you DO get the game up and running - the entire content of the game can be played in under 30 minutes. For all the trailer talks about \"solve puzzles\" - there was only one puzzle to be solved. \n\nA very unique experience, and one worth seeking out - IF you are tech-savvy enough to get past the hurdles.

"Score: 10/10\nTime to 100%: 150 hours\n\nEasily, unequivocally, absolutely, undoubtedly, undeniably, one of my favourite games ever, ever, ever - did I mention ever - ever! Here are just some of the many reasons as to why this game is so great:\n\nPROS:\n\nThe Leading Man - Something has to be said about our main protagonist - he's an absolute badass reminiscent to that of Solid Snake. From his scar-riddled body to his gruff and gravelly voice every ounce of him oozes cool. I want to be him. Women want him. On initial impressions you might think he will turn out to be a monotone bore, void of personality but this also couldn't be further from the truth. Geralt can always manage to deliver great lines of dialogue from witty quips to interesting introspectives. In truth he is a great leading man.\n\nGame Within A Game - While some games like to add some extra little minigames to their game that can prove to be entertaining for a couple of minutes at best Witcher 3 went the extra mile and added Gwent - a fully fleshed out card game that adds dozens and dozens of hours of extra gameplay. This card game itself is entirely optional within the game, but whole sidequests go unfulfilled should you choose to ignore it - which you really shouldn't - because it's a lot of fun. Northern Realms is best deck!\n\nThe Writing - There's always a special place in my heart for games that manage to give a choice of not black and white options - but the all too common and ever uncertain options of grey. You know, the choices that don't have a clear cut good answer or bad answer. The choices which, all to often is going to hurt SOMEONE. Witcher 3 has plenty of these and even goes the extra mile of luring you into a \"good\" choice only for outcomes to go horribly wrong. It makes me question my choice, makes me feel bad, makes me reload previous saves, makes me love it all the more.\n\nA Good Looker - Straight up this game is GEORGEOUS! There have been plenty of times where I've just stopped in a beautiful glade or mountainpass and just thought \"Wow\" as I take it all in. Even the cutscenes in the game can be so pretty, the characters even have their intricate little flaws and detals like tiny marks, bumps and cuts on their skin and faces. I can only appreciate the sheer amount of work that went into making a game of this beauty. \n\nThe Celtic Influence - Ok this one, well I'm Irish so I can already appreciate the heck out of it. It's blatent celtic cultural influence is just a joy to see and makes me think of a simpler time. Props to the Witcher 3 staff hiring Scottish & Northern Irish voice actors for basically the entire populous of Ard Skellige. \n\nI could also mention other things like how the game does a great job of handling lore of fantasy - delving into a whole host of mytical creatures or how the fighting mechanics of Witcher are a technical joy, having to read up on creatures weaknesses and using useful concoctions in the heat of battle are a must for higher difficulties, but I won't say anymore I can't praise this game enough - PLAY IT.\n\nCONS: \n\nHaha, no.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198129939882", "last_played": 1487950793, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1487952627, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488116", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1487952627, "recommendationid": "30144395", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "LAN doesn't works for me, my friend is doing everything but still, the game does not react", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198077063493", "last_played": 1483730138, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1486583261, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470120", "votes_down": 20, "timestamp_updated": 1491052223, "recommendationid": "29788196", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very fun game to play. \nIt's local Multiplayer/Co-op unless you use tunneling services such as LogMeIn Hamachi (Which works without issue)\nVery fun concept, would be cool to see more levels added.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198005987964", "last_played": 1488068791, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 316, "playtime_forever": 96}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1488069056, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1488069056, "recommendationid": "30181895", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "eh its ok could use a better *fake the internet system*i had to restart my computer 3 timees to reconnect to the internet(my internet)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198328358227", "last_played": 1479566927, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_forever": 32}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487934167, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487934167, "recommendationid": "30138547", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Took forever to get the multiplayer to work.
