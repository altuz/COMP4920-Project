Let me explain, why.\n\nSome people dismiss this genre of games, wittily called \"walking simulators\" as not engaging and generally boring. And, true enough, the common theme for this kind of games is lack of agency or interactivity. But if these components are missing what makes a good \"walking simulator\"?\n\nGenerally the games of this genre rely heavily on observation and exploration, allowing player to experience story and world crafted by the developer via bits and pieces of information, spread across levels, something called \"environmental storytelling\". Walks between these objects and reveals serve as a sort of a mental buffer for a player, a way to process new information and tie it into the mental model of the game universe he's building in his head. Additionally, such walks are best accompanied by expressive environment and music, serving to cement mood and impression the game is going for. And of course the centerpiece of this exposition is the story that is woven into gameplay, the characters, the mysteries.\n\nUnfortunately, De-Void does none of it right.\nPerhaps, the best parts of the game are voice acting and music. That's not to say that they are excepionally good or memorable, it's just that these components of the game were good enough. Other than that the game fails miserably at what it's trying to be. The levels and environment and bland and washed-out, offering little to no entertainment during the soul-draining walks from one point of interest to another, some of which can take several minutes. These points of interest themselves are mostly audio or text logs from other people you never encounter and have absolutely no emotional attachement to. The protagonist is similarly bland and uninspiring, simply a vessel, moved by players hand through empty vastness of scarcely populated levels. The only discernible purpose such long walks serve in this case is to pad the length of the game. On top of that at times your vision will be obscured by weather, making navigation all but impossible. And no map, of course. Where we're going we don't need maps.\n\nIt all could've been saved by a good story, a decent mystery to solve. But unfortunately, no, instead of such we get pretentious and obtuse pseudo-philosophycal ramblings about the nature of man and abrupt ending, which ties none of what we've seen up until this point together. The parts of story and world feel disjointed and don't fit into a whole.\n\nThrow some gameplay bugs on top of that (I've got stuck into tight spaces a couple of times) and you've got a failed attempt at a \"walking simulator\".\n\nI urge you to not buy this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040995031", "last_played": 1501922154, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 260, "playtime_forever": 124}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501929740, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503058", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1501929740, "recommendationid": "34035416", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
