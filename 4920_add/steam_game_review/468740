It runs smoothly, takes advantage of VR, the throw mechanic feels really natural. I highly recommend you to try it. However, I do have some issues/proposals:\n[list]\n    [*] The game ramps up in difficulty really fast. It took me 4 attempts to beat Level 3, the AI's aim is just too good too early on. Survival mode felt better, it allowed for more time to get used to the mechanics before it got harder. \n    [*] Setting up your snowfort at the beginning of each level can be tedious. I'd like to be able to save templates and just load those, or at least reset the snowfort to your previous one for each level when you fail.\n    [*] I wouldn't recommend this game if you have a standing-only placespace. Mine is rather small (1.6x2.2m) and the blocks to build the fort were at the edge of it. At one point I had to pull a lever that was placed outside my chaperone bounds by default.\n    [*] So far, the game is lacking music.
