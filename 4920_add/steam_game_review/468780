I played a few 4-people races and it was super fun for a while especially since you can shoot disables at your friends to slow them down, reverse the controls etc. inbetween trying not to get lost in the maze (especially with the longer tracks, just make sure to find the direction of the flag arrow before the race starts) and parkouring the obstacles. The quality of the graphics is awesome but I will warn those with laptops and lower-end PCs that this might lag for you as the game lagged slightly for me with my i7 2.8GHz, GeForce GT 630 and 16GB RAM setup. It made it quite difficult to pass some of the moving obstacles as they switch positions very fast in the race. Overall, its a really cool-looking, fun party game to play with friends.\n\nPanda Dislikes: Unfortunately there isn't any leveling or reward system for playing the game, so I wouldn\\'t recommend this for anyone going SOLO right now as the server doesn't seem to be very populated either. It was a little disappointing as I do think this game is cool and all that but I think this is more of a one-off game, definitely not one to play often unless your friends are up for it.\n\nPanda Verdict: 3.5/5 - I love the aesthetics, gameplay and idea but it seems to lack a few things that would make it a popular game to play in the long run.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198100778654", "last_played": 1464757567, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 51, "playtime_forever": 34}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1464786155, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462158", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1464813611, "recommendationid": "23326435", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I\\'m not a big multi-player person, mostly because I suck at them.  But this is addicting.  It\\'s a competitive footracing game, with moving obstacles and randomized race tracks.  There is no single player mode, but there\\'s also nothing here that would make it necessary.  The visuals are neat, I really like the designs and colors they went for here.  There\\'s a view for 1st or 3rd person, also which is nice, you don\\'t see options too often.  I prefer 1st person myself.  It\\'s fast paced and a bunch of fun.\n\nYou can get in and out of races really quick, so you\\'re not stuck wasting time not playing.  You get different powers that you can use to trip up your opponents, which can sometimes change the outcome of the race entirely.  I still suck at MP, but found myself winning a couple rounds here and there, just due to some well timed powers and luck.  You get a freeze power which freezes you in your tracks, another power which reverses your controls, and also one that makes you slide everywhere like there\\'s oil slicks on your feet.  You also have a shield that you can use to deflect attacks if you time it right.\n\nAll that with the randomized tracks and moving obstacles make this a fun challenge.  It\\'s not contending for any GOTY awards, but it\\'s definitely worth the $10 and it\\'s a fun distraction that doesn\\'t require a lot of commitment.  I\\'m looking forward to seeing what else they do with this.  Get a group of your friends together so you can scream obscenities at each other over skype or whatever and it\\'s a blast.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197968274410", "last_played": 1479063835, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 127, "playtime_forever": 186}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1464819212, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464427", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1464819212, "recommendationid": "23334890", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "(I did not recive this product for free)\n\nThis game for only being  month old id a good game, its sort of like Mirrors Edge but you are competeing against other players.
