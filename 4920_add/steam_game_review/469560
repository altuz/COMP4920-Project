If you don't mind paying the high price tag for single player bowling then go for it. Since choices are slim on Vive games atm. I may keep it but I sure hope the Developer plans to improve it. I wish it atleast claim to be early access because it needs a lot more polish. Graphics are rather ugly, multiplayer is not included, and in my opinion is a requirment.
