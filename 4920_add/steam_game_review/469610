I am a big Rick and Morty fan and this game gave me exactly what i wanted.\nThere are references to the show everywhere, a simple yet overcomplicated story and some different play styles mixed into this one.

If you want to complete it 100% you might get 1-2h worth of gameplay out of it and for that 30$ is alot.
