The concept seems very basic, but there are constantly new mechanics and ideas introduced into the puzzles that make them really deep and interesting. There are very few timing/skill-based puzzles, so the focus is always on creativity and problem solving. The controls are super simple and flawlessly executed. The dreamy soft graphics with nice piano music make the game a joy to play, and never frustrating trying to figure out a solution. The puzzles are never really too difficult, but also never boring. There are plenty of secret puzzles that are a bit more challenging too.\n\nBut the best part has to be how much charm and character and story is delivered through these tiny little lines. It's an amazing achievement, and a breath of fresh air after playing so many similar puzzle games that just feel soulless and dry.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 85, "steamid": "76561197992550873", "last_played": 1506471621, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 267, "playtime_forever": 241}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506471955, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506471955, "recommendationid": "35232670", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "BIUTIFUL!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198050563587", "last_played": 1505136358, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 444}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504864789, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496117", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504864789, "recommendationid": "34811202", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
