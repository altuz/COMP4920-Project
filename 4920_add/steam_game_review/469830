Low RNG makes the game feel more serious. The 0.5 patch makes the game promising. Instead of nerfing cards and making them useless, less powerful cars get tuned up. Also the mass disenchant is a real improvement. \n\nStill it's clearly an early access game, but they'll get there eventually.

It hurts to play a match because of the game speed, its just too fast and its extremely unwelcoming to new players such as me. I've played Hearthstone for many hours and it has a nice vary of Color, Atmosphere and a nice system. But unless you go to competitive magic competitions regularly then the game is very confusing and doesn't grant a tutorial. I know its in early access but in all honesty i really dislike this games current state. It hurts me to try and play a game when someone has a 12/12 card played and i dont know what a hollow man does, and for the first time in my life it hurts to be part of the Fable Community just because of how unworthy and useless i feel in this game. For new players it must feel like your only taking up space and you playing this game is loathing for everyone else. I hate when i just try and have a friendly casual match but when you have a limit of 10 seconds to choose a morality, quest and play ALL your playable cards and add all of that math up it can really mess with your brain especially on a time limit. Currently i WILL try and get into this game but for now any other card game i've ever played definitely succeeds this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198214224055", "last_played": 1505593530, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 36, "playtime_forever": 60}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505594149, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490703", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1505594149, "recommendationid": "35006655", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": false}]}
