Yes, there are a lot of bullets. The game seems to want to be a twin-stick shooter, but the ship's pacing and shooting lacks the frantic nature of a Geometry Wars. The bullet evasion and combat with the enemy ships lacks the frantic nature of a Cave bullet hell.\n\nOverall, pretty disappointing. The game would have been better designed around a controller with a focus on twin-stick support. Controller support on this can work, but you'll miss aiming with the mouse because the controller feels unresponsive by comparison.\n\nMusic is somewhat annoying. Graphically it is totally uninspired.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197980006490", "last_played": 1500161399, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 78, "playtime_forever": 98}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1498875408, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497652", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1498875408, "recommendationid": "33064603", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "topdown shooter with useless controls.
