It is [b]NOT[/b] your run-of-the-mill hacking simulator. It surprises you with many things right from the beginning. From the text-only visuals (it might be a flaw for [i]some[/i] people, but I actually like it), through the puzzles, to Lena Raine's music. After the 2-6 hour singleplayer part, you are thrown directly into the deep water. This game does not hold your hand [b]at all.[/b] The interface is entirely text-based; that means imagination will be your main \"display\". There is almost everything. Casinos, news networks, freelancers, corporations, hackers for hire, just anything you could imagine and turn into a script. Do you want to make a game in a game? Open up your text editor and get typing! One of the most important parts in the Multi User Domain are scripts. Those are written in what is basically JavaScript, but with enforced strict mode and a few minor changes to avoid sandbox breaks. There is also a database at your disposal, it is MongoDB. As of 21.09.2017, there are over 13 [i]thousand[/i] scripts that players have made. However, not all of them are safe. Some of them are very useful, like lock crackers or loc (system access script - an IRL equivalent would be an IP) storages, but some of them are so brutal that they'll send all of your GC (Global Currency) and upgrades to an unknown user, breach your system and post said system location in the main chat channel (0000). How would you decide which one you should run, and which one you shouldn't? Script safety is defined in security levels ranging from FULLSEC to NULLSEC, where FULLSEC is totally safe (It can humiliate you in chat though[spoiler], don't run owo.whats_this, PLEASE[/spoiler]), and NULLSEC is the most likely to decimate your system. When in doubt, scripts.get_level. The community is one of the best I've ever seen. If you ask anything, you'll most likely get an answer in less than a minute. (or have your stuff [strike]screwed over[/strike] protected by xena.defender, that's an option too) However, because to send a message in game you need to type a (kind of a) long string: \"chats.send {to:\"channel_name\", msg:\"message\"}\", that's why most players can be found on the unofficial [url=https://discord.gg/Q8ZSpJC/]Discord server.[/url] Even the developer hangs around there and sometimes drops cryptic hints, sometimes fixes things.\n\n[h1]Advantages:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Strong implementation of JS and MongoDB;\n[*]Awesome community - whether in-game, or in Discord;\n[*]Hard puzzles sometimes requiring huge dedication (heart.beat);\n[*]Soundtrack that I can't stop listening to.

You REALLY need to read this before purchasing.\n\nFor example the \"tutorial\" or \"singleplayer\" portion of the game takes more than 2 hours usually. So the actual gameplay is not yet revealed by the time your refund opportunity is over.\n\nWhat I am saying is to think carefuly before buying.\n\nSo lets discuss what is good and bad.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nNormally I would not mention this first but I'll talk about the good first.\n\nFor a game that is only typing commands it is actually beautiful to look at.\n\nYou have a bloom, screen distortion, and screen bend effect command to change your graphic settings.\n\nIt's really cool and does not cause any lag for me from what I could tell.(I mean it should not anyway but hey... in case your worried)\n\nTo initiate a hack you type kernel.hardline and it even makes the screen red and text different colors. Seems like a lame trick to make it intense but it is actually very effective and looks cool too.\n\nText ascii scripts are made by community and game alike which look pretty nice.\n\n[h1]Sounds[/h1]\nWhile there is not much sounds it's a big part of your experience actually.\n\nEvery command you type has that little sound to let you know you are doing a command and it is not finished. It just does not get old to me.\n\nThe game soundtrack is pretty great. There is no denying this.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThis is where the problems arise.\n\nWhile playing hackmud you go through the hardly debatable difficult tutorial. You may be like me and forgot several parts of it as soon as you got out of it.\n\nWhen completed you are dropped on the multiplayer portion of the game. Everyone who gets to this portion of the game is completely confused and directionless. Lets discuss why that is.\n\nDuring very little of the tutorial are you told what it is like outside the tutorial. You get some really short and sweet access to upgrades and cash.\n\nWhat the player does not realize is they will be dumped into a playground of scams and cash grinding.\n\nAll the npcs are hard to find without community help due to the player made scripts and game scripts being in the SAME PLACE. Type scripts.fullsec and you'll see player/npc scripts all in the same place. This is absolutely horrible as a decision and is obviously abused for the scamming portion of the game.\n\nT2 npcs ticked me off pretty badly. They require a QR code reader to even get your npc locs. Admitedly someone made a script for this and you can get a QR reader for your phone but that is still absolutely crazy. A game [b]in my opinion[/b] should not require such interaction from a user. Oh and best part is these codes are in text form. FUN!!!\n\nHacking in the game is not that bad but gets repetitive fast. You will hack the same kind of locks at T1 NPCS over and over again with minimum reward. To buy your first upgrade which actually makes you able to be attacked.(oh geez thanks)\n\nT1 manual hacking is not based on how smart you are for the most part and instead is based on how lucky you are. Pick a random prime number, pick a random digit, or even pick a random color. You make think this would be fast but however it takes a couple of seconds to complete a command. Kernel.hardline(How you start a hack) ends in about 100-120 some seconds or something like that and once it is over you actually just run it again and keep going like it never ended.\n\nWhich brings me to another thing.\n\nRISK. This game even says \"In Risk We Trust\" but there is no Risks. There is nothing to worry about in T1 at least. You can end hardline without completely hacking a target with no penalty. The reward for wasting your time can be 50,000 out of the 1,000,000 you need for your first upgrade.\n\nSo that makes the only thing in T1 just grinding.\n\nThe best part is [spoiler]you are not human and are an AI(I believe)[/spoiler] so how can you even be punished?\n\nThe only true risk in the game is other players can make scripts. You can even automate T1 grinding to be way faster. You might ask why I am complaining if this can be done. Well the problem is scripts have to be small and well thought out. Early game you only get 500 characters(I think it counts by characters) for your script.\n\nOther player's scripts can be scams and pretend to be a legitimate service. These scripts can steal your money or your loc(which allows them to hack you). So you won't be able to just use a script whenever you like.\n\nYou can luckily type scripts.get_level {name:\"someguy.hisscript\"} and it will give you a rating. If it is fullsec it is completely safe but the scammer can still give you a safe script that tells you to type an unsafe script so caution is absolutely a must.\n\n[h1]The Community[/h1]\nWhile I know little to nothing about the dev I did join one of their discords.\n\nI was greeted pretty much instantly and everyone seemed nice to be playing such a game. Seemed like a pretty good group of people and some of them was developing completely safe scripts that just do random things sometimes.\n\nIn the game I had much worse mix of people. The chat was advertised full of scam scripts with many being nullsec(least safe). A few people in chat still seemed ok and there was a few new players too.\n\n[h1]Quests[/h1]\nI wanted to make this a special little section due to how I feel about it.\n\nThe quests in hackmud are not what you would expect. \n\nWhen you played the game Uplink for example you got missions telling you exactly what to do or get a message from someone telling you to do something. HACKMUD DOES NOT do this in any shape or form. \n\nThere is in fact quests but they don't even save progress and are just a script by themselves. Matter of fact if you do a previous step in the script you realize if you have a friend who has already done the \"quest\" he can give you the same command and you will have \"completed\" it instantly.\n\nThis makes them pretty horrificly pointless which could have made the game way more fun otherwise.\n\nThe only good thing about quests is a tad bit of backstory and some occassional easter eggs.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n(+)Looks good.\n(+)Great music!\n(+)Community could be far worse. Nice people for the most part other than scam script spam in game chat.\n(?)Everything is script based? I guess it's the idea of the game but eh....\n(?)QR Code reader required to get into T2 npcs. (Who the hell thought this was a good idea?)\n(-)Community scripts are mixed with official game scripts?(New players will have trouble finding stuff)\n(-)Quests are just scripts and very undynamic.\n(-)You can't disable running another player's scripts temporarily(WHY IS THIS NOT A FEATURE)\n(-)Repetitive nature.\n(-)T1 locks are just pure random luck.\n(-)If you don't have scripts you won't be breaking anything fast.\n\nIf you really like hacking games this might be worth it but I'd highly recommend Uplink if you have not already played that.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069963222", "last_played": 1504905054, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 138, "playtime_forever": 1016}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1505250632, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507255", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1505350682, "recommendationid": "34908597", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "apekis", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 7436, "steamid": "76561198346265688", "last_played": 1506796885, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 76222}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505528148, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505528148, "recommendationid": "34985692", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I love this game.
