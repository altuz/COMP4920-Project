It features an extremely easy-to-learn match 3 concept but also focuses on the use of additional \"elements\" to help you in your quest. ---*STEAM VERSION WARNING *--- The version of this game on Steam runs in extremely low resolution around 720p. If you play it in fullscreen the game is very blurry. There have been many versions of 4 Elements released on different platforms. The best version to play is \"4 Elements HD\" which was only available on PS3 through the PSN network.  It features updated visuals, a quest map and castle building feature that add much more to the game.  I wish that version would be released on Steam someday."}]}
