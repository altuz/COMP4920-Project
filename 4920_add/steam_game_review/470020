I just thought to myself, \"I'll just buy this, probably laugh at it, then write a review or something\".\n\nThis game makes no sense to me. It's a world full of vaguely Jar-Jar Binks-looking characters that live in some medieval fantasy world but talk in a... certain way? Let me try to explain: here's a simple sentence. \"I'm going to take this over to there.\" The SnarfQuest translation: \"I'm gonna take dis over dere.\" This is the exact same way I heard people talk on ROBLOX in 2010.\n\nIf the dialogue wasn't too awkward, the voice acting is even worse. And then the puns... GOD, the puns... 3 minutes into the game you can talk to the character's father who is just full of endless fish puns. They don't really need to be there and nothing would be subtracted from the game if they were removed. I don't know if they were supposed to be funny or if they were intended to make us want to do a hard-shutdown on our PCs after seeing them (which is what I did the first time).\n\nI guess I could have withstood the bad dialogue, bad graphics, and bad voice acting if the game didn't run at 5 FPS. The only way I could get to a marginally playable 12 FPS was by putting the graphics on the lowest settings and making the game run in a 800x600 window. But this is a point-and-click adventure game, and dat's about da worst way to play dis kinda game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198126926034", "last_played": 1490807488, "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 154, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_created": 1491007608, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538605", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1491062736, "recommendationid": "30864874", "votes_funny": 6, "voted_up": false}]}
