I'm giving Spellgear a tentative thumbs-up, but really my opinion could go either way.\n\nSo far, it has been a relatively enjoyable experience. The combat is fairly fun, though nothing special. They advertise it as a highspeed action non-targeted fun time party, and it's not really all that exciting. You can do some flips to avoid attacks, but when facing PvE monsters it seems to be better to just sidestep a punch manually. The flips (and sprinting and jumping, yes, jumping) take energy from the same resource pool that is used to cast abilities. Side note: in my first PvP match, I accidentally side-flipped off the map. Acrobatics can be dangerous, kids. \n\nI joined a capture the flag match and it was actually pretty fun! The map design was unfathomably tedious, but the skirmishes that took place were pretty sweet. Both teams sort of clashed at the middle, and the one melee class had a hard time joining the fight without exploding, but with proper timing and tactics, it was possible. Once we started working as a team, we could stand our ground pretty effectively. You can queue for these matches as soon as you leave the tutorial.\n\nRegarding the PvE experience, the first 10-15 quests are essentially: \n\n\"Go talk to John.\" \n\n\"Hi John.\n\n\"Go talk to Sean.\"\n\n\"Hi Sean.\"\n\n\"I can't talk right now. Pretty busy. See if John needs anything.\"\n\nI haven't played for very long yet, and I've already been tasked with killing some stuff, so hopefully the quests will become a bit more interesting/dynamic. \n\nIt's not a very pretty game, and the menu navigation could use some improvement. But as an Early Access title, you gotta be patient and try to help facilitate proper patching. \n\nLike I said, my opinion is sort of good and sort of bad. I genuinely think the game will improve over time, and I'm excited to see how it changes for the better. If you are looking for a polished game, then stop browsing Early Access titles and play Neopets (actually, the Neopets in-game economy exploded a while back. It's fallen into chaos.). \n\nAnyway, I don't really know who this game is for. I don't think I would recommend it to someone who just likes MMORPG's, because so far the questing and PvE stuff is really bland. But the PvP is neat, and could end up being a strong reason to play the game. It wasn't a negative experience, which is why this review isn't a thumbs-down. Maybe you should wait a bit to try it out, or maybe you'd like to be part of the community that's already giving feedback. It's up to you. I'm going to keep playing it for now and see what happens. \n\nThis review is horrendously ambigious.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025754126", "last_played": 1471636787, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 84, "playtime_forever": 58}, "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_created": 1471640973, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523045", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1471661125, "recommendationid": "25020107", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So far pretty good game.

So, yes it needs more classes which I believe they are working on.

And I'm neither tired nor drunk so it's a bit weird.\nAfter the tutorial zone, I saw a store and a page encouraging me to \"join a battle\". So did I. That was a capture the flag. Confusing as hell. Some people can run quite fast (practical in capture the flag) and some others cannot. Some people have strong abilities that deal tons of damage and/or stun you, and I just have my god damned fireballs that are quite hard to land on a sprinting dude and do not deal much.\nThen I went back on that menu, and tried to \"join the world\". Landed on an island, where I was given a few classical-MMO-trash-quests (aka FedEx + monster slayer). No clue on what else was happening. No clue on how my character sheet works. That was too much and I quit.\n\nMixing MMO with MOBA (or CTF ?) elements can be interesting, I'm sure. But right now, you are basically fed a few missions/battles without any information. Who are you ? What are you supposed to do ? In what order ? How can you become better ? Nothing. Is. Explained. At. All. I'm not even talking about \"advanced\" information (like, expert game mechanics used for theorycrafting, for example). I'm talking about basics.\n\nMaybe I should have done a few more FedEx quests to get this information but tbh I always found that infuriatingly boring.\n\nOr maybe, as some of my MOBA teammates say regularly, I am simply retarded. I don't know. But a game lacking content, polish, AND a basic manual is too much for me.

I spent hours of my time waiting for arenas to pop and never ran into a single player once I reached Storm Island. It is harder still when you are dealing with Early Access and the potential fluctuation of content release. This is usually why I try to catch the initial burst of activity during the first week so I have a better understanding of the difference before the re-review six months later. I have spent roughly twelve hours exploring the world of Astarma and believe I have enough to get a general idea of the environment. \n\nThree classes are currently available with each one representing a specific magic type. Tamer (Mage) utilizes fire, Rangers use storm and the Paladin is regulated to frost type skills. Every action performed by the player requires mana including sprinting and jumping. The default attacks used by each class don't use mana, but the Ranger's default requires purchasable arrows. Mana and health are replenished by standing still or using potions, which can be bought or traded for using wild mushrooms scattered around the islands. Equipment can also be found at a few venders in exchange for ingots gained through Crusades or tokens you acquire from Arenas (auction house is not live, most of the vender NPCs are still not functioning).\n\nCombat is tied to the non-target system introduced during the tutorial. All actions are performed using skills and require the player to manually aim toward the intended target to successfully inflict damage. Dodge allows you to cartwheel out of the way of an attack while damage mitigation skills will reduce incoming damage. It is much easier to just strafe around the enemy and ends up making the NPC combat incredibly boring. Every monster type does one or two attacks with varying speeds and depending on the circumstances (fireballs and knife throws) you will not be able to avoid damage. Hit-box sizes also seem to be a problem with certain player skills being too slow to keep up with enemy models, resulting in combat becoming extremely cumbersome. \n\nQuests are the standard kill X amount of Y, collect number of Z and go speak with this individual found in every other game. Unlike most games, however, the quests have you roaming across major lengths of the island map to complete a simple objective. The usual demands of the local peasantry slowly dissipates in favor of teaching the player about the historic properties of the conflict between the Foundation and the followers of Migurat. By the time you decide who to swear allegiance too, the quests will be dried up and Crusades/PvP will be the only real activities to pass the time. Open-world PvP relies on a territory system centered on specific orbs located along the shoreline of the major island. I have yet to see what the territory percentage provides even after I spent two hours destroying every orb to hit the 100% threshold. I have yet to find a group for the Crusades (dungeons with special objectives), but I have been in a couple of PvP Arena matches to understand the general concepts.\n\nThe basic rules for capture the flag apply with teams requiring both flags to score a point. Killing enemy players, damaging said players and scoring points provide experience pooled together to unlock upgrade points. Each point can unlock a single improvement that ranges from useable abilities, increased stats and additional potions. The skills are divided into three branches with a powerful ability on offer once all three branches are completely purchased. Once the timer runs out (12 minutes), the match is over and points are applied to your overall rank. The 1v1 map does not have the unlock system, instead relying on the skills each player has to overcome their opponent. This format is nothing particularly special, but the matches can be relatively fast-paced depending on the team compositions.\n\nInconsistencies are apparent in the environment and are painfully obvious with fall distance. I managed to fall five floors with a net lose of 97 health while falling two floors in other areas to the net lose of 480. I also became wedged into a railing in a few areas that placed me in a falling animation. Some other problems were present, mostly in the form of quest markers not properly displaying and random pop-ins. Regardless, the game managed to maintain a 30 FPS (locked at 30?) the entire time I was playing the game.\n\nVisually the game has some splendid texture detail and lighting, though it could use some better smoothing for enemy models and buildings. Fire effects are a bit weak, but colors are vibrant in most cases. The real treat comes in the form of the night sky, which is absolutely stunning. Ambient sound is pretty good and helps overcome the limited, but fitting music selection. The aesthetic is higher quality than some of the MMOs I have run into recently, it just doesn't stick out much.\n \nThis was one of the hardest games for me to review in months and I believe the reason for it was boredom. The combat system is tedious due to limited mana usage and a lack of skill diversity to keep things interesting. Quests are sparse and rely too much on downtime (travel time) to lengthen them. PvP is hindered due to a very limited player base and player interaction is rarely possible for the same reason. Without enough enjoyable content to help offset the wait times for PvP matches, the experience becomes hard to tolerate. Until the content amount increases or the player base increases, I cannot recommend Spellgear. Hopefully when I return in six months the situation will be more lively.\n\nPros\n- Arenas can be enjoyable\n- Some very nice visual qualities, lighting/fog\n\nCons\n- Solo content is limited\n- Combat requires adjustments\n- Not many people on\n\nEdit: Upon further stress testing on my backup unit, the full screen issues could not be replicated.
