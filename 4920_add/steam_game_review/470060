Not a great one, not a bad one, but a fairly solid one. Fans of the genre are starved enough for good quality games as is, and this one is honestly one of the better ones.\n\nThe graphics are truly retro - a lot of indie games will claim to be retro by making your character a blob of pixels, but this looks honestly like it couldve come out of the arcade era. The soundtrack is alright, not groundbreaking but certainly not bad.\n\nIt is, notably, a shmup and not a strict bullet hell - the hitbox is kinda vague, and there's less focus on massive bullet patterns and subtle dodging and more on just rote memorization of where each enemy spawns. The patterns generally amount to \"a bunch of bullets in a wave\" or \"a bunch of bullets in a line\" from bosses, which is a bit of a shame.\n\nIt's alright/10 but for a game that costs as much as a cheap lunch you could do a lot worse.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198026516510", "last_played": 1494721378, "num_reviews": 36, "num_games_owned": 478, "playtime_forever": 42}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1494721756, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510821", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1494721756, "recommendationid": "31736237", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[h1]Substandard vertical shooter[/h1]\nOh my... this shooter feels uninspired in every way - graphics, music (they sell the OST seperately!!), enemy formations, animations.\nThe graphics look ugly indeed and although 1080p is available, everything is extremely blocky, each block seems to contain at least 9 to 16 pixels!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197982446888", "last_played": 1493957805, "num_reviews": 87, "num_games_owned": 1935, "playtime_forever": 43}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1493958130, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484548", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1493958208, "recommendationid": "31552616", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "For starters:\n\nEnglish it's a language\nGerman it's a language\nDutch it's a language\nSpanish it's a language\nDanish it's a language\nRomanian (not Romania) it's a language\nChinese it's a language\nCzech it's a language\nRussian it's a language\nJapanese it's a language\nFrench it's a language\nItalian it's a language\nKorean it's a language\nBrazil It's NOT a language\nPORTUGUESE it's a language!\n\n\nBesides that \"small\" detail:\n\nPros:\n   - The game it's entertainig for a while.\n\nCons:\n   - It soon becomes boring;\n   - it's repetitive;\n   - It sends you to the beginning of the level if you're killed!\n   - The germans are the \"good guys\"?", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198048888905", "last_played": 1495222239, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 1025, "playtime_forever": 36}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1495223943, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.406298", "votes_down": 46, "timestamp_updated": 1495223943, "recommendationid": "31846448", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": false}]}
