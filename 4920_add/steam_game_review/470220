The game with glitch, crash, or sometimes not even load often. In my case, I was able to get around all this because you sometimes had to be patient with the game. Recently, however, the game will not let me OR my friends host a game because it says \"Your NAT setting have been set to STRICT\". All of us tried the multiple ways to possibly correct this, but all in vain. None of us can host a game now and has since made the game worthless to all of us. \n\nIn other words, you can buy this game, hoping to get around it's usual funks and host a game before you too will not be allowed to host games or else just play with some random people before it crashes in the middle of a game.
