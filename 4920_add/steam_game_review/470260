This cerebral thriller game has got quite a few shining moments within it, but at 20 bucks a copy, I feel it fair to provide some warnings.\n\nFor instance, the game is quite short. There are multiple endings, though to be perfectly honest they feel somewhat 'shallow' given that following your instincts is half the fun of the game. Like me! I got Kaizne good and angry at me quite a few times by pressing the AI, demanding answers for inconsistinecies in its story.\n\nThe AI, Kaizen, that you must speak to to progress through the story, is somewhat easily confused yet hosts a great deal of depth. The use of words like 'thanks' or 'please' will actually impact Kaizen's attitude towards you, which was really intriguing to see and a beautiful touch to the only entity you have any real contact with. Conversely, if you press or demand too much of Kaizen, he becomes far less helpful and starts copping an attitude with you right back. Though I probably shouldn't hype it up so much, I really was very impressed by this simple but elegant little tidbit that made Kaizen into a briefly 'living being' as part of the story telling.\n\nThe story was intriguing, and like I said, multiple endigns really don't leave you with a 'wrong playstyle' for your run. If you don't mind running the same puzzles again, I would highly recommend this title as it seems there was quite a few story thigns I missed during my playthrough, hidden within the logs of the terminals and the unreliable little AI that decides when it is best for it to lie or not.\n\nIf you'd just really enjoy a cerebral thriller, then this game clocked in at roughly 3 hours for myself. Not too shabby, the gameplay is mostly storytelling and puzzles based. I'd probably sell it at $10 myself, $20 is a little much for such a short game.\n\nIt'll make ya jump, that's for sure. Kaizen's 'irritation' can actually become quite alarming, and the station, while not inhabited by any monsters, hosts alot of unsettling scenery thanks to use of lighting and placement of props in just such a manner to speak volumes as to what happened before your arrival. A tale of a spaceship, ironicaly the very definition of freedom, turned into a comfortable prison whose warden will only release you with your compliance.\n\nIn my perosnal opinion, it was money well spent, and I hope you think the same if you pick this up.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198003688382", "last_played": 1505213871, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 402, "playtime_forever": 162}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1505189281, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510935", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505262672, "recommendationid": "34894741", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "There is a bug that may prevent you from completing the game.
