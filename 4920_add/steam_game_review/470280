Driving the car could be enjoyable, but instead it's a pain because you use the trackpad to steer and to also gas/brake.It would feel so natural to be able to hold the steering wheel, but unfortunately it's just for show for now.

I was getting so sick. That is rare for me. I was too high in the seat of the car. The dev should just make us sit in a truck or lifted vehicle like a hummer or something to compensate. The steering is weird too. Instead of using a grab and go method it is slide fingers on track pad. It would have been easier to have left controller steer with arrows forward/backwards/turn left/turn right and the right controller arrow up excellerate and down arrow brake. Why the complicated method I do not know. I was excited about this after some good reviews but I have to rate this down and see if the steering can be done better and have options to grab with triggers or use an arrow method. VR users need options for everything because we have so many different physical abilities or inabilities and ages as well as different PC Specs so every game runs differently for everyone. I am giving this a thumbs down because I could not even steer the car effectively before getting very VR sick. This game wil be good I guess but until I see more I spent my money on a dud.

It looks like the dev is still learning how to bind objects to controllers. Example, I had a doll head in one hand (makes sense once you play it), and a tree branch in the other. They both got latched to the controller, and you can't drop either of them. I've ran into this same issue in Unity, and it needs to be fixed. I really want to see where they go with this, but they need to get some basics worked out first - like learning how to program the controllers correctly. Also, please fix the velicoty programming on the controllers, so when you throw something it doesn't just drop. I'm seeing a lot of mistakes I made my first couple days working in Unity. If this was free, I'd say grab it - but charging for this? No....not when they are still learning the basics of how Vive controllers even work.\n\nAside from that, I had no motion sickness, so that is good. I couldn't find a way to re-align the car to my chair without starting the game from the beginning, but maybe I just missed how to reset the camera ( I ended up sitting outside next to the car while driving, lol). Very cool ideas in this, and I hope they iron this stuff out. But honestly, this should be a free demo as it's currently a buggy mess with the controls.\n\n--edit-- The dev is making key points to fix controller issues, and like other reviewers said - buyer beware for this early access game. I changed my review to recommend, because the concept of this game does seem really good and different, and they are working on the issues people have brought up. Is it worth $5 right now? That's up to you - the game is a cool experience, if you can get around some controller problems (which they are working on).\n\n-edit in November- I was looking back over my VR library, and see this game has turned into abandonware.
