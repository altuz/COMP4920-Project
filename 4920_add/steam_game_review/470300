Maybe on sale if you want to support the creator.\n\nThe game is boring and empty. \nThe art is good but a game need more than pretty artworks, especially at this price.\n\nKingDingo 3 and Cyberdown's reviews are spot on for the various cons of this game but I will add a thing or two.\nNo replayability value at all the moment you end the game, the max level is capped at 99 and you will get this level way before the end. You can maybe grind half an hour to complete your ancient stuff and that's all, nothing else to do after the short story.\nThe whole game can be done in two phases during combat :\n- Exploring the dungeon with just enough speed stats, no vit and rest str/mag to hit first with multi-hit skills to kill everything.\n- Get wiped out by boss, reset without speed and a mix of vit/str/mag and hard-hitting mono-target skill ( or the two-hitting ones ) and destroy him slowly while one of your character heal. \nDone the whole game in six hours at intermediate difficulty like that, it was boring and I can't replay it, nothing else to do.\nExcept punishing myself by trying in hardcore mode but I don't really see any reason to do it at all.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198032265427", "last_played": 1501677053, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 270, "playtime_forever": 371}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1501678143, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509978", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501678143, "recommendationid": "33970335", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
