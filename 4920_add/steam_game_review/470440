It uses the familiar Tetris shapes, and it is a jigsaw puzzle without a jigsaw puzzle picture. You set the blocks to a great soundtrack into the field. This is actually more difficult, than it sounds, because a gold medal awaits only the one filling up every free spot. The game has different modes and workshop support, so if you like this kind of filling up a board puzzles, you have plenty of hours to do so.\n\nWell coded, great soundtrack, different modes that are quite well thought through, I recommend it. Price is ok.\n\nFollow me as a curator at http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28337205-Fair-Minded-Witness/?appid=298050", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197980796094", "last_played": 1501857912, "num_reviews": 67, "num_games_owned": 480, "playtime_forever": 275}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1501858293, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500450", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504476963, "recommendationid": "34017450", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
