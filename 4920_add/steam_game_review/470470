The graphics are cute, and the beat box sounds were fun and the game itself takes some skill to master.  End of positives.\n\nI honestly wouldn't even pay the $1.99; more like a 99c game or whatever you value 30 minutes of time at. There are only 8 levels in campaign which can be completed in just half an hour. There is no achievements, cards, menu options or any of the final touches I like to see.\n\nLocal multiplayer is available; but I have never once utilized it. (in any game). If I did have friends and they wanted to play something locally it would be a much better game. So to highlight that element above others is weak.\n\nOverall, it's cool but only worth $0.50-0.99. 30 minutes of Game-play.\n\n[code][h1] Accidently Reviewed[/h1]\nHundreds of Reviews, Thousands of Members and FREE games for you!
