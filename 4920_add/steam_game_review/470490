In fact, it is quite good! I don't know anything about the original game, or platformers in general. I don't really play them. This game is a good sign that the genre can be put into Virtual Reality to quite decent effect, though. It's the same platforming game, in which you and your sexy rollerblading girl friends defeat aliens and save cows from abduction. I'm surely loving the aesthetic here. Am I using the word 'aesthetic' to much in my reviews? Maybe. Anyway, you play the same game (with a controller or the vive wands) in like a space ship above from the main game action. The game action is part of the VR mode (it is not a 2d screen), but it very much is a glorified cinema mode. It works great though, because the environment you inhabit looks awesome. They also added some first person dance party experiences! Priced exactly correctly, and therefore a total gem for a sale. [spoiler]I liked Roller Blades, but then everybody started calling them 'fruit boots', and therefore I was gay for not being good at skateboarding. There is also a funny kids in the hall skit about roller blading on youtube, check it out![/spoiler] http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=896713104", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961017729", "last_played": 1491001279, "num_reviews": 236, "num_games_owned": 2716, "playtime_forever": 192}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1504129297, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.358454", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504129629, "recommendationid": "34619216", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The VR version looked very nice but the VIVE motion controllers are not supported yet. You have to use a game pad. \n\nThe regular game version took some getting use to moving the characters through a deep depth in the platform experience but after I did I was having a blast.....literally. \n\nThis is a sexy fun game.....literally. \n\nPeople were talking about problems. I had none playing with a keyboard and mouse. Just use the arrows keys to move through the menus amd the space bar to select. Easy peasy.\n\nYou have to use the character abilities together to kill some of the creatures,i.e.,freeze then blast. And change characters to kill certain mobs who are immune to other types of damage. The music is very good and driving as well. It changes with each character. This is a buy in my book and this is not a genre I like. 10/10 for sexy and fun. I liked the bike segment a lot.
