(And if you're like me, it might also feel reminiscent to Tomytronic Thundering Turbo goggle systems.) \n\n[h1]Full Description/Review[/h1]\n\nVery, very simple game. Three inputs. Shift up (which also initiates turbo once the meter is filled,) shift down, and left and right. That's it. \n\nThe premise is to avoid other racers while fighting against the force pulling you left or right depending on which way the track leans at any given time. Survive long enough and you advance to the next race. Fail enough times, and it's game over.\n\nYou can switch between different display modes. (My favorite is \"glowing,\" for the aforementioned Tomytronic Thundering Turbo goggle experience, and a fun, retro, wireframe, neon vibe. :P)\n\n[h1]Recommendation[/h1]\n\nThis is a very brief, very simple game. If you pine for the purity and simplicity - which is a bit extreme in this case - of any of the aforementioned games, then this is a fantastic modern, digital take on that kind of experience. Personally, I love it. But I grew up with those games, and am someone who can value a deep, complex gaming experience, or the most barebones arcade game imaginable. This definitely falls into the latter category.\n\nThere is no real \"AI\" to speak of. (Though there is some variation in opponent movement on the tracks.) This isn't a \"racing\" game, so much as a classic \"dodge the other cars and keep moving\" arcade racer.\n\nGo into this expecting that level of simplicity, and a dearth of options. It's so old school, the Start button actually... well... STARTS... not the A button! \n\nAs I said, I love that personally, but it won't be for everyone.\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\nThere are few if any straightforward arcade racers like this today on PC, and fewer still (this may be the only one) that specifically seek to emulate the style of those vintage mechanical games. (Before graphics as we know them even entered the scene! We're talking literal mechanical, physical machines, and at most, simple LCDs!) This game is trying to recreate that style of game design, albeit in modern 3D graphics. That makes this a very niche, unique product, and I love it for that.\nThere is an additional unlockable mode as a reward for beating the basic Arcade mode.\nYou can choose to see it as lacking in options, or elegant. I choose elegant.\nPure, simple gameplay. \n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\nIf you want anything more than the above... look elsewhere.\nNo multiplayer.\nFew configuration options (such as the lack of volume control.)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040600970", "last_played": 1495705906, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 67}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1495703041, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504919", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495705054, "recommendationid": "31948162", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
