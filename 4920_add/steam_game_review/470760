Saw this game was only $2 and it was on sale for $0.49 so I figured it was a low risk investment to try it out. I'm a big fan of the metroidvania genre and that's what convinced me to try it out. I will say it doesn't feel like a Metroid game at all. Yes you can replay levels but it doesn't have that backtracking or looking for completion incentive. It is a series of puzzle rooms and you have to get from one point to the exit. I'd say it's more comparable to like a Super Meat Boy. There are a plethora of tool tips along the way so you learn as you progress and you aren't left with that where the heck do I go now feeling, which is nice. The puzzles start off fairly straight forward where it's more about jumping and dashing at the right time and then it becomes more puzzle oriented.\n\n-PROS\n-Game explains itself along the way\n-Soundtrack isn't too bad\n-Lots of checkpoints so if you find a hard part you aren't forced to replay the same annoying part over and over like a lot of games similar to it\n\n-CONS\n-Using Xbox One controller, game says it has full controller support but I've noticed it constantly either the D-Pad doesn't work at all or it goes the opposite direction. This bug needs to be addressed.\n-Game crashes when cycling through levels to select a level to replay. Alt Tabbing out of game can cause game black screen forcing a restart as well.\n-Level 4-6 I believe had an area after a checkpoint you could easily get stuck in forcing you to restart the level and there's no way to revert to previous checkpoint so you have to restart the level.\n-Controls in general feel a bit less precise than you'd like, making it easy to set off this laser or bump into a spike.\n-Many levels of invisible spike ceilings \n-When in map mode camera constantly drags and never is stationary\n-Loud thud sound every time you drop down (which is often), for some reason the sound of you landing is made louder than anything else in the game.\n-You eventually reach a dead end with no explanation of what you need to backtrack for or where to get it after having played dozens of levels. There's no sense of direction or knowledge of what you need or where to go.\n\nIt's not gonna give you a Metroid feel. It's just a 2D puzzle platformer.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198115394119", "last_played": 1501624955, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_forever": 161}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1501610564, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501625050, "recommendationid": "33954258", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pretty fun puzzle platformer, but as others have said no real metroidvania element here.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 132, "steamid": "76561198025018402", "last_played": 1507010127, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 286, "playtime_forever": 132}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1507011386, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507011386, "recommendationid": "35437152", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
