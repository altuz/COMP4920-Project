The game is not easy, but with some skill gained from previous levels, some deep cogitation, and a bit of trial-and-error and accustomation to the current level, one can reach the end. The story is interesting, even if, like the rest of the game, it's a bit mysterious and not easy to get at first.\n\nIn addition, I played the game on two computers on two different places, and thanks to the Steam Cloud support my saves were kept, and the game ran not super smoothly but okay enough on the \"not powerful\" machine I though would not be able to run this in the first place.
