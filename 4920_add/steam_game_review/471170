I picked this gem up today for $0.59 today. And man this is a steal for such a fun rainy day game. It's pretty basic in it's control; click a square, pick what you want to build and if you have the proper resources you then wait out the timere and vwah lah your new building is built. \n\nDefinitely a resource balancing game at it's very basic. Balancing Houses, with cultural, market, and religeous buidlings against the cost of new workers, new upgrades, and new resources. Some maps have certain blocks that you don't want to build houses around or suffer pentalites, and some of the maps offer difficulty for the goals laid out to complete.\n\nCurrently only have 7 hours in, but after playing it for 7 hours I just had to write a review to let others know about this gem before it goes off sale.\n\nEDIT: It also has a sandbox mode to play with and make up your own goals. I use it personally to test therories on how to build certain resources faster on a map that I have problems with. Also available are achievements to aquire like most games of today.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198164361248", "last_played": 1504941456, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 36, "playtime_forever": 852}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1497401383, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506982", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1497401628, "recommendationid": "32400984", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[b]Game Type/Genre:[/b] City Builder\n[b]Casual: [/b] Yes\n[b]Theme: [/b] Roman\n[b]Controls:[/b] Mouse, simple\n[b]Difficulty:[/b] Moderate\n[b]AI:[/b] None\n[b]Achievements:[/b] 20ish reasonably easy to get\n\n[h1]Micro[/h1]\n\nA simple point and click city builder where what you build is mostly determined based on pre-set level goals. Few building types and few relevant upgrades quickly devolve into a repetitive level goal oriented gameplay.\n\n[h1]Recommended?[/h1]\n\nI cannot recommend this game. \n\nThe amount of building types seems sufficient for the relative small maps but what upgrades you build is dependent on the mission goal meaning you quickly get stuck into building what the game tells you to build right up to the very last level. \nThe missions themselves can be quite challenging due to the time restrictions for the medals that can be achieved. Even in sandbox mode you just mess around until the map is full and there\u2019s no real \u2018sim city\u2019-style urban sprawl going on that would keep you going.\n\n[u][b]Value For Money[/b][/u] \n\nThis game will taper off quickly after the first 10-15 hours in which you should easily clear most if not all of the achievements. After that there\u2019s really nothing to keep you coming back meaning at a 3.99 euro pricetag this offers too little real value for money.\n\n[h1]Macro[/h1]\n\n[b]Romopolis[/b] is a basic point and click city builder set in a roman theme offering simple graphics to click yourself towards certain pre-set goals per level (i.e. build 15 of type x houses, collect 12 culture etc. etc.) To achieve a medal or trophy in each level certain goals must either be met by the end of the level or within a certain time limit making a bunch of the levels a decent challenge to set up correctly. This particular challenge approach is also what makes this game better than just junk.\nHowever the amount of different types of houses and the upgrades you can do on each house are really limited and for living space often revolves around +20% income and while income is nice some differentiation between the upgrades could\u2019ve really given the game some more depth.\nAfter you complete your campaign you could dig into sandbox mode but will quickly figure out that it\u2019s the same as the base game other than setting your own goals. Since the maps are restricted to the same size for each level and the sandbox mode you really run into city building restrictions and can never exceed the effective 25 building cap.\n\nThis game could\u2019ve really benefitted from some more depth in the upgrade system and larger map options that could potentially lifted it out of it\u2019s \u2018this is just a flash game\u2019 kind of feel that I get from it now. \n\nThe upside really is that if you get it on sale you will notice that you should be able to take care of all achievements in the 10-15 hours range which at least means you can do a full clear while having a little bit of fun.\n\n4/10: Forgettable\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198031685960", "last_played": 1497778414, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 660, "playtime_forever": 760}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1497784801, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502690", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1497784801, "recommendationid": "32534005", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
