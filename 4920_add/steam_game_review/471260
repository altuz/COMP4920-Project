Very mixed.  Some good story, some so-so, good visuals, some software issues.  The thumb here is down, but only slightly.  Steam needs a neutral score option.  See below for the breakdown.\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n\n+ Not another formulaic high school romance or slice of life.  The narrative takes some unexpected and interesting turns in the longer routes.\n+ The character designs are appealing and distinctive.  The level of detail is middling, but aesthetically I found them pleasing to the eye.  Backgrounds are nice enough though some look like retouched photos (I could be wrong).\n+ Some of your choices make very significant changes in the story.  This is a welcome change of pace.\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n\n- The software (or their use of it) is weak in terms of features.  No active log (can only read previous text, can't actually go back and re-see scenes or redo choices), no skip, no options, and it crashed twice.  If you're used to renpy titles, you might be frustrated.\n- The English translation wobbles around among passable, awkward, and downright incorrect.  This can be very distracting, and occasionally confusing.\n- The text formatting for thinking vs. speaking is odd, being exactly the same aside from color variation.  This means thoughts have quotation marks, which they should NOT have and which constantly threw me off.\n- Likewise for multiple characters, only color and context can tell you who's speaking.  Better remember who's orange!\n- The limited log feature doesn't retain text colors, so I hope you have a good memory.\n- An aside: If you're colorblind, you may have issues, as the text colors are yellow, orange, lime green, and cyan, pretty much exactly the gamut of colors used on colorblindness tests.\n- While the narrative got better later in the game, initially it felt tedious and very unlikely.  My suspension of disbelief was unwilling.\n- Some of your choices make zero difference, even though they seem important.  It's a little frustrating to waste time revisiting choices only to have the next ten minutes play out exactly the same.\n\n[h1]NEUTRAL:[/h1]\n\n\u2022 I couldn't relate to the MC at all.  The guy is a prat.  But whatever, it's a story, not a Myself Simulator.\n\u2022 The music is mostly cute, but the loops are too short and it can get on your nerves after a while.\n\n[h1]FINAL WORD:[/h1]\n\nI got the title on sale for about 1/3 off.  As such, I don't feel it was a _terrible_ buy for me, in spite of its flaws.  However, it doesn't deserve better than neutral, and I can't vote \"thumbs sideways\" on Steam.  Coupled with the fact that the normal price is half again what I paid, I have to choose thumbs down.  However, if it's on sale for 1/3 or 1/2 off, maybe it's worth it for some people.  You can do better for ten dollars, though.\n\n---\nNote to devs: Some of the above flaws are easily addressable.  At the very least, you need a native-English proofreader and you should revisit the text formatting.  Adding a volume slider, text color in the log, and a skip-previously-read button would be high on the list as well.\n\nIf you were to fix enough things, I'd be willing to revise my review; just leave me a note here to let me know.  I don't mean to punish you for your efforts, but at the same time, I cannot in good faith suggest the current version for the current price.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067704124", "last_played": 1499698172, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 1228, "playtime_forever": 2024}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499449202, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506308", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499698143, "recommendationid": "33349333", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
