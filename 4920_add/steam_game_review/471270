Now, as I don't have any VR equipment I played the \"desktop\" version, so this review is more geared towards fellow non-VR players. Though it is clear the game is made more for a virtual reality experience and is the main selling point.\n\nGameplay wise the controls are fairly smooth, though I found it difficult to precisely fly through holes with buttons alone, I suspect the flapping ability in the VR version makes this much easier. The gameplay isn't very deep, as the focus is to enjoy the novelty of flying in virtual reality, so us non-vr players are missing a vital part of the game, but it still manages to be a fun casual time without it.\n\nNow let's get into the meat of this review: \"How can it be better?\"\n\nWell let's start with the characters or Birds. I can't remember how many exactly there were at the time of this review, six I believe? The roster is palette swaps for the most part, some have slightly different models, each characterized with different speed abilities. Though one, who's name is Touky, feels heavier than the others, and \"collects\" insects instead of the usual coins that the birds do. I feel as though adding a weight stat along with the speed stat would add greater variety between the birds. On the subject of the Birds, I feel as though more in depth character descriptions would be better for various reasons, even if to just say stuff like why Touky goes after bugs instead of coins.\n\nGoing back to gameplay mechanics: There are seemingly three power-ups, a magnet and a shield, I'll touch on the third in a bit. The magnet collects coins and the shield protects you from the many obstacles, both last for thirty-seconds and can be stacked if you collect another before their time expires. In the case of the shield, time will shorten when you take damage. At first I thought they lasted too long but on second inspection they're fine.\n\nThe multiplier system the game features increases upon the completion of each zone, or acquisition of ten coins, this will continue till the run ends, at which point everything will return to zero. There is another way to increase your multiplier too, a way that confused me for a bit. The \"Glide Multiplier\".\n\nThe \"Glide Multiplier\" seems to activate when you soar high as the clouds, and will double your multiplier no matter what it is. The reason it confused me is because this feat is rather easy to do, but then I remembered I'm playing the desktop version, where you just have to press a button fast enough to get that high. VR users actually need to flap with their arms, which I can imagine might be harder. If I'm right and it is, this means it might be easier for desktop players to get higher scores than VR players. I feel as though a better and more accurately named mechanic would be when you dive down from the clouds and actually glide, it would last till you flap your wings again. Of course, it could be this IS how it works, and for whatever reason it was glitched for me.\n\nOnto the zones, I could go ahead and talk about all of them in detail, but I think it'd be better for players to experience them themselves. There are two I'm going to talk about for the developers sake however.\nThe Beach and Jungle zones are far too crowded with obstacles, to the point the only possibility is to fly above them all, the Jungle zone especially.\n\nFinally I'm going to end this by talking about the glitches I found. Some of them are harmless and just aesthetic glitches, like not landing on your nest. The only major one I found, well, I'm not even sure if it is a glitch. If you recall I mentioned a third power-up, it is a clock. I have no idea what it does. Why is this labeled a glitch? Well there's a spot that explains power-ups on the menu/hud, and there's a space that's blank, I'm wondering if there's supposed to be something there that explains the purpose of the clock. If there's not, there should be, but that does mean I didn't find any real glitches.\n\nAll in all, Leave The Nest is a fun casual game that I bet really shines when using virtual reality devices.
