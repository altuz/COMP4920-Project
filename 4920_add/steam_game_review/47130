When you find the sword, you know it is the correct sword, because it will say EXCALIBUR SWORD on the blade, with made in china maybe on the other side who knows.  There are shady guys who will ask you to steal priceless artifacts, from crowns, to terra cotta warriors, jade statues, paying you 80$ for these priceless treasures, the economy of the hidden object world sucks.\n\nThis puzzle game is for advanced hidden object hunters only, this game runs on nightmare difficulty.  New players may want to avoid this game until they bone up on their Hidden Object skillz.  There is a hint button to press, or keep pressing, but why bother with a puzzle game if its just to beat the game, its not an RPG with some epic story, the fun is in the puzzles.  What makes it difficult is often there will be objects the game looks for that you cant click to see what they are, meaning if the name of an item appears like a censer and you don't know what that is you are SOL.  Other items are hidden behind other items or photoshopped to have the same color pallete as the foreground, also the image quality is a bit fuzzy for some of the images as in low res making it hard to make out what an object is.  Whats nice is this isnt a typical hidden object game where a flea market throws up random objects everywhere, all items fit the scenes.\n\nSir Bridget Doyle's tip:  In this game the rooms are layed out like real rooms, no floating objects or anything, its best to picture yourself in the scene hunting for the object, try to build a 3 dimensional image of the scene using the power of imagination to overcome that hint button!\n\nAdvanced Players:  Rating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99\nBeginner Players: Rating 1/10  Value:  $0.99 <---Its real hard new Hidden Object Hunters will just keep hitting the hint button making the puzzles useless since their puzzles."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1342436654, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507649", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "5115968", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198045208825", "num_reviews": 67, "last_played": 1342508400, "num_games_owned": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 203}, "timestamp_updated": 1342436654, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Okay object finding puzzle games.

I don't play them often enough to be an authority on the genre, but this one was a major disappointment. Book of Legends has a couple of kids looking for the sword of Exalibur based on hints from some ancient book. It's roughly 4 hours of fetch questing which is unrewarding in itself, but then the game ends unspectacularly--it's unfinished, only offering half of a story. There are also several times where it is unclear on what exactly you are supposed to look for.\n\nNow there are a couple shining aspects to the game, like the dialog between these two kids and the fact that the story actually holds interest, but it does require closing your eyes to how two kids have unrestricted access to all these different locations.\n\nBeing only half of a game, I would definitely recommend staying away from this unfinished product. If it told the whole story, I'm positive I would recommend the opposite."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1296837311, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497272", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "3028870", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198016179939", "num_reviews": 102, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 1517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 213}, "timestamp_updated": 1296837311, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Fairly typical find-the-object game with a story plot of looking for the sword Excaliber.
