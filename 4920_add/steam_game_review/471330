Sometimes a bowl of deliciously simple ice cream isn't improved upon by adding a pile of whipped cream, sprinkles and other toppings.  And Versus Squad doesn't quite find the right balance but you still wind up with a pretty good dessert.\n\nThe premise is simple: A twin-stick shooter where you mow down waves of zombies in a never-ending endurance fight.  Weapons and power-ups abound and you gain selectable perks as you progress.  Versus Squad adds a defense element by allowing the player to purchase and place walls, fences, sentry turrets, explosives and other items to protect themselves and funnel the zombie hordes.  Unfortunately, the defense part didn't always seem to make the game better.  In my first game, it bugged out and locked up the game (that hasn't happened since).  In other games, no one had enough coins to do much between waves. The UI is clunky which just adds to disrupting the flow of the game.  There's also a survival mode where you place items once and then fight continuously without wave breaks.\n\nAlthough I didn't think the defense aspects were entirely ready for prime time, the game itself remains solid and the other improvements are nice: you can earn points to buy permanent perks, the graphics are much improved and the game still feels solid.  It's not a bad game by any stretch; it's a pretty good one.  But the new elements need some more tweaking to match the simple beauty of Nation Red.  Fortunately the developers remain involved in updating the game and I expect good things for it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198011364752", "last_played": 1503459467, "num_reviews": 32, "num_games_owned": 1720, "playtime_forever": 426}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1500824701, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519508", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500824701, "recommendationid": "33746792", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Versus Squad is an amazing follow up to Nation Red. \nBoth are \"Twin Stick Shooters\". In a twin stick control scheme, one stick controls the player character's movement while the other stick controls the aiming of the weapon. this control scheme allows fast responses to targets in 360\u00b0s. it is especially convenient for consoles and associated controllers. this control scheme became popular with the blockbuster game \"Robotron 2084\"\n\nthe ability to  take diarama arena sandboxs and modify then in preparation for the hordes of enemies to come adds to the aspect of trying different tactics. there are several choices in the build phase as well. repair of defenses is possible in game during the \"Build Phase\"\n\nthe player may carry two weapos at a time. one active and one secondary. it is possible to \"lock\" weapons you wish to keep. during gameplay different weapons may spawn and unless your weapons are locked, one will be replaced. this can be a boon if it is a bettrer weapon or a hindrance if is worse.\n\nthis ia a fast paced shooter that requires good movement skill in addition to good aiming skill. \nthere is much, much more about this game. Perks, Power Ups,Online Multiplayer and more.\n\ni whole heartedly reccomend Versus Squad and hope you enjoy it as much as i do.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197962502174", "last_played": 1502147579, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_forever": 1449}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1502843199, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514214", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1502843199, "recommendationid": "34266636", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[h1]Versus Squad: An addiction in a nutshell.[/h1]\n\nI bought Versus Squad during the summer sale with the notion that it would be a \u201cfun 4 dollar game\u201d, but it turned out to be a lot more than that.\n\nVersus Squad is one of those games that can easily become an addiction. From the outside looking in the game might seem repetitively simple. \u201cBuild Here. Kill Here. Die Here.\u201d, is how games like this normally are and once you establish that the game can become stagnant fast. Versus Squad isn't like that. While this game isn't overly complex it does have enough complexity to keep you playing.\n\nIf you're interested in the array of things that make this game what it is then I will point you in another direction.[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=849180214] All of the basics can be found here! [/url] If you're interested in the positives and negatives of those things then continue on in this review.\n\n\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n\n \u2022 The Perk System plays a large part in how the game will progress for the player. As the game progresses you're able to choose Perks to help you fight off the attackers. In the end [i](if you survive long enough)[/i] you might be able to get most of the Perks in game. Choosing the right Perks in the right order that fits your play style is what will help get you there.\n\n\u2022 Defenses are a very large part of the game and the main reason I keep coming back. The map is a Sandbox and how you set your defense up will directly impact how long you last. There is always room to improve upon your failed attempts.\n\n\u2022 The game plays smoothly. The rolling. The shooting. The running. The surviving. All of these things match together perfectly and brings an overall enjoyable feel to the game.\n\n\u2022 It's a great COOP game. Playing this game with 3 other people is a hoot. I don't know how to praise it enough. If you like playing with friends then you will like this game.\n\n\u2022 Achievements can keep the game interesting. If you're interested in Achievements like me then you will be happy to know this game has some fun ones. Take a gander through the Achievement list to see for yourself.\n\n\u2022 The Dev actually interacts with the community. They actually listen, communicate, and try to fix the problems that the community faces. I think this says a lot for a game.  Take a scroll on over to the Steam Forums for this game to see what I mean.\n\n[b]Negitives:[/b]\n\n\u2022 [i]The game can be buggy.[/i] In the 25 hours I've played I've yet to run into anything game breaking. There are bugs that range from a minor inconvenience to flat out annoying. [i]Not being able to place Defenses down for a wave is the one I most commonly run into.[/i] If bugs completly ruin a game for you then they might ruin this one.\n\n\u2022 The game is dead. There is no good way to put this. I can make a few public matches over the course of a few hours and wont have a single person join. Than other times it will fill all the way up by wave 2. Sometimes there wont be a game up for seemingly hours, but other times there will be a few. If the main reason you're buying this is for the COOP then I highly recommend you convince a friend to get it or are at least willing to actively look for people to play with.\n\n\u2022 It can get repetitive. I wont lie and say this game will keep you entertained for months on end. That is just the nature of games like this. The only difference is that this game lasts longer than most.\n\n\u2022 The menu controls are clunky. Navigating through the menus isn't the best experience around. It can be confusing at times and a little frustrating at others.\n\n\u2022 The connection type is Peer 2 Peer. I don't see this so much as a negative, but something that is just worth mentioning. If you've played any other game that is Peer 2 Peer you will know what it's like to play this.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\n\nSimply put this game is fun and is well worth the money. If you can pick it up on sale even better. If you can convince friends to get it then hot damn you're golden. While getting into a match [i](finding people and navigating the menus)[/i] can sometimes be a burden once you get into the match be ready for 30+ minutes to just sail on by. I mean I've put more time into this little game than most AAA titles I buy during sales. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a Sandbox Twin Stick Shooter. Heck even people who like Tower Defense would like this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006894941", "last_played": 1505076492, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 465, "playtime_forever": 1931}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1499719439, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506593", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499724279, "recommendationid": "33440351", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "From the creators of one of my favorite topdown shooters, Nation Red, comes Versus Squad. This game is an improvement on Nation Red in many ways. The new enemies are epic, the guns are great, and the maps are well made. The perk system is well made much like the first game, with Perk Modes dictating how you recieve them in-game. New to the series is the ability to gain \"Perk Credits\" by leveling up your character. Perks bought with these stay with you in-between games unlike normal perks, which reset after every attempt. The most important new feature is the ability to build. You and your squad can build barricades and turrets, among other defensive items, on the map either before playing or in-between waves depending on the game mode you choose. These things along with the constant updates and very responsive dev makes Versus Squad a must have for people who love topdown shooters. Be warned though, while fun in single-player the game is intended for (and thus 100x more fun with) other people. So if you can grab some friends that are willing to buy this game and play it. And while you are at it get Nation Red. It is an older game, lacking some of the features of Versus Squad, but it is still very fun and includes a little mini-storymode of single-player levels. Nation Red also have and amazing multi-player so you can pick and choose, or do what I did and buy both.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198099055821", "last_played": 1503924645, "num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 397, "playtime_forever": 238}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1500341544, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498739", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500341544, "recommendationid": "33620139", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A great game from one of my favorite indie devs who made the awesome Nation Red", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004583352", "last_played": 1487992620, "num_reviews": 114, "num_games_owned": 6935, "playtime_forever": 205}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1502790975, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503114", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1502790975, "recommendationid": "34252789", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Honestly, just a fun way to kill 20 minutes.
