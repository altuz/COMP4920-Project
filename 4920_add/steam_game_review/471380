I know that it was very exciting for me, because even though I was a nerdy and well-behaved little kid, it was fun to imagine an alternative me putting those tricks to use on the street. Well, this is that game. You shoplift so you don't starve, you grow, smoke, and sell weed, you make molotovs to defend your squat against over-zealous riot police, and you skate in a minigame homage to NES's 'Skate or Die'. I play a lot of games, and this was a real breath of fresh air to me.\n\nIt's essentially broken down in to several very simple minigames and a fairly simple meta-game on top of that, which basically boils down to: Avoid cops, don't starve, and stay sane. Action success is usually determined by an RNG. The pacing of the game is nice; it eases you in to new game mechanics just at the right time. This was the carrot on the stick that kept me interested, because there is admittedly some tedium here that is caused by the cruel RNG gods (something that needs to be balanced by the creator, in my opinion). For example, there is a bonus mission objective in which you have to abstain from smoking weed for the duration of the mission. Well, the cops raid the local squat randomly which denies access to it, and staying sane depends upon your ability to visit the squat to socialize. If the cops show up every single day (which has happened to me several times), you are out of luck and must restart. Another bonus mission depends on your ability to shoplift successfully X number of times. Again, if the RNG is unfavorable, you have to restart. Both of these missions took 5+ attempts for me, which is extremely frustrating, given that it was not my lack of skill that necessitated this. Additionally, despite the fact that both of these mission objectives were labelled as 'Bonus', they were anything but, considering that I needed to complete every bonus objective to move past level 5 (There are 11 levels, BTW). \n\nIn a weaker game, these points would have been frustrating enough to cause me to stop playing, but I was invested enough to see it through to the end. It was oddly addictive, despite the frustrations, and I quite liked the minimal yet engaging story. This to me feels like a game that is more than the sum of its parts. It has a heart in there, and I can't say that about most games.\n\nAs a side note, all of the pirates are blue (none of the other characters in power are), and are profiled by the police and searched without due cause. I assume this was intended as some social commentary on racial profiling.\n\nAt any rate, give it a shot. It's cheap, and you know about Steam's return policy right? Just return it before 2 hours are played if you don't like it. It's certainly not for everyone, but to me, it's a little diamond in the rough.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002864117", "last_played": 1466530168, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 313, "playtime_forever": 1139}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1466532907, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517034", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1466532907, "recommendationid": "23690014", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "tl;dr: For me personally, the fun of this game does not outweigh the frustration of the game.

When you get caught stealing, which seems to happen more and more frequently, you then run in a vertical scrolling stage with only left, right, and jump buttons [url=http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471380/ss_7c45f7876f59012c2b88cde0aaad3cef0a6d16c5.1920x1080.jpg](like this)[/url]. This seems nigh unwinnable to me, and I've only successfully escaped the police one a couple of occassions. For me as a player, if I roll poorly on the RNG for shoplifting, I almost always get caught. When you get caught, you are fined 50 bucks which you are supposed to pay at the police station. If you don't pay it, because who has 50 bucks in this game, then the next time you're caught shoplifting you go to jail. Jail makes your sanity plummet (it drops -1/day, -2/day if you're starving. 0 = Game Over, 10 = Capped) and sets your action points capped to 3 (from 5). With 3 action points, you can steal for food, so that you can eat, or you can socialize (if the squat isn't being raided by the police which happens far too frequently). Assuming that the cops are not raiding the squat, you can get anywhere from 1 to 3 sanity and 0 to 1 food. Keep in mind that you lose 1 food and 1 sanity every day. So, many days, if you just socialize, your day will be net zero sanity and negative to food. Being that you only have 5 action points a day and lose health and sanity every day, this is really a resource management game with an overzealous dice roll mechanism. If that's your thing, get on it.
