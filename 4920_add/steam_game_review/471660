I'm no artist and have no experience whatsoever with graffiti but it's great fun to try it in VR. The experience is very immersive, and after a few hours in the simulation I found myself searching the net for real life spraypaint techniques; maybe I'll go out someday and try it in real life :-)\n\nSome things I'd like to get fixed:\nThe warning message when the player's head gets \"into\" the wall is quiet annoying. Would be better if the head would just stay outside. Same goes for the spray can, a better collision management would also enable the player to use real life spraypaint tricks, like hitting the wall with the cap to produce small dots or very thin lines. And, like mentioned in a few other comments, a stencil / cardboard would also be a great addition. \n\nAll in all a great game!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970731167", "last_played": 1505854659, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 193, "playtime_forever": 239}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1503510608, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507949", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503510608, "recommendationid": "34443413", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Messed around a bit to get it working with my rift *$10 cheaper on steam than oculus store* Basically set to Windows 7 Compatibility mode then launch the game from inside SteamVR Home.
