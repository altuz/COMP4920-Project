Everything about this game makes you happy. Everyone's always smiling (because your character can only smile), other players are extremely friendly (its totally normal for people to compliment you or congratulate you if you hit them in paintball), and the devs are just as feel-good as the game itself. They are extremely responsive to the community and really have a way of making everyone feel special. I sent Against Gravity an email recently, and the response I got came back less than six hours later not from some intern, but from the CEO. And in the AMA, when someone asked how they could support the company financially, the response was to instead to make a donation to charity and to \"tell 'em coach sent ya\". They're small gestures, but it really shows that they care.\n\n\nIn a world where it seems like we are constantly being bombarded with negativity, and where everyone is divided, this game is like a haven of positivity.
