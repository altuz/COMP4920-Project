I would like it if you could change controls ( ie: i have a PS4 game controller and this game works with it, but i want to change the left and right to L1 and R1 ) 2. The graphics are pretty good, though it would be better if you could customise it a little bit more, say if one map is really laggy, I could turn down the graphics so that it would get better, therefore creating a more fun experience for me and my friends 3. There aren't alot of people online to play Multiplayer and alot of my friends live quite close to me and also play this game, I think it would be better for the game if you could implement Local Multiplayer, again, therefore creating a better and more fun experience for me and my friends 4. I don't like loading times and this game has possibly the fastest loading time yet! I can get straight into the action in around 2 seconds 5. This game also has one of the most user-friendly menu's and i like that you can change the colour of your' character right from the start screen!\n\nI can't think of any more things to say about this game, but it DOES remind me alot like F-Zero, Redout and WipEout\n\noverall, 10/10 -==- would Rocket Ski Dangerously again", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198249624676", "last_played": 1494689613, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_forever": 106}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1485106885, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499244", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1485106885, "recommendationid": "29427118", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a fast game.\n\nIt pegs my 980Ti at 100%.
