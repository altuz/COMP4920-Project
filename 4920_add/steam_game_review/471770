This is an alpha build so clearly this is not representative of the final game. A lot needs to change and be built on to make it a good enough game for release and I am sure it will be. Currently the way the raptor controls is crude and imprecise both in terms of movement and trying to target and attack enemies. You essentially run around some procedurally generated corridors smashing nearly everything in your path and attacking any robots you see. Once you have beaten enough robots you can then take on end of level robo brain boss and the level ends.
