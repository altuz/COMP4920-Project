I'd recommend it in the same way that I'd recommend Dead Rising 1: recognize its few flaws, but definitely enjoy it for what it is. Now that the game is nearing its teenage years, it's starting to look pretty rough around the edges, and this port isn't exactly spotless, but if you look past some minor audio snags and lack of keybind prompts, you'll most likely enjoy it. Ranks up there with Dead Space 2 for having some very relatable swearing and grunting."}]}
