The game is a challenging, strategy oriented card builder that takes quite a bit of wit and honestly a LOT of luck as well.  You can build a custom deck to fit your playing style and to counter different AI strategies but in the end you'll very rarely get better draws then them, even with a well built custome deck.  The game is geared toward the AI and its way obvious, which is understandable considering its a free game.  All in all, interesting game, but the AI is garbage and almost feels like your being cheated against practically every game but if you decide to give it a try, I hope your not an impatient person or get frustrated easuly because if you are, then you'll want to break you're PC playing this one.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198096760612", "last_played": 1487724893, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 40, "playtime_forever": 330}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1487698410, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487698410, "recommendationid": "30083234", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Really wonderful game.

It personally gave me 2 good hours of gameplay.\nOverall recommended.\n \nUpdate: Well i played the game some few more hours and i got to say it has much more depth than i thought it had.
