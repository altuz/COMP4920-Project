I understand the need to reward kickstarter supporters, but it can be done more subtly than that. \n- The puzzles are child play.\n- The game(if you can even call it that) takes about an hour to an hour and a half to finish. It feels like an opening to a game (like a first chapter) rather than a full experience. And the fact that we do not have a continuation confirmed, means you are going to play a non finished product.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970728266", "last_played": 1495227541, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 1053, "playtime_forever": 299}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504586716, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503848", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1504586716, "recommendationid": "34749762", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
