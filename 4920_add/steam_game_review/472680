In less than 10 minutes of playing I stumbled upon clich\u00e9s after clich\u00e9s. \n\nThe game is divided into three branches, each putting one of the character in the main spot, with the Innkeeper, being the link between them.\n\nIt starts out with The Prince having a wet dream about Elisa. Honestly, that was a bit too much, and that's right at the start. Right there, I knew I would dislike the game.\n\nThe personality of each character seems to be really fluid, not constant, and it just screams \"bad writing!\". They are also all jerks with almost no redeemable qualities, even if you choose the good option.\n\nFirst, there's The Prince. Depending on your choices, he's either a cheapskate, a liar, a thief, someone's not respectful, someone who doesn't know what privacy means, or even a beggar. He also may force Elisa to do his binding, or even threatens the merchant for what he consider a small amount of money. No matter your choices, at least 2 of them will happen because he's a shitty human being.\n\nSecond, there's the merchant. He's one of the most decent character, but still, he's trash. Not as much as the Prince. The Merchant acts as the rival of the Prince. He can be a liar, a thief, or a scammer. He also force Elisa to accept his gifts (where we see that she is highly uncomfortable) and he manipulate people to make him look good. Ew.\n\nThird, there's the Knight. The character with the least amount of interactions, and that's a good thing. He start off as saying women are worth nothing. Like, right at his introduction, we get to know how misogynist he is, sweet! He continue off, with the other characters saying he hasn't met the right one. That's some great heteronormative dialog here. He could be gay or even asexual, but the author doesn't want to. (I mean, I can let it slide a bit, depending on the time period this is set in, but... We don't even know if it's in the real world or a fictive world...) \nAnyway, the knight is a jerk no matter what you do, he'll treat the staff like shit. Depending on your choice, he may also treat Elisa like shit, too! He even spout a line totally not made for him, to the prince: \"Respect others if you want to be respected in turn.\" ... Yeah, the same guy who treated others like shit. Wow.\n\nLastly, there's Elisa. Not much is said about her, she seems to be doing drama for her amusement, and in one route we learn that she somewhat manipulate the men who love her for her pleasure. \n\n\nIn one route, we get to see a bit about her past (by the prince who decides to read her private journal, from when she was a kid.) It's pretty much 5 pages of \"I'm sad my dad died.\" It just feel shoehorned here, and it ends up only being used so the Prince scores points in her heart by blatantly lying about his mother's death. \n\nAs for the engine itself... There's so much things wrong here. For no reason, I ended up on the title screen... With the game still playing. I could continue reading dialog while I was on the title screen. It happened 3 times, and I don't know how it happened. If you click-hold and move, it would be like you selected the background, which is so fuckin' weird. \n\nThe skip function is really slow. I haven't tried autoplay. \n\nHonestly there's way better visual novel worth your time here, even for free. This one is just an uninteresting mess full of bad ideas, and it just makes me way less interested in the main game; which will be without me, for sure.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198059971262", "last_played": 1486667154, "num_reviews": 278, "num_games_owned": 1138, "playtime_forever": 57}, "votes_up": 27, "timestamp_created": 1486669423, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515666", "votes_down": 14, "timestamp_updated": 1486669423, "recommendationid": "29808740", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I was going to play through all of this for the achievements as well as for the sake of the review, as I normally do, but it glitched me out of the game three times or so.

The vibe it tries to have is nice, but it's just lost somewhere in the background as the stupid, hateable characters argue in front of you all the time about whatever silly shit that occurs in no real human being's brain. It's kind of a disaster in the sense that it seems to have been written by someone who simultaneously hates and glorifies women. r9k?\nThere's a bunch of technical things that are getting on my nerves and I can't tell if they tried to be archaic with the writing because it's just so bad. The dialogue is not realistic at all, making the already nonbelievable and one-dimensional characters plain ridiculous. This game is a joke. They tried here and there but.. the final product is just a joke.
