First off, the graphics are pretty good, being what they are. \n\nThe narrator is NOT a dick. He's an annoying, grating repetetive asshole. Not only does he repeat himself every few seconds, but he usually doesn't even get a chance to finish his setence before he's launched into a new line.\n\nThe game killer for me, is this. There is no analogue control. Just like IWTBTG the first couple apple trees drop apples for an insta kill and clouds drop lighting bolts for instakills, blah blah. The point is, you can't slowly edge towards it to set the trap off. You move so quicky that even if you tap the direction super quick, at least 1/2 the time you'll end up running underneath a death trap even though you knew it was there. \n\nIf it had analogue control with pads, or even a walk key I might have tried to actually finish this game. As it is I'm refunding and hoping to God I never have to hear the nasal repetitive voice of the Narrator again.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010737305", "last_played": 1494900800, "num_reviews": 65, "num_games_owned": 1053, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1494901101, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526595", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1494901101, "recommendationid": "31779849", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I was laughing the whole time.
