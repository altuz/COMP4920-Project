Lacks content diversity. A slog. Narrative not worth it. Most of the map is useless and you can beeline to the end boss quick if you know which path to take, only one map then game over. Slow clunky UI for hex based combat makes soloing with hero only way forward.\n\nReview: You hit a ceiling in terms of content about 7 fights in. The rest is just grinding stats for your hero so you can defeat the gatekeeper and get the game over still image. Writing was ceremonious and befitting of an afterlife theme, but the narrative itself was not all that gripping. The setting is purgatory, kind of as a spinoff to novel of dante. The geographical description are short, but often surprising, and hints a unique bosses or unique conditions, but you always get the same recycled backdrops and foes. Micromanaging a squad is annoying and mostly useless as you can make your hero OP just by farming the first level a few times. The sprites I thought were beautiful in game once your eyes adjust to the indie setting they had nice fluid idle animations but nothing for attack and defense or death. The audio was pretty solid as well all around. The upgrade tree seemed badly designed, both in terms of balance and also in terms of cost to purchase and effects bestowed. The active abilities take huge portions of your health which makes them useless.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "last_played": 1500614004, "num_reviews": 1973, "num_games_owned": 4956, "playtime_forever": 367}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500614725, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505086143, "recommendationid": "33688971", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
