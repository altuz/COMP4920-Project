The fact that the level starts before the camera finishes zooming on Miko caused a few deaths, and the fact that it's in 3D rather then 2D makes some of the physics less predictable then its ancestor, but on the whole these don't really mess with the general feel. Also given the small price tag, I think it's not trying to reinvent the wheel too much.\nMiko's little helicopter pack thing also makes the gravity of the Boulderdash genre a little more visually logical for me.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198062344972", "last_played": 1466014412, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 457, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1464635371, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497806", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1464635371, "recommendationid": "23296223", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game captured my attention because my toddler daughter is so infatuated with the game. \nMiko Mole is a clever blend of the puzzle, strategy, adventure, and platformer genre. Throughout the gargantuan amount of levels, players will face a myriad variety of challenges some of which are more difficult than others. Some levels are straightforward while others are more intricate and the difficulty does not necessarily progress in that order. Some people are complaining about the graphics, but I argue that they are adequate if not appropriate for the game. Miko and his co-stars are adorable. Additional elements are added as the game progresses which keeps the game refreshing, but they don't appear until later in the game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198089832651", "last_played": 1480306306, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 253, "playtime_forever": 552}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1466088141, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499248", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1466833424, "recommendationid": "23597037", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
