Not bad for this caliber. No Xbox360 pad support. Music was good but did not always mesh thematically with the game. Effects for lasers were nicely done. Sprites for ships were okay. Progression is grindy, GRIND for XP AND COIN AND SLOT MACHINE. *ugh* There are no power ups or anything, just different ship types for the progression, you have to buy in game crates and get new ships as random spawns. The difficulty ramps up gradually ensuring that a large slice of people with different skills can have a chance to try the gameplay. Game difficulty overall is fairly casual especially once you have a ship that complements your playstyle. Always the same map, music had only a few tracks. About half a dozen type of ennemies, zig zag ships, missing saucers so on. After about 1 minute of gameplay it is always the same thing with gradually more foes spammed on top. No way to make the screen accept modern resolutions. This falls short of being worth keeping permanently in library, between the shallow content, grindy unlocks and technical shortcomings but it was not all that far from it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "last_played": 1500422412, "num_reviews": 1973, "num_games_owned": 4956, "playtime_forever": 459}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500422749, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500422749, "recommendationid": "33640728", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
