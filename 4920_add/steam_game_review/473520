Rather slow paced; though I guess that fits with the intent of the game. You probably need to read the manual; that's no chore though as it's short and well presented. Puzzles are optional, and just as well as some are rather hard.\n\nEdit: now I\u2019ve progressed a bit, just to tell you a bit about the teachings. One should always be cautious with spiritual things,   so keep in mind this is just my opinion and Im only a moderately spiritual person at best.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the teachings here are the real deal. It\u2019s easy to spend thousands on teachings that are worthless at best and harmful at worst.  The teachings here seem very well presented and well chosen.  I\u2019ve strayed of the spiritual path a bit recently,  but I didn\u2019t expect this game to help at all as Im a Christian, would never consider converting away, and I don\u2019t believe in syncretism (mixing religions).  I just thought the game might be an easy way to learn a little about Asian faiths.  To my surprise though,  the teachings seem to be helping me renew my spiritual hunger. I now have a better grasp of why certain mystics say that deep down the different spiritual paths are similar.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198167667963", "last_played": 1463325253, "num_reviews": 34, "num_games_owned": 154, "playtime_forever": 482}, "votes_up": 38, "timestamp_created": 1463263017, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518652", "votes_down": 14, "timestamp_updated": 1463390857, "recommendationid": "22986419", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game just isn't suited for me - I lack the patience.

The music is calm and relaxing. The quotes, inspirations and teachings are well chosen. The overall visual scheme is simplistic and supports the main theme.\n\nHowever.\n\nConsidering the game is supposed to be a spiritual experience, it activates the mind quite a bit. The puzzles and the overarching goal of achieving and collecting everything available is in contrast with the teachings and quotes about surrendering to the ever-present, natural flow of life. They align with the controlling mind instead of the all-embracing heart.\n\nFurthermore, as spirituality is usually about going deeper and deeper and finding new aspects to life and reality, the game, in contrast, remains throughout its lifespan quite one dimensional. The \"spirit\"-sphere-thing never grows in size nor depth. It stays throughout the game a dot of life, a nature servant, so to speak. It never evolves into anything greater, with more depth, more understanding, more scope of vision, more responsibility etc.\n\nHowever.\n\nThe game as it is inspires a lot of idealization about how a deeper spiritual game would look like. This 2D platform would quite naturally evolve into a more complex one, and eventually into a 3D one, which in turn would evolve into multidimensional game spanning galaxies and responsibilities involving civilizations and different forms of life across the multitude of the Oneness of All That Is.\n\nAlso, it evokes an idea of a truly different approach to the game mechanic itself. Usually the player is rewarded the more they achieve, but imagine a game where not the quantity but the quality matters. The player would truly have to undergo some development of the psyche to advance into further stages of the game. Now that would be something.\n\nBut all in all, I salute the maker of this game for attempting to differentiate itself from the majority of the gaming industry today, and for focusing on the spiritual aspect of nature and of life. In that regard it is truly the first of it's kind (to my knowledge at least) and deserving of more attention.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057251481", "last_played": 1490292093, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 66, "playtime_forever": 311}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1490382602, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515430", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1490382602, "recommendationid": "30710650", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This seems like a nice relaxing game and I think it can be but for now I want to play something and it looked like you could do things based on the store page.

Maybe a faster version with a tutorial would help me understand more but until then I'm going to have to suggest not buying it. (Check out the discussion section of the community page for a guide on how to play this game. It kinda helps but not really.) I like the concept of casual games that you can relax with and enjoy but there is no instruction in this game to let you know how to do things or what you're supposed to do.
