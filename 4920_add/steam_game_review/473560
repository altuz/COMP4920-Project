Not bad for a dollard but it is a little bit underpar of an experience and probably does not belong on steam but rather on a flash games site.\n\nTactical defense is a sidescroll shootemup against massive waves of tiny ships as well as larger capital ships, then to as backup fire you can mount additional turrets and get some HP upgrades for the ship. Sound clips loop too much especially at the shop, the visuals are alright, as far as I could tell there are 7 levels, but I had to fully grind the ship to beat level 6. After level 5 or so you are no longer given new turret upgrades and the game becomes punishingly hard, and because everything is maxed out you can no longer really progress at all. Maybe I am just not good at the game but I was using all tlhe power ups, also there seems to be quite a few unused slots on the ship that look like they should have upgrades on. That gives the impression that the whole thing is slightly unfinished, as if it was lacking another level of upgrades and customizability.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "last_played": 1493089976, "num_reviews": 1973, "num_games_owned": 4956, "playtime_forever": 353}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1493090270, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490268", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1493090270, "recommendationid": "31350092", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
