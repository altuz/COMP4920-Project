The breaking point was i wasted :30 minutes running around the world map, rebooted my save twice only to find out(youtube video) a tutorial mission was not executing(never worked for me). Basically, i think i needed to restart the game to try and fix. There are a few other issues:\n\n1. The game looks nothing like the videos and or previews. Texture work is really muddy which takes away what is a really an attractive pallette.\n2. The game ran like a potato, mud on my laptop which runs almost everything(1080P med/high) graphic settings are limited and it ran fine on my PC except .....\n3. No Ultra wide support\n\nI was excited to play Shock tactics, these are my type of games, but your game has to be functional in order to enjoy. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 103, "steamid": "76561197970950758", "last_played": 1506632617, "num_reviews": 45, "num_games_owned": 572, "playtime_forever": 103}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506634882, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500826", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506634882, "recommendationid": "35273666", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
