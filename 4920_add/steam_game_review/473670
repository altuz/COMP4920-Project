As there were some legal issues because of this the game was taken down. Later on it was published once more on Steam under the title Reborn. Now, the problem with this is that the only way for them to have it up was to change the gameplay and eliminate the similarities as much as possible.\n\nInstead of being bound to a desk having the ability to check the cameras showing each room in this factory we are free to walk wherever we please. This, however, kills the gameplay since the monitors are in the office and they indicate how close the dolls are - to the office. So, your best bet is to go back there and close the 2 doors whenever you feel it necessary. The 2 doors, by the way, along with the quickly draining power bar are still items very similar to FNaF.\n\nI played an hour or so with this game and was not able to figure out when the dolls are coming. It is also pretty annoying that they teleport into the office - even the store page mentions this ability of theirs. Then what's the point? Towards the end of the 1st shift (night) I had a couple of mins left and decided to close the doors but the doll immediately jumped onto me. For me it is unclear if the doors serve as real protection when closed.\n\nWhen roaming our flashlight barely helps. The corridors are barely lit and even the torch drains our power. I met a couple of dolls along the way but they were completely harmless. With the exception of going through them, that is. It is nice to see them looking into the camera from above but once you are outside you cannot find them positioned this way. It appears the game separates the roaming part from the office area in terms of gameplay.\n\nSince I was not able to figure out how to complete my first shift (after the training) I did not find any sense in playing the so-called insane mode which, of course, makes everything more difficult. What is pretty annoying is that the store page still has the trailer for the original Dolls - feel free to check any videos on YouTube showing gameplay for the original (which seems pretty cool).\n\nFor me Dolls Reborn is a failed attempt to cash in on something similar. If you want to borrow an idea make some changes to make sure the developer of the original idea cannot have any claims against you. But don't make changes that completely remove the atmosphere and provide an annoying gameplay just so you can keep your game afresh. Elaborating on the rest of the issues with this title I'll simply skip (e.g. Unity assets, bad graphics, lots of typos in the store page synopsis) as I have already done so during many reviews pertaining to similar \"quality\" software.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197986360343", "last_played": 1493464824, "num_reviews": 335, "num_games_owned": 630, "playtime_forever": 85}, "votes_up": 17, "timestamp_created": 1493465705, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530523", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1493465889, "recommendationid": "31437835", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
