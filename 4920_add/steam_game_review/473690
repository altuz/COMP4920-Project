I say now, but i'll say this: \n\nCombat: 9.5/10 Great and the real meat of the game. The chess matches you can have if you actually learn to play the game and build your style accordingly are great. Extremely fun, and rewarding when you win. Creating a school is a very exciting prospect to be sure. The game absolutely excels with regard to combat.\n\nBalance: 8/10 Game is decently balanced in the sense that everyone can get the same moves and everything has a counter. The only downsides are that some styles are easier to use/have greater advantages while many moves have bonus effects which make many of the other moves completely miss them. This can be countered but can also be exploited. Nothing too bad (in my experience) though.\n\nAnd here's where the problems start to lie.\n\nConenctivity: 6/10 A few issues besides some lag here and there. I know I'm one of the lucky ones though. De-Syncing leading to death however, has happened frequently.\n\nGame Stability: 3/10 Buggy. Very very buggy. I've ran into areas only to die instantly, which was funny the first 2 times it's happened. I've been trying on gear and have the game literally freeze and have to reset my computer. I've been editing my style and i've found my game locking up because I went to back out and reset my current style because I removed moves from slots.\n\nIf I have to restart my computer because your game freezes and it does it more than once, that doesn't sit well with me.\n\nGear Drops: 2/10 RNG is severly flawed in this game, as you can get starter gear from very significant loot drops which is a brainless design decision if I ever saw one (and they say that may not change). While gear isn't super important, this is worth pointing out.\n\nStory: 2/10 While there isn't much at all, there is some there so regardless of people saying \"LOL it's a PvP game\" the story is there and you must explore and open up areas so it is a valid aspect of the game to judge.\n\nImmersion/Environment: 7/10 I'm referring to the game sucking you in, not so much getting sucked into the lore. The environment has an enjoyable artstyle and is well-done if a bit simplistic, but that is a strength in this case. Fighting will absorb all of your attention.\n\nAmount of PvE Content: 2/10 This may or may not matter to you and that's fine, but buyer beware: It is very short and very limited. Locking story progression behind PvP is honestly one of the most counter-productive decisions i've ever seen in a game.\n\nOverall: I'd say it's the best 4.5/10 i've ever played (no I didn't average my scores, I just gave it one I felt it deserved, the avg is 4.8125 if you're wondering), because everything outside of combat and the landscape feels lazily done by people who are great at making combat fun, but terrible at overall design and progression choices. I feel they completely ignored player fatigue because it is largely a PvP game. Problem is that it is a PvP centric game with a mandatory PvE component to experience PvP to the fullest and vice-versa \n\n The fact that they baked in some of these horrendous and easy to avoid design choices (mainly PvP to progress story and gear RNG, poor planning for server load as if they expected to fail) is pretty dissapointing.\n\nVerdict: Get it on sale or at least wait till more patches go out, if there's even a playerbase for you to PvP to progress the story/create a school by then.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198023827267", "last_played": 1505199567, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 197, "playtime_forever": 786}, "votes_up": 61, "timestamp_created": 1505329052, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555160", "votes_down": 26, "timestamp_updated": 1505530731, "recommendationid": "34925309", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So I put around 35 hours into this game. I do like it. I actually like it inspite of itself, yet fucking hate playing it. Not because its bad, but because of a ton of minor issues that just add up to an overwelmingly disappointing experinece that just is upsetting and doesnt respect your time. It is a short game around 5 hours with a ton of grinding if you want to unlock other movesets or stances. Even just getting armor is a slog. I want to recommend this game, I actually like it and think it is good, but there are so many issues that I have been experincing regarding the basic ideas of player feedback, or the ability for a player to understand what exactly is happening during a fight and why things work and dont work. I am a fan of the Souls series and competitive fighting games. However I have had an easier time learning the Souls series without guides (which is the regular way I like to play them since demon souls) and fighting game systems than learning the simple systems in this game. The lack of information given and I dont even mean stat information but just the fact it is extremely difficult to understand what exactly you are doing wrong during fights and why certain builds or types of play just dont work, makes this game tedious. \n\t\n\tYou start out with the choices of Three stances or styles each different with different strengths. Windfall is the fast stance with a focus on dex, and you get a dodge that allows you say jump over low moves or duck highs. This can (though its extremely hard to notice) cause an opponent to slow down like a minor debuff or a buffer for a move. Next is Forsaken which is a middle of the road style with a focus on both dex and strength and vitality. Slight advantage to strength. You get a parry which will stun the opponent for what feels like at most 1 second, but more like .5 of a second. Then there is Kahlt or fucking whatever, which absorbs hits. You take the damage but you can start a move after you are hit while they are finishing their attack animation. Doing this right you can punish attacks. You technically can punish with all of these stances, but without something as simple as the FUCKING FRAME DATA for moves it gets EXTREMELY Tedious regardless of the information they provide.  (Also there is a forth class you can unlock later which is mostly if not entirely based on mobility stat.) First let me address the stats, There is strength, dex, vitality, endurance and Willpower. Vitality of course being health endurance is your stamina and willpower is basically magic regen. (yes there are spells like healing or a knockback but none do any damage) So in this game you build your own combo chains called a combo deck. Each move having stats such as power, speed and range. ON TOP OF THAT, they are stance specific but DONT REQUIRE that stance to be used. Second they have a system where each has a grade scale for stats, that go from D-S ranking based on stats such as Strength, Dex, And Mobility. Mobilty is the last stat which is determind by weight of your gear. SO Normally in a game like DS if you put stats into endurance you can wear heavier armor, doesnt work like that here. Regardless of your stamina you mobility is uneffected and ONLY is effected by the weight of your armor. WHICH IS SOME CASES SEEMS POINTLESS BECAUSE OF THIS. Before anyone says, well this isnt dark souls, I understand that, but its systems are obviously heavily inspired by those systems. Even the layout of the stat menu is very similiar to that of souls. So you have these 3 stats; strength, dex, and mobility that affect the damage of the move. BUT mobility affects the SPEED that the move will come out at. But hold on you say, isnt there a stat on the move that determines its base speed? WHY YES THERE IS! However because of the mobility stat it is nearly useless in practice. What should be a fast move can easily just become slow like the heavier hitting move making them useless for anyone with armor. The max your mobility can be is 30 with no armor, and as you add armor you lose mobilty. 24-30 is fast, 18-23 is normal and 0-17 is slow. However Its not a flat stat, 24, is slower than 27. How much slower? WHO THE FUCK KNOWS. None of that is presented in the game. Also NO WHERE does it state that mobility on deck moves will affect its base speed in anyway. IN FACT that stats is presented in a way that it should only affect damage, BUT IT DOESNT. It also affects the speed of the animation of the move. This brings me to the problem of Frame Data, EVEN IF there was frame data on these moves; It would come back to what gear you are wearing, and what style or stance you are using. SO if a move is say +3 on block (like the base ryu jab in street fighter) at 30 mobilty in the windfall stance it could be completely different in the forsaken or kelpt stances. It could easilly go from a safe move to COMPLETELY unsafe just by the armor and stance you are in. The fastest jab in the game could become as unsafe as some of the slow wind up heavy hitting moves or in some cases EVEN more unsafe because it doesnt have any special traits. You see some moves have traits in them that allow you to say dodge a high attack becoming a counter. Some of which allow you take a single hit and punch through an opponents attacks. SO if a jab is as unsafe as the move that say lets you take a hit but still be able to hit the opposing player, regaining the upper hand and doing large amounts of damage; Why would you EVER use the fast jab? It becomes a game where you have to go as light as you can with the fastest moves you can OR go as heavy as you can with the heaviest hitting moves you can most of which have moddifiers such as the absorbing hit, or dodging through or under attacks. There isnt any safe way to play down the middle. IN fact it is detremental to do so. ( of course you need certain moves as buffer moves like the stagger moves, that allow for quick double hits that can hit people side stepping, as well as double hit through absorbs. There are some staple moves but regardless of that, it is stick to heavy or light based on your mobility stat.) Now that brings me to the issue of the actual stats in the game and leveling. The soft cap in this game is not soft whatsoever. There is a fantastic guide on this called [b]\"Stat caps and why there's only one efficient build\"[/b] that did the math on this. I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO READ THIS if you are interested in this game or CURRENTLY playing. ESPECIALLY since you cannot respec at this time. Basically 18 st, 18 dex, 16 vit 16 end, 16 will is what you should be at with slight variations based on the stance/style you use. Which the guide goes into. Extremely helpful but also demonstrates the utter useless nature of even having stats in this game at all. Just to use the soul series as an example in that game, yes there is a soft cap but it is nowhere as strict, and there is a reward for ignoring the softcap to build towards certain items. For example, dumping 40 points into strength regardless of the soft cap in ds rewards you by allowing you to use massive weapons at the expense of other stats. No such reward exists at this time for this game. In fact it hurts you to do so in this game leading to what I said before, a single effective build at this time for stats. \n\nIF you are interested in this game DO YOUR RESEARCH. If you are cool with the fact the severs dont work except from 10pm to 10am. (This isnt a joke) That it will not respect your time, that it is tedious and has barely any pve content. That it probably should have been an early access game. (most of the PVP content isnt even in the game. They dont even have an anti cheat) Than I wish you the best of luck. Like I said I wanted to like this game, and I do like it, however all its problems just left me frustrated and made me feel I wasted 35 hours.

The sights, the sounds, the mechanics, all of them reach towards something great. It is impressive, and I find it easy to recognize how hard Absolver tried to make a name for itself. I also find is easy to recognize that Absolver may have tripped over itself in excitement in some areas, and would like to explore how and why. I would like to mention now that I will be covering spoilery material, and if you're not up for that, then be advised that's where I'm headed. If we're all good with that, let's continue.\n\nAbsolver is self-described as an online multiplayer combat game. Sloclap, the developers, do themselves a disservice by describing their game this way. It is absolutely those things, but it is better described as a brilliant 3rd person fighting game wearing the skin of a 3rd person adventure game like a cheap, old coat worn by someone for a very long time before it was ripped off their cold, dead corpse. Granted, that's not as easy to market, but that's what it is.\n\nAbsolver's story takes place in a land called Adal. A long time ago, disaster struck; this disaster, called the Downfall (not very original, but functional regardless), destroyed the old Adal empire, leaving many dead and few still living. The few left living created a new ruling caste, the Guides, who live on top of a mountain. Like most old martial arts super guru hermits, they are hard to get to. The player is one of the few who have managed this journey, and taken on the role of Prospect. The Guides send Prospects back to Adal wearing a mask which removes the need to eat or sleep, and prevents the wearer from dying. As one of these Prospects, the player is chosen to go back to Adal, and prove their worth by killing a dozen \"marked ones,\" earning experience and leveling up along the way in a traditional action-adventure style. Accomplishing this will grant them the rank of Absolver, the Absolvers being an elite group of martial artists who serve the Guides in some way. \n\nThe appeal of the world isn't to do with story, though. Not really. It's not a very big game based on content alone, but that doesn't stop the game from standing out. There are two big factors in Absolver's appeal that gives it a lasting and ambitious impression; first, there's the combat system, and second, the in-and-out multiplayer aspect of the world. \n\nAbsolver has a 2 button attack system. Just 2. It's a simple system where one button uses a chain of attacks, and the other uses an alternate attack. It's elegant and easy to use. Despite having only 2 buttons for offense, the system itself is startlingly deep when you add the additional systems involved.\n\nThe attacks themselves are determined by something called a \"combat deck,\" which is effectively a completely customizable movelist. Once a character has enough experience, each stance in a combat deck can accommodate up to three chained attacks that go in sequence from left to right, as well as one alternate attack. Since there are four stances, a combat deck can consist of up to 12 chained attacks and 4 alternate attacks, for a potential total of 16 attacks in a deck. Each attack has to start in a certain stance, and ends in a different one, which allows players to chain more than just one stance's worth of attacks in a row. Consequently, a combat deck can be built to player preference, either to flow around the entire deck for a continuous barrage or have several smaller combos, whichever the player prefers. There are so many different ways to build a combat deck that it's either very daunting or very exciting to tinker with the huge number of options available, and I haven't yet mentioned that every individual move in the game also has their own unique animations, power, speed, range, and can have other special attributes such as guardbreaking, super armour, or whether it can avoid certain moves during the attack, to name a few. The amount of variation possible between different combat decks is dizzying.\n\n Thankfully, it doesn't have to be complex; players can simply choose to have less moves in their combat deck. There's less potential for interesting synergies and movesets, but it's still entirely effective and much easier to work with.\n\nPlayers have 3 defensive options available to them at any time: blocking, dodging, and style defenses. Blocking is simple enough; the player blocks so long as they hold the button down. Blocking an attack costs stamina, with weaker attacks using less stamina to block than bigger ones. Dodging is a quick movement in a direction of the player's choice. Dodging is quick and costs a small amount of stamina to use, but is has no invincibility frames. This means it\u2019s a purely positional defense; if the player makes a mistake, it's usually punished by the attack they meant to dodge in the first place. Style defenses come in several varieties, unique to the style being used, though they all have the same philosophical idea: high risk, high reward. Used correctly, they can turn the tide of a fight.\n\n\nWhile out in the world, every section of the world works like a small instance with a revolving door of people that leave and enter, with a maximum of 3 people being in any one area at a time. Unlike an MMO where seeing another player is a dime-a-dozen moment, Absolver's player interactions are unique opportunities for emergent gameplay. It's a genuine feeling of the unknown; players can attack you at any time, whether in co-op mode or not. Coupled with a seemingly deliberately minimal emote system, which is the only non-violent means of communication, Absolver's playerbase must make their actions speak for them.\n\n I was standing in the Oratian Quarter on top of one of the buildings, admiring the view. It's truly still a spectacular world, and I was appreciating that I could see the coloseum and the harbour, the neighbouring areas, by using a high vantage point, an actual navigation technique. And then, a random player just attacked me from behind, almost pushing me off the edge of the building. Swinging around with a dodge, I immediately broke into several kicks and then backed off. A bright flash of light later, I stood with my sword in hand, and waited to see his response. Several moments passed. Eventually, his stance relaxed, and I dropped my focus and folded my sword away. I gave him a thumbs up, the \"yeah\" emote. The other player hung his head, slumped his shoulders (the \"sad\" emote), and without warning ran off the edge of the building, killing himself. He ran by a few moments later after respawning without so much as a wave, and continued on his way. I hadn't laughed so hard in days.\n\nAbsolver also features, at the time of this writing, a 1 on 1, best of 5 PvP mode that works like online matchmaking. It works well, when connections allow, and is a lot of fun most of the time. It can be overwhelming to new players though, so players who give themselves room to fail and learn. The benefits of competing in the combat trials include rare gear, and opportunities to battle certain bosses again.\n\nSloclap are still currently developing Absolver for several months into the future, which is reassuring. I just find myself wishing that the developers had made a thoughtful game to be supported by the robust combat system, rather than a combat system showcased by some game. Although this may come across as fortune cookie nonsense, it's clear to me that Absolver is a strong and capable game that lacks focus and balance in all of its many aspects.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 353, "steamid": "76561198025306288", "last_played": 1506917305, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 286, "playtime_forever": 3121}, "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_created": 1504825604, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522759", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1504825604, "recommendationid": "34804252", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[b][u] TL;DR:[/u] Great concept, poor execution. Wait for more content or a sale before buying, it's fun for a day or two in its current state.[/b]\n\nOverall I'd recommend Absolver, but in its current state expect it to feel like Early Access. \n\n- The reason for that is the lack of content, mainly for PVE. On average it shouldn't take you longer than 2 sittings to finish the main story. On top of that most encounters are poorly balanced. Playing the game by yourself you'll have trouble with certain bosses and normal mobs. Team up with someone and the same opponents will be a piece of cake.\n\n- Once you're done with the \"story\" all that is left to do is grinding for gear and new moves, may it be in PVE or PVP. Latter being unbalanced currently, probably due to the lack of players.\n\n+ That being said the game is still worth looking into for multiple reasons. Firstly: The high diversity in fighting-styles and gear. Every player decides for themselves how to skill their character and how to customize their move-list, meaning PVP has the potential of being challenging in new ways every time you face a different opponent. The same goes for equipment , especially masks. Most can only be obtained as random drops in PVP. This might sound too grindy, but the gear is mostly cosmetic, so all it does is increase the individuality of players.\n\n+ Secondly: The fighting mechanics Absolver offers are fluid and easy to learn, but hard to master, especially if the class you chose doesn't fit your fighting style very well. Overall it is very satisfying to win fights with your own developed style.\n\n+ Finally: The immersion. First time I played, 6 hours had passed before I looked at the clock. There's a lot to discover and to learn in this game, which makes you wish for more than it currently offers.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198012173134", "last_played": 1505574608, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 499, "playtime_forever": 804}, "votes_up": 23, "timestamp_created": 1505913566, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519757", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1505913721, "recommendationid": "35083752", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "While I love the aesthetics and gameplay of this game myself, you should be aware that some parts of this game just need a large player base to work properly. Exploring the world and unlocking new moves is great, but when you need the help of other players to beat a boss, with no other players around, it just becomes frustrating.\n\nNext to that, there's the 1v1 matches, which first were inaccessable due to server issues. Luckily, this has been fixed (in the EU region, at least) but now that I finally got on them, there's just a handful of players on it. Because of this, matchmaking just doesn't work well and new players will get matched up with level 40 players, making this a rather irritating experience.\n\nMost of these issues can be resolved by either getting a larger player base, or getting better at the game, so if you happen to be a star at fighters like this one, knock yourself out (har har).

The idea sounds good on paper - a build-your-own fighter game with beautiful graphics and deep controls. However, the fact that games develop a \"meta\" leaves absolver in a very funny place. Either create your fighter in a cheap and well-defined manner, or lose fight after fight because the developers are unable to balance the mass array of moves put in to the game (who can blame them). What your left with is the same top players spamming the same top moves and using the same defensive style to gain wins while any other player using a non-cookie cutter build is punished heavily. Currently the game encourages a hugely spammy, deeply unstrategic, and cheap style.  \n\nFurthermore, this game is content bare. The gameplay is great and deeply satisfying, but aside from 3 bosses, 7 or so minibosses, and an uninteresting but beautiful \"open world\", there really is a lack of meaningful enemy types, environments, and interaction. The game world feels about as disconnected from the player as I've seen from a game in a fully released state. You can fight people, you can loot 2 different objects in the world and you can interact with a dark souls like bonfire to check stats, equipment, and access pvp. The open world is really not an open world at all, but a diorama you fight in. Nothing works. There are no doors. There are no switches. There is nothing to do but fight. Why does this world exist at all? Because Absolver would be even shallower without it. \n\nIn the end the game has a variety of problems that will only be solved with serious post release support, not to mention serious server instability and lag in matchmaking. The foundation is solid, but I'm unsure if the game can work at all while still making complete use of the fighting system's complexity. As is, I fear the \"meta\" will be the death of a game like Absolver which offers more illusion of choice than choice itself.

I warn you... it is a very simple game with tiny maps even when fully operational though this is not a bad thing as there is precious little guiding you in your wanderings and no cartography skill (aka your character does not carry a map though there are a few in cryptic in game maps on large stone slabs). \n\nWhat stands out is the incredibly detailed and highly customizable marital combat forms (though again there is virtually no guidance on how to construct a form,... much less an effective form,... much less when and how to start to build your own school). It is not that there are not poorly detailed and vague references, but no honest-to-goodness explanations.  In any case, it would be very enjoyable though I do think the current price point is too high for the content (take $10.00 off each and fine).  Even fully functional, it is early release at best given some game balance issues (see below).  It is much more reasonable -- if their promised content-to-come works out - dungeons, group play, and bigger environment once you complete training.\n\nIt seems like this game, while the highly developed combat system is reasonably flushed out, is really the introduction section - like the pre-game training section or Act 1 of say 3. When it works, it is a great Act 1.\n\nNEGATIVES\n\nMAJOR SERVER ISSUES (ONLINE MODE - MAIN GAME - UNPLAYABLE): \n\nWithing 2-days of my purchase (and not much more from original release date), the game is rendered unworkable because the online mode cannot be played with ongoing server issues. If it were a $10-$20 early release, we know what we are getting... however, for an official release, it is poor - indie or not. If you are not ready for the primary time, then do not 'officially release' game - alpha, beta, and early release under development - and charge $10-$20 (not $30-$40 and say it is officially released).\n\nSpecial Note: Some fools in discussion claim servers in Houston, TX (and post hurricane issues); however, from what I understand the game was released 2-days after the hurricane hit. So, it was a stupid move - had they said - release date delayed due to hurricane - fine. Once you decide to release knowing what you know - you are responsible. Serious game developers need to have alternative servers for major world release and should be able transfer to functional servers fairly quickly.\n\nOTHER ISSUES:  \n\nOne of the most unfortunate issues with server problems outside of the problem by it self is... developers are struggling to solve this problem rather than working on other serious game issues.\n\n1 -  PvP DOES NOT WORK (SERVER PROBLEM):\n\nPvP is the core of the game despite a minor off-line game component which does allow your character to advance on a personal leveling and learn marital arts style by basically standing there and absorbing punches and kicks for a while before defeating opponent (which you must do to retain memory of what you learned in that combat if you lose memories are lost). Unfortunately, unless you are online, you cannot advance your character through trial by combat which is the major aspect of this PvP Game.\n\n2 - CONTENT (VERY LIMITED & LITTLE GUIDANCE):\n\nAt the present moment, Absolver has one main temple hub region and two small map areas with three small regions per map (about the size of a a single large dungeon in a top notch dungeon crawler in total for the entire game).  In addition, Absolver has several arenas in which 1:1 PvP take place. Although the maps are wind about and present a bit of a challenge to learn they are not extensive and you end up running through the same maps and areas many, many times to level and rank your player - so replayability with second character is even more boring. It has just about zero back drop or storyline with only vague references hinting at a storyline that could be developed.\n\nIt is precisely this aspects (aside from major server issues on release) that has me place this game into what should have been an EARLY RELEASE GAME.  It is no where near a full release game - period.  It is true that the game developers promise 3:3 PvP and dungeons as one would assume a more developed storyline, etc., but absent these it is not 'finished.'  As I note later, I would suggest that the content is on the level of the 'pre-game' where you build-up a character and learn mechanics or Act 1 in a 3 Act Game.\n\n3 - COMBAT GAME BALANCE\n\nAt the present moment, the 'fast class players' have an extreme advantage for several reasons (a) game mechanics have overpowered this class (assuming no other problems, but there are other problems...), (b) game mechanics do not internally compensate for timing differences with connection speed which is essential for a game that is pretty much PvP (again serious games factor it in...), and (c) with ongoing server issues... when you do connect... lagging, dropped games, and poor and shaky connections only amplify this problem. Servers aside this is a fairly major issue.\n\n4 - HACKED PLAYERS\n\n\"Fast Class Players\" are a game mechanics issue aside from 'hacked players.' I have encountered a few players - named and 'unnamed' attempting to blend in with enemies who were impossible to defeat and I do not mean in terms of an overpowered class.   I should be clear the enemies would they were hiding among where easily damaged so it was not a server or software glitch - only the ONE character was virtually invulnerable.  How do you know? I was max leveled and fought them along side two other players one of whom was also max level and the 'hacked' player took no damage most of the battle and in the end had only a finger nail width of damage on full hit point bar - this is just not possible.    HACKED PLAYERS = SECURITY ISSUES.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nI understand indie game developers. I love \"The Long Dark,\" \"Pillars of Eternity,\" and \"Subnautica\" and cherish these games - TLD & Sub are both long standing early release development games and Pillars was a major game companies 'crowd funded pet project.' I have also enjoyed \"Examina\" which as been painfully difficult to play (very challenging and unforgiving) and slow as an early release. So, I do know and have patience for such games....\n\nWith that said, I have to say that these games were all early release when I bought them and priced extremely fair for early release and given the massive amount of content available at them time of release ($20 or less). Moreover, these games were almost always extremely stable and fully playable (servers) and glitches with video cards - identified, owned, and fixed within days.\n\nIn truth, Absolver IS NOT READY - even as an indie game by a small company - for FULL RELEASE and, given limited content (even when servers worked), OVER PRICED (i.e., should be $9.99 to $19.99 and Early Release). Game developers need: (a) Content, (b) Game Mechanics Balance (PvP Factor In Connection Speed), (c) Game Mechanics Balance (Internal - Fast Class & Stagger School - Way To Powerful), and (d) Server Problems.\n\nGame developers should have done early release and waited and done more crowd funding to pay bills in interim. During this time, they would have been able to get feedback about PvP (Server Side Speed Balance) and on overpowered classes and other factors. I forgive a lot for fairly priced early release under development games. I DO NOT FOR FULL RELEASE & FULL PRICED GAMES.\n\nIf you are going to 'full release' and charge $30 (29.99) to $40 (39.99), I do not care if you are 'indie' you want to swim in the big leagues and play with the big boys in terms of price and full release - SO GAME FAILS!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198131237001", "last_played": 1505451786, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_forever": 2671}, "votes_up": 26, "timestamp_created": 1504615668, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515484", "votes_down": 16, "timestamp_updated": 1504792315, "recommendationid": "34755738", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "17 hours in, game freezes save corrupted.
