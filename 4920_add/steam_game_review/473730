There are only 10 playable levels, the 11th one won't even allow you to make any moves, rendering it completely unplayable.  Once you unlock level 11 by beating level 10, you can't even select it from the menu to play it that way.  It feels as if the developer got bored or ran out of ideas and just decided to put what he had up on Steam to see what he could get for it.\n\nMost levels are solveable in under a minute, giving you very little play time.  You will probably complete the game (as far as it can be completed) before the first card drops.  The physics on each level play out exactly same way every time, so once you figure out the correct box to click (and [i]when[/i] to click it on some levels), there simply isn't a reason to ever play them again.\n\nExiting the game leaves some process running in your system, doing god-knows-what in there.  You can't kill it.  You have to log off Windows or restart your computer to be rid of it.  Worst job of coding I've ever seen.\n\nA short, cheap-feeling, lackluster effort that feels more like a shell of what the game was supposed to be.
