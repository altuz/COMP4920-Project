There are physics and difficulty options for the newbie or expert alike. The default physics are spot-on just like old Wipeout games and the controls are very responsive even when I use a keyboard. There is also a 2280 mode with physics that more resemble the newer Wipeout titles. The mod support along with built-in editors is icing on the cake. I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes either retro graphics or any type of racing games.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 332, "steamid": "76561198157307249", "last_played": 1506972889, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 332}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506390210, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506465130, "recommendationid": "35213920", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
