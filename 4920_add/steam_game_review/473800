I haven't played but a few times and it causes eye strain on me.  But I'm kind of old.  So the whole first level is just \"meh\" and THEN the first boss comes up.  This is really interesting.   I get stomped but it's fun dodging all the shots in 3d.   Very nice boss battles.   Maybe it'll pick up later, but the control scheme is what is hurting this.   Add customizable keys or mouse control.   Much better me thinks.   I haven't fully enjoyed this game but for a couple bucks and the boss battle I experienced... thumbs up man.

Except this game doesn't have a clear story, though it didn't bother me. Basically, you're controlling this girl that looks kinda like Strike Witches, shooting orbs and stuff, and you will have a fight with different bosses.\nFor gameplay, I'd say it's really nice, control is smooth enough to dodge the shots and take down enemies, all these combat is quite intense, as the bullets come towards you at a relatively fast speed, or tight barrage that seems to be nearly impossible to dodge.\nAlso you can change the equipment of your character, though it's limited, but it's a bullet hell game after all, the choices are enough for different play style.\nMusic is also nice.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041854292", "last_played": 1491290298, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 159, "playtime_forever": 27}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1491289965, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501779", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1491289965, "recommendationid": "30937393", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I have no idea what I no idea what I am doing, but the cut scenes are cool and a cool retro electronic soundtrack.
