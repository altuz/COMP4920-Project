From parts of the UI still being written in the games native language, to crashes, to maps you cannot complete because the zombies get trapped in the scenery. \n\nAlso no sign of the single player content promised on the store page - this is mp co-op only as far as I can see. Also MMO - when did three players in one instance count as massive? However there is plenty of MMO grind needed to level up your character and earn money to buy weapons and gear.\n\nGameplay itself is a very standard third person shooters with very little in the way of original mechanics. Graphics and animations are ugly and there is no music (despite having a slider for music volume in the options).
