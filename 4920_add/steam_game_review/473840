Unlike other games of this type there are no maps to explore, instead each level will be the same-sized, square, isometric grid (presumably one floor of Diib's Dilemma Tower) which you then have to defeat all the monsters of the current level in order to progress.  You have a limited number of spell types to take into battle, 2 at the start of the game, and you must be able to cast spells to defeat monsters, and then dodge enemies as your spells slowly recharge.\n\nYour character does not have levels or stats that increase as the game progresses, just the spells in his book.  At first there are 4 spells to choose from including attack spells, a trap and a heal spell.  After you have collected some of the 4 elements found defeating monsters, you can start creating newer and more powerful spells.  The real fun and strategy of the game is to experiment with different spell combos, and to discover new spells as you build up your spell book roster.  But be warned, this game has an old-school difficulty to it, traps you lay will be invisible once you have set them, and if you are the first to walk through the square then you will spring the trap and take the damage.  Also, many monsters require several hits to defeat and there are no shown lifebars, plus the mosnsters move all over, so it gets hard to keep track of which ones you have weakened and which you have not.  But all of that is designed to keep the strategy of the game interesting as there is not much variety to each level other than monsters types and the spells you choose.\n\nThis is an old-school game and it's graphics and audio lack the polish that simple games of today have.  The game doesn't even utilize the mouse, this is a keyboard game only which uses the arrow keys and the number keys in order to play.  And there are almost no options other than turning sound and/or music on and off.  However, given the fact that this game was made in the 90's and the game's low price point, I'm willing to overlook those points.  The overall movement of both your character and the monsters has a slight delay to it, making dodging and moving through the enemies a bit of a prediction game but I feel the quirky movement actually adds to the strategy and difficulty of the game in an interesting way.\n\nAnother point to mention is that this is a survival game more than a story driven RPG.  You are expected to die, and you will die and you accumulate a score as you play so that when you die you will have a top score chart to keep track of your best playthroughs.  This is not a global leaderboard but a personal top score chart.  And while you can save your progress, there is something to keep in mind:  The save files only keep track of your current tower level, the elements you have earned, and the spells you have purchased.   If you exit the game or die your score will be set to zero when you load up your save file and your currently selected spells will be reset to the basic fire spell, so keep that in mind when choosing to exit the game if you have worked up a nice score.\n\nAll in all, the age of the game shows in its graphics, sound, and play quality, but it has a unique strategy and style to it, which makes it an interesting game to play, even today.  It's super cheap and a little different than most games out there, so I recommend trying this game out if you don't mind playing older games and want a challenging game to play.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198122163777", "last_played": 1464454216, "num_reviews": 46, "num_games_owned": 1530, "playtime_forever": 610}, "votes_up": 28, "timestamp_created": 1464395423, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538828", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1464395423, "recommendationid": "23243658", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ah this game brings back memories.  I wasted too much time long ago trying to beat this one.\n\nMinutes to learn, lifetime to master, this game shows its age but the core game is still solid and fun.  A warning to everyone right up front, this game can only be played with a keyboard.  Clicking on menu options or spells does nothing.\n\nThe sound and music and art also do not appear to have been upgraded at all since the original version was available.  I don't mind the retro feel, but know before you buy this one that it really was released 20 years ago.\n\nThe game is a devilishly deep puzzle game about strategy and resource management.  Take in a limited number of spells and figure out a way to survive to.... well to as far as you can make it, I've never beaten it in all the years.  There are a huge number of strategies to employ.  You simply put a spell in a slot, and then after you cast it you have to wait for it to reload.  Spells can be direct damage, summoning, traps, healing, score boosting, aoe, teleportation and on and on.  You command so much power, but when you are dead, you are done.  It is back to your last save or level 1.\n\nThe levels play very quickly, allowing you to build up power early to try new strategies in how to beat the levels.  Also, some monsters are immune to certain spells, but the game does not warn you of this, so some levels are a bit of trial and error.  This does make it so there is no one \"super build\" of spells that will let you get through every level of the game.  Or not that I have ever found.\n\nMake no mistake though, this game is hard.  A kind of hard that doesn't exist in modern games.  You were warned.  If someone tells you they beat this, screenshot or it didn't happen.\n\nPros:\n- Clever design\n- Lots of spells\n- Freedom to find your own strategy\n- Lots of weird secrets and bonuses\n\nCons:\n- Clunky, keyboard only controls\n- Old art \n- Old sound\n- Hard as nails\n\nThere is still an addicting game in there though.\n\n7/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198218094865", "last_played": 1464397657, "num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 53, "playtime_forever": 231}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1464397645, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506721", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1464397645, "recommendationid": "23244076", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is such a mixed bag, largely due to its age (which you can immediately tell when the game loads and you can see 'Copywrite 1999-2002').\n\nDiib's Dilemma is an arcade style game where you are given a selection of spells to choose from which you take into a chamber to fight foes. More spells can be unlocked (built) by gathering soul stones, which are either dropped by enemies or given in groups of five each time you beat four rounds without taking damage. The battle screen is a grid, and its really up to you how you play. This game is not for the faint of hard, as it is quite hard.\n\nThe gameplay allows you to pick your own strategy, especially as you gather more spells, and rewards a player for performing well. You use the arrow keys to move on the grid and the number keys to fire the spell assigned to them. However, as soon as you begin moving to the next square, you can be hit as though you are on it, and the same rules apply to enemies, making it risky to step up to enemies, especially if you want to get that 0 damage. The game is RNG heavy, as not getting the right soul stones means not getting the right spells and you can fall into what feels like a hopeless situation.\n\nA lot of little quality of life improvements could be made to make the game flow more smotthly, but is it really worth the effort? If the game was completely remade with no grid as a fast paced arcade game, I could see it as an instant classic or even an app to be played on the go, but for now I'll just have to enjoy it as a fun (and frustrating) piece of nostalgia. It's great to see old games like this come back and not be lost forever.
