I knew I was suppose to go through the cave, but I couldn't go without a light, so obviously the next step would involve the lantarn right next to the cave. I have spent a good 30 minutes exploring all the areas for maybe a lighter or something, but it turns out to get in the cave you don't use the lantarn, you instead combine the stick/rag together then use it on a container of tar, OF COURSE THIS IS THE MOST LOGICAL CONCLUSION!!!! Why use the damn lantarn when you can simply combine two items and hopefully come to the conclusion of using it on what appears to be another useless interactable object like ever other object in the game. \n\nSo my thoughts, for a free game there is potential to this, but when you have a game with poor grapics set on LOW and its pushing my computer that has a Nvidia 980/16 GB of RAM/i7 Processer then there is clear optimization issues to your game. Also I know in the start of your game you say it doesn't hold your hand but guess what maybe thats the issue here, having a little guidance once in awhile is better then leaving the player having no idea what to do next.\n\nIf you guys want to play a good free game on steam then try...\n(Cry Of Fear / Blameless / Transmissions: Element 120 / Only If / Dr Langeskov) \n\nAt least with these games your not regreting for wasting an hour of your like this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198221250292", "last_played": 1487024897, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 67}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1487023358, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501645", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1487023358, "recommendationid": "29910006", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The Nadi Project is a nothing more than a scavenger hunt game.
