Managed to beat the 1st hundred levels and grab the top spot on the leaderboard in just about 2 hours. Interesting concept that has been done before on mobile, but this gives a fresh new take to it. Gonna be a long, rough ride getting all the achievements, but as its a pretty casual game, I can just take it one level at a time whenever im comfortable with it.\n\nMy only complain is that the difficulty curve seems to go up and down randomly and comes from nowhere and it makes some levels seem impossible to 3-star; which drives a completionist like me insane. One level was hard enough I couldn't beat, while the next I managed in one click.\n\nI also had a problem with not being able to select a level past 100. I had to go back, repeat level 100 and continue on from there.\n\nOverall though, fun little game to play now and again if you have some extra time to blow off.\n\nEdit: Level 200 doesn't seem to load for me no matter what I do.. I just get the BG design and nothing more.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198070929704", "last_played": 1469778030, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 29, "playtime_forever": 448}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1467349884, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499221", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1467388153, "recommendationid": "23975234", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Oh god, the sounds...
