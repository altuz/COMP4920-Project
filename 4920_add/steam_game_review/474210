If you get the hang of using a controller, the game actually becomes a bit easier due to the built-in auto-lock feature that turns on when you aim at an enemy's general direction. On KB+M, your aiming has to be more precise and it's even harder when most enemies are small on the screen. Both ways are very playable and just becomes a matter of preference on how it should be played.\n\nThe pixel art is very detailed, minus the actual character models. The protagonist and the enemies (save for the one boss in the game) are extremely small on-screen and have very little detail on them compared to the rest of the game's graphics. They're so small and lacking in detail that they can sometimes be hard to spot amidst the chaos and environment.\n\nThe sounds & music in the game are great. The music accentuates the overall theme of fast murdering and the sounds are pretty detailed from the various enemy screams to the weapons that actually sound like they have impact to them.\n\nThere's hardly a plot in the game. According to the Steam Store Page, you're a cyborg sent to purge what's left of humanity. Simple.\n\nConcept of the game's also simple, go from point A to point B to beat the level. There are 24 levels in total; 3 for demo/tutorial, 4 each for 5 areas, and 1 boss level. Most levels have you traversing whole paths while some just have you stay in one large area fighting waves of telegraphically spawned enemies until the game tells you you can proceed. Each level takes around 3-4 minutes on average to finish, but that's if you succeed. There are no checkpoints either, meaning that death results in starting the current level from the beginning. Enemy spawns and traps are always cued in some way but dealing with them still requires some skill.\nThe game's also designed for speedrunning thanks to the hidden movement mechanics like grenade jumping and bunny hopping. Some secret collectibles can only be obtained through these methods anyway.\n\nYou're given a lot of control over your character's movement. You can cancel jumps for a fast drop, bunnyhop, shotgun-boost, and so on. All this at your disposal for a variety of reasons but that's if you know how to even use them properly.\n\nIt's easy to die against anything here. Enemies however, telegraph their attacks with an exclamation mark on their heads that indicate they've spotted you and are about to attack, even the ones that are slightly off-screen. You always have enough time to avoid their incoming fire via strafing or jumping out of the way in case you can't fire at them for whatever reason. If you manage to land a bullet, kick, or chainsaw hit in on a common enemy, they get stunned for a second or two. If you're out of their vision for a while, they go back to \"patrolling\". All that said, there's usually a hefty amount of enemies surrounding you with attacks anyway, making the game as tough as it is with the enemy mechanics being one of the things that balances out the difficulty.\n\nThere are only six weapons throughout the entire game and they're all useful and feel powerful. The chainsaw though is useless for the most part but for anyone who really knows when to make use of it, it can save ammo when needed. Ammo pick-ups aren't too scarce but you can only carry so much of it that you've still got to make as many shots count as possible.\n\nThe game likes to advertise itself on how difficult it is. There are three difficulty settings available from the start, Hard, Harder, and Hardest. The \"easiest\" difficulty mode is \"Hard\" unless you download the free \"EASY MODE\" DLC. If you collect enough of the secret collectibles, you unlock the last difficulty option, Impossible. The change from Hard to Harder is that you have less health. The change from Harder to Hardest is that you can no longer find health and armor. And Hardest to Impossible has you have even less health. Other than those, the rest of the game is the same regardless of the difficulty setting.\nWhile I like the challenge in the game, I don't find that it gets much more fun the higher the difficulty you go. Because of the decrease in health and lack of health/armor, you've got to be more cautious and take the game more slowly. The music and overall tone of the game wants you to run & kill fast but the higher difficulty strongly discourages that. On Impossible difficulty, you're pretty much dead in just a few hits, telling you to take it even slower. The challenge is there but it strays from the pacing.\n\nA basic playthrough for a decent enough player may take 3-5 hours to beat. It's not a long game and the replayability isn't too large either, though it's there for those who just want a challenge. There's a level creation system with some new features that aren't in the base game for some reason. It's not very simple to use and there aren't a whole lot of user created levels on the Workshop right now.\nThe levels are fairly designed, the sounds & music are excellent, the graphics are great minus the character models, and it's as bloody & difficult as advertised.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034306697", "last_played": 1500293282, "num_reviews": 464, "num_games_owned": 1086, "playtime_forever": 1495}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500293106, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500059", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500295922, "recommendationid": "33606475", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Literally Doom in 2D pixels. \n\nEven tho I'm bad at this, but I fucking loved it.

Butcher is very challenging and it is a very hard game. But, it's hard in a way that keeps you coming back for more. You have to think about how you can improve your strategy and react to enemy behavior. The game draws you back in after you take a break to regroup or calm your nerves from an intense session. Conquering a level feels like an accomplishment and pushes you on to continue fighting your way through stages. The lowest difficulty setting for Butcher is hard. I realized after beating it that there is DLC that unlocks a casual difficulty setting. I'd suggest attempting it with everything you have on hard mode. If you reach your wit's end and feel like throwing in the towel, give casual mode a whirl so that you can experience all of the levels and complete the game. Trust me, it's worth it either way.\n\nSimilarities:\nI'm a huge fan of Broforce. Butcher is similar to Broforce with its 2d pixelated graphics. Butcher allows for you to shoot diagnonally, whereas Broforce only lets you shoot directly in front of you. Broforce tends to focus more on comedy. Butcher is more intense and violent.\n\nCheckpoints:\nButcher does not have checkpoints. The game is designed for the player to survive a level in its entirety. At first this might seem off-putting or frustrating. But, part of the joy of the game is learning to manage your ammo and utilizing appropriate weapons for different types of enemies. Completing a level wouldn't be as rewarding if you could just inch your way through it with checkpoints.\n\nControls:\nThe controls in this game are smooth and responsive. This is good, because you must react quickly to enemies and move fast when pinned down. I used a PS4 controller and I recommend using a controller over a mouse/keyboard if you can. At times, your thumbs can get a bit sore from riding the analog sticks while aiming during intense battles. This is usually a sign that you need to take a break from the game and regroup.\n\nMusic:\nBesides the menu music which I wasn't that fond of, I absolutely loved the soundtrack for this game. It's textbook industrial with thumping beats and dark synthesizers. It really sets the mood and none of the stage music grated on me during repeated attempts at finishing levels. For the final boss battle, I tried turning off the music. Not because I didn't like it, but because I was trying to calm my nerves from the intensity of the music. It ended up helping a bit and I was able to calm down enough to focus on my attack strategy.\n\nWeapons:\nThe weapons are awesome in this game. You get a chainsaw, shotgun, assault rifle, flamethrower, grenade launcher, and rail gun. You become intimately familiar with how each weapon works and what kind of damage you can inflict on enemies. When you equip the rail gun, be sure and note that you can hold the fire button to charge the weapon for a more devastating blast. I was not initially aware that you could do this and I was firing it without a charge. This made some stages insanely difficult for me. I managed to make it through them after several tries and a lot of cursing, but it would have been so much easier had I known how to charge it.\n\nLevels:\nEach set of stages has a certain theme. You start off in an industrial complex, invade a military base, explore a jungle outpost, infiltrate a research lab in a volcano, and fight your way through a futuristic city that reminded me of Blade Runner. Most stages are linear and allow for exploration and platforming, but certain sections have arenas where you get locked in and have to fight enemies that appear out of thin air. The arenas are some of the most difficult aspects of the game, but these melees allow for you to hone your skills and dominate the sections that give you a little breathing room.\n\nCharacter Size:\nYour character is tiny. Even smaller than characters in Broforce. I would suggest playing this game on a big screen. I played the game on a projector displaying on an entire wall in my house. If you have a lot of screen real estate, you shouldn't have any trouble keeping tabs on your character and the intricacies of enemy movements. There's a lot going on in this game and you don't want to get lost squinting at pixels from across the room on a small screen. The game is also dark. This adds to the mood, but if you have too much contrast you might have trouble seeing the details of level environments.\n\nSkulls:\nSkulls seem to be hidden in walls and ceilings that seem completely out of reach. I scooped up a handful, but most I completely disregarded. Often times you are just trying to survive let alone worry about collecting extra goodies. I found myself hoarding ammo and health versus taking risks exploring levels for skulls. Maybe on subsequent play-throughs I'll take the time to try and hunt these down. But, for now, I was just relieved to survive the game on hard mode without rage quitting.\n\nTips:\nAs I said before, charge the rail gun. Take breaks from the game when you are overwhelmed. Take some time to think about your strategy and how you can improve. Part of the joy of this game is problem solving and self improvement. Find your rhythm. As you progress, your movements start to become more controlled and deliberate. Familiarize yourself with the capabilities of your weapons and use the best tool for the job. Conserve your ammo. Don't waste your bullets and try to focus on accurately aiming even when things get hectic. When you encounter characters without weapons, don't mow them over with the chainsaw if you have full health. Save them for later if you need a health boost. Take cover. Use the environment to your advantage and protect your character from taking damage out in the open. Don't give up! You can do this!\n\nConclusion:\nI honestly love everything about this game. If you love games like Broforce and are up for a challenge, you will love Butcher. I wish there were more quality run and gun platformers out there. 1st person shooters give me motion sickness, so for me this is the next best thing. It truly feels like a side scrolling Doom game and the sound of all the weapons mixed with the industrial soundtrack is exhilarating. It's damn fun to play and cathartic.
