You start with a boomerang and get another weapon after beating the first boss.\n\n+ Graphics are simple, but decent for the style and price of the game.\n+ Music is good, but a bit repetitive.\n+ Controls are good enough.\n+ The boomerang is fast and fun to use.\n+ It's three bucks.\n\n- The levels are long, including 2 mini-boss (?) fights, with no checkpoints that I can tell until right before the main boss of the level.\n- There are many places where enemies unavoidably hit you, unless you know they are coming, or inch ahead slowly.\n\n~ The one boss I got to was pretty easy.\n~ You only have 3 lives to finish a level. There is 1 extra life on the first level that is always there after dying, so you effectively have infinite lives on level 1, up until the boss. \n~ Escape insta-quits the game.\n\nI only see 5 levels on the map. The first level took me about 15 minutes to learn and beat. I assume the others will take longer.\n\nIf you don't mind dying a lot to learn where things jump out at you. it's reasonably fun for the price.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042628923", "last_played": 1471902100, "num_reviews": 46, "num_games_owned": 932, "playtime_forever": 47}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1471493389, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525629", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1471493486, "recommendationid": "24985932", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I don\u2019t think this game was playtested at all before release.\n\nGiga Girl screams retro nostalgia. It promotes itself as a game inspired by classic Mega Man games. It looked retro, it looked spunky and it had no reviews when I first discovered it. I figured why not? I love Mega Man games, and I missed playing them. After spending a good amount of time trying Giga Girl I am left disappointed. Giga Girl, while inspired by Mega Man, doesn\u2019t have the gameplay to back it up. At first I thought it was retro hard. I laughed it off and kept trying. Then I thought, it may be be one of those really retro games that demanded you memorize level layouts. After discovering enemies are somewhat spawn and act somewhat randomly I ruled that out. Then it set in. Giga Girl is just a bad game.\n\nGiga Girl is just a frustrating and cheap experience wrapped in a nostalgic package.\n\nExpect unavoidable projectiles or enemies jumping in from different angles off screen. Think about this. Enemies do not behave the same during repeat game sessions. Most spawn at the same areas, but how they move and act differs. That means you can\u2019t even prepare for the cheap attacks even if you know they\u2019re coming. The enemies might just jump in a little higher, lower, or faster. It\u2019s maddening. In one area a group of birds spawn randomly near a large enemy who just so happens to spit out projectiles\u2026again randomly.\n\nIt gets even worse because the colliders seem off. Enemies look like they don\u2019t hit you somehow do damage.\n\nWant another bad level design example? How about Giga Girl\u2019s rotating platforms. They rotate randomly. At times, platforming seems almost impossible. But wait it gets even worse! Sometimes they have enemies on top of them. These enemies shoot you off screen, but they rotate in such a way that you cannot kill them. BUT IT GETS EVEN WORSE! Sometimes these platforms overlap. You\u2019ll find yourself rotating into an enemy leading to yet another cheap death.\n\nGiga Girl is a lesson in how NOT to do a retro platformer.\n\nTo see the rest of my review go here: \nhttp://nardio.net/2016/08/29/giga-girl-review/\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198299718188", "last_played": 1472404970, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 278, "playtime_forever": 99}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1472487431, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503194", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1472487431, "recommendationid": "25231396", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[h1] Faithful Mega Man Clone\t[/h1]\n\nGiga Girl is a lot of fun and plays similarly to the original Mega Man series.
