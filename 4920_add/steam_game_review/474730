I think the main problem I had is that there is no accounting of units and resources anywhere. \n\nThere is a metric ton of in-game text, but very little of it is really useful. Lets try to strip that down to what I really need to know - that would be a good start.\n\nNext, I go on the forums and find a stickied thread from the developer with helpful hints. Great! I read over that and find it is both redundant with the in-game information, and anything extra was largely useless.\n\nDoesn't matter. [i]I do understand the basic premise of how the game works - you establish colonies that generate resources.[/i] You pilot an airship to move these resources around, and use them. You fight ground and air units. It seems cool, and the artwork is nice. I just couldn't break through to understand certain critical elements, namely accounting of what my colonies had versus what I had (in general), and what was on the airship. It's not rocket science, just add stats (or show me how to find those stats).\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+I like the artwork, and basic idea of a board-game-esque strategy game\n+I like that you can use only the mouse; it makes for a good coffee break game\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Wayyyy too much text on the screen, and more importantly - very little is functional\n-Price is too high for me to keep this game when refunds exist; the dev needs to spoon feed me a little more information; and its not like there aren't two seperate tutorials (of sorts), but neither of them were adequate or focused enough to get me started\n\n[b]Sorry, the lack of instruction was a fatal flaw here.[/b] Could be a real gem beneath the surface, but I'll never know. Looks like I'm not alone with the lack of reviews and overall community feedback/discussion.\n\nPeace,", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040884867", "last_played": 1469824709, "num_reviews": 618, "num_games_owned": 1196, "playtime_forever": 60}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1469869278, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523002", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1469869415, "recommendationid": "24611053", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is pretty fun so far and has some potential but is kind of frustrating at times.
