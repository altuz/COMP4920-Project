Let's face it, there are loads and loads of games on Steam right now trying to pull on the nostalgia chords. Loads of pay for roms and emu packages of games you know and love, and tons of indie games developed in the likeness of games you know and love, but what those games can't deliver is what Dorke has in mass quantity; an authentically new SNES experience. This isn't a game like a SNES game. This isn't a SNES game you've beaten countless times. This is an authentic SNES title you never got to play. If it was unplayable it'd still be a wortha few bucks to check out, but given it's actually a decent game it's a gem of an experience. I'd say the closest thing to Dorke and Ymp is when you find a game that never came to your nation online and in your language or at least a fan patch.\n\nSo what's the game actually like? It's decent, but nae great. If it did come out during the SNES days it definately wouldn't have excited me as much as it does now. It's slow, and hard, and some things are kind of lost in translation or just all out weird, but it's not horrible. The pair of characters over one PC is pretty neat. It may not be the only game to do something similar, but it is an interesting take and easy to do. You never have to think about which one you're going to use, just what you need to do and the pair takes care of the rest. My favorite thing about the game is the in game animations. There are quite a few animations that remind you not to take the game too seriously despite is being seriously difficult. The cutsenes are long, but I enjoyed them. I'd rather have them than not, though skipping would be nice sometimes. \n\nI'm not sure what Piko did to finish the game. It's clearly another rom+emu package. It's a bit of a hard game and I wasn't so taken with it that I wanted to prove I could beat it without cheats so I took the rom and uploaded it to my Recalbox build to play Dorke and Ymp with fast foward, rewind, shaders, save and load states, etc. I'm not sure why pay-for emulators have less than free ones, but they do and that's the case here. I definately advocate buying the rom to support Piko for bringing it to us, but once you have it play it on your favorite emulator because the one it comes with is bogus.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198091699313", "last_played": 1504386593, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 112, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503278106, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499218", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503278451, "recommendationid": "34385590", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
