The decisions on offer do not have always have obvious outcomes were the theme is exploring an alien ship it is very fitting that you at times have some pure guess work based on loose clues.\nThe big BUT: the action parts of the game if it wasn't for the amount of time and button clicks it takes to just move around would be a non talking point letting the gamebook gameplay shine, but it is so slow and messes so badly with the pacing of the game if you can only pick a few games to fill a small amount of time you get them give this game a wide birth. Plus the storyline is not really simple enough to fit into a pick up and put down style, which for me is a plus but again for people with busier schedule would be a negative.\n\nFull review/gameplay: https://youtu.be/9qmtk0g1KZM", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994868319", "last_played": 1486742956, "num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 96}, "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_created": 1486742091, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518537", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1486742586, "recommendationid": "29826537", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
