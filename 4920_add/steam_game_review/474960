Shooting guns isn't very satisfying (even less so once you find out that there always is one gun that is objectively better than all the others in its category, rendering the apparent arsenal of weapons you can choose from obsolete) and while using the powers in combat is cool, well... it feels like something's missing.\nI mean, sure, they are fairly well balanced, but they didn't feel quite right to me - they didn't make me feel as powerful as they should.\n\nStill, I think you should pick it up when you can - the plot and execution are fantastic, and with any luck, there might be another game like this (with some improvements) out of Remedy someday.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983740606", "last_played": 1499443972, "num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 272, "playtime_forever": 904}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505513919, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507095", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505513919, "recommendationid": "34982484", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Mixed feelings about that game.\n\nCinematic, Gfx, Voice acting are excellent. Really immersive atmosphere.\n\nI'm not a Sci-Fi fan, therefore story didn't drag me as much as I expected - but anyway it was good enough to keep me interested. Characters traits are not developed - that's a shame. \n\nAbout choices matters - well, don't expect anything close to telltales or similar. \n\nThe gameplay/combat was pretty simple, but well executed. Even if fights gets repetitive, it's always a nice feeling to smash and crash everyone with your superpowers. The game is more cinematic-action-on-a-rail-with-platform-elements.\n\nPeople looking for Open-World features will be disappointed - but for me it was good, since the focus was on the story.\n\nMy only complain is about the final boss - very hard to beat, after the whole game is really an easy walk and the focus on the story, not the difficulty.\n\nFor the quality of gfx/voice acting/atmosphere, it worths the full price, but only if you are a sci-fi fan and you are ok with a linear story. Otherwise get it on sale at 50% - a good experience (approx 15 hours gameplay) that worths for sure this price.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1030, "steamid": "76561198013424387", "last_played": 1507074257, "num_reviews": 86, "num_games_owned": 630, "playtime_forever": 1030}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1507074671, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505650", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507074671, "recommendationid": "35458964", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great game, great story, and great mechanics.
