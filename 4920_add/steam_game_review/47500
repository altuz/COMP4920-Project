However, a man named Hobblepop wants to help them: the house is full of ghosts with the stronger of them having a last thing to finish. And Hobblepop has everything to make sure that the house will be peaceful again... but the Burtons began to have doubts about the true motive of the man...\n\nMishap: An Accidental Haunting, while not being the plot of the year, is really pleasant: indeed, everything is treated on the tone of comedy. The ghosts have all an ironic biography and met their end in a funny way. And while you have a \"main\" ghost you have to help in the end, you can find five of them in each \"scene\".\n\nHowever, finding these ghosts isn't really the main task: each location in the house is a scene and is divided in four pieces: the main one, where you can navigate from left to right and three smaller ones. In each of them, you'll find items that will help to write a riddle and to build the tool that will be used to capture the main ghost. That's the main gameplay: a pure hidden object game with list to clear.\n\nThe items are easier easy to find or very hard as they can be very small, very thin or hidden by another one. Mishap isn't escaping from the old way of playing hidden objects games. It means that people used to the adventure casual gameplay will be probably quickly bored. But you don't have a succession of scenes, you have also minigames so that you can satisfy the ghost. The goal there is to at least win a bronze medal - however, the gold trophy is a better objective, as you can unlock after that a secret award. Mishap is also letting you play minigames outside the game, so that you can improve your score if you didn't get the gold trophy. Games are going from drawing without a mistake to a tower defense-like in a garden without forgetting some fast challenges.\n\nIn the end, the graphics are reflecting that ambiance of comedy: they're very great. Each character is really reflecting their defaults and their death. However, get used to see their angry faces: too much wrong clicks and they're going to appear in the middle of your screen... well, unless it's deciding to appear randomly. It's probably the most annoying fact in Mishap. \n\nThe soundtrack is also good and very fitting to each location.\n\nThere is only one conclusion: you will probably find more fun in this classic era game than in Mystery Case Files or Mystery P.I. or Hidden Expedition, because of the ambiance. Mishap is really a very good hidden object game. You can buy it without any hesitation."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1453145182, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516395", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "20610875", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141404871", "num_reviews": 119, "last_played": 1453134459, "num_games_owned": 596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 518}, "timestamp_updated": 1454554209, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Ghost busting with all the wry, punned humor of many parodies in a top notch Class A Hidden Object game that is well worth full price.  \n\nSpoiler Alert but I can not really spoil too much.\n\nStoryline: Brock and Kelly Burton have bought the house of their dreams only to discover it is full of ghosts.  Lots and lots of ghosts.  Fed up and about to leave, Milton Hobblepot appears on their doorstep to rid them of their ghosts.  (Read the diary pages for the complete storyline.  No spoilers here.)\n\nGameplay:  This is a hidden object game, and mostly a hidden object game.  There are four aspects to the gameplay: 1) hidden object list finds 2) ghost busting 3) solving a riddle and 4) \"battling\" the master/boss ghost.  Each room of the house is one chapter, complete with five ghosts to bust, four areas (each with twenty hidden objects to find), four messages to locate (part of the find list), a riddle to solve and one master/boss to \"battle\".  There are eight rooms total giving the entire game 640 total hidden objects to find, 40 ghosts to bust, and 8 master ghosts to send on their way.    \n\nHidden object scenes:  Each room of the house has a main area which is an extended area the player must move their cursor across to gain the total panoramic view and find the other three adjacent locations.  Each location has a total of twenty list clues to find, which is almost double what other HO games have.  They are no fractured finds, or interactive ones, just straight finds.  This is not as easy as it seems.  Each area though not cluttered is definitely full of objects all appropriate to the area.  Believe it or not, most objects are actually in a place one would normally expect to find that object in real life.  Statues are on tables or shelves, outlets (this game likes outlets) are found on walls, and tools are usually found in places one would expect like the floor, sticking out or up from whatever is being worked on, or actually in or around a work area or tool box.  Nothing is unfairly hidden, though some objects are well hidden and behind other things. Some are just randomly strewn about as if someone dropped them in an odd place and could not be bothered to pick it and put it away.  There is a hint button which recharges very, very slowly.\n\nA warning about random clicking and misclicks: the game HATES both.  The Help/Instruction area found in the main menu screen even states that.  The game will punish the player too by having the master ghost show up and \"scream\" at the player.  It takes about three misclicks (in a row and a bit more if there are finds in between the misclicks) before the obnoxious master ghost of the room shows up and \"screams\", which sounds something like a howl.  After the first time the ghost shows up the screen will seem a bit foggy and every misclick (or few) after that the ghost will show up again.  To clear the fogginess and gain some peace exit the scene then re-enter.  The fog will have gone away and the player has at least three misclicks before they get screamed at again.  My suggestion: DO NOT RANDOM CLICK.    \n\nEach scene also has animations in it, as the background objects move about: the soda machine flexes its arm muscles, dolls dance, slot machines spin, and things like that.  There is a repetitive loop of music for each scene, so if that is a bother, turn off or down the volume.\n\nGhost busting: Every room has five ghosts to locate.  The main room has two ghosts, and the three adjacent areas, one ghost each.  The player clicks on the magnifying glass to start the ghost hunt and the screen will turn green.  A hot/cold bar appears at the bottom of the screen to help locate the ghost.  Locate and click on the ghost three times to capture it.  A small blurb about each ghost can be found in the Log section under ghosts.  Some are very funny to read.\n\nQuick note here about the left side panel: (top to bottom) \nITEMS - the list find clues for the hidden object scene\nMESSAGES - each room has pictures, notes, posters, etc. that appear here and one is a small dossier about the master ghost \nLOG - is broken down further into the RIDDLE, GADGET, GHOSTS, CHECKLIST, and DIARY\nRIDDLE is just that, the riddle for the player to find the \"hidden\" area of each room where the master ghost is hiding\nGADGET - a picture of the ghost busting gadget needed to battle the master ghost (They are really odd, and amusing.)\nCHECKLIST - Player progress in that room\nDIARY - The actual storyline of the game (7 pages total)\nLast entry of the side panel is MENU - Exit to main menu.      \n\nThe riddle: Each room has its own riddle.  The riddle is the location of the \"hidden\" area where the master ghost is \"hiding\".  This location can be in any of the four areas in the room.  So it is hunt and find to locate the master ghost.  This is not to difficult since the cursor changes to something that looks like a written on scroll when the player is at the correct place.\n\nWhich leads to the master ghost (or the boss) and this is where the spoilers are (in a way).  \n\nBattling the Master Ghost:  Each room has its own master ghost with their own agenda.  Each ghost has something they want to accomplish but could not due to some mishap in life which caused their death.  Each battle is a mini-game and they are all different types of games.  If a player, manages to get 100% they receive a gold trophy and if they recieve a gold trophy in all the mini-games, this unlocks the \"bonus\" special award.  I chose to list the mini-games just so the player knows what to expect.  That is the spoiler.   And yes,  all these mini-games can be skipped.\n\nThe mini-games: \n1) Photoshoot -  Target shooting the ghost (with the camera) The cursor is a round circle like a focus circle in a camera.  Head shots are the most points, of course.\n2) Recipe - Follow the recipe while grabbing things off the moving conveyor belts.  There are four parts to the cooking aspect based on hitting the green area on the correct dials.  I can only remember tenderizing and grilling.  Plus then the player has to serve up the meal properly.\n3) Symphony - A mini version of 'Guitar Hero' without all the buttons but just as hard.  Geez what a music \"puzzle\".\n4) Cards - Low cards win and the player only gets to see 2 of their cards, but the player gets cheating glasses to look at the deck twice per hand.  Tough game to win.\n5) Garden - Tower defense mini-game to keep the invading hoardes of insects out of the garden.  No comment on how badly I did at this, other then there was no garden left.  So Sad.  No flowers for me.\n6) Racing - A racing game, based on how well the player can stop the gauge needle on the green area.  There are four gauges total that activate in sequence if and only if the player hits the green on the gauge before it.\n7) Painting - Keep the cursor area on the paint brush as the paintbrush draws a picture.  Not as easy as it seems.\n8) Ring - Kinda reminds me of a bullet-hell game.  Drop a magnet onto the rings below, while trying to miss other objects and fend off the angry ghost's fireballs shooting at the rope with a fire extinguisher.  The fireballs hit, the ring falls, start again.  60-90 seconds to retrieve all the rings (or as many as the player can).    \n\nI was actually impressed at the variety of mini-games and how hard some were.  These games can be skipped and if the player even attempts them they are awarded a bronze trophy.  \n\nOverall, this was a fun and engaging game to play.  I enjoyed all the subtle humor found everywhere in the game.  For example the car (Greased Lightening) from the movie Grease being \"worked on\" in the 1950s style garage.  The game is full of this type of punned humor, especially in the names of the ghosts like Allan Bonds, super spy.  The cutscenes between chapters read like comic book pages but there are a few fully animated ones. This is definitely one for the collection, especially if one is a Hidden Object fan."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1375670831, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515738", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "3703944", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026325706", "num_reviews": 67, "last_played": 1375667678, "num_games_owned": 7063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 267}, "timestamp_updated": 1375670831, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Not a bad hidden object game and very cheap on sale. Took four hours to beat it. The settings are visually interesting and animated and most of the mini-games at the end of each level are fun (though four or five rounds seemed excessive). There are little mini-mini-games in each level like solving a really easy to solve riddle and catching ghosts by moving your mouse around the screen (which is even easier than solving the too easy riddles). Still these little touches mix things up away from just object hunting. \n\nAll the objects look like they should, meaning when it says find a cookie, it looks like a cookie. You aren't left wondering \"how is that a cookie?!\" The game doesn't allow you to randomly click all over the screen to find things, which is good. Otherwise, I'm sure I'd have done it at times. If you click too many areas that aren't objects, a ghost pops up and the screen fills with a green fog, making it even harder to find objects.\n\nThe story is very basic. There's a haunted house. Various objects on the item list are used to form a machine that is used in the \"boss fight\" mini-games. Each of the four rooms in each of the eight levels has a letter or notebook or something to drop in some more story. I stopped caring about the story after a while. Each little scene between levels consisted of the ghost hunter guy telling you to go hunt more ghosts in another part of the house. The short animation at the end is a happy ending with a little plot twist, what little plot there is to twist.\n\nI haven't played a lot of hidden object games, so I'm not sure how this stacks up in the genre as a whole.
