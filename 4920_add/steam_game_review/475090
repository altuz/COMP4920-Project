The story is that you are a nano-bot injected into a little girl who is suffering from some unknown illness.  Once inside the body, the game is pretty much a first person shooter that has the setting of being inside the human body.\n\nYou have two guns (right click and left click).  Feels like one weapon does more damage to shields, while the other does more damage once the shields are down.  There is also a grappling hook mechanic kind of similar to the Just Cause series.\n\nWith the game being on the unreal 4 engine, it looks very good.  You can tell the devs spent a lot of time on making the levels look great.  Audio is good too, with lots of voice acting (even if the accents do sound a bit fake).  \n\nOne issue I did have was being unable to record with bandicam in full screen.  It would crash the game on every load screen.  The solution was to run the game in full screen windowed, which worked flawlessly.  Not a huge issue, as I've encountered this issue on a few other games in the past.  (engine issue perhaps?)\n\nOverall, this feel like a solid game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984712587", "last_played": 1504032730, "num_reviews": 76, "num_games_owned": 168, "playtime_forever": 42}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1504039100, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510061", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1504040145, "recommendationid": "34588018", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a great shooter game!

An accident. An ambulance, the worried parents. An operation, the blonde girl in a water filled-tank. A nanobot transported inside her. To begin a game inside her body. \n\nThis series of static images makes the opening scene of Project Remedium, the new game from Atomic Jelly published by Movie Games. We play as a nanobot with a task to heal the little patient. The narrator suggests what actions we should take and gives us the status of the girl's health. In order to proceed in the game, we need to follow the instructions and follow the tracking indicator. First, we neutralize the pathogens. We do this with the help of the left mouse button shooting them and killing. Yes, project Remedium is a first-person shooter in a 3D environment. What makes it special is its noble goal to save life and a rare ability to kill the baddies in the microcosm of the human body.\n\nAnd not only do we kill there, we also have an ability to heal. So we heal the small infection spots at the infection core, achieving this with the right mouse button. We receive from our virtual assistant an alarm: morbific impact danger and we again have to use our laser. Then we gather samples for further analysis and return to the operation start point.\n\nAfterwards, we are transported to the liver where the real fun begins as with the patient's health being compromised we have to overcome the infection induced organ failure. We level up, get new skills. and advance.\n\nEver wanted to fix a patient? It's your turn to do it in Project Remedium.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198417388422", "last_played": 1504202210, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1504202220, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499519", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1504202220, "recommendationid": "34639871", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Really like this game as it is a clever and unique approach to an FPS.  The interface is pretty straightforward and easy to navigate now that a couple of patches have popped and the game runs smoothly and high FPS (GTX 1070) at 1440p and maxed out quality.  \n\nThere are gameplay elements like the crafting system and upgrading of weapons that are not documented on the Internet yet, not part of the tutorial, and no tips within game so it is part trial and error, and part mucking through forums trying to figure out what they do.  I still don't know what most of the crafted items and weapon upgrades do.\nThe main upgrade system though does give tool tips and approriate names to determine the benefit.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, there is a steady, albeit slight, difficulty curve.  Mostly you are just presented with more bad guys in front of you and firing at you and that makes dodging/strafing even more important to stay alive.  The AI is very basic but at least it isn't that god awful \"hide behind a rock and peak out\" AI that is so prevalent lately.  I prefer the straightforward aspect to AI that Project Remedium provides.\n\nThe story is linear but that isn't a bad thing.  It is a somewhat open world with objective based quests and you can get there however you want/need but you only ever have one quest at a time.  The exploration inside of the human body is a great environment to wrap all this gameplay within and makes for a very enjoyable time that I keep coming back to over and over.\n\nAt the current price this is a no-brainer as it feels like a AAA game for no money at all.
