I really wouldn't know. What I can tell you, though, is that despite the inaccuracies (that are obviously made for the sake of the game's plot, since it's more of an insertion of yourself than a retelling of the greek myths), I feel like the devs made some fantastic work capturing the aesthetics and atmosphere of the places you go to as the game progresses, and the plot manages to be surprisingly cohesive and well built, although the pacing might feel a bit rushed.\n\nThe combat system is very solid and it feels great to level up and unlock more and more of your character's extents (even more if you're like me, a sucker for mainly warfare builds and love charging headlong into hordes and massacring them all), although you have to figure out by yourself how to level the specific build you might be going for. \n\nThe soundtrack would be probably one of the few elements that I consider to be weak from the game, given that most of the time it's the same theme, only re-orchestrated, or slowed/pitched down, but that's mostly me probably giving that part too much attention.\n\nAs to the complaints I have with the game? They're very few, but one of my major complaints is that, as the game progresses, the secondary damage types (bleeding, vitality, energy, etc., along with disabling abilities) become more and more present, especially in the Hades, yet the drop system still focuses only on the main elements, which by this point you most likely are geared for, so it ends up in you getting absolutely torn to shreds by the Soul Carver Empusas or even mini-bosses like the Machae Generals, let alone the bosses themselves.\nA little minor nitpick I'd make (because, honestly, it doesn't really affect the game as to call it a complaint) is that the voice acting tends to be very repetitive, being that everybody uses the same accent barring a few bosses and Zeus after you kill Typhon.\n\nThat being said, and this is probably what you're reading this wall of text for: is the game worth it? Yes. Absolutely. The game on it's own offers you plenty of content and places to explore. The masteries and their combinations are varied, interesting and they all just further cement the game's replay value, along with the bosses that appear from Epic onwards such as Boar Snatcher, the Hydra or even the Dragon Lich. It's worth every single cent (and to be fair, the $20 price tag seems almost generous considering how much content it has)\nThis game is highly recommendable to anybody that is into ARPGs, especially those of you who were big into Diablo II back in it's heyday.\n\nPS: The game might also have some technical issues, like giving you a flatout black screen if you alt-tab or crashing/freezing on Win10. If you have said OS, there's obviously a safemode choice for it.\nPS2: It was fairly nice from the new devs to be generous to those who had the original game and give it to them for free.

Not only does fighting ancient real-life gods and monsters sound a lot cooler than fighting the devil, you get to traverse the ancient world like never before. Throughout your journey to slay the Titan that is spawning all these monsters into the land you travel across four major realms: Greece, Egypt, The Orient, MOUNT OLYMPUS, and HADES.\n\nThese lands house their very own monsters, weapons, armor, music, and so much more that practically make it five games in one, they are all really awesome to traverse through. The soundtrack for not only the different lands but the entire game itself is utterly incredible, the gameplay is smooth and easy to learn and master, the story is extremely epic, I mean how could you make a game about killing ancient monsters and gods not cool?\n\nThe multiplayer is also awesome and fun to play with friends, adding a lot more hours to the game than just singleplayer which already is at the very least a 40+ hour experience. The modding community, while not as big as other games, is still amazing at delivering custom content and updates to the game. This is also not just the original game with the Immortal Throne DLC, this is a fully REMASTERED edition of both and just make it so much better.\n\nAll of this makes it my 9th favorite game of all time, no joke, its that good.

I know some people prefer to take their time and appreciate the lore/backstory put in instead. \n\n- Dying can be a pain in the ass especially if you haven't saved at the nearest rebirth fountain and end up spawning half way across the world and have to walk all the way back again like The Fellowship to Mordor.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027919138", "last_played": 1492026715, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_forever": 2699}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505767523, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505767644, "recommendationid": "35052739", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I played this considerably due to it's ease of pick up and play, as well as the addictive gameplay.

The loot system is good, but often the last merchant  would sell the overall best items. The game had a bug that would disappear the cursor and I had to do a work around, and still it would happen every so often, perhaps once every two days of playing, forcing a restart. Not the end of the world, but my personal opinion is games should not be sold that have game breaking bugs like this until they are fixed, but I will recommend the game nonetheless.
