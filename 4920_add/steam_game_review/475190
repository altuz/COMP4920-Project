At a very leisurely pace, you'll be through your first playthrough in under 3 hours.  And there's very little replayability.\n\n- The story is a trifling thing, heavily telegraphed and perhaps not entirely satisfying.\n\n- In my brief time, I've experienced at least three game-breaking bugs where I had to reload to make progress.\n\n- It is most definitely a \"walking simulator\", complete with all of the limits and frustrations with which the genre comes loaded for bear.\n\nPROS:\n==========\n+ In the brief playtime it offers, it's the most achingly beautiful walking simulator I've ever seen.  Though I warned against the lack of replayability, I've already played it four times, just because of how astonishing and compelling the experience is.  And for that reason:\n\n+ It is the greatest cave exploration game of all time.\n\nI mean, if you know what you're buying into, it's just... it's wonderful.\n\nThis game represents the death throes of the walking simulator, and what a tremendous, unforgettable way to go out.\n\nWoefully underappreciated.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983660925", "last_played": 1505686233, "num_reviews": 45, "num_games_owned": 399, "playtime_forever": 372}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505690158, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505691326, "recommendationid": "35035068", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I like the concept of the game and the execution of the unique scanning mechanic is good, but the story is insignificant and loses you easily.

Game is heaps better in VR, even though it's stuck to teleport locomotion and you miss out on the cutscenes (they don't even let you pick up the scanner at the start, it just teleports into your hand when it gets close enough!). Even with the teleport locomotion I managed to fall and die quite a few times, something that never happened outside of VR. In non-VR mode the game boiled down to hold M1 and walk, then use the burst scan whenever the cooldown wore off. In VR you have to stop and physically scan your surroundings, and think about when to use the burst. Visually the game is so much more stunning in VR (while also being a lot more taxing on your PC) and it feels much more intense and immersive than outside of VR. Some of my critisims of non-VR mode definetly come from having already played the game when I tried it out, but even when compensating for that the game is simpily a far better VR experience than traditional game. If you can't play it in VR then I don't think this game is worth playing, especially since the experience would be spoiled if you eventually did get to play it in VR. Plus, considering that the VR mode is only in beta, it can only get better from here on out.\n\nRecommended if you own a VR headset and are willing to pay whatever price the game is currently at for a 2 hour experience.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198029220070", "last_played": 1505530321, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 217, "playtime_forever": 205}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505531173, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505531313, "recommendationid": "34986382", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I got the game because of the very interesting visual style and the unique concept of stumbling through the dark while manually building your visuals. It's amazing how pretty a simple array of dots can be when swinging around to create a perception of 3d space. But nothing ever happens in the game. You can run through the whole game in a very short time, and there's really very little to DO other than look around. I took a bit of time the first play through, really looking in every nook and cranny, trying to FIND something, anything, constantly thinking I was missing something. But, nope... Just plow on ahead because there's nothing to see or do here. Just keep moving, then, oh, there's the end. I ran through the whole game again in a single sitting (it's very short), thinking I MUST have missed the entire point of the game somehow, but, nope, I didn't miss anything. There is nothing going on here, nothing to find, nothing to do but move forward. \n\nAnd this is some kind of convoluted, meandering, contrived story with no beginning, no end, no resolution, nothing to tie the disparate elements to one another.  It added no value to the play experience, and was actually more annoying than intriguing. \n\nThis is honestly just a neat tech demo that they tried to turn into a game by cramming a pointless story that has no relevance into a \"stumbling through the dark\" environment that they inexplicably stretched into an hour or so. It would actually have been a better product if it had lasted 3 minutes and been free.
