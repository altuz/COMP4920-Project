If you enjoy FB games such as Gardens of Time, you will undoubtedly like The Otherside. The narrative is a little strange, but there are several different puzzle types to keep the gameplay interesting.  The Otherside doesn't try to break the mold too much however and is a good choice for the casual gamer.  The Otherside is definitely a great pick for anyone who has a penchant for puzzles."}]}
