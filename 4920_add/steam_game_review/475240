I played this game for a while man, and I got pretty far. Then I went to start the game up and it was lagging, so I started spamming enter (which is exactly what people do when they get impatient, what gamer doesnt?) and when the game actually loaded, the cursor started on the \"new game\" button. Long story short, it erased my game and I had to start over just because there's the capacity for one playthrough. There's not even an option to go back to a certain level if you've been there before. One small mistake and hours of gameplay are gone with no hope of getting them back, seriously dumb.\nIn the game there are mobs that drop weapons, which you can then pick up, and throw them as a secondary attack. It's kind of cool because these dropped weapons are essentially a resource to use, and they are needed in many cases to pass the levels. There is a glitch when you kill two mobs with the same weapon (you should be getting two of the same weapon at this point) and they land in the same area. When you go to pick one of them up, it just picks them both up and you can only use one. They morph together or something. So basically depending on the rng of where the weapon drops, you have sporadic amounts of resources. It never was the determining factor of whether or not I passed a level, but it was still super annoying.\nAnother glitch has to do with the time ticks for damage. I'm supposed to be able to throw these weapons at mobs, and it damages them, but somtimes if I throw two in a row very fast it only registers that one hits them. This can't be because of a mechanic that they can only be hit in a specific time frame, because you can throw a weapon and then smack it with your sword super fast. So basically you miss out on hitting them just because you are trying to be efficient (Which is super annoying) In fact, this glitch definitely made me not pass levels a lot, it was really frustrating.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 250, "steamid": "76561198260534400", "last_played": 1506396867, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 250}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506397511, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502264", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506397511, "recommendationid": "35215189", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
