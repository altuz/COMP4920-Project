Unfotunately, it's nothing like it. There is little gameplay involved. All you can do is trade players, set up a tactic and press \"Continue\" a hundred times until there's finally a match. There's no \"Training\" option or anything else you would look for in a soccer manager.\n\nA plus point is the tutorial section though. Sure, it's very minimalistic but it serves its purpose well and shows what can be done in the game.\n\nThe game seems to have serious performance issues as well. Loading, saving and basically doing anything takes forever. Kinda hard to believe that this new game struggles, where the old CM 01/02 was so much faster with its huge database.\n\nThe GUI is not very optimized. Tables are small and leave much space of the rest of the page. Elements like arrows feel kinda awkward to interact with. The date display is also really small.\n\nI really want to like this game, but until the performance problems are fixed and the one or other feature is added I would not recommend this game yet.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197978668303", "last_played": 1465993272, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 540, "playtime_forever": 57}, "votes_up": 27, "timestamp_created": 1465998219, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527556", "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1465998219, "recommendationid": "23569777", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very poor game that is very overpriced.

It's very basic by nature and those who, like me, spent hours upon hours playing Championship Manager 97/98 many years ago, will recognise the likeness and the 'nod' that this game gives to the old CM series. That's definitely a positive thing for those who want to run through season's a lot quicker than is possible on FM.  \n\nIt's clear the game is in its infancy as there is indeed some improvements needed in certain areas like searching for players more easily (i.e you cannot filter player skills at the moment) and at least having some kind of basic scouting system too.  However, I believe the game offers a sense of CM nostalgia that's worth tapping into and offers a completely different product to the FM seies by focusing on just the football and none of the other role-playing and media nonsense.  It also seems that the developer is keen to take the game forward and does interact and take on board feedback/ideas on the game's discussion board.  \n\nDefinitely a thumbs up for players looking for a management game that is most certainly stripped back to the bare bones that allows you to glide through season's.  It is not, however, a game for FM purists who enjoy all the ballyhoo and bravado that comes with that title.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198050538049", "last_played": 1495335309, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 997}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1487902141, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487902141, "recommendationid": "30131748", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The System I used are Mircosoft surface 3.

CM of yore took about 10 years to hit its high point around 2002 before if went downhill, and given some money and enough time this game has yet to do the all the errors Football Manager is currently doing. \n\nYou'll get a few hours outta this game, and hopefully developers are still incentivised to broaden this \"proof of concept\" into a better and more complex football manager. 90's football manager are still far superior and more fun than this, but given time to expand this show promise. Look at this as an investment. Showing developers that there is a market for a proper competitor to SI.\n\nTL:DR: Buy it, if not only to give a big middle finger to Sports Interactive for the utterly horrible direction the monopoly flagship of this genre is headed.\nPros and cons are quite simple: A pro is that this game has nothing of the superfluous timesinks that football manager does, the con being that it doesn't have much else either yet.
