Two worlds have situations that are shaped somewhat by the player's choices/responses to character interaction in-game.\n\nReview: One of the worst-conceived storylines I've encountered, driven by kitchy American-->Japanese culture fandom and a ham-handed attempt at fantasy genre insertion into a modern world with \"furry\" characters. Interaction is extremely linear and directed. This poorly-written story reads like 90's era Interactive Fiction minus control of any senses, exploration or puzzle-solving. Dialogue is contrived and unremarkable. World-creation is lazy, with names like \"The Assassins Guild\" and conflict centered around the most rudimentary understanding of the capitalism/socialism dichotomy. A little more effort could have resulted in the player's ability to explore and problem-solve, but instead the player is faced with railroad tracks over a fiction rife with the worst anime stereotypes and long scenes of text in which nothing is engaging and everything is boring.\n\nIf you like reading horrible stories, this one is for you, but even then I would wait until it was on sale... a lot.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197996005791", "last_played": 1502501795, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 403, "playtime_forever": 52}, "votes_up": 19, "timestamp_created": 1504737827, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514888", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1504737827, "recommendationid": "34784462", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I didn't play for very long, but the constant fuzzy background images that give me a headache looking at them, coupled with static characters that NEVER change expressions despite changing \"emotions\" really take you out of the world.  This was something I was very much hoping to like, but I can't get Immersed.\n\nBetween the poor visual composition (despite the well drawn but completely immobile characters) and the fact that in 45 minutes I got to make a whole 3 choices over lines and lines of dialogue, there's far less to this game than it would seem.  \n\nIf you want to see the characters, look up their artwork, save your money, make up your own stories, and don't waste your time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001201499", "last_played": 1505620887, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 48, "playtime_forever": 42}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505621466, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508578", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505621466, "recommendationid": "35013680", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not gonna lie, this game is not what you'd think it be. The storyline is very interesting and the characters are so diverse. Each chapter of the game I played made me feel more and more compelled to continue. I did find that sometimes I felt a little bored with the vast amount of dialogue clicking but besides that my interest in the game never faded.\n\nEach individual character had their own interesting fursonas, accompanied by intriguing backstories and conflicted pasts. The art itself is a feature to admire. The work and dedication which went into each character truely made this game fun to play. You feel very much involved in the story's progression for each decision you make will decide not only the ending of the story but also the amount of backstory your opened into by the characters you speak with. \n\nOverall, if y'all is a furry, like me, or just interested in games such as this one then I highly recommend you jump right into Major/Minor. Complete Edition or not, the game is very nice and shouldn't be looked down upon. \n\nMy favorite character would have to be Konrad.
