It's all very disorienting and kinda disturbing.\n\nI only played the easiest mode (yeah yeah, call me a wimp if you must) where you don't have to throw the balls, you just aim in the direction and fire and it goes that way.  I did OK, but I found that I really had to keep teleporting or I got killed.\n\nSpeaking of that, when you die, you only had the one life so that's it.  Then a creepy robotic voice says \"you died! Game over man\" or \"they killed you!\"  \"You got shot!\" or some other line. I guess it's amusing...sorta.\n\nThe graphics are really basic.  Cubes to land on and stand on, some spacy looking background, round enemy robots that don't move, they just teleport in and eventually locate you and shoot. Oh and it seems the cubes can be destroyed so that means eventually if you survived for long enough, the places to run to might dwindle to nothing.\n\n It seemed to me that this game was probably made very low budget.  I didn't find the music that memorable, the gameplay was kinda flat and repetitive (but to be fair I was playing the simplest mode where there are no powerups) and I kinda lost interest quickly.\n\nThings I liked about this game:\n[list]\n [*] I guess it could be like a big shootout, and maybe with the powerups it'll be cool.  I only barely played it so I might not have seen the best it can give.\n [/list]\n\nThings I didn't like about this game:\n [list]\n [*] Nothing really grabbed me about this game.  I'll try it again and see if I change my mind.\n [/list]\n\nRight now, the verdict is still out, but I would say pass on this game based off of what I saw for that short time period.  I'll give it a few more runs and see how much my opinion changes.  If I go from \"Ugh\" to \"meh\" or even \"I Love it!\" I'll come back and update this.  \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969913402", "last_played": 1467596752, "num_reviews": 149, "num_games_owned": 1966, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1467600379, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508353", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1467600379, "recommendationid": "24068280", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I love this game!!
