One of the great things about it is how it is a primarily black and white game- which allows it to make you feel almost unnerved by its dark colours. The dark colours reflect the game absolutely perfectly as if it was in colour, it wouldn't portray the same effect.\n Should you buy it?\nThat depends on wether it is your kind of game.
