It is easy to pick up and play for a few minutes or hours.  Basic time managements are there like clearing roads (not as bad as 12 Labours of Hercules Series), building production buildings to produce resources (Wood, Food, Stone, Mana, etc), upgrading your avatar to improve your skills as levels progress, fulfilling simple quests, and more.  The sound track is very pleasant and enjoyable.  The developer did such a great job with this series and I have enjoyed 4 the best so far  which is why I opted to buy in Steam to support the developer plus the Steam achievements are there too!  There is also an option to play with no time limit or if you want an extra challenge you can play with timer on.  If you never played make sure you get the bundle that includes all 4 games in this fun little series!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197998786781", "last_played": 1501221793, "num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 952, "playtime_forever": 144}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499144409, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500291", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499144599, "recommendationid": "33215359", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
