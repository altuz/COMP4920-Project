The game has everything to be a potential game....\nbut unfortunately its DEAD, there is no players to do PVP once the mainly thing to do is the PVP/ARENA...\nDevelopers are too worried about other priorities and not putting/fixing whats necessary to populate this game and make it more interested for players.\n\nSeason 2 patch at the moment is a disappointment, new sets are useless, the game didn't change at all, still the same boring stuffs, nothing to do, new player come and leave.\n\nI'm not recommending this game right now but maybe with future patch it can become good", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197985722105", "last_played": 1488023932, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 53, "playtime_forever": 58843}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1486609935, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513694", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1486610002, "recommendationid": "29793878", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Crush Online is now live for about 3 months and i can still recommend it to all who are interested in a MOBA/RPG crossover to test it out.\n\nIt still doesnt have p2w features at all. The things u can buy with jewels doesnt give u any benefits for the pvp (so the fights are fair) but money can be spend to get some stuff a little faster or for some costumes. Also there are a many Achievements, Arena Rankings and Quests where u can get alot (really alot) free jewels again and again. Yes, no limitation, u just need to play active to earn it.Very friendly monetization.\n\nIf u are a new player, it could be a little difficult to get in to all the new stuff and how it works. Maybe u will even think thats to difficult or would need to long grind until u get on the same lvl as \"older\" player, but thats not true at all. The last updates made it so much easier for new players to gear up, u just need to know how (just ask ppl and u will get help!). Also dont forget its a mix of rpg and moba, so some ppl spend some time on their equip and know how to fight. If u would be on same lvl as them after a few days, the rpg aspect would feel bad.  :-D \n\nAnd here comes also the good community to the point. Alot of ppl in the game are very friendly und help the new ppl who have questions. There is also a Forum, Reddit and the best thing Discord server, where u can speak to other players even if u are currently not ingame or if they are not ingame. In the game there are 3 nations that fight each other, but in discord ppl are still helpfull to each other (hope it stays like that^^). Also dont forget to check the official forum, there are alot of usefull guides about the game.\n\nThe game had a rough start and lost alot of playerbase, but alot of the problems were fixed and it is now growing with new content, balance changes and other stuff. So dont understand me wrong, Crush has still some topics that need to be worked on but thats something Devs and GMs are already working on now, just need some time. The game is very special and has alot of awesome features, that u will maybe not see or understand as a new player, but some mechanics are really deep and brings alot of fun when u get to know them.\n\nJust dont listen to the haters with 0,1h playtime.

The concept of Crush Online is to try to combine MMOs, MOBAs, isometic RPGs and Pay To Win games into an ugly monster. The objective of the developer is to make you sign up for a VIP level 4 package so that they can milk you for all the money you have. With the VIP Level 4 package, you will gain loads of crystals that you can use to buff your character, unlock inventory slots and upgrade your weapons. There are a whole list of limitations that hide behind a paywall in this game.\n\nYou start off by creating 1 of 3 different classes, Saint, Punisher and Guardian. Each of them have a primary and secondary weapon that can be switched by pressing Spacebar. Each weapon gives them 4 different abilities that can be activated by pressing QWER, similar to MOBAs. As you level up, you can unlock a Main and Sub talent tree for your class. Moving around the map is simple, it is exactly like any other isometric RPG. Click and move. Along the way, you can even play a MOBA match for PvP, where you rush to down the enemy's tower in a single lane battle.\n\nConclusion, don't play this Pay To Win game. Hendrik Lesser, Achim Kaspers and Markus Wilding are the ones who helped publish this game.
