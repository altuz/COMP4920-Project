It's not because it's not a good game, but because it has too many things I'm looking for that is not yet available at this early stage of the game.\n\nIt would be great to have a co-op adventure, not just a multiplayer battle mode-- what I was looking for at this time as I was looking for something to play with my non-gamer wife.\n\nTo be fair, I still recommend the game. To be fair, I still will look forward to buying the full \"explosive\" potential of the game, but just not now.\n\nIt still is a lovable game and is the best Bomberman-like type of game I have seen and played on different platforms.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043941027", "last_played": 1498572393, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 208, "playtime_forever": 36}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1498653908, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522354", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498653908, "recommendationid": "32932788", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
