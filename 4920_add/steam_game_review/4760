(Yea even the gauls and the britons) They have different units,Not types of building but different textures,names,and descriptions (But they do the same thing...Eccept religious buidings)\nGreat map:The map is full of city to take and exploit it potential...\nAnd so on...(I do not want to write like 10 hours of review...I just don't)\nNow to the sadly bad points:\nBoring city management: Well for me its just to simple...Units,taxes,trade and buildings... (mah)\nGlitchy map tho:I don't know if it does it on all copy but well...When I put my screen resolution for that game well the movement on the map is SUPER SLOW...It's so annoying!\nNaval combat:Auto combat...B-O-R-I-N-G!\n\n\nBut even for thosse minor flaws (Ho and I did not put ugly graphics because I just do not cares...I think its not a problem and IT SHOULD NEVER make a gamer go away from games...Therre is ammazing game whit ugly graphic:This one :D, Fallout 2,The Elder ScrollsMorrowind/Daggerfall,The stronghold series (Remove 2 and 3) and so on... UGLY GRAPHIC DOES NOT MAKE A GAME BAD!!!)   ok. But even for thosse minor flaws you should get this ammazing game IT IS AWSOME You'l have a good time playing it (Ho wait the multiplayer still work so that a good points...Its not abandoned but its rare to see someone...Still) trust me! Ok now you should buy the game when you'l have the money and TIME (Or else you'l fail class because you did not study but played this classic...)
