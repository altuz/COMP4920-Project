Has a menu on the F2 key with load/save anywhere.  Music seems very similar/identical to the Amiga version so far.

This updated version keeps all that intact while also adding a new soundtrack and insightful, informative commentary from creator Colin Jones. If you were old enough to have played it back in the day, pick it up and feel like a kid again.

The Dizzy series and their imitators, BMX Simulator, Steg the Slug, Rockstar Ate My Hamster, Tilt...\n\nAnd then we get a Codies game released on Steam, in more or less its original form, and... it's Slightly Magic. I'm not sure if I had any prior relationship with this game. I think I owned it at some point, but maybe it was one of those tapes that rarely loaded properly. Maybe I gave it a try but was immediately put off by the apparent difficulty and oblique puzzles of the first few screens.\n\nHaving given it more of a chance, to make the most of my Steam purchase, I'm a bit more taken with it. It turns out there is more to it than getting fried by the dragon right at the beginning. The puzzles have a logical progression to them. The platform jumping seems fairly sophisticated and forgiving, but I suspect that's an aspect of the remake rather than the original. Overall, the game certainly has that 8-bit charm. It's just so good to play a game with that white sprites, black background Spectrummy look. For a Dizzyalike, Slightly Magic has its own unique style.\n\nIs this worth a purchase if it doesn't hold any nostalgic appeal for you? I'd like to urge yes. It's certainly more worthy than a lot of Steam indie games. At full price, it might be asking just a little bit much. This is a game that cost 3.99 on release (inflation, I know). Achievements and trading cards would do a lot to add value.\n\nI hope between this and Deus Ex Machina, this is the start of seeing a lot more games of this era on Steam. While this release seems to be a one-off project by Colin Jones, I'll keep dreaming of that Atari Vault style collection of Codemasters classics.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "steamid": "76561198088030397", "last_played": 1507076532, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 735, "playtime_forever": 62}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505242253, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505242253, "recommendationid": "34906545", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
