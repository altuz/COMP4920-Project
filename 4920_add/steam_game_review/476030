Handy with a six-shooter and a handful of spells, after a few centuries of working for the family business he's decided to fight for the good guys when hell makes a play to take over the world. The writing is serviceable, but the plot is really bare-bones, pretty much just an excuse to let you kill a lot of demons on urban environments.\n The store page says it's an ARPG, but it really really isn't; It's an action game with a pickups that raise your stats. I'd describe it as a twin-stick shooter, but the controls are strictly mouse and keyboard. They're functional, making things harder than they should be but also allowing for some things that would be tricky on a pad - like aiming at spiders hanging off a high place.\n The environments are pretty detailed and the music is great, if not really memorable. It's a pretty short game (finished it in just under two hours), and that actually works in its favor. Far more of a problem is that it's plagued by frequent traversal problems - it seems Johnny hasn't learnt to deal with ankle-high obstacles very well, causing him to get stuck on the level geometry fairly often. This is a problem in a game where backpedalling is pretty vital.\n Still, it's fun enough while it lasts - pretty good for a tiny indie game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198003469036", "last_played": 1498327809, "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 1925, "playtime_forever": 114}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1498329197, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509184", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498329197, "recommendationid": "32738347", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Playthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdZSZmp1V_8\n\nI absolutely loved this game! I had so much fun (and rage) while playing this game.  The main thing that caused me issues at points in the game was the jumping.  I would clip on things or couldn't jump high enough in certain areas.  I messaged the devs about it and they said they are looking in to it.  That to me in itself is a huge plus because it shows that the devs still want to fix and improve the game.  Other than that the combat was fun, quick and smooth.  The boss fights were great especially the 2nd and final boss.  Camera movement was extremely smooth when rotating/turning.  It took me around 1.5 hours to beat the game and I didn't explore all the other routes/areas so I'm sure you could add a bit more time on to that.  I really loved the fact that you got upgrades to your spells (ground and tornado shot were my fav).  I do admit that while the boss fights were fun I had a MUCH harder time fighting hordes of gun slingers or the steroid dogs.  They were sometimes infuriatingly hard to kill without dying almost instantly before you killed one.  \n\nPros:\n-combat and spells\n-boss fights\n-camera\n-dialogue\n\nCons:\n-jumping\n-random clipping\n-being killed off screen by gun slingers\n\nOverall I highly recommend you pick this up for the price if you enjoy ARPG's and the trailer looks interesting to you. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198097303058", "last_played": 1494145469, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 148, "playtime_forever": 118}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1494231285, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494175", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1494231285, "recommendationid": "31620804", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
