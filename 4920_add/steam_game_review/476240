But this should be one of the last ones you read. After this paragraph or so of text, you're going to scroll upwards, buy this game, and enjoy your life. \n\nJust do it.\n\n[h1]What is this thing you call a \"Chess\"?[/h1]\nKNIGHTS is a game about, you guessed it, moving knight pieces on little checkered puzzle boards. Do you need to know jack about chess? Not really, but it helps if you've played a few casual games, just so you're familiar with a Knight's moves, since it's definitely the least intuitive of the pieces. But, even if you've never played a game of chess in your life, this game indicates quite clearly which spaces you can and can't move to.\n\n[h1]But is it any good though?[/h1]\nKNIGHTS takes the mechanics of moving a knight chess piece, and builds a fantastic little puzzler around it. Your task is to move knights to certain preallocated positions, which gradually becomes more and more complex as your chessboard shrinks, and the number of pieces increases. You can do this by just brute-force clicking at everything you can until it works, which is only viable for the earlier puzzles, or carefully try to map out how you want things to look like X moves from now, and work backwards. At the point I'm at, about 2 hours in, I'd go crazy if I even attempted to brute-force these monsters...\n\nThe game also apparently has dailies, which I haven't looked at too much so far. These might have varying difficulties day to day (the was Duet does it), or  just a set difficulty. I'll update this review on my thoughts on dailies once I give them a look. At a glance, though, just that should be enough to add a good number of hours to your time with this game.\n\n[h1]What can you even buy with a dollar anymore in America?[/h1]\nReally, it's just a fun and cue little puzzle game for a dollar. Literally a buck.
