The sound balance is awful; On the one side the BGM is only moderately too loud at my PC's default setting of 12% volume but talking to people and opening chests have sfx that are so loud it almost hurt my ears.\n\nThere is no quit option. Use the task manager or alt+f4 to close the game\nThere is no window/fullscreen option you must the default shortcut (alt+enter) to resize the window.\n\nThe game doesn't support resolutions above 1600x900 (1080p)\n\nThe menus have incorrect control hints (Press X to close when you actually have to press B)\n\nThere is only one menu and no submenus for equips or items, you use left and right to cycle through equipment (presumably. The arrows indicate this but I never got any new gear to test it)\n\nThis game is not up to par for what I'd consider the minimum quality standard of games delivered on the steam platform.
