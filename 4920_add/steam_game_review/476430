However, this one is cleverly done.  This game actually makes good use of VR to maximize the fun.  You will have to look around to find the best way to get to the finish line (the bell) in as few swings as possible.  Each level has a certain amount of recommended swings to get there.  If you can get there in those amount of swings or fewer with as much health as possible, then you will likely get 3 stars and move on to the next challenge level.  Of course, you don't need three stars to move on, but I recommend you do to that to get the most gaming fun time out of the title.\n\nEach level brings a new challenge, as the challenges get tougher, new mechanics are introduced.  The puzzles/ challenges are not too difficult, nor are they too easy.  You will have to not only think of how to best get to the finish line, but also execute correct timings.  It's also fun watching the little boy get plastered after putting the \\m/ heavy metal rules sign up :D\n\nRating 6/10 sale price rating which is currently at $1.59  (I don't recommend this game at full price unless you have several kids interested as there will be virtually no replay value and it's not a very long game depending on your skill level)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1506577905, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506578283, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506578387, "recommendationid": "35255584", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
