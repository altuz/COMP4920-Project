Even a LOT of weapons you can pick up and level up over the course of the game. The story isn't anything special, you play as this girl who's parents have been kidnapped by an evil doctor looking dude because he is evil and you have to rescue your parents. This game does start off nice but the further you go on you realize some really annoying mechanics. But then that leads to my first problem with this game... \n\nLeveling up you weapons doesn't make sense how it works, we would know that when we level up something in a game we expect that thing to be better right? However in this game you will do a lot of button mashing with certain weapons to kill off enemies fast. When you level up weapons some might have better damage and what not but you still feel like your button mashing the same amount of time you did before, and worst when you get to a certain level it changes the weapon a bit and makes it seem much better but the damage is reset to like a default state... So does this really seem like a proper \"level up\" system?\n\nThe beginning of the game has this annoying as h*** character who plays a guitar and has to tell you everything about the game in case you haven't realized something earlier. Every time you run into this character the game cuts off into a cutscene with the character dialogue that gets annoying since it happens often that makes me want to be with Navi the Fairy from OoT instead! The character with the guitar has a store where you buy abilities like a triple jump or sword upgrade or shortcuts to certain levels. However the currency in this game is insane because everything costs a lot of coins that makes you have to grind for like 2 hr. to get one of the more expensive things. And whenever you fall on spikes, bottomless pit/water and get a game over you loose some money as well. Until the game decides to bring you to the beginning of the game to the store because you can't access the store anywhere else which is a terrible design choice for a shop in games IMO. \n\nNow to me the most BS thing with this game is that whenever you get a enough game overs you restart all the way back to the beginning of the game. Thank god you still get to keep all your weapons and certain amount of money. Though like I said the last paragraph everytime you get a game over you loose money and gets worst the more you have. The only way to warp to certain levels like I said is to buy shortcuts at the shop which cost a LOT of money and it takes forever to get a good amount of money. \n\nThe one thing I really enjoyed from this game is the soundtrack which honestly is really good that I would listen too every now and again that I do recommend you pick up the soundtrack!\n\nConclusion: Cally's Trails isn't a terrible game, it has what it takes to be a good action platformer but it fails later on into the game when you realize some stupid design choices that makes the game annoying at some points. I only suggest you pick this up if you are into this genre and what to get some easy achievements but do pick up the soundtrack cause its really good.\n\nRating: 4/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198166771313", "last_played": 1481821534, "num_reviews": 75, "num_games_owned": 1060, "playtime_forever": 244}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1481824145, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507209", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1481824145, "recommendationid": "28391072", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "At first, I heard a few negative things about Cally's Trials (aka, Cally's Caves 2), and I have to say, I don't see these negatives.  Is it tough?  Yes.  Are there issues?  Yes.  But is it FUN?  That's the big question.  And I have to say, YES.\nYou get weapons.  You have a sword.  You get to do a LOT of cool things, and it's a platformer, and it's great!  Is the sequel better?  Oh HEAVEN'S yes.  But judging this game on its OWN merits, I have to give it a 7/10.\nI love the controller support, although some of the mappings don't feel quite natural.  Even still, I have to rate this game pretty high because it's VERY fun!  And the physics in the game are pretty clean!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198289499329", "last_played": 1477210325, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 64}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1480056315, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1480056315, "recommendationid": "27394433", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
