It will take a very special kind of player to enjoy this game.\n\nThe art style is great and the music is okay. The gameplay sections are terribly outdated but thankfully there aren't many of them. The problem is that the quality of the story is not nearly good enough to balance out these flaws.\n\nThe main attraction is clearly the story, however it is often obtuse for no reason and poorly paced. It's a shame because the story concepts and characters are impressive but crucial revelations are barely explained while the game spends hours on unimportant details. This is frustrating since there's a cool Blade Runner / Snatcher vibe but the story doesn't really go anywhere in the end.\n\nOverall, I'm not even really sure if I can say I enjoyed the Silver Case. I wanted to see how it would end so I kept playing but in hindsight I don't think it was worth it.
