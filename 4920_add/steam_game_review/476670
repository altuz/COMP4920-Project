You pay $.25 to play for 3 minutes, are amused and don't feel swindled. You never think about it again and the world resumes.\n\nReally pretty graphics. Yeah.... pretty graphics. The characters are cute and pretty. The spells and different things look pretty. Everything is nice and vibrant. It's a nice looking game. \n\nUhhhh... I can't thing of a single other redeeming thing.\n\nYou click the mouse a bunch and kill a bunch of stuff that is trying to destroy some crystal thing. You can expand your area in the midst of clicking and attacks... and just keep clicking to kill things. CLICK CLICK CLICK. No story to be found. What am I even clicking for?\n\nMost redundant and disappointing game I've played. I wanted to like it... I don't understand why this is not early access. I would pay $.99 for this game, but the cost even on sale is just honky. \n\nOne post says the game is complete and ready for release at it's final stage and only a few smaller things will be added. Then the dev responds to a post in the discussions saying they were going to add a lot more stuff. More than the original post sounded like. Either way... the lack of a roadmap or direction for this clearly Early acess quality game completely turns me off. \n\nLike a dealer without a menu.
