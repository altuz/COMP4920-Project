It's an entertaining game, but with the current level of content and polish, only worth picking up heavily on sale.\n\nDinosaurs are a nice change from the ubiquitous zombies, robots, humans, etc saturating gaming. Nothing new, certainly, but still refreshing. The animations and AI still need a lot of work though - nothing looks particularly natural, and even after a couple hours you notice the canned animations. It's especially bad on the big dinos - they track poorly in general (except the triceratops, which makes pretty much no sense - if anything would charge past you, it would be that). \n\nThe guns feel pretty good for the most part. It's obnoxious to repeatedly get drops for just the basic pistol, though. There are enough guns in the game, but seemingly no way to try them all out or unlock them in any systematic way. The forced recoil is awkard, but that's a challenge of the medium more than anything.\n\nI think my biggest gripe with the game as it stands is the bow - aiming feels very awkward because the angle is determined more by the front hand than the back hand. It's hard to describe, but if you've played Gorn it should make sense. It's not unusable, it just feels way worse thansome other games. This wouldn't be as big a deal if the game didn't seem so intent on pushing bow use. There's an entire mode dedicated to it, and the game seems to want to incentivize being stealthy (which as a system seems pretty underdeveloped. When you're using a silencer or a bow, it takes dinos a couple more shots to notice you, but that seems to be about it from a gameplay perspective).\n\nTo sum up, it's a cool idea and I see some potential here, but it still has a pretty long way to go to get above the level of \"only playable because of the state of the VR market\". I'm hopeful for future updates.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009851846", "last_played": 1505539107, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 153, "playtime_forever": 354}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506388828, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506388828, "recommendationid": "35213640", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game does not feel finished.
