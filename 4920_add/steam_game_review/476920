Because Amulet of Dreams is hit/miss in places. In AoD, you actually play as a child. According to[spoiler]the end cinematic,[/spoiler]you're about.. six? seven? I'm surprised that a seven-year old can be counted on to do much more than play with Lego and eat crayons, but maybe I'm unaware of the maturity of present-day pre-teens. \n\nThe [strike]story[/strike] reason for playing the game demands a truly epic suspension of disbelief. I'll buy that[spoiler]the hooded man wants to kill an otherworldly princess, for no clear reason.[/spoiler]I'll even buy that[spoiler]somehow, your friend is connected to said princess because the girls look EXACTLY alike, just in different universes.[/spoiler]But I won't buy this:[spoiler]your friend is sick, and ... she's all alone in the house? Except for a strange, hooded man in the sitting room? And she's what, seven? Maybe nine?[/spoiler]'Kay. No. That's just taking it too far.\n\nPros:\n\n+ pretty artwork.\n+ plenty of areas to explore.\n+ the adventure parts were mostly interesting.\n+ pretty artwork (it really is pretty).\n+ can be played in windowed mode.\n+ it has a map.\n+ the map tells you where you still have tasks.\n+ I liked the little helper elf.\n+ achievements.\n+ trading cards.\n\nCons:\n\n- the map is buggy: you will always have a task marker at the first location.\n- the music wasn't at a consistent volume.\n- the voice acting wasn't the greatest.\n- the HO scenes had nothing to do with the story.\n- the items you receive after HO scenes have nothing to do with the scene.\n- the scenes where you have to find pieces/parts (see second video) are incredibly unintuitive.\n- typos.\n- instructions are given for only some of the mini-games.\n- I encountered a bug in a certain mini-game after tabbing to another window, and had to restart to fix it.\n- some unintuitive backtracking to replay HO scenes.\n- the 'story'.\n- awful, awful, awful end 'cinematic'. truly, awful.\n- no replay value whatsoever.\n\nEphy Rating: 5/10\nSummary: If you can suspend your disbelief for long enough, and you play with the volume as close to 'off' as makes no appreciable difference, it's not a bad game. It is not as good as some I've played. (I play a lot of HOGs.) But I have played worse. If you've got the usual three hours to kill, and you're looking for some pretty scenery and a cute elf helper ([spoiler]and an incredibly ugly ...rat? thing?[/spoiler]), then get it on sale, if you've run out of really [i]good[/i] HOGs to play.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198032451918", "last_played": 1500429042, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 761, "playtime_forever": 194}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1500431751, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508066", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500761462, "recommendationid": "33642770", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
