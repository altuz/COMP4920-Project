The reason I say it's unfair is because this game has something that the other one hasn't and that's charm.\nRocksmith is like the trainer who says, \"Do 60 push ups and you'll eventually be an athlete\".\nFourChords is like the friend who says, \"Do 20 push ups and I'll pay for the pizza\".\n\nSecondly: After a long day or a tough workout, I don't want to see a complicated layout showing the exact pattern of how to play a song. No, I just want to strum along with the chords I already know and this game does that. Sometimes you have to \"Downgrade\" your skills to experience the magic in music and this is what FourChords does.\n\nMy point is, Rocksmith can be intimidating with all its features and that affects the passion you have for something. FourChords doesn't ask anything, play a song and switch chords until you strum something that sounds somewhat like the song you want to play.\n\nCons\n*The same background image of the girl holding the guitar, maybe add some creativity/animations to motivate the player.\n*It doesn't have a feature where it can detect your chords, it has a strange point system which says, \"I don't even know how you played but I'll pling your points anyway\"...PLING!...\"You're a Level 2 Amateur Club Rocker!\".\n*Computer generated music, it's not the original songs that you strum to so it might turn you off when it comes to sound quality. (Note: This is a pro also)\n\nPros\n*The computer generated tones helps with strumming, playing along with skilled guitarists will mask your own faults and cause sloppy muscle memory.\n*Its charming simplicity makes me want to strum along with my guitar, it makes everything feel more organic and honest.\n*When it comes to learning rhythm then it beats Rocksmith because you don't play to rack up points, hoping it will detect the sound. You jam and listen to your playstyle, which a lot of beginners neglect.\n*The straightforward simplicity makes you play songs without much effort, which is the reason we start playing guitar in the first place. Counter this with Rocksmith and you practice more than you play.\n\nIn conclusion, if you just want to become the guy who can strum a guitar around the fireplace then you don't have to know how to play 'Thunderstruck'. There's no need for that when it comes to the average Joe, you're still just as charming with a few basic chords.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010060551", "last_played": 1504960240, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_forever": 220}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1504546097, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511389", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505031703, "recommendationid": "34739830", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
