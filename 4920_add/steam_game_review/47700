CnC Generals is still regarded as one of my favorite games of all time. This game, however, is nothing like the other CnC games. At least while I played it. There was no base building, just pick your MRV or whatever and pop out units like a chicken on crack. Then, if you start losing and it dies, no worries, another will respawn down for you. \n\nCommand & Conquer was always a base building, army building, thrash your enemies kind of game in each iteration that I've played. This is not like that at all.  It would have been better to just call it something else. On top of that, you have the always online, which made it so I couldn't even play it on my laptop till I hit WiFi spots while traveling.
