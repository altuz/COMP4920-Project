With a team of up to 4 players you can play through either the short tutorial campaign, or the expansive Kindred Flame quest, which can be experienced over a session lasting days! with a convenient save feature and Exp/Item Tracker so you can pick up from where you left off anytime!\n\nEach Quest in Descent is a challenging experience which will put your teamwork and strategy to the test with randomly generated enemies and encounters that can keep you on your feet the whole time around, your mettle will be tested but it is a rewarding experience after all the hard work! \n\nHowever the games flaws can mainly be player induced, the lack of certain features can lead to some frustrating scenarios. If somehow you may have jumped the gun and mis clicked, the game does not have an undo system of any kind so you will be stuck with any mistakes you have made. so make sure you have somebody aware and not clumsy at the helm of the app! \n\nPerphaps another minor flaw is that the entire game requires alot of reading, which can pause progress signifcantly and effect game flow, i feel like an option for a narrator would not go amiss! as the Quest Introductions demostrate some pretty decent voice acting! And one which makes me kind of wish the characters were speaking within the game for immersions sake! Though this is more a personal opinion then a game flaw.\n\nOverall: If your a fan of Dungeon Delving, with a level of sadism where you love a challenge Descent is the game for you, though if you have a bad team this game may present alot of frustration for you. it can still be a fun time none the less.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198068886444", "last_played": 1486077829, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_forever": 513}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1477249748, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500832", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1477249748, "recommendationid": "26187920", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Outstanding App that goes along with the board game.
