You play it once, no more fun in playing it again.\n\nThat were the only 2 gamemodes implemented in this game, so for what it is, don't buy it.\nIt has great potential but it isn't there yet at all.

However, we have far superior VR games now (such as RawData), which offer actual gaming experiences rather than simple mini-games that have no progression or development worth speaking of.\n\nIf you want to buy a cheap Demo game that makes it easy to teach your friends the basics of VR, this is worth it for sure--it's simple, with no complexity, purely based around the single minigame of laser tennis. If you're looking for an actual PC Game however, this is not it. Definitely was fun while it lasted though!\n\nTo clarify, I enjoyed this game. For its price, it's an easy purchase. The gameplay, limited as it is, is refined and satisfying (though the Desert Trial section suffers due to the enemy character using keyframe animations rather than physics-based animations). I chose [Not Recommended] because there are games I recommend more highly over this one. Your choice is your own however, so feel free to skip buying a bottle of beer as someone pointed out, and get yourself this little game for some occasional recreation and relaxation if you'd like!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997049604", "last_played": 1490923136, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_forever": 143}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1500256664, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490332", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1501806763, "recommendationid": "33598501", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
