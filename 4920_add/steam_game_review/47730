It does what is expected from an expansion pack, adds a little here and a little there, rehashes everything that was in the original and doesn't add anything new or major. And, like most expansion packs, stand alone or otherwise, it is only worth it for fans of the original as taken by it's own merits, it's not much of a game.\n\nAwakening starts you off short after the end of the original Dragon Age, you can choose to either import one of your old characters or just from scratch. The latter option gives you an Orlesian Grey Warden background which adds plenty of interesting dialog concerning your heritage throughout the game. Importing a character however, yields almost no interesting dialog throughout the game and even in places and with characters that you original play through should have had a profound effect on you will find that nothing changes regardless of your actions in Origins. This leads to a highly disappointing experience for those of us that have actually played the original and like to think our choices actually mattered, if only in terms of storyline.\n\nYour party receives a bit of a shakeup as well, Orghren makes a return as the only one and your other four party members are all newcomers and while they each have a story for you to discover, much like your original team, none of them are particularly interesting. The main storyline in Awakening however, dealing with the Darkspawn, does hold to the usual high Bioware quality even if it's still very much a black and white affair and any notion of murky morality or grey choices only exist in the promotional material, the game itself is mostly Star Wars in those terms.\n\nIn terms of Gameplay Bioware has stayed with what works. The level cap has been raised to 30, two new tiers of equipment has been introduced and a few new skills, such as rune-crafting, are now available to you. The combat plays much as it did in the original with a pseudo-tactical interface that can mostly be ignored except for a few choice fights on the higher difficulties.\n\nAll in all Dragon Age Origins Awakening does what is expected from an expansion pack, it provides more of the same. Big fans of the original will enjoy it while the rest of us will shrug it off and wait for something bigger and better."}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1297207913, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620255", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 7, "recommendationid": "553417", "votes_up": 91, "comment_count": "5", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972088206", "num_reviews": 119, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1297207913, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Just get the Dragon Age: Ultimate Edition.

Creating an expansion to an RPG that is as epic as Dragon Age: Origins was never going to be easy, and it's true that Awakening doesn't have as gripping a story, nor is it as detailed or as in depth. It definitely has the expansion \"feel\" to it, with new features that seem more like they've just been tacked on than anything else. So things aren't off to a great start.\n\nHowever, as you play the game you find yourself getting somewhat emersed in the story, which is still very good despite the lack of depth compared to Origins. The story itself is quite original, and your companions include one of the best character creations i've seen in an RPG to date (I won't giveaway who it is just in case you've still not played this). So while it is much shorter than Origins, it's still a lot of fun and well worth playing if you enjoyed the full campaign.\n\nI do have one complaint, although i suspect this is more my doing than a mistake by Bioware. This adventure isn't particularly challenging and getting through it is fairly straightforward. I suspect that this is at least in part due to me importing my character from the Origins campaign though. Using a new character could well change this point of view... i've just never done that. Where it HAS improved on Origins is that it is now VERY hard to please all of your companions and the chances are at least one of them won't like you much. There are also a few missions that will put you in awkward situations which result in you not being able to do every single mission available... so choose wisely. I like this aspect a lot and is something that Dragon Age II took further (and by all accounts is being taken even further still in Inquisition).\n\nUnfortunately one issue does overshadow the whole game, just as it does with Origins... The game is badly bugged and frequently crashes to desktop completely at random. There isn't much you can do about this, other than save your game FREQUENTLY and hope to god it doesn't crash right after a long fight, long dialogue scene, or worse of all, a long scene that contains both... This is infuriating, and yet i persevere because i am such a fan of the Dragon Age series. This is definitely a game killer for many people so if you have even the slightest feeling that potential instability will ruin the experience for you, don't buy this!\n\nThe final word is the same as i wrote in my review of Dragon Age: Origins.... Namely, don't buy this and Origins seperately, buy the Dragon Age: Ultimate Edition and get both Origins and Awakening together plus all the extra DLC. It not only works out cheaper, but much of the DLC does actually improve the game quite nicely... for once!"}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1334714156, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517288", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "390811", "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970307991", "num_reviews": 71, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1334714156, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Had quite a bit of fun with this, actually, at least for a short while.

The answer is surprisingly \"yes\".\n\nYou'll return with your character, the Hero of Ferelden, or if you sacrificed yourself (don't pretend, I know you couldn't pass up Morigan's deal) you will be given the opportunity to create a new \"Warden Commander\" that will take his/her place. The level cap has been raised, and new powerful abilities are available for every class. Sadly, most of your old friends won't be joining you this time around, and in their place you'll meet a handful of new characters, which range from completely forgetable to moderately interesting.\n\nWhere DA:O launched a tired textbook invasion of the demons that only you can stop, DA:OA sets out to tell a smaller tale, one that is more mystery than adventure. Awakening explores the murkier waters of morality and justice that were only glimpsed in the first outing. And by the time all is said and done, you'll feel as though you've been witness to the start of some world changing events (that still haven't fully come to light as of DA2).\n\nShould you bother playing DA:OA? Probably. This expansion does more to shine some light on the darker corners of the setting than either of the main offerings available so far.
