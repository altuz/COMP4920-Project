I've got an embarassing 990 hours eador, masters of the broken world and this game basically is the stand-alone expansion. \n\nWhat really does it for me in this game is how every unit in your army AND the commander can all level up to level 30 and every single level has a fun choice to make in increasing the units stats. On top of that the amount of completely different units, spells and commanders that you can both control and fight against is staggering, and SOMEHOW they managed to make almost all of them meaningfully different especcially when leveling up.\n\nThis won't be your most balanced or least buggy game ever owned, but for me it certainly is that game that even with flaws gets my unconditional love for eternity. It's just so much FUN.\n\nDo not buy if you're not into strategy games, but if you like games such as Heroes of Might and Magic you owe yourself giving this game a chance.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "steamid": "76561197994675364", "last_played": 1507073256, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 420, "playtime_forever": 3520}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505206668, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505206668, "recommendationid": "34897379", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Well I have put in already a number of hours so my review will be not based on little to no experience.\nAn I would love this game!!\nHOWEVER...i have to say \"I would love to play this game\" \nThe game is full with issues due to which I cant play it right now:\n- Access Violation Error (as it seems this is an issue for ages and has never been really fixed)\n- Random Freezes (mostly in planning/execution phase)\n- Battles stuck and you cant end them even if all enemy is dead (forced reloads)\n- The deeper you are into the shard (more turns gone) the more frequent the crashes get (currently I cant even end one turn anymore)\n\nI have a win10 which people say can be the cause but than I`m asking myself why don`t they say this at the description of the game?\n\nI would love to give this a thumbs up but at this moment I can`t recommend it to anyone as you will be fustrated about the crashes and bug`s.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 961, "steamid": "76561197960404972", "last_played": 1506557306, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_forever": 13589}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505696053, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505300", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505696053, "recommendationid": "35036247", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
