If you enjoy 999, then you'll enjoy Virtue's Last Reward because it is very good sequel that follows in the footsteps of its predecessor thus I'll be focusing my review on 999 for the most part to avoid spoiling anything for Virtue's Last Reward.\n\nIn 999, you play the role of Junpei, a young man forced into playing a game of life and death called the Nonary Game with 8 other participants whereby everyone must solve puzzles and escape from their predicament before the time's up, however not everything is as it seems.\n\n999 is a thriller puzzle \"escape the room\" visual novel where you as the player must solve \"Escape the Room\" style room puzzles whilst piecing together the overarching plot of the game over the course of multiple playthroughs.  \n\nPros\n- Puzzles are fun, they are just hard enough to be interesting and rewarding while not being frustrating.\n- Piecing together the intriguing overarching plot and learning more about various the characters is very enjoyable.\n- One scene in particular near the end was one hell of a rollercoaster that I won't be forgetting any time soon.\n- Fully voiced English VO is very well done and the script/dialogue is well written.\n\nCons\n- Using a Keyboard and Mouse in Virtue's Last Reward is playable but a little awkward, I'm assuming because the game was originally developed for the PSP whereas 999 was developed for the more PC-like (at least in terms of controls) DS.\n\nIf you enjoy intriguing stories, good puzzles and/or unique Japanese games then you can hardly go wrong with Zero Escape: The Nonary Games.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988039425", "last_played": 1504839341, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 485, "playtime_forever": 4360}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505091732, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505091732, "recommendationid": "34874232", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If your still trying to decide if to get this, Get it it is well worth the money i'd even pay more. 10/10 perfect games", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198246834666", "last_played": 1503716766, "num_reviews": 34, "num_games_owned": 78, "playtime_forever": 3560}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504727232, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504727232, "recommendationid": "34782019", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Still a great game.

It does a very similar insane, mind-bending story with no plot holes or improbable moments. It came out after 999 and probably inspired by it, but it addresses a lot of the issues I have with 999's plot.\n\n\nWhat seperates 999 from \"no-one has to die\" is the amazing puzzles. But 999 has an inexplicable urge to give away the anwser at every turn. Sometimes it's the way they present the question. Other times you fail at a puzzle and a hint comes down whether you like it or not, you won't even know it's a hint until it's too late.\n\nThis would all be solved by putting a hint button in the menu, or having a hard mode that disables hints. It's such a simple fix that I'm baffled by its absense. It's like sitting down with a really good book only to have the author come in and spoil everything.\n\nThen there are moments where the game just explains things to you without ever making a puzzle out of it.\n\nNow, I completely understand why they did this. The puzzles in this game can get hard. And some story exposition felt like you needed to be Sherlock Holmes to make the connection. Which is why this made me so much angrier, that I finally found a puzzle game that could stump me, but it was too afraid to do so.\n\nThere's a really good game buried here. And that last puzzle UGH it's soo good! Yet ultimately, I can't recommend a puzzle game that's afraid of letting the player get stuck. That's the whole point of a puzzle!\n\nI'm going to play Virtue's Last Reward next and see if they have fixed the issues above.
