IF you don't care about cockpit/helmet view.\n\nMilestone adds something like 'lock to horizon' effect to cockpit/helmet view. It maybe good for new comer. But it is not realistic. I spand a few days to mod the game. https://youtu.be/TZtd6wqiq7Q Cockpit view should look like this. I removed 'SmorzerCameraComponent' in HELMETCAMRAS.BML/COCKPITCAMRAS.BML. \n\nI played milestone games since SBK09-10. Milestone already made 1st person view right in Ride 1 and Motogp. Why change it in Ride 2??? If that new effect has any good, make it an option. So players can choose.\n\nOther than cockpit/helmet view, Ride 2 is much better than Ride 1.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 543, "steamid": "76561198101960889", "last_played": 1506835394, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 228, "playtime_forever": 4828}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505149545, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496689", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505149545, "recommendationid": "34886649", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
