The game is also heavily instruction and companion based, so free choice is pretty much absent. On the positive side are the good graphics and the gun play, but those do not balance out the negative aspects.\n\nI rate it 6/10 mostly due the lack of pace and rail sections. Only acquire it under heavy discount. Be sure to have some other activity ready during all those interruptions."}]}
