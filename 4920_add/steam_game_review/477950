The music brings me back to the Bit-Era, and the game itself is challenging enough to keep you playing through trial and error, but not too difficult that you throw your keyboard or controller into the air with both hands \"fuck it\"-style. It requires timing and reflexes along with slightly planning out ahead of time, since not all of the level can be seen at once. A bit of sliding on the character kinda throws you off, when you plan to stop, but adds to the frustrating-but-fun factor. All in all, a good game for a minimalist platformer.
