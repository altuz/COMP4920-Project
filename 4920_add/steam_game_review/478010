You have two coloring modes: one with a paintbrush and one with a color pot. In other words, the color pot allows you to paint an area respecting its outline. For the paintbrush, you can choose its size. On the side, you have a cube rotating, showing also the progress of your coloring.\n\nAnd that's all. Once exiting, you're moving suddenly to the next house, whether you're finished or not with your drawing. And you can't go back. Nope, you're forced to follow the alphabet. And once you're back at the letter (after Z, you're back at A), the drawing is different. It's impossible for you to save and come back later or to find again the drawing unless being lucky.\n\nThe only pertinent audio is the letter being pronounced, because not coloring a picture is still rewarded by an \"Excellent\" or an \"Awesome\". The description of the game is confusing with Basic English prononciation. So don't expect the words to be spoken.\n\nDespite the great idea to associate a word to its picture, the rest is just so frustrating that I largerly prefer [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/411870/]Discovering Colors - Animals[/url], even with its major default of not having any word. At least, you can come back when you want to the game, you have a little animation, three modes and a better presentation.\n\nEven the cute music or the 3D house and village aren't saving this software of a thumb down. Avoid this, even with a discount. And while I'm an adult, I can see the disappointement for kids that have to interrupt their coloring and can't resume it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "last_played": 1494069075, "num_reviews": 352, "num_games_owned": 2214, "playtime_forever": 139}, "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_created": 1467210372, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542946", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1467210756, "recommendationid": "23926018", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ok the only reason why one would buy this, is so that one could draw all the things that they are not supposed to draw on the stencils since they don't befit such a thing (for example giant anatomy, moustaches on all the animals and just go rainbow nuts). Problem is the prog is useless as a form of meaningful expression for both adult and child unless your child is inbred and been hit in the head one too many times.\n\nThe premise is that you go through a town one hut at a time which contains a letter, when you click on the door a stencil for you to color in appears which corresponds with the letter on the door. For instance 'A is for Apple' and you get to color in a apple. The tools you get are a paintbrush, a pallete of a dozen colours or so and a paint tin which fills in the whole area for you with the color you choose. If you do or dont colour it in, does not matter as it will say 'good job' and then move onto the next hut which has a 'b for bee' etc. \n\nOnce you have gone through the whole alaphabet it starts again with another word that starts with the letter A and so on. Don't worry it doesn't get too complicated the words are always easy. Its not like you come across a hut which gives you a complicated term like 'A is for Antichrist'. \n\nThe accompanying music is so bad that your child will probably be forced to find where you hide that locked away gun in the house and blow away 'S for speakers'. 'P for Police' will soon surround your house and then you will have to 'H for hide' from the law.\n\nThis 'T for Turd' is done by these mexican developers... http://www.ensenasoft.com/index.html\n\nSorry I tried to get into this as can be seen here... http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198112866114/screenshot/275100415617890871\n\nbut the only thing I have bothered to colour is my review.

I consider it a better artist outlet than it is a vocabulary builder- but I'm not 6 so maybe it is. But if you want a software means to build a bit of creativity, then use the free-brush tool and let them do what they do.\n\nTl;dr - for 1$ on sale, it's just 'sort of worth it', NOT really though. As a creative outlet for kids or a game you can stream and be funny (just DON'T save those pictures! see below). It's alright. For full price? Wouldn't advise.\n\nEdit: just remembered, you don't walk around. The camera moves from letter to letter automatically. It stops a couple of times crossing the river to see the water- but carries on. I did think you walked from letter to letter - which, I guess wouldn't be optimal for kids and would require more physics work and all - but I really wanted an emotional walk around, you know?\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=717102945\n\nAlso I got banned from this PRESTIGIOUS AND POPULAR game's community page because I replied to a joke question thread with a joke answer. The developer is the kind of guy who doesn't understand jokes, blocks and reports you. I mean, that just turns a recommend into a no-go! :C\n\nFrankly, the team behind this game doesn't seem to allow the community to express themselves through the medium of art; and they report and ban pictures that they don't like.
