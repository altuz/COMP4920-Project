I popped in the disc and started up a new character.  Very simple character creation. You choose your gender, race, class, and origin story: a feature I had never seen. Six different starts, each with different characters, equipment, and interactions that influence the story throughout the game. So, I being a young teenager at the time, I started up a Male Human Warrior, who I wanted to put in the biggest armor I could find. After the opening cutscene and following conversation, I wandered around an amazing castle with so many things going on. After a while of talking and learning the controls, I finally made it to the first combat sequence: Giant rats. Very overused, but effective at introducing fighting. As a warrior, I just sat there, swinging my sword and taking hits from tiny rodents. No real chance to use my abilities, but I knew I would fight again. Oh boy, was I right. After more walking and talking and a brief cutscene, the castle and my character are attacked. So I fight my way through with some companions and finish up the origin story within 30 minutes.\n\nI repeated this process with a wide variation of genders, races, and classes until I had gone through all of the origin stories. I did not feel any repetition or unnecessary dialouge and combat. Even now, many years later, I love going through the story from the beginning and experiencing the rich story that is only one part of a massive world full of lore.\n\nI know this game came out years ago, but it still has a place in my top 5 games of all time. People who enjoy a good story and a fun, but more tactical combat system should definitly look into this game."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504862853, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508138", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34810791", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198002728071", "num_reviews": 29, "last_played": 1504859480, "num_games_owned": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 12610}, "timestamp_updated": 1504862853, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition must be considered one of the best games in gaming history;\n\n- Gameplay: 10/10\n- Soundtrack: 10/10\n- Story [Driven by your choices]: 10/10\n- Oghren's Lines :D : 10/10\n- Decent Graphics\n\nThe above verdict states for the Origins and for the Awakenings as well."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505100352, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34875957", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198255979749", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1502031101, "num_games_owned": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2115}, "timestamp_updated": 1505100352, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I'm halfway through my first play through, and while this game is older, it is by far one of the best games I have ever played.

I played on the ps3 for the first several years ago not completing it i really enjoyed the game. So when the Ulitmate edition was on sale for $7.99 awhile back I got it beat the game and kept playing on and off since I had run into some problems with steam taking too much memory ( I wonder why ) would uninstall the game and even steam to figure stuff out. Now that I have this game has been a great treat to play now even more since I got mods ( the good ones ) for it and I found out that skill bar at the bottom could be expanded by grabing with the mouse and pulling to the right. Made the game so much more fun that I could have more than 9 slots filled with skills ( max is about 20 ) was so much fun. The romacing makes so fun but it is so stupid the ninjamancing that happends needs mod to fix a long with other mods for fixing other things but still worth it vanilia. Story is great and fun too go through and in some cases your gender will affect how much background stuff you get but that is also affected by race and origin start. So make as many playthroughs as possible you will not regret it"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505506206, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34980317", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198031256739", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1410463263, "num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 15294}, "timestamp_updated": 1505506206, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I hold this in higher regard than DA2 or Inquisition, which will probably remain true even after the 4th installment launches. It's a cult title IMHO and deserves at least one full play through. I'm not sure whether it holds up to this day in terms of visuals, then again I'm sure that's not why you might want to own and play it. Combat is not as fluid as the 2nd DA so keep that in mind, personally I had no issues with that. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Can't say much without spoiling so there you have it, my humble review. Seriously, give this one a shot even if you hated every other DA(I know I did). It is its own thing. Do have reasonable expectations when it comes to how open the world is ETC, it's of a certain age at this point. No pun intended. Just focus on the story and the characters.
