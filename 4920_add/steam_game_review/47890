That's probably what it's worth.\n\nOn new hardware you will need to do a bit of work to get it running properly and even then the performance will progressively lag as the in-game world accumulates clutter, needing further modding to get optimal functionality.\n\nOn top of that the game is still by default priced stupidly high, likely to put people off of buying it in favour of the similarly priced Sims 4?? I don't know.\n\nThe gameplay, as the Sim's careers progress and they go from broke to stinking filthy rich is probably the best the series has produced, although The Sims 4's ability to have Sims multi-task is something I already find a glaring set-back.\n\nThe building construction is the series' best, and has had its functionality stripped back considerably for 4. Although if you've tried 4, and then move on to 3, it will look old.\n\n4's isolated lots replacing the open world also results in a much more stable game that is able to handle many more sims in the same space at a time without performance issues.\n\nThe Sims 3 is the series' high point, but no one should ever pay the price they're currently charging. Given its overall performance and the constantly increasing content via its many updates, I'd probably recommend 4 at this point unless you can get 3 for cheap. Then again, The Sims 4 is also grossly over-priced, so maybe go and spend the money on an indie game and save EA Maxis their smug satisfaction.\n\nAnd now I've said that...
