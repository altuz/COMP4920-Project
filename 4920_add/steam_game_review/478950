If you can't get past the tutorial, just remember to press down on your thumbsticks whilst pressing the grab button to reload.  Press A or B (or X or Y) to bring up the rifle.  You have to bring your hands together to reload the rifle, it's very wonky so you may want to press grab too while you do that.  Trigger is the fire button.  To grab the barrels, you just press the grab button while clicking down on your joystick then swing and let go.  Using the focus ability I think is just pressing down by itself or grab.  To set stail you have to put your hand on the sail and then press down on the joystick and then just physically take your arms down.  To get to the shop I believe you simply press the trigger button when you don't have a gun.  \n\nAnyways, yeah the controls are wonky for the Oculus Rift but this game is fun.  It's like a wave shooter on the high seas, defending your ship against invading pirates with quick aim and by dodging.  I don't think it's worth $9.99, but I definitely recommend it at a 50% sale or higher (I think I paid .99 cents if I recall correctly).\n\nRate 6/10 buy on sale Arrghhh like a true pirate, never pay full price", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1505634244, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505635786, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505635821, "recommendationid": "35017324", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
