Also, it'd be nice if during resolution of tests or combat that you don't know what happens if you pass or fail until you confirm if you've succeeded or failed.

The included scenarios are fun, though the difficulty seems a little high for 2 players in combat heavy scenerios.\n\nI do have some criticisms however. The app largely fails to take advantage of its digital nature; it doesn't make the most of the things it could do that a purely physical game coudn't. Compared to the Xcom boardgame app, there is no tutorial, no rulebook included in the app, and no handy links to a digital rules reference while playing. \n\nThe most clunky aspect of the design is that, essentially, the rules you have to learn are spread accross the instructions from the app and the rulebook, meaning that a new player must refer back and forth between them while playing. This is something Xcom avoids; everything you need to know is in the app and by design you learn as you play.\n\nAdditionally, the Xcom app is explicit about what you must do to resolve everything; with links to the relevent section in the digital rules reference. MoM's app on the other hand, often gives you instructions that you can only follow after a careful reading of the rulebook.\n\nEdit: Steam cloud sync for your save data is not enabled. Why? Had to manually copy a save over.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992593632", "last_played": 1499567406, "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 176, "playtime_forever": 2964}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485836424, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485836880, "recommendationid": "29598128", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "PROS: \n\nExcellent update for this game that really improves upon the first edition and allows it to realize its potential. \n\nSome of my best tabletop gaming experineces were with the First Edition, but those great experiences were outnumbered by the times that the scenarios did not work, were glitchy, or we were destroyed by the all-powerful keeper. \n\nPlaying the second edition with the same group of friends is a far better experience. The app streamlines the set-up and mythos phases so that they work a lot better and makes the game flow so much quicker. Scenarios are well designed and challenging and the tweaking of rules with regard to dice rolling, spells, and character abilities really help the game as well. \n\nWe have played The Cycle of Eternity and Escape from Innsmouth three times each. We have also played through Vengeful Impulses and Silverwood Manor once each. There has been good variation on all of our repeated playthroughs which adds greatly to the game. \n\nIf you had the first expansion you can re-use all those components as well as the componets from the expansion - this gives you more variety. \n\nDo not need a large group to play as the app takes over the role of the keeper. My partner and I can play this by ourselves or we can get a large group together and play. The game scales difficulty depending on the amount of players. \n\nCONS: \n\nThe game is expensive but is worth it. There are some DLC scenarios being released (five bucks Canadian I think) so that will extend the replayability factor. Additionally, the included scenarios are great. If you can afford it on your own -  or can afford to split it with a partner or as a gaming group then it's a no brainer. My partner and I split the cost and it has been so worth it. \n\nMiniatures are kind of blah but if you paint them they look pretty sharp. We are about halfway through painting ours. It really helps the look of the game. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067653443", "last_played": 1504393335, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 1644}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487655516, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487655516, "recommendationid": "30072793", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
