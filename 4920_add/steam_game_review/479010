This is Early Access, so I accept the UI hiccups I encounter. I would like to be able to reliably save from anywhere, anytime. The sculpting and surface painting tools are excellent. I am not a trained artist, but the addition and subtraction of material possible with this tool makes me feel like one. I was looking for something to help me express my VR ideas to others.
