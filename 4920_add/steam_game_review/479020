I and many others loved it. They didn't always have the fastest progess, but it was an enjoyable game. I shared a lot of good times with friends over that game. \n\nUnfortunately, our fun ended with about half the features we wanted and about 75% of the ones the devs wanted. No explanation was given for dropping it, well, no good one. \n\nHistory repeats itself with this game. Only the backing by the fans isn't really there. So the progress isn't there either. \n\nBuyer beware, they will probably drop this one as well.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198014874521", "last_played": 1483201802, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 1420, "playtime_forever": 252}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505141546, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504078", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505141546, "recommendationid": "34884232", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
