I really tried to enjoy it. But, well, I guess it's too much. I liked music, a lot of visual elements that were borrowed from Portal series.\n\nFirst issue I had with it -- mechanics offer some interesting ideas, whole gameplay is somehow alike Portal, Grappling Hook (small portal-like indie game, it's pretty much alike it in visual style as well) and Antichamber. I don't have anything against core gameplay and mechanics, but level design is just... ugh. It feels like levels were built not around mechanics, but more around unexpected \"tricks\", so it feels more like bug abuse.\n\nAltho, it's not the main problem. The game is still great and I'd like to say that it's around 7.5/10, but it's unplayable. I've completed around 10 levels out of 12-16 (can't remember actual numbers, but the idea is that I was close to the end) and on every level (except the first one) I've had an issue in every room. Starting from lost blocks, inability to get them in my \"gun\", \"flying\" around and not dying to water and ending with dead black screen. The reason why I abandoned this game is pretty sad: I ended up with black screen every time I started my last level. I tried it on another machine and it seems like these issues aren't exclusive to my configuration. I'd not recommend to buy and play it right now, but I hope that these issues will be fixed soon.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040037065", "last_played": 1504548850, "num_reviews": 58, "num_games_owned": 549, "playtime_forever": 77}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504549821, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504549821, "recommendationid": "34741107", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A rubbish puzzle game, the concept is great, the execution is extremely poor. The controls are very bad and unintuitive with something like 3 button presses just to place some blocks, there is nowhere in the game that tells you what controls are outside of the brief tutorial introducing them and they cannot be rebound. There are also multiple bugs such as visual glitches and block dispensers not working requiring you to suicide. What is a deal killer for me is that some of the puzzles require jumps that are extremely tricky to executy even after you have correctly placed the blocks, I want to play a puzzle game, not a platformer!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006217347", "last_played": 1500907188, "num_reviews": 57, "num_games_owned": 766, "playtime_forever": 102}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500907567, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499777", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500907567, "recommendationid": "33767456", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
