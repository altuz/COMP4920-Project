It took me 20hrs (with 13hrs ingame, no idea what happened to the 7hrs difference) to finish. Most, if not all, of the bugs have been squashed by now. I played it with a controller and it worked fine, no need to remap the buttons. The keyboard layout made playing a bit weird but possible. If you have a controller, use it. If not, you can try to change the configuration with F1. And that reminds me. If you're new to RPGMaker games, don't press F12. It'll reset the game. \n\nThe maps varies from small to big but they are all nicely detailed. The exits can be hard to find though there are clues (like footprints and obvious openings). \nThere are a few secrets like easter eggs, chests and hidden areas to find. Pay attention to what NPCs says and what you see or read (although there are red herrings). There are sidequests, magic, a crafting system, a fast travel system (it's very much needed) and enemies that gets harder to kill the further you get in the game. Just keep levelling up and you'll be fine. \nThere are no handholding in this game. You start in an area, pick up items and info and then travel to the next area. Sometimes you need to backtrack in order to finish a sidequest or find that chest you needed to leave for later.\n\nThe only thing I didn't actually really like, was the story. It started out good and mostly stayed there throughout the game. By story, I think I mean the plot since there were no scenes besides those that pointed me towards the next area. That's ok, though. It didn't feel lacking. However, I feel the end was missing an answer or two. I won't spoil it, though. Perhaps the answers will be in a sequel?

I'm a fan of indie games, and it was cheap, so why not? Not a bad decision, in my opinion\u2014though I\u2019m not very far, yet.\n\nI think that to call it a Legend-of-Zelda-esque game is a bit misleading. It seems, to me, to be more of a mix of Final Fantasy and Zelda. The combat is very reminiscent of Zelda games (same attacking style, get money and items for killing monsters, can definitely get messed up if you go too far too fast, very little guidance for your quest, etc.), but I feel that other aspects of the game (the menu, the equips, the graphics, and the adventure itself) are far closer to the older, handheld Final Fantasy games, like FFIII for the GBA (Or FFVII for the SNES for people who follow Japanese release titles). It makes for a very fun combination when playing.\n\nRegardless of which well-known titles it is like, it is a fun play, and engaging enough that I\u2019ll definitely be heading back to play some more before too long, and I definitely recommend it for people who read this review. I'll be nudging my my family members to buy and download this game. The music is catchy and fits the areas you\u2019re in, the game play is fun, and it\u2019s always satisfying to smack things until you get that sweet, sweet level up sound/animation! The characters are very simple, but that simply adds to the reminiscent charm of older games, and it\u2019s nice to see some attitude from the NPCs.\n\nWith that said, there are a few quirks I\u2019d like to point out. As I mentioned earlier, there is very little guidance within the game. For people like me, who\u2019ve been gamming their entire lives and have a certain level of scorn for manuals (born from being an impatient child who wanted to smack things sooner, rather than later), this wasn\u2019t a problem: I just hit buttons until I found what I wanted, and carried on (who needs a booklet\u2019s help to be am RPG hero?). That method of gaming might not work for some, however. There is no in-game tutorial on how to use your weapon, shield, or items aside from being directed to a file that comes with the game on what the default key-bindings are. A few, very brief tutorial windows will pop up here and there for how to open your menu and a couple other basic things, but that\u2019s it. In relation to that, you\u2019ll need to do some searching for your quest progression, whether that be collecting stuff, or talking to some person; there is very little hand holding here (which I love). Also, you cannot name your character, which was a little disappointing, but oh, well. Another minor problem is that the music doesn't loop very well.\n\nFor the creator, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re still updating/working on this game, but I have a few suggestions I\u2019d like to make (I apologize is this seems pushy to you, and you definitely do not need to take any heed of me.):\n\nOne: Adding in a prompt right off the bat about where to find the controls, or even having it as a menu option on the title screen or in the menu in-game. might not be a bad plan.\n\nTwo: Making the default controls a little more ergonomic/conveniently placed would definitely be a plus. It\u2019s fairly hard to hit the buttons I want with how they are set up. \u201cA\u201d being the sprint button, while \u201cZ\u201d is the shield makes for a strange yoga session for my fingers, and I keep accidentally using my items. I haven\u2019t looked into re-binding the buttons, if that\u2019s even a thing I can do (I\u2019m not quite sure where in the files the controls file is), so this may not be much of a problem, yet. Also, a quick Quest Log and a quick save button would be nice, which, again, might already be things that I simply need to find.\n\nThree: Make the characters name-able! Their default/recommended/canonical names can be the same/be filled in already, but the option to name your main character is a simple, but huge bonus, in my opinion. There's a certain sense of attachment and involvement when a character you've named and leveled up kicks butt that I feel just isn't there when you're simply given a name to live with.\n\nAlso, I hit F12 by accident which took me to the windowed/fullscreen option, and it took me back to the title screen! Is that supposed to happen, or is it a bug?\n\nAnd I guess that\u2019s it for my long-winded review.

What is unique is that the player and wield different accessories which will interact with the game environment in unique ways. For example, if the player wields a \"Hook and Chain\" he can swing across chasms. If he wields a Bow, he can activate switches that are far away by shooting. If he uses a large hammer, the he can smash Boulders blocking the game enviroment, so they can get to various unreachable paths. As a result, once you get a new accessories, you might have to go back to earlier maps because the new accessories will open up new game pathways. This make the gameplay really different.\n\nFurthermore there are a lot of unique game bosses, each of which require radically different strategies. There are also a lot of different and innovative puzzles that the user have to solve in order to reach each of these game bosses.
