Once that's taken care of, you're treated to a racing simulator that has some arcade feeling. There's a good selection of tracks, cars and performance tuning. I liked the new helmet cam, night racing and the menu soundtrack. During the races, i just sticked to the car sounds. The carrer mode is divided by categories, and it's varied enough. The game is hard, sometimes even on easy, but it depends on the settings and your racing experience. There's also some bonus objectives, although they're always the same. The XP system is almost pointless, because you progress very quickly in it. The racing mechanics are good after tweaking, but collisions with other cars is a mess. I also didn't enjoyed drifting too much. But overall, i had a good experience with this game, even if i didn't touch the online features. Plus, it's cheap on sale."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503217724, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34368322", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198136185122", "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 1506725458, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 77, "playtime_forever": 1354}, "timestamp_updated": 1503217724, "received_for_free": false, "review": "one of the most realistic racing games in my opinion but i wish the AI were better ;("}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502120150, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492683", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34084031", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198130745334", "num_reviews": 31, "last_played": 1435541112, "num_games_owned": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 165}, "timestamp_updated": 1502120150, "received_for_free": false, "review": "hella ass"}, {"votes_down": 19, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500977311, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479470", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 43, "recommendationid": "33783424", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198010366377", "num_reviews": 73, "last_played": 1471870520, "num_games_owned": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 19}, "timestamp_updated": 1500977311, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The correct pronounciation for this game is SHIFT with a silent F."}, {"votes_down": 37, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500004782, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436305", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "33527795", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198162373446", "num_reviews": 54, "last_played": 1499675548, "num_games_owned": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 15}, "timestamp_updated": 1500004782, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Bad"}]}
