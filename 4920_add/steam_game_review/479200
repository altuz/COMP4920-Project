The magic is good, the particles and sounds on the moves looks great. The minnion summon looks good. The game is just missing the meat to go with the potatos, you just get dropped in and there is no story or anything. Once that gets put in it will feel like a good adventure similar to Half Life, Turok etc.\n  \n[h1]Pros[/h1] \n[list]  \n[*]Runs very smooth.\n[*]Pretty models and particles.\n[*]Good AI interaction/Moves etc.\n [/list] \n \n[h1]Cons[/h1] \n [list]  \n[*]No story.\n[*]No map interaction.\n [/list] \n  \n[h1]My Opinion[/h1]  \n[b]Its entertaining for a few minutes. There is no passion to continue as there is no story laid out at the start. The enemy Ai is interesting so its fun to kill them. Once there is a story and some things to interact with on the map. Its interesting just not ready yet.[/b]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198016485091", "last_played": 1503858246, "num_reviews": 57, "num_games_owned": 306, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1503860957, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504156690, "recommendationid": "34536829", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
