While to those just giving this game a quick glance this may seem to be an unfounded assumption, just give me some time and you too will notice the prevalent pro-communism roots. Basic gameplay consists of the player controlling not one, but two rabbits. Moving one will cause the other to move in the opposite direction. Your goal for each of the increasingly complex levels is to collect each and every carrot on the screen, before reporting to your supervisor, a lazy and rotund pig, who you chuck out of the stage shortly before making love to one another. That is really the basic extent of the game, though everything I've mentioned, when seen in a different light, becomes one huge red flag. For example, you undergo strenuous labor collecting what every rabbit desires, carrots, though you yourself are not allowed a share, despite you and your soulmate clearly doing all of the work. Going a step further, let's revisit your supervisor. A comedically fat, mean, and beyond lazy literal pig who is clearly exploiting you. Now if this isn't the most overdone caricature of a capitalist that I've ever seen, then I truly don't know what is. The rabbits in question are depicted as sad, slender, overworked souls driven by their lust for each other as well as the pursuit of a better tomorrow. They themselves have experienced the dehumanizing aspects of capitalism in their daily lives and desire change in the most radical form, violent revolution. As in any revolution, no one man or woman may accomplish anything on their own, but rather working side by side with a surplus of comrades. The unification of the black male rabbit and the brown female rabbit represent how no amount of injustice will suppress the voices of the many when all races and both genders unite for a common goal. However, capitalism in this day and age has reached a point where it is the expected norm, and any one attempt of changing that would likely go unsuccessful. This is seen by the pig always coming back even after being overthrown each level; capitalists are slimy and will stop at nothing to continue to hurt the working class, demanding \"I NEED MORE FOOD\" after each level, throwing his workers through even more dangerous labyrinths for personal gain. This does not stop the willpower of the rabbits however, as they will push on because they know the power of the majority will eventually emerge in triumph over the elite few. The main menu screen, with the large word, \"Cutties\", may appear to be a simple typo or bad translation, this has existed for many months, and I suspect something sinister may be behind this, perhaps even a call to action for kids to use their acquired skills in the real world, sickle in hand and their hatred for the upper class in the other.\n\nEDIT: I have found one last tidbit, perhaps the most revealing of them all. A true bombshell, certain to convert anyone who still isn't quite convinced of this game being communist propaganda. This game is published by \"Atriagames\", which according to their official Twitter page as well as the fact they often use Russian on official sites (and even have published \"Russian Car Driver\"), is based out of Russia. Their cleverness was enough to get greenlit by Steam, but I will not allow it to pass through me, and I hope others feel the same. Do not buy this game, who knows what the communist blood money will go to?", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198136153258", "last_played": 1498505163, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_forever": 86}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1498234593, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498708", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1499879469, "recommendationid": "32687739", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
