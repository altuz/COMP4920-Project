Whenever you are in a town, you are able to visit the Tavern for quests. Getting furniture for the inn to make your character stronger by placing them, Spending your points and level up by resting. You are able to do main quests or sub quests, You can only activate 1 quest at a time. You can sell useless collection goods to the trader to gain some gold, which you could spend on decoration for the inn or buying consumables.\n\nWhenever you are in the dungeon, your screen will be in first person and you are able to open the inventory menu with the I key button. You are able to cast spells, Melee, block or interact with things. Magic spells, shield bashes or some other things may need to charge up before you are able to strike. Melee weapons like a sword doesn't have a charge up meter. Enemies has a health bar and a \"detection\" indicator. They will keep following you if they are able to see you. However if they lost track of you, Their interest in you is lost aswell. By using different ways of attack style against an enemy, you may unlock their weakness or resistances.\n\nDecent soundtrack but quite repetitive and doesn't have alot of variety.\nSmall hints.\nYou have a stamina meter.\nGame is alright, but sometimes it feels pretty empty or stale.\nThe slow progression (due animations mostly) could really kill the momentums or the reason to keep you playing this game\nSimplistic game.\nBad optimized, Even if you a strong pc, you could get lagg in big rooms with alot of enemies.\nSometimes an enemy is still able to do a strike when they are death. Which could kill you.\nEnemies has a health bar with the X ammount of health shown.\nEnemies has a detection indicator, So you will know if they have spotted you.\nAnimations in this game on both sides are slow.\nEnemies weakness and resistances can be unlocked and revealed by different attack styles.\n\n[h1]Other things.[/h1]\n\nRotating around the monster and giving him a hit whenever his attack misses seems to be effective way to kill an enemy without too much trouble.\nArchers are a joke in this game. Their projectile is extremely slow and their animation aswell. Quickly go behind them and finish them off and you will be like \"well this is easy\".\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 6/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 286, "steamid": "76561198041949592", "last_played": 1506612089, "num_reviews": 482, "num_games_owned": 1112, "playtime_forever": 286}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506604322, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506607820, "recommendationid": "35261589", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
