It has heros, units with heavy/light position but gameplay is completely different\n\nto previous RTS games. \n\n\nI wonder that why there is no sequel of this game, perhaps because it is such a minor title I suppose? \n\nAnd game play might feel boring for people who are used to more fast paced games.\n\nBut it is still modest title and fun to play.\n"}]}
