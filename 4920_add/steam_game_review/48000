I'd give it a 'meh' if steam allowed. Don't get it for the full price, as it's not worth the money nowadays - there are better experiences you can get for $10.\n\nIssues with the game:\n- everything is dark, to an annoying level. Dark is the cheapest way of making atmospheric games with no atmosphere and it rarely works. While the early levels are readable enough, some choices in the later game hurt your ability to know what's going on.\n- It's basically a kaizo troll level. You're not puzzling too much, mostly the devs just kill you in ways you can't expect. The genre is trial and error. There are some nice puzzles here and there, but you'll spend most of your time dying to bullshit. The balance is ok in most places to not be too frustrating.\n- While not too frustrating the game just isn't that much fun. I'm sure I won't revisit it.\n- The controls are wonky and annoying, yet some puzzles require really precise inputs.\n- Less story than in super meatboy. Literally no story. Unless you buy into fan theories. Not a problem for me, but some people want a story.\n- everything is slow, yet the devs force you to repeat sections by killing you in ways you can't predict.\n\nThere are some good things in it obviously, overall a decent effort. Nothing is seriously broken or stupid (except the secret level). Some nice ideas here and there (particularly liked the brain slug). Experienced no issues playing linux version which is always great. The length of the game (about 3 hours) is spot on, it gets tedious towards the end.\n\nIf you're a completionist you're not going to have a great time, as the final challenge is to complete the game with less than 5 deaths. I don't think the game has enough replay value to justify the amount of playtime and memorization this would require.\n\nOverall if you feel you might like it (based on the screenshots) it's worth $2.50. If you haven't played other indie staples like braid, go spend your money there - you'll get much better value."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506351835, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35204526", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198196311543", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1474284346, "num_games_owned": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 389}, "timestamp_updated": 1506351835, "received_for_free": false, "review": "when you completed 76% of the puzzles game but ending up got my saves corrupted and back to the beginning"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505309117, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502242", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34919490", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198026724823", "num_reviews": 41, "last_played": 1505308737, "num_games_owned": 602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 166}, "timestamp_updated": 1505309574, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I played this on Xbox originally when it first came out and fell in love with Playdead all those years ago.
