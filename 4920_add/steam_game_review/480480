The pixel graphics and music are enjoyable, and the upgrade system (more health, stamina, speed, bleed damage, etc...) adds some variety to the gameplay. The game is a bit simplistic (which I don't mind) but the reason I don't recommend it is the limited mouse controls are annoyingly / unreliably implemented. Gameplay consists of you clicking / holding LMB to move your character around the screen toward the cursor as you dodge enemies while they constantly swarm you, with RMB being your attack / dash move (with the default character) to dispatch them or create some space between you. This is all well and good but there are often moments when your character will just not perform his RMB dash attack to evade the enemies. He just stands there with his dick in his hand and gets hit (or worse killed) by the enemies. This is caused because you have to fully release LMB, click RMB briefly to dash/attack then click / hold LMB again to begin moving once again. Due to the resolution and way you move your character by having him move toward the cursor, it feels like you have very little room to move once the enemies begin to fill the screen or will often accidentally dash slightly too far into an enemy and die. The holding of LMB to releasing to briefly press RMB rather than being able to just press RMB while holding LMB kills a lot of the fluidity of the game and feels inaccurate and unreliable. The game's title alludes to this being intrinsic to the gameplay, that you have to \"Slash or Die\" to make space to move around, but when the Slashing is so inconsistent your deaths are often frustrating. I suppose I could play more to \"git gud\" and learn its rhythms/hitboxes more, but I've found it to mostly just be a frustrating, idle distraction of a game with a poor interface.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "last_played": 1499990218, "num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 800, "playtime_forever": 33}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1499990857, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514190", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1499996612, "recommendationid": "33524744", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
