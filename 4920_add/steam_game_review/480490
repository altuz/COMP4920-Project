The player controls Morgan Yu, a scientist working on the space station Talos 1, in orbit of Earth\u2019s moon. Obviously the science experiments go wrong (don\u2019t they always?), and the station is overrun by aliens.\n\nThe aliens have an interesting visual design, and there\u2019s a good variety of them to fight against. Mimics are knee high spiders that like to disguise themselves as other objects such as chairs, coffee mugs or oxygen canisters, waiting to pounce on unsuspecting victims. They add an element of paranoia, because any object that you would normally ignore in other games, could be a threat [spoiler]at least until you find a device that lets you detect hidden Mimics, which in my opinion, ruined the best part of the early game[/spoiler]. Phantoms are Humanoid in shape and can attack at range using psionic energy, electricity or fire. Telepaths and Technopaths are large, floating creatures that can mind control Humans and turrets respectively. Cystoids are small blobs that explode when you get close. Plus there\u2019s a few others that I don\u2019t want to spoil.\n\nUnfortunately the weapons are a bit disappointing. Most of them feel weak (even after upgrading their damage) or are primarily designed for non-combat purposes. For example there\u2019s a glue gun that you can use to temporarily trap an alien, and then switch to another gun to actually kill it. You can also create makeshift platforms out of glue, to help you reach high ledges. There\u2019s a crossbow whose bolts do no damage, which is intended to press switches from distance (less useful than it sounds). You can use it to safely explode cystoids, but its otherwise useless in combat. Meanwhile, there\u2019s no equivalent of a rapid fire assault rifle or a long range sniper rifle. In most shooters, the basic shotgun is something that I\u2019ll only use when I\u2019ve run out of ammo for the better guns. In Prey, the basic shotgun IS the best gun.\n\nIts possible to learn some of the aliens\u2019 abilities, and use them against the aliens during combat. You do this by scanning living aliens to gather information, and then installing \u201cneuromods\u201d. I actually chose not to do this for a couple of reasons. If the station\u2019s automated turrets detect alien DNA, they\u2019ll view you as a threat, and I wondered if staying pure Human would affect the story (I\u2019m not confirming or denying that here). Combat might be more enjoyable if you use alien abilities, I\u2019m definitely going to try them when I do a second playthrough, but I can\u2019t really comment on them in this review.\n\nInstead, I chose to use all my neuromods to upgrade my Human abilities. I was able to repair and upgrade turrets, and use them to kill a bunch of aliens for me. The really cool thing about the turrets is you can pick them up and move them to wherever you need them. I maxed out my hacking skills so that I could open any door and access any computer. The hacking minigame, where you guide a disk through a 2d maze, is more enjoyable than most minigames. I also upgraded my health, stamina, inventory space and stealth skills.\n\nThe story is fairly generic, but there are multiple endings based on the decisions you make in several optional side quests. Its up to you to decide how much of a hero you want to be. Voice acting is mostly good, especially Morgan\u2019s brother Alex, played by Benedict Wong (Netflix\u2019s Marco Polo). One negative point however, is that Prey has several occasions where NPCs talk over comms during combat, which always annoys me because I can\u2019t concentrate properly on what is being said while I\u2019m busy trying to not die.\n\nLevel design is fantastic. Its mostly indoor, but non linear. There\u2019s usually more than one way to reach your objective, and lots of side rooms that you\u2019re encouraged to search for loot. You can use special machines to recycle unwanted junk, and then use the base materials to craft items like ammo, medkits and neuromods.\n\nIt took me 22 hours to finish the story, and I didn\u2019t suffer any bugs or crashes. Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard. I was able to get a constant 60 fps with most settings maxed at 1080p (i7 6700K @ 4Ghz, 16GB ram, GTX 1080 8GB vram).\n\nOverall Prey is a very good game. Its greatest strength is that it allows the player to have freedom of choice, which affects both your playing style, and the story. There are similarities to games like Bioshock, Deus Ex and Dishonored, so if you\u2019re a fan of those kind of games, you should definitely considering playing Prey. There\u2019s enough content to justify a high purchase price.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1292, "steamid": "76561197969417125", "last_played": 1506592587, "num_reviews": 169, "num_games_owned": 251, "playtime_forever": 1292}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1506635769, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516948", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506635769, "recommendationid": "35274085", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Do the youngsters these days even know what System Shock 2 is and how incredibly ahead of its time it was? Almost two decades later we finally get a game that comes very close to it, but how close exactly? Let's examine, shall we? Beware: mild spoilers ahead.\n\nSystem Shock 2 is an incredibly complex game and yet highly approachable. It\u2019s impossible to talk about this one in detail without bringing its \u201cspiritual successor\u201d to the table, which is of course the unfortunately much more successful Bioshock. I will argue that Bioshock doesn\u2019t even come close and that the true spiritual successor is actually the main topic of this review.\n\nBioshock to System Shock 2 is like a lobotomized deformed brother with a down syndrome. Whereas Bioshock is definitely dumbed down, Prey is modernized and simplified. So if we build a similar analogy here: Prey to System Shock 2 is like your good-looking suave psychopath of a brother. Why such a precise description? Well, that\u2019s the main point of the game of course! The old pushing the fat guy trolley problem. In the lieu of Silent Hill 2 the game closely observes you during the entirety of your stay on Talos I. What will you do? Will you push the fat guy? Will you jump yourself?\n\nWhen it comes to the story, many parts of it are simply brilliant. What makes us who we are? If you get your brain rewired, are you still the same person? The answer to that question is of course no, yet it\u2019s something that the smarter of us only now begin to realize. However, no matter how unambiguous the answer to a big question like that, it still needs to be illustrated and Prey does so beautifully.\n\nUnfortunately not all is rosy in this Typhon infested kingdom of ours. As many a good idea Prey has; it also dwells into the quantum mechanical woo that would make even Deepak Chopra and his tirades about entanglement and \u201ccon-scious-ness\u201d blush. Fortunately not nearly on the same catastrophic levels as Bioshock Infinite, which gives even the original a run for its money in how stupid it was. There\u2019s also a problem of having no identifiable villain. Apex doesn\u2019t count, it\u2019s a formless mass of evil nobody should care for. Heck, we don\u2019t even get to fight it properly. Even Fontaine was a more compelling presence than this, let alone Shodan who I still consider to be the greatest video game villain of all time. However, I would say that on the whole, the story in Prey is better than that of System Shock 2 and that there should be some kind of an award for a game that doesn\u2019t phone in multiple endings, where every one of these feels meaningful.\n\nSo why am I saying this is the true spiritual successor? Because the gameplay is extremely close to System Shock 2 and as we all know it\u2019s all about gameplay. So, Neuromods instead of Cyber Modules, the familiar psychic abilities, three professional disciplines: science, engineering and security; and we also get to research stuff. Honestly, it\u2019s so close that on a superficial inspection one might think it a carbon copy. Luckily Prey puts enough of a spin on it to make all of that its own. Oh and by the way: Bioshock has none of it. None! Spiritual successor, my a*s. Just because it was made by the same people implies no such thing and it\u2019s also extremely sad when another company makes a spiritual successor to your own game whilst you burn down in flames trying to recreate the magic. Too bad the public is too gullible and so of course it falls for it.\n\nDo I have any criticisms? Yes, of course I do. Prey is by no means perfect in the very strict sense, but neither was System Shock 2 (die, weapon degradation, die!). Prey only really has 5 weapons. I\u2019m not counting GLOO Cannon, grenades or god forbid \u2013 the Boltcaster, as these are utility items, yes even grenades: a frag grenade a recycler charge is not. Now in contrast, System Shock 2 had 13 weapons.\n\nHonestly, all you will ever need is your trusty shotgun and disruptor. Pistol is a joke, as you need to go through a whole clip to do any significant damage, at least playing on Nightmare difficulty. Whilst human abilities are well-balanced, Typhon powers range from overpowered to outright useless. The telepathy tree is extremely useful, morph less so, energy being completely useless. Really though, once you get the shotgun and max Combat Focus and Psychoshock (I see what you did there) you\u2019re pretty much unstoppable. Nightmare, the strongest enemy in the game gets violated within seconds using just those three things. So, overall, not very balanced, but then again neither was System Shock 2.\n\nThe criticism that I often hear is that the Typhon are not very interesting enemies. I disagree a great deal. They're as varied an adversarial force as one could hope for. What makes them most interesting is their special abilities that spice up the combat quite a bit. Well, unless you spam Psychoshock that is, but even then they can still Psycho Shift their way around turning some battles into an intense game of cat and mouse. At any rate, they're infinitely more intriguing than the dull hordes of \"sploicers\" that seem to always plague Rapture. When it comes to their visual style: it bears a clear parallel to the Rorschach test which is very much in theme with the rest of the game.\n\nGraphically the game feels last gen, despite running on CryEngine which I should\u2019ve picked up back in the day instead of wasting two years of my life learning Unreal Engine. What it has going for it though is a well done aesthetic suspiciously resembling Bioshock, which isn\u2019t surprising provided Arkane worked on its sequel, the one that I actually liked, believe it or not. Whereas both feature Art Deco style, Bioshock had a 30s theme going on for it, Prey goes for more of a space age thing: 50s to 60s.\n\nOverall Prey is a worthy successor to my beloved System Shock 2 and I believe it to be my duty to inform of the fact every breathing fan of both it and the immersive sim in general. If you like a game of this ilk you simply cannot go wrong with Prey. As a value package: the game promises between 20 and 40 hours of gameplay should you wish to explore every nook and cranny of the behemoth that is Talos I, and believe you me \u2013 it is a delight to do so.

The areas are awesome make logical sense (ie a cafteria, lobby, medical center, maintenance tunnels, water treatment, etc.)  Going out of the space station and flying around is beautifuly done.\n\n- The abilities and combat are seriously fun. Very cool perk system that makes sense in the game because of the story.\n\n- The recycling and inventory managment system is very well done, basically this game is very fun to play for the most part. Exploration, story, combat, and the general upgrading is all extremely well done.\n\n- The movement is great, the puzzles are great, there's multiple ways to solve most problems and it's very much a thinking man's game. It's not just a run around and shoot stuff kinda game but actually reading a lot and trying to solve certain safe codes or ways to get into certain rooms. \n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n- I think it's safe to say the GUTs Maintenance Tunnel is probably the most tedious and annoying part in the game, combat while flying around is not that fun especially when it becomes such a grind.\n\n- Speaking of a grind...this game gets to be grinding at a lot of points. The reason I have a lot of hours in this game is because I kept going back and backtracking (you'll be doing that a lot) and just about everytime you go back the levels will have respawned enemies. It's okay for one or two times but this happens much more frequently add that with the bonus Nightmare (a boss enemy) that randomly spawns throughout the game and it becomes just tedious.\n\n- The ending feels kinda rushed and about halfway through the game the game turns from exploration because you're trying to find out things to exploration because you're doing dumb fetch quests. There's certain plotholes near the end that I won't get into but basically the enemies you face exclusively at the end make you question WTF is even going.

It plays very similarly to Bioshock, with a similar setting (though in space instead of underwater) and gameplay in general.

I found it pretty relaxing to play actually, but you will need to save pretty frequently to keep yourself out of too much trouble. There are a few little jump scares, especially when it comes to the mimics that can disguise themselves before they leap up and attack you. I found that after upgrading the shotgun and the combat focus (slow time) ability, combat was never too much of a challenge on normal difficulty. There is plenty of freedom to choose your approach, but honestly I found straightforward gunplay to be the most effective. There's also a pretty impressive amount to do in this game, and it took me 40+ hours to complete the story and all the side quests (except for the treasure hunt - couldn't be bothered). \n\nI paid full price at $60 and don't regret it, and I understand it has come down pretty significantly in price since then.

You play as Morgan Yu, Vice-President of the Talos 1 Space research station and Brother/Sister of Alex Yu, the company president.\n\nThe game takes place on Talos 1, a space reserach station oribitin Earth's moon, after a unknown alien species that was being researched broke containment and everything has gone wrong. It's up to you to solve it, whatever way that might be while being hunted by hostile aliens all over the station.\n\nPrey features a lot of inspiration from thing such as The Thing and more, featuring many Sci-Fi and Pychological horror themes with the Typhon and the futuristic Talos 1.\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Fantastic intro sequence. \n[*]Pretty visuals, the aesthethic of Prey is on point throughout the game. \n[*]Encourages exploration and rewards it. Talos 1 is huge and mostly completely open to explore, from the atmospheric, empty space outside, to the closed in labs of the station. A LOT of replay value.\n[*]Well written, diverse and memorable set of characters all over the station. \n[*]Intriguing, although plot-twisty story that can be predictable, but keeps you guessing at times.\n[*]Plenty of side stories and missions to be discovered all over.\n[/list]\n[b]CONS[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Audio issues still present, some NPCs are very loud compared to others.\n[*]Gameplay can be clunky, mostly fun but sometimes frustrating.\n[*]Unskippable sequences can be annoying with multiple playthroughs.\n[*]Soundtrack is up and down, has some fantastic points but is overall sadly a bit weak, though fits the atmosphere.\n[*]Game is [i]mostly[/i] well optimized, though it still has a couple areas that tank performance later in the game, and frames can fluctuate. Still better polished than most games in 2017\n[/list]\n\nOverall, Prey 2017 is a fantastic game, and very underrated. Though shunned for having no connection to the original, problematic Prey from 2006, i'd say that's just for the best, as this Prey on its own stands out brilliantly with it's theme. \n\nIt's high replay value, exploration and many missable things make it a good purchase, maybe even at full price, although for someone who isn't going to run it 2+ times and 100% it, i'd reccomend grabbing it in a sale for 30$ or so.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 959, "steamid": "76561198047302625", "last_played": 1506445775, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 120, "playtime_forever": 3096}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1506255909, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506917", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506255909, "recommendationid": "35179469", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great game 10 out of 10.

Atmospheric, intriguing, heavily immersive, open... maybe too open, even! What's more, it looks good, runs smoothly and controls naturally, too, unlike a lot of the lazy console ports we've been getting lately. Loading times are nearly non-existent on an SSD, which contributes to the feeling of navigating an actual space station and the surrounding open space rather than a series of separate maps.\n\nOf course it's not flawless - there was the odd minor side quest that was impossible to complete, another that I completed on accident by picking up an item here and applying it elsewhere hours later, breaking the quest as a result (hence \"too open\"), and I experienced a handful of CTDs as well as some possible memory leak issues in the reactor and cargo bay areas. But that amounts to a very minor fraction of the total time I spent on the game - which brings me to another point: the game is long. I spent 40+ hours on my first playthrough. I suspect the number would shrink to about 20-30 hours with a less meticulous approach, but that is still a rather massive number considering the relatively confined space of the Talos 1 station.\n\nMy only major gripe with the game is that it might be *too* rewarding of a careful, meticulous approach even on the highest difficulty. Halfway through the game there is little left of the initial challenge, and the need for diversification or skill tree planning is gone as well; you can do just about everything you wanted. The first time a Nightmare appeared, it was dead before it even registered with me that this was not just an overgrown Phantom that I was pumping shotgun shells into at point blank. In hindsight I could just have recycled nearly all of the suit repair kits and medkits I hoarded for the large battles that never really came - the omnipresent Operators rendered them useless most of the time. And that was while avoiding any Typhon skills whatsoever (which left me with some 60+ unused Neuromods in the inventory at the end of the game).\n\ntl;dr: Liked System Shock 2?

It is way too frustrating. I have gone through almost 2 playthroughs just to find out that being a typhon ability user sucks even more than using human abilities. Only human ability users have a chance to improve inventory space or their suit/psychoscope mod count. Typhon ability users have no way to get to certain areas while human ability users have a skill for every little thing in the game. Which sucks because there is an achievement for completing the game using just either one. The costs for the typhon abilities are too high and the use too little. The enemies look all the same and it has nothing new to it except the ability to turn into pickle rick or a coffee mug. In fact all enemies look like giant gooey black spaghetti monsters who behave all the same except those who can turn also into pickle rick or coffee mugs. The only real difference is the element/power they are utilizing to kill you. \nIt is nothing else than a really bugged Bioshock/Systemshock clone with a bland and unimaginative story which makes no sense at all except you try to force some philosophical bullshit into it. \nThe Graphics look like from the late 2000's with some small upgrades like blurry screen space reflections. \n\nBethesda should have left Human Head Studios alone but instead they decided to destroy the studio by making impossible deadlines just because Human Head did not want to sell to them.

For example, you'll be in an area and pass by something interesting you want to pick up but you can't until you return later with a certain item or power up.  So you're constatly navigating back and forth.\n- Enemy AI is extremely dull and lacks any kind of depth.  Enemies are far too similar.\n- Combat is incredibly boring and feels very dated.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game.  Not because it's bad, which it's not, it just wasn't a very fun experience.  Since the enemies will respawn upon leaving and re-entering an area it makes it so that you just end up running through a portion of the space station just to get to the intended area.  ie: Loading Screen To Loading Screen.  So there is a lot of backtracking.  There is no incentive to clear an area, when it will be repopulated with enemies when you reload that section after leaving.  Enemies for the most part look the same but have a few different power gimmicks.  The combat against the enemies lacks choice.  Stealth is an inneffective solution in Prey.  The only real choice for combat you have is either to Fight or Run.\n\nI'm not saying don't buy Prey, but if you're expecting a game on the level of Dishonored or Deus Ex, this is certainly not it.  In a game like Dishonored the combat is refective of the entire game.  The combat in Dishonored is choice driven just like the entire game.  In Prey, the combat is only kill or run, and most of the combat is clunky and weapons leave something to be desired.  The Gloo Canon is cool but its not that effective against enemies.  Prey's combat is simply not fun.\n\nI pretty much just made it through Prey and have no desire to revisit the game, unlike Dishonored which is always interesting to uncover many of the things you missed the first time.  The difference in Dishonored when you are playing an assault run as opposed to a stealth non-lethal run keeps me coming back for more, in Prey this is not the case.\n\nThe ending for Prey was probably one of the best I've seen in a video game however.  Imagine the end of Fallout where the narrarator sums up your time played in Fallout, but in Prey it's like a million times better.  It does feel like you get some closure with finishing the game.\n\nConclusively, Prey is not a bad game, but the combat brings it down, the combat feels feels tired, dated, and isn't even half as good as what Arkane has been known to create.  Buy this game when it's on sale, but don't expect an even half as interesting of a ride as Dishonored gives you with Prey.\n\n\n7/10\n+ Excellent storyline that screws with the players perception of reality.\n-  Boring combat and enemies, leave nothing to be desired except to uncover the next page of the narrative.  Levels are annoying and there is a large amount of backtracking.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198082438220", "last_played": 1495515122, "num_reviews": 52, "num_games_owned": 460, "playtime_forever": 2056}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1505797696, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500240", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1505929644, "recommendationid": "35058228", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "10/10 amazing", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198369875136", "last_played": 1505547190, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 1519}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504627870, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504627870, "recommendationid": "34759651", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
