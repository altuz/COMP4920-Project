I have a masters in CS. This is TERRIBLE software. It's buggy and there seems to be no help file. You click help and it takes you to a website that is an advertisement for why you should buy the app. I ALREADY BOUGHT IT. I JUST NEED THE DIRECTIONS ON HOW TO SET IT UP! But no, it wants to just try to sell me on why I should buy it. Very helpful...\n\nI never got the app to recognize that I was ever in the game no matter what I did. Maybe it was something that could have been configured to work properly but, again, no help file to show you setup tips.\n\nThe mobile app is a joke. It's buggy. It says its waiting on my PC to confirm the connection but never does anything. I have to kill both the mobile app and steam and gamecaptr then start them all back up and then it connects fine. This would be fine if this were occasional but it's every other time.\n\nThe app doesn't even close itself properly. If you click the icon in your tasktray and then choose the exit option that the app menu provides, this should be the best way to close an app because it is allowing the program to close itself. If you do that with this app it looks like it goes away but steam says its still running. So it doesn't close itself. You have to actually kill the steam process and then start it back up to actually close this gamecaptr app.\n\nBottom line is that I couldn't get the thing to record or stream or even take a screenshot.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961568462", "last_played": 1480231310, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 57, "playtime_forever": 9146}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1479832809, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518322", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1479832809, "recommendationid": "26748918", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Installed and set it up, played and captured 90 minutes of an Exterminatus in Space Marine, the results was a 8.3G mp4 file which couldn't be opened by anything.
