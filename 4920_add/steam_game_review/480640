Unless if you're a hardcore Pathfinder fan (like me), don't bother.\n\nPros:\n- Faithful adaptation of the Pathfinder world & lore\n- Core mechanic is fun\n- No micro-transaction is necessary to enjoy the game\n\nCons:\n- Unfair mechanic against the player\n- Infuriatingly buggy\n- P2W micro-transactions that don't add much value\n\nAs a 10yr+ veteran of Obsidian games, and a diehard Pathfinder fan, I really want to like this game. It's fun. When it works, it really works. If you're into team-based RPG, or card games, there's a lot to enjoy here.\n\nProblem is, most of the time it just doesn't want to work. Not by design but by poor execution. While the core formula is solid, there are too many mechanics that feels unfairly stacked against the player (e.g. some sections of the game automatically treats rolls of 1 or 2 as 0; while others forces you to permanently \"banish\" a card (which you may have spent hours farming for)) in order to artificially inflate difficulty. It doesn't give you a sense of fair challenge; it just makes you feel powerless and ill-equipped to handle what the game throws at you. The single most important factor to winning the game is luck.\n\nAnd the bugs make the game feel unfinished - remember by the time it comes out on Steam, it's already a year old. There is a 3-month old game breaking bug sitting unresolved as we speak that randomly duplicates or deletes a character after you rename him or her; there is a dice %age indicator that appears to straight-up doesn't work, as even 90% rolls fails at least 50% of the time - and we don't know if it's working as intended or just too bugged. One expects Obsidian games to be buggy. But this is a mess.\n\nSo unless if you're a fan, in which case you probably have to play this regardless, the admittedly solid gameplay just isn't solid enough to justify the frustration you'll have to deal with.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 750, "steamid": "76561198042884123", "last_played": 1506707095, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_forever": 2416}, "votes_up": 51, "timestamp_created": 1505477083, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559723", "votes_down": 20, "timestamp_updated": 1505477083, "recommendationid": "34970172", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very good port of the card game. \n\nUnlike other reviewers, i didn't run into any bugs, crashes or rule inconsistencies.

Also, if you can live with the bugs the game is \"Recommended\".\n\nPros:\n1. Base Game by Paizo is very good, but not for everyone\n2. A very good port of the board game, without the manual handling part like keeping track of cards etc\n3. Fun to play, good UI and graphics, great gameplay (but again, not everyone will like it)\n4. Like all board and dice games, there is RNG, lots of it. But the aim of the game is to minimise those by reducing variances, moving to higher average dies or using other characters. Definitely not a con, at least not of the digital game. \n\nCons:\n1. Extremely buggy, many game breaking bugs like character duplication, gold loss, skill points loss, sync issues etc\n2. Characters don't get referenced by their changed names, hence nicknames are useless. Not only that, renaming characters leads to a major bug\n3. Stash limit of 10 - Inadequate for a digital card game. Playing offline results in infinite stash, but can cause problem due to buggy sync. (Note: Do not create mules, it will lead to issues because of bugs, it is anyway very inconvenient due to card limits.

It has an item mall that makes this game extremely pay to have fun.  \n\nInventory System:\nThe currently inventory is limited to 10 slots.  I don't have a problem with that, except the game is made more difficult because you could pay money to increase the number of cards in the inventory.  The inventory is called Stash and is limited to 10 cards; but there is a second inventory called Unclaimed which has unlimited space by paying them lots of money.  Don't be fooled, EVERYBODY IS USING IT; because the game is grinding unfun without it.  Luckily, since I paid a premium price, they gave me a lot of that \"premium\" service to make this game easier (*cough, I mean normal).  To make things worse, permanently destroying cards is OP (over powered) in this game.  You could go on a spending spree and beat this game in a yawn feast without ever thinking about strategy; or you could struggle without ever gimping your character (no destroying cards)..  I'd say most people play the game in between based on how mentally retarded they actually are...\n\nRune System:\nAnother pay to get a direct advantage in the game, and it has a real life timer attached to it.  I hate it, they literally lower the difficulty 20% just for paying money or grinding the fuck out of the game.  The game is designed to give you a 0% chance of winning with shit cards, shit runes, and without strategy.  So, basically the amount of money you spend directly affects how easy the game is for you.  Most players will claim that you can grind gold to get this stuff for free; which is admitting they redesigned the game to be a grind feast.  I love grinding, yay!  NO FUCKING WAY!!  Any game designed to be grindy and unfun is a huge thumbs down for me..\n\nCharm System:\nA very well hidden system that allows a direct money from your wallet to a instant win scenario.  There are about 8-9 specific charms that allow you to directly add dice; or flat out win scenarios by literally just giving you a almost 50% boost in power.  You can be rolling between 1-10, but pay some money and now you are rolling two d10's doing 2-20dmg.  That's a direct 100% increase in power if you are willing to pay the cash.  I guess when you modify the boardgame to make it harder, then you need to add ways to make the game easier (by paying real $$).  Just in case we messed up making the game too hard.\n\nSources from original boardgame rulebook (Notice: You should able to keep cards on failed runs, but the video game version does not allow this.  Thus making this game exponentially harder.)\nhttp://paizo.com/products/btpy8x6l?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Rise-of-the-Runelords-Base-Set\n\n\n\nOverall Review:\nSept. 22, 2017; Currently the game is well done and would be a perfect thumbs up, perfect 100% grade A game....  However, adding the pay to have fun aspect to this game leaves a sour taste.  It's like paying to get into Disneyland, and then finding out you need to pay for \"premium tickets\" to NOT wait in line for 2 hours.  Yes, you eventually get your fun; but paying extra to not wait in line for a 2 hour grind is BULLSHIT and I refuse to support this shit.

MTX in a singleplayer game, are you kidding me.\n\nWouldn't even recommend it on sale.  I'd refund except it took me too long to see all of the hideously glaring flaws.\n\nEDIT:  The RNG dictating everything is probably as harmful, if not more harmful, than the loot crates and MTX.  If you thought losing 80%+ chance rolls in other games is bad, this one hurts so much more.  Often to boost your chance to win, you are discarding or sometimes even banishing (more on that later) many cards from more than just your character fighting the key battle but other characters to boost them.  Range weapons, boons, that sort of thing.  That moment when you raise a 10% chance to succeed to 90% chance to succeed vs a boss that you likely won't get another chance to beat (there are pin down and lock out mechanics to prevent them from fleeing and needing to be fought repeatedly) and fail spectacularly anyways, ruining the entire adventure, well if that's not infuriating I don't know what is.\n\nOther aspects are also too RNG dependant.  Trying to search through 6 locations only to have the minions who allow you to 'lock down' those locations at the bottom of the deck is a guaranteed failed adventure because of the clock you are always fighting. And it swings both ways, sometimes you have an insanely quick and easy time because 4 of those locations have the lockdown enemy at or near the top of the deck and you just breeze through the adventure not evening using half of the alotted time.  There's no decision making process that can save you from  badly shuffled adventure location decks.\n\nAnd yea, you can sometimes permanently banish cards.  The hearthstone equivalent would be using and destroying your card during a match, and then not having that card anymore in your collection, it's just gone forever.  Unlike hearthstone, can't craft any card you want/need either, it's all up to the RNG loot crates.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 3250, "steamid": "76561197970674137", "last_played": 1506906142, "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 179, "playtime_forever": 3545}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505997907, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499300", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1506053420, "recommendationid": "35103480", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "just not good enough, i Love duce games and card games, so Useally I will love this kind, but it it not fun, it is fustrating and grinding to get just 1 card  just takes forever.
