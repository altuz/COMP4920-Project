Missile Command was basically a set of base structures to protect and a main base with a limited number of missiles that can be fired.  Above you, you would see a bunch of streaming lines indicating incoming missiles which if they hit your base structures they'd destroy it.  Occasionally a plane or UFO or something would go overhead as well.  \n\nWell \"Inbound\" is almost the same way, except that it's 3D instead of 2D, it's VR instead of 2D... and you have laser turrets instead of missiles.  You still have the base structures to protect, and your turrets can take a few hits before they're destroyed and that may or may not affect your ability to continue defending.\n\nAs with missile command enemy ships will fly overhead to take shots at your base and you can use the lasers to take them out.Unlike Missile command, you've also got some mechs that will walk in and sometimes hover/jet in mid air to take shots at your base.  There are also some ground based vehicles that will roll in and shoot at your base.  For these threats you use grenades that are launched from the turrets (this part feels closer to missile command) and occasionally you get some land mines that you can deploy the same as grenades, but instead of blowing up a few seconds later, they stay in place a bit longer.\n\nThe game ends when all your base structures are destroyed (I had to stop myself from saying \"all your base are belong to us\").  Though it might also end if your turrets are taken out without having to wait for the base structures to be destroyed as well.\n\nThings I liked:\n[list]\n [*] It really is just like I would have imagined 3D/VR Missile command\n [*] You can easily see where you're aiming, so you don't have to make guesses (which would be harder to do since you're in a 3rd person style setup)\n [*] The graphics are nice and you don't notice a \"screen door effect\" while you're playing it at all. Some games made text hard to read, but everything seems set up just right.\n[/list]\n\nThings I didn't like:\n[list]\n [*] The grenade attacks were pretty unsatisfying.  It felt like it was just better to spam grenades in the general direction of any threat on the outside chance it might destroy it at a distance\n [*] Speaking of the distance thing, it's impossible to aim at something too far off, so I felt like I had to lean in to get some of the shots\n [*] The game could use an option to reset where you're standing as the 'center'. I'm not sure if it was by chance or design but I was not far from the boundary of my game play area and so I constantly had to get close to the edge to protect some buildings. Seeing the chaparone bounds is a big turnoff.\n [*] It's not always clear how/when you can use the land mines.  I feel like you should have half the button devoted to grenades and the other half to land mines.\n[/list]\n\nOtherwise though, this game is awesome and I can definitely see myself spending more time playing it.  It doesn't use much of the room scale play area so you could potentially even play it sitting down if you wanted. You will still have to stretch to get to all the areas of your base to fire at incoming missiles though.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969913402", "last_played": 1473813779, "num_reviews": 149, "num_games_owned": 1966, "playtime_forever": 116}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1468721510, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1468723333, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507558", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1468721510, "developer_response": "Hello Arleas, thank you for that absolutely amazing review. Regarding the preferred standing area...we designed the game to encourage the player to stand more behind the base than in front. This is for 2 reasons: one, if you're standing forward and something gets past you, you have little chance of stopping it before it hits the colony. Two, it is difficult to assess the condition of the colony if it is behind you. We've been thinking about this issue a lot, and wondered if maybe there needed to be a distance adjustment on the targeting reticle. Would love to hear your thoughts on that.\n\nRegarding the grenades...the first version of the game had the grenades detonating 1 second after contacting the terrain or on direct hits to ground units. We still detonate after one second, but we also detonate in the proximity of ground units now. This is because one of the complaints with v1.0 was that a reasonable well-placed grenade shot would hit close to a mech, then bounce away and explode. The way we tended to play at that time was to aim short, and have it bounce near the target rather than aiming directly at the target. This is counter-intuitive, I think. Would love to hear suggestions on how this might be addressed in future versions.\n\nAgain, excellent review, thank you for taking the time to write it, and feel free to email/message us any additional thoughts you might have as to how we can continue improving the game!\n\n-John Nagle (CTO/co-founder)", "recommendationid": "24364317", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Looked flashy the first 5 min.

Someone was suggesting a seated experience but I think standing is the best way to play as I was reaching a lot to get a little closer to the missles before they out ran my reaction time. If you like wave shooters and arcade type games in VR then get this. I don't like wave shooters and arcade VR much but I liked this one.
