What do I do? What am I looking for? ARGH I CAN'T SEE!!!\" brand of 'horror' games. You know, the type that preys on your total lack of peripheral vision thanks to the sole light source being a tunnel-illumination flashlight, while sending you all over hell and creation to find something that you haven't the first clue what it could be? Yeah, that's pretty much Satanist wrapped up in one paragraph; but wait, there's more!\n\nActually, there isn't. There are no sounds in this game, save for some faint footsteps, one single drop of blood (yes), and a loud jumpscare noise. There's no background music, not even droning ambiance, no voice overs, no squeaky door opening sounds, nothing. Nada. Zilch. This title isn't low budget, it's no budget. You get the same repeating textures, the same door and object models, pretty much everything looks exactly the same; a feature that makes it hard as hell to tell where you have and haven't been to yet.\n\nSo, what is Satanist exactly? Well, you roam around until you find two batteries for your flashlight, and then keep going through a maze of corridors. Since there's no prompt when you're able to pick something up, you might find the first key on the body in the toilet by accident or you just may spend an hour or two searching for it; without it, you'll simply never progress. Ever. Then it's a wild goose chase for keys thereafter. Eventually, some serial killer \"satanist\" is going to chase you, and since there are LITERALLY ALMOST NO SOUNDS EVER IN THIS GAME you'll never have any idea that he's behind you until you die. Then you'll die, die, and die again until you discover the keycode (089693) on some dead dude's arm. You'll die more on your way to enter the keycode. Then [spoiler]you'll die one final time after you get back to the starting area of the game,[/spoiler] because that's the end.\n\nThere, I just saved you $1.09 CAD and hours of your time. I'd also rip on this title for having spelling errors and terrible grammar, but it's obvious the developer's first language isn't English. I'm pretty close to whistleblowing Dmitry as a scam developer, because he uses multiple publisher/developer names to produce the same crappy FPSCreator titles under similar yet slightly different names; recently, some of them have changed. He never issues any updates, and his games are almost always broken beyond repair. Satanist at least runs, but that's hardly any consolation prize.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.5/5.0[/b] - Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork#curation]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049701098", "last_played": 1503417497, "num_reviews": 203, "num_games_owned": 2338, "playtime_forever": 33}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1503418802, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526070", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1503418831, "recommendationid": "34419176", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
