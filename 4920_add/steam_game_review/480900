I just can't get passed the terrible voice acting to spend time on this, seriously it is awful and I am having to refund for the first time in 1400+ games. Nice attempt at a game, but with abysmal voice acting, this is not for me. I have every single pnc on Steam and have been playing them since the Amiga days, this is by far the worst voice acting I have come across to date. The main character is fine, the rest of the characters are horrible, even the grammar used is poor at times. \n\nMy Score - 2/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198033812163", "last_played": 1497101115, "num_reviews": 318, "num_games_owned": 1539, "playtime_forever": 25}, "votes_up": 30, "timestamp_created": 1497101173, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529761", "votes_down": 15, "timestamp_updated": 1500726176, "recommendationid": "32317700", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very Fun and Challenging it kept me entertained throughout.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198127798435", "last_played": 1498633927, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 278}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1498634030, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493840", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1498634030, "recommendationid": "32917010", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
