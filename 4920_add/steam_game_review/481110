Yes. Was this a game? Barely. Is the story predictable? A little, towards the end. This is more of an interactive short film. There are some failure conditions, but the only punishment is going through the failed action again. I don't think there are any \"choices matter\" elements, either. It's a novel idea, the production value seems good for what it is. I recommend getting it at a deep discount, and \"playing\" it when you are in the mood for a storytelling experience. I like that things like this exist, and I would like to see more of them, just with some more \"game\" and a \"branching\" story, where my choices actually impact what's going on. (If this element existed at all in the game, I completely missed it, and I don't think I would replay it to find out for sure.)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 113, "steamid": "76561198025397416", "last_played": 1506224126, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 1173, "playtime_forever": 113}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506226198, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506226198, "recommendationid": "35170367", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "More of an Interactive movie than a game, The Bunker brings a return to those FMV video games.\n\nStory is good so is the acting. The music ambiance sets the mood properly for this dark underground tale.\n\nGame is about 2 hours long for a single run. You can replay for the missing achievements and also to see the other chosen ending.\n\nOverall, not a bad game but not groundbreaking either. I do hope we'll get to see more FMV based video games in the future.\n\nConclusion: Get on a sale!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 119, "steamid": "76561197969592572", "last_played": 1506487221, "num_reviews": 270, "num_games_owned": 1483, "playtime_forever": 119}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506559817, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506559817, "recommendationid": "35252129", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
