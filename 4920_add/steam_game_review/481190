It's being actively worked on.\n\nI got it while 33% discounted, so my opinion is based on that price.\n\nFirst, this game is a roguelike, which I didn't expect. Your station is saved at the point you leave it. If your station falls out of orbit, it's gone. Loading the save just gets you an empty orbital position. There's no incremental or manual save options. It makes for an interesting mechanic.\n\nThe UI currently lets it down, as it feels like it hasn't been properly audited before release. There's now a basic tutorial, but you can't globally disable it and it will prompt on each new instance. UI scaling has just been disabled to fix another bug, which means on my 1024x1280 screen, the info bar at the bottom has text about 4 pixels high, which makes judging the current status very hard. Likewise the icons are tiny. There also aren't any tooltips, where items have descriptions it appears it's missing information, resource quantities modules provide are always zero in the purchace descriptions. It also feels it's a bad omission that modules don't list their stats for production & consumption. It means it's very hard to plan ahead. What's my stations current mass? How much does this newly researched module weigh? Will my station fall out of orbit if I add it? Or will I get brown-outs from unexpectedly high power consumption?\n\nYou can however wing it by watching the balance bars in the status bar, but it would be nice to plan ahead with more accuracy.\n\nOverall it's an enjoyable thing to play and quite pretty. It feels like a solid base in need of some editing. That in-game options duplicating options from the loader window seems like an example of that.\n\nI would hope that additional challenges & technologies are added later, as once you get the knack of balancing resources, I could see just waiting for research to complete get a bit tiring. Maybe a manager to hire? Or at least a way of sorting tasks by expiry or type.\n\nThe only thing I'm honestly sad about is that the branching construction system means you can't reconnect ends. For example, trying to put a truss all the way around a rotating habitat as a cage.\n\nFor under \u00a37 it's made for a good few hours entertainment so far.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 593, "steamid": "76561197995682863", "last_played": 1506804006, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 85, "playtime_forever": 593}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506746408, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506746408, "recommendationid": "35322900", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "For those of you who are old enough to remember Earth Orbit Stations on the Commodore 64 way back in 1987, then you're absolutely going to love this!\n\nOk, so it's got a couple of bugs, which I've found aren't game-breaking - but don't let that put you off.\n\nOverall, it seems well designed and  even though I think that the tutorial could do with being expanded just a touch, it's thoroughly enjoyable. I'm sure the developers will be adding in new features as time goes by - or at least I hope they will because there's a lot of scope for expansion here.\n\nA couple of tips to get you started.\n\n1) Follow the tutorial. Even if you think you're goin to be a natural when you first start, follow the tutorial - then restart the game, if you wish.\n\n2) Don't be tempted into taking on a huge contract before you have the Oxygen Generator - and this is the bit that's missing in the tutorial - if you focus on money and just money too early, you'll have problems, because you'll be stuck 3/4 of the way into your research and have no money left when your crew leaves.\n\nFinally, don't forget to put RCS Thrusters onto the station. These will keep you from falling out of orbit.\n\nOverall, a great game and I'm looking forward to updates from the developers. Thoroughly recommended.

It still needs to be finished.\n\nThis is a beautiful game to play or sit back and watch. \n\n I lost the first station to RNG about an hour in when my lab (the ONLY way to make money) was randomly removed from my ship in an \"event.\" Immediate loss since getting up and running requires you to spend a lot of money, leaving you unable to pay the big bucks when you get punched with these events too early.\n\nMy second playthrough I got to 5 astronauts and 2 labs with 150 O2, 3K Water, 2.5K Food and only losing ~25% total battery life at night. Then I specialized my second lab into tech (so I could unlock extra/large parts.) The only unlock that worked was for the large solar panel array. The other items stayed locked and doing research to unlock the other specializations actually locks those specializations so you can't use them. \nThose are what we gamers call GAME BREAKING BUGS.\nI understand wanting to make a difficult and realistic game; however, having early game stations which literally live paycheck to paycheck take full piece destruction like that is not possible without losing or keeping a ridiculously high rainy day fund in reserve. \n\nNew users:\nJust to get a station running you need to build the following:\n\nA Lab - Your only way to bring in income.\n\nBatteries - Although not mentioned anywhere, if your station runs out of power at night, the shuttle will not launch to bring you supplies and crew. (Testing it showed that you cannot start without batteries, the shuttle will never leave with the crewman you need to man the lab.)\n\nOxygen Generator - I found that spending the $1B off the bat for this instead of buying oxygen tanks saves you a lot of trouble. (Your crew will die between drops otherwise.)\n\nWater Tank - The Windows Generic Female Voice will not shut up about your fatal and depleting water levels (50L or base starting water levels BTW) until you buy a water tank. \n\nRCS Thrusters - A part that relies on guesswork since the stats are non-existent. This keeps your ship up. If you are constantly having the WGFV yell about altitude then you need more of these.\n\nWaste Disposal - Honestly, not sure how any of the waste is calclated but this prevents ecxess weight from forcing your station down faster. \n\nAt this point your ship should be semi-stable. Upgrade some storage tanks, add some more solar arrays.\n\nEasiest way I found to accomplish anything was to stabilize a one crew ship then specialize a lab in Earth and Science and perform the lengthy but well-paying contracts. \n\nThis game is not yet user friendly. Some contracts when undertaken restrict your labs from those specs instead of unlocking them. Further the new rooms don't seem to unlock at all. When repairing your ship, there is no cost estimate. If you hit repair it just starts draining money, leaving you without the ability to compair the price for repair against the price for replacement. \n\n---ALWAYS KEEP $1.5 BILLION AVAILABLE---\n\nAt any point the game will take a module from you with one of its random events.
