I bought Final Approach just when launched, at the very early days of Vive avaliability, and yes it was cool but wasn't very impressed of the gameplay itself. The game suffered also of awful performances with lot of missed frames, and I refunded.\n\nI'm back today after more than a year, with the Pilot Edition (than include also the standard, if you buy this one you'll get both). I tried the classic version again, the graphics is way more detailed and super smooth, they made an exceptional work in optimizations but still I don't find particulary fun or compelling the gameplay. With my surprise, the Pilot Edition instead fit way more my taste.\n\nWhere those games are almost identical in contents, the classic version use full roomscale, handtracking and is based on drawing paths in the air: let's say than is closer to play with toys on a tabletop airport. The Pilot Edition instead is a seated + pad experience, something less interesting in theory, but well... now you pilot airplanes with a sweet third person view! It's like a Pilotwings kind of game mixed with managerial elements. Birds and fires are still present, but their weight is reduced, and this also is a good news being both actions repetitive and annoying to perform.\n\nI realize than the classical Final Approach was (and still is) a more peculiar and roomscale oriented project, but the Pilot Edition as pure videogame is a better product.\n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969101080", "last_played": 1498772003, "num_reviews": 132, "num_games_owned": 290, "playtime_forever": 108}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1498687137, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507562", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498687137, "recommendationid": "32960636", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Nausea!!
