Some of the more advanced levels introduce things like movement mirroring (reverses your intended movement) and a time limit.  On the negative side, the time limit levels, while challenging, can pose a roadblock if you are not enthusiastic about learning/recording precise moves in order to complete the timed levels.  It wouldhave been helpful to set difficulties or bypass the countdown aspect of the timed levels.  Over all a very nice game, and very resonable price."}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1464402707, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471750", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "23244948", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198033107016", "num_reviews": 148, "last_played": 1488401345, "num_games_owned": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 80}, "timestamp_updated": 1480608299, "received_for_free": false, "review": "\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f"}]}
