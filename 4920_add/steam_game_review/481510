You play this game for the story, and you'll either love that or you won't.\n\nPersonally, the story and characters in Night in the Woods made me see things in my own town and in people I know, and that relevation is astonishing. This game is all about feeling stuck, that hopeless nihilism that a lot of young people feel, and realizing that everyone around you has some kind of potential that they just can't seem to fill.\nIt's very real in a way that I did not expect.\nThis is one of my favorite games, and it may or may not be for you, but I really do suggest playing it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198260417113", "last_played": 1491288635, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_forever": 1540}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1506010469, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505507", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506010469, "recommendationid": "35108197", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A beautifully rendered, well written, sweet, funny, and relatable game with an identity crisis.\n\nI'm not one to split hairs about what is and isn't a game.

It screws with the tone without adding much of substance, but more importantly, it screws with the pacing. If this were IF, or even just a story, the pacing would be perfect.

Think of this game a lot like \"Fall of the House of Usher\" by Edgar Allen Poe or \"The Lottery\" by Shirley Jackson with respect to climax and hazed cues throughout the story. The way the story muddies leaves me frustrated at times but always wanting more out of it. \n\nThe soundtrack fits the color of the game: rustic and gray with a touch of bright autumn. The emphasis on bass and keyboard reflect a more somber feeling from an old rust belt town yet give a homey-time feeling for those that have experienced small town life with more upbeat melodies. The xylophone, tuba, bassoon, ensemble, and keyboard usage resembles a community lost in its former time: hard-hitting on heritage and nostalgia.\n\nThe characters themselves are lively and feel normal when carrying out decisions with gameplay. A great amount of dedication went into the dialog and persona's of each character. It's very easy to give each character their own voice in your head accompanied by any inflections or attenuation caused as the game carries on. It also adds in more of a replay value as you get to learn more about certain characters as you interact with them more. \n\nI will not go too granular into game mechanics based on the popular reviews for this game have covered this topic.
