Houses are 10 times bigger from the inside and almost empty or unkind. Lots of labyrinth-like paths that took me thrice as long to get through. I was able to run up walls but got stuck when I approached things that shouldn't block me. When there were cut scenes I got ported to an area that doesn't even look like my surroundings and people just decided to disappear after talking to me - because walking away is too mainstream.\n\nFights don't seem that important but I am really glad about it. There is no combat/skill/character balancing. Skills need too much MP (400 of 800 e.g.) but almost all fights are against one mob which is mostly a one-rounder. If there were more they wiped me pretty fast because enemies do way too much damage (sometimes even onehits).\n\nI couldn't find a variety of weapons or armor but plenty of healing items instead. Most of them seem useless and overpriced tho. \n\n\nLast but not least it was the story that disappointed me. Dialogues seem forced, unnatural and I am still looking for the humorous parts.\nAt one point the characters started to talk about stuff they never mentioned before which spoilered and confused me. After playing some more another conversation explained what happened back there. Some things happen/are mentioned way too early in the game. \n\nThe only parts of madness and crazy I found was me playing this.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079811614", "last_played": 1492352119, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 1127, "playtime_forever": 314}, "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_created": 1492353686, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478290", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1492353686, "recommendationid": "31179786", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Well... this is a game that is not taking itself too seriously. Shin appears to be the descendant of a man who... well, got greedy, infiltrated a sacred place, drank the all-powerful water of the gods, became an evil deity, before Gaia kicked his backside and cursed him to fall in love with a woman then watch her die... And also cursed his entire bloodline to suffer the same fate.\n\nThis seems to be the only reason off the top of my head as to why he is such a... jackass to everyone. Especially Dawn, who he has appeared to have seen before and realized he might... like her... Oh and Dawn needs his help to go through the Enchanted Forest to find an Oracle... which would be easier, if she didn't fall asleep every few moments...\n\nSo this game is a bit of a comedy, so be forewarned.

Must of bought it for .50 cents given the promises of steam achievements and badge leveling. \n\nRPG maker dimodozen game. I know it has a story but to be fair I cannot remember a damn thing about it. I found a pink ghost and grinded 2kg in loose loot from whatever the same re-skinned mob. Took about an hour to get to the next traders town, so I walked back and forth for my 10k meters achievement. I left the game open and idle for the 5 hours in-game.
