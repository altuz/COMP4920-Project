Very ocassionally it would glitch out in one way or another (e.g not grab onto a platform right in front of me) but it was rare enough to not really hamper my experience.\n\nThe tutorials in this game aren't just intrusive, they're obnoxious. In the penultimate mission, there is a sequence where the game prompts you to \"find a way out of [the area you're in]\". The camera then literally pans to where you're supposed to go. I'm not really \"finding\" a way out here, am I? I'd like to think that by the second-to-last mission of the entire game, a player would be prepared for some sort of challenge. By the end of the game, I was still getting prompts for keybindings for basic movement in combat and platforming, too. It's outrageous.\n\nThis incessant handholding extends to the combat as well. Not once did I die during my playthrough, and I only got close on one occassion. The combat consists of you locking on to an enemy, waiting for him to attack, then pressing LMB. Then if there are other enemies, press LMB on them as well (no need to wait for them to attack, now you've started a \"combo\"). Some enemy types try to spice it up by forcing you to press space to kick them before you can attack them, and it becomes more of an annoying hurdle than an actual challenge.\n\nMaybe this hand-holding would be forgiveable, if there was no filler and the game was short but sweet. But most of the \"story\" missions in this game are boring \"go here, do that, tail this guy\" missions. The best missions were ones where you had to stay undetected, carefully plotting out a route past the guards, which does shine a light on how awful the combat system is.\n\nSpeaking of staying undetected, for a game that sells itself as a stealth title, stealth is barely ever the best option. Wherever the game lets you attack head-on, its the best option. Staying undetected takes longer and has a higher risk associated with it.\n\nDespite all these gaping flaws, the game was a pretty enjoyable experience. The story, whilst I didn't get particularly attatched to any character, was somewhat interesting and while the game ends on a \"ooh, buy the next game to find out what happens next\" cliffhanger, they at least put the effort in to make you genuinely want to find out what happens next - and the platforming, when the game wasnt holding your hand with it, was satisfying and surprisingly well-programmed.\n\n6/10"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506589908, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35257843", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198145338475", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506592273, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "playtime_forever": 74}, "timestamp_updated": 1506589908, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game with stunning graphics for its time, storyline is just perfect."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506456106, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500707", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35229287", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198149771229", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1506535932, "num_games_owned": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "playtime_forever": 24}, "timestamp_updated": 1506456106, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Ubisoft and Uplay are both shit, and I cant connect to Uplay for some reason, but in offline mode this is a good game."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505761915, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500706", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35051315", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198080220914", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1484526241, "num_games_owned": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1398}, "timestamp_updated": 1505761915, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Even though I basically speedrun this game, I really enjoyed it.

While I don't think it quite lives up to its predecessor, it was still enjoyable to play.\n\nBasic info on equipment: HP Pavilion dv6-6123cl entertainment notebook. Processor AMD A6-3400M APU w/Radeon HD Graphics 1.40 GHz. Installed RAM of 6 GB. 64-Bit Windows 10 OS. Wired external mouse and keyboard. No additional equipment used or upgrades made to computer.\n\nGameplay and Controls 6/10:  Same as the last game, which actually was a bonus for me, considering how long it took me to get used to the controls in the first place. :p The addition of the hotkey to call on other assassin's was nice, but honestly, I hardly ever used it unless it was required by the goals of the quest I was completing or I was starting to get overwhelmed by the enemies I was fighting and needed backup. Otherwise, my fellow assassin brothers kind of stayed unused. I did like how you could send them on quests to gain more skills and liberate other areas. That I actually found very useful, especially since it improved their combat ability and made them more helpful when you did end up calling on them. I also appreciated how they retained the banking and investment system from the previous game and incorporated it more into the liberation of Rome from the influence of the Templars.\n\nGraphics 9/10:  I'm not sure why, but I actually felt that the graphics were a tiny step down from the previous game. The overall feel of the world was still just as rich, and it made exploring Rome incredibly fun and rewarding, but the characters and animations just seemed...off. Maybe it was a little more \"cookie cutter\" in terms of the extraneous characters? Again, I'm not entirely sure why, and I'd probably have to play AC II and Brotherhood a little bit again to pinpoint exactly what I found to be different. Either way, the graphics were still quite good, as with all of the AC games, and it really wasn't big enough of a difference to change my experience of the game.\n\nStoryline 7/10:  The storyline was still enjoyable, but again, not quite as good as that within AC II. I think the part I liked the most was the history behind the fictional story, which made the whole thing much more immersive. Even with that, however, this game felt much less like one cohesive story and much more like a barely strung together main story supported by numerous side quests and adventures. Whereas playing AC II was like playing through a James Michener novel, with all the rich detail and background to accompany and enhance it, this felt more like reading a short story that had lots of side stories you could read in association with it. That's possibly due to the fact that, whereas AC II covers around thirty years of history, this game only covers a few years. Either way, the story was not as well constructed, but it wasn't terrible either. It was just a little above average. I also played through The Da Vinci Disappearance DLC, and it was like an interesting short story. Even though the Copernicus Conspiracy DLC was supposedly released for PC, I've not been able to find it on my game menus or in the Ubisoft menus, so I can't speak to how good of a story that particular software addition provides.\n\nCharacters 7/10:  Well, Da Vinci is still great, for the little that we see of him. And of course, Ezio is his usual charismatic self, even if he's older and maybe a little grimmer than in AC II. Otherwise, the characters lacked the same depth and variety that they had in AC II. Even the villains, with the exception of Lucrezia Borgia, I found to be very cliche. All of the characters were still somewhat believable, but I didn't feel like leaping through the screen to interact with them like I did in the previous game.\n\nOverall Rating 8/10:  This game is a solid addition to the AC franchise. It's certainly not as strong, beautiful, nor coherent as AC II, but it's still an enjoyable game to play for the most part, and I didn't feel like I was wasting my time, even if I was just wandering around the beautiful city of Rome. Certainly recommend."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504964479, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500409", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34837662", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198343987044", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1506970053, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "playtime_forever": 1059}, "timestamp_updated": 1504964479, "received_for_free": false, "review": "You Should play AC 2 of You Want to know What is Going on Here.
