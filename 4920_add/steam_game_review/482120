However, each match felt exactly the same and once I got the hang of fighting the 3 enemies at once this game had nothing left to offer. The outfits are nice but collecting them all is the closest thing to a goal this game has. If that is enough for you then you might enjoy this game but it wasn't enough for me so I can't recommend it to other people.\n\nI made a more in-depth review here if you want more details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxDUASduM3U", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198054196245", "last_played": 1464995729, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 220, "playtime_forever": 136}, "votes_up": 153, "timestamp_created": 1465001769, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652241", "votes_down": 15, "timestamp_updated": 1465012839, "recommendationid": "23371138", "votes_funny": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Super awesome!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198070547085", "last_played": 1464878104, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 83, "playtime_forever": 75}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1464817949, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.323004", "votes_down": 178, "timestamp_updated": 1464817949, "recommendationid": "23334625", "votes_funny": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I want to echo the other negative reviews. I played through all content game has to offer and got all the achievements so you can't judge me on not being thorough. \n\n[b] Let's start with the Pros. \t[/b]\nGraphics - They are okay nothing standing out too much. But it doesn't grate my eyes, so the style is fine. \nSound - Nothing to write home about either \nCostumes look nice but because of stats attached you won't have time to enjoy their look \nYeah I would've thought pros would be more positive \nNot very long (For this game a Positive) if you do want to buy it then it's a nice time sink to spend 2-3 hours maybe more or less depending on how much this game looks nice to you \n\n [b] Now with the Cons. \t[/b]\nThis game is extremely repetitive. It's like a big step down from the procedurally generated games. It is kind of procedurally generated but in a way that doesn't make it different, you even choose the background. So talking about any sort of thing like level design is off the table. \nEven the costume unlocking mechanic is repetitive. You play a freaking chance like in csgo or something, and costumes would be pretty much the only thing to work towards because if you are, you'll unlock all achievments by the time you get them all. \n\nSo I wouldn't recommend it.
