Most features will be subjective hit or miss to long time HMM serie fans, i love most of them so that's a recommandation.

It's a turn based game with a interesting campaign and fun pve and pvp. With a lot of maps and ability to set up the game just the way you want to some extent. I wish they hadn't removed so many cool factions/races like dwarfs or wood elves. You can only play now as Haven  (your plain old humans), Sanctuary (water people i guess you can call them and my favourite), Dungeon (new DLC dark elves pretty cool), Necropolis (classical undead), Inferno (cool looking demons) and Stronghold (Orcs aka anger issues). I find it way more fun to play with friends than on my own, but I still find it enjoyable if anyone decides to get this game add me on Uplay/Steam so we can play together :). And yes I forgot to mention the annoying part for some is that Uplay is required to play the game. Personally I don't find it that big of a problem. Overall I rate M&M VI a 7.1, also I seriously recommend trying Heroes of Might & Magic V ;)"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505436321, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34960884", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198032346609", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1421933610, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2760}, "timestamp_updated": 1505436321, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Ended support, so this game sucks."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505543101, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34989040", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197962453460", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1505542934, "num_games_owned": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 127}, "timestamp_updated": 1505543101, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Unoptimized, stutters on the campaign map just 5 minutes into the game.
