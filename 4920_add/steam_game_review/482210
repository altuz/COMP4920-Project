Mechanics are decent, and visual are surprisingly great. The problem with it is the amount of content. There are two modes, practice and play (practice but timed). There is nothing other than throwing at still targets. No pass rush, no receivers, no plays or defense. As a huge football fan I wish I could enjoy the game and give it a positive review, but in its current state I can not.\n\n\nEdit: I should mention, the game would be worth around $5 max, I would reccomend the game around that price.

To my surprise I really like this game, good graphics, sounds are good. The mechanics seem a bit robotic, but if they were too realistic I could really see myself getting frustrated because I would miss A LOT! You basically throw the ball toward the target and if you release at just about the right angle it will lock on and hit the target. Play options are light (practice/competition). I played for 20 minutes and i'm ready to go back in and climb the leaderboard.
