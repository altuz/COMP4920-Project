The puzzles are not that good but it is scary in terms of jump scares. The game is very short and I finished everything in 3 hours I think. Definitely play the DLC since that would give you closure of the story. I liked the ending of the DLC and was content regarding that. \n\n[h1]Story][/h1]\nThe story is totally disoriented I played the game believing that it was after the end of the world like an apocalypse, I liked the fact at least some humans are thrown in the game and it is pretty intriguing and keeps your curiosity going. The DLC changes everything in the main game- what you percieved and thought I guess. \n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nNeedless to say for laptops be warned that you need to change the game's graphic processor in order to play. The graphics were beautiful and I really loved the different locations- needless to say the best job was done here in this aspect.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\nI loved the wonderful music it was suspensful at times and soothing when needed. \n\n[h1]Recommendation[/h1]\nTotally wish we could get some in depth info on to the story more from by collecting notes or journals anything. A nice inventory would have been nice for the game. And I personally wish it was longer and was more emotional. More background information about the characters are needed. If there is a sequel of some sort other than the DLC I'd happy to play it \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 208, "steamid": "76561198050637112", "last_played": 1507068715, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 118, "playtime_forever": 208}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1507051020, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502722", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507051020, "recommendationid": "35452220", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game has much potential but not all were used (probably because it's their first game), the graphics are looking good but the walking of the 2 npc's gave me a feel like i was playing s.t.a.l.k.e.r .\n\nThe puzzles were too easy, i didn't had to look twice to figure out how to get to the closed room,\nthe jumpscares were meh maybe because it was all too obvious that and this is going to happen.\n\nThe story was very good, thats what kept me going on in the game but the protagonist never gets heavily injured, i mean he falls down a 20 meters high hole and everything he says is \"argh\", in a closed room about 20m\u00b2 big he has to use a stick of dynamite to blow a metal door away, the explosion occured like 10 meters away from you with no cover and all he said was \"could've been worse\" but like i said this game has much potential but not all were used. The spiders (robots) looked from the beginning very graphic lacking for the max setting and also with a moment where you've gotta run away from an chasing giant spider woul've been pretty shocking. The story is a little confusing, the next moment you are high up on a bridge structur when a giant ass spider appears i mean he really was a big fuck of an arachnida when he ran into the bridge and made it collapse where to try to proceed on the damaged bridge to only have it collapse again to wake up in a very different place, i mean duh, why not at least snow right? Also you can (if you want to) find some gnomes which of some funny placed.

However I accidentally played it before the main game. In the DLC you wander round with no explanation, get shot in the face, wander around some more, murder some guy, wander around a lot more collecting gnomes and then it just comes to an end still with no indication of what is going on. So my first recommendation is don\u2019t play the DLC first.\n\nNow onto the main game, it does give you more of an indication of what is going on but it still really didn\u2019t work for me. When I see a game described as a walking simulator I am expecting a game focusing on story, atmosphere and aesthetics. This game definitely has the last one nailed, the levels really look excellent and capture the sense of the wilderness reclaiming civilisation. Unfortunately it did make me nauseous, I think it is the slight swaying of camera. I could only play for short periods at a time but the game is split into nice short chapters.\n\nThe story however was not great. It is difficult to say much without spoiling it but the progression seems disjointed and nonsensical. The only way I can rationalise the plot is that it was all a guilty delusion or hallucination.\n\nThe biggest problem for me was inclusion of horror, it didn\u2019t work in combination with such a passive form of gameplay. Since all there is to the game is walking around there is no form of peril so the horror elements have no weight to them. I just started shrugging off the cheap jump scares.\n\nSo if you looking for an excellent graphical showcase this is the game for you but if you are looking for more of an engaging story I\u2019d look else where.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972822414", "last_played": 1505029177, "num_reviews": 309, "num_games_owned": 304, "playtime_forever": 213}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1505048701, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504723", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1505048701, "recommendationid": "34861495", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I got the game for 62 cents so I didn't really have any big expectations.\n\nIt feels like a mod for the most part. The story is all over the place and quite honestly I found it quite boring overall (guess I expected something closer to the STALKER or Metro universe).\n\nThe game lacks polish in some parts. For example the menus are strange to navigate and sometimes it is hard to click on the right button. For example in the level overview the buttons aren't highlighted when you hover them - a feature that is basically a standard in all things UI.\n\nThe game has nice atmosphere and you can tell that the dev has put a lot of work into the environments which look quite good most of the time.\n\nAll in all the game comes at a fair price for what it delivers so I give it a recommendation.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 129, "steamid": "76561197989460833", "last_played": 1505998018, "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 295, "playtime_forever": 203}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505998423, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500106", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505998423, "recommendationid": "35103609", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "What a hidden gem this game is .
