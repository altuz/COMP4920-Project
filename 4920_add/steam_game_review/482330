Now you maybe thinking \"But thats standard for games...\" Well yeah, But not for 2D Games... And one of the abilities aka sliding takes SO LONG to do.

If you are familiar with the concept of the Death Star, then you can get the general picture as to the scale of the ship in question.  The map is approximately 15 areas large, with each area connected to each other by way of teleporters.  In my playthrough of the game, you can easily reach most, if not all of the areas with a little backtracking and exploring, which is good in a Metroidvania.  You can gain upgrades by entering into blue cubes, which again, you can find most of them with a little backtracking and exploring.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where my praises of the game will have to come to an end.  The plot of the game seems to be a bit poorly written.  Not that I didn't take away anything good from the story, mind you, just that most of the explanations that they gave for taking away the player's abilities appears to be a bit cliche at best, and the fact that the final boss (referring to the ship's captain) isn't exactly final appears to be ripped right from Metroid.  That isn't to say that taking inspiration isn't entirely bad, it just that it is presented in bad taste, in my opinion.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n\n+ The game is the perfect length for retention.\n+ Most areas of the game are completly accessable with a little backtracking and effort.\n+ Most of the power ups are accessible with trial and error.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n\n- The RPG-like stats are completely unnecessary for a game this size.\n- The writing is severly wanting, though not too terrible compared to what I normally see from AAA publishers.\n\n\nI am proud to give this game a solid 6/10, and I recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198014223463", "last_played": 1496765394, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 103, "playtime_forever": 475}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1496767300, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496767300, "recommendationid": "32223242", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I bought this game with a great discount, however, i can't recommend it due to the next reasons:\n\n\n*All the ways are labyrinths, this is very confusing!\n\n*The map is useless.\n\n*At beginning of play all doors are closed.
