Less of a puzzle and more of an exploration game. Unlike many others this one however does mix in some environmental puzzles and a large mystical world to explore. It doesn\u2019t hold your hand and leaves you to figure things out on your own, such as needing to obtain crystals in order to open various doors and an orb, said to be a soul, that will guide you around some areas, other than that you\u2019re left on your own to wander the lands ahead and this is where the game really comes together for me.\n\nStarting off a little on the slow side but if patience persists you\u2019ll find yourself becoming more and more invested in trying to find new areas and piece together the jigsaw of what happened and what will become of the world. Narration isn\u2019t as prominent in this simulator as it is in others but interacting with various inhabitants begin to tell a story. However, I did find myself lost within it all, never really understanding the bigger picture. Given that this is only the first act of many, I didn\u2019t expect to understand much but perhaps the inclusion of some kind of diary that unlocks pages each time you speak to one of the beings might make for a good addition as it can be on the difficult side to follow. Hopefully that\u2019s something that will be addressed in later acts. As for now, the asking price of \u00a315 may put some people off seeing as the game can be completed within 2 to 5 hours but it is in my opinion a solid start for an interesting project I look forward to learning more about.\n\nThat\u2019s perhaps the one consideration people should take into account before purchasing, this is an exploration game more than a puzzle game and if you have little interest in learning about the world and its inhabitants then you might be disappointed but if like myself, you enjoy exploring magical lands you\u2019d be well advised to think about purchasing this. It\u2019s a beautiful world, perhaps one of the most impressive I\u2019ve seen of the Unity engine. The architecture at times reminded me of giant cathedrals from many fantasy works as well as an exploration of the mind. Music fits in perfectly, never being too quiet nor too over the top. It acts as an ambient sound that\u2019s always there to help enhance the visuals. This game in my opinion is all about the architecture. It felt at times as a visual reference into the minds of the developers, which should be noted consists of just two individuals as far as I can see. It can be a little rough around the edges with little bugs here and there but nothing game breaking. Compared to many other indie early access games that\u2019s a good start as not once did the game spew out its insides and drag me back to my desktop. I played through the first act and several hours had went by without me realising. The game is rather slow paced. Others might find this off putting but speeding the pace might also have the player miss out on some breathtaking visuals. I found myself stopping several times just to take a few screenshots to act as a memorabilia for myself to look back on. They can be seen in my gallery if you\u2019re interested.\n\nIf you\u2019re able to look past the minor bugs here and there and the fact that this game is a walking simulator by a very small team, then you might just find yourself being drawn in by the visuals and investing interest into finding out what exactly is this place you find yourself wandering through. Is this life after death or something else entirely?\n\nReviewer notes: Essence is a project I randomly stumbled upon around a year ago that caught my attention. Since then I\u2019ve followed the development as I am a university student myself studying Video Games Development. Having spoken to a developer a couple times I can say I\u2019m pleased to have purchased this game and I look forward to further updates especially if the inclusion of VR is done well. That\u2019s something I assume is quite some time away but I believe may be worth the wait.

Some simulations use their theme and great narration to help compensate for the lack of interactivity (The Stanley Parable) while others rely on a story heavy atmosphere and pretty visuals (Everybody's Gone to the Rapture). Essence appears to be attempting the latter, focusing more on enriched landscapes and the vagueness of the story. Unfortunately, due to the nature of early access and the splintered state of the game, the overall build is hampered by a short run time that fails to captivate.\n\nThe player wakes up with a clean slate: no past, no present, and no identity. The world is in ruins and the truth is hidden somewhere within. Messages are scattered about the land, held in the hands of sculptures that hold pieces of information. The problem: this information is extremely limited in terms of answering any real questions. I am eager to learn more about the past inhabitants of these ruins, what each world has to do with the progression of the player's path toward enlightenment, and the point of the men standing guard before each new area. I am sure I missed a few orbs with a few more clues and I know that not everything will be answered in the first act, but the lack of context is the main drawback for the current act as well as a side effect of being released in fragments.\n\nThe first act is available at the moment and contains three main areas with six smaller areas that must be cleared to progress (took me a little over an hour and a half). The main issue is keeping the user engrossed long enough to bypass each level. I will admit a couple of the locations are beautiful, mainly the forested region in the second area and the architecture right before the final walkway, but graphics are not enough to carry a game. Some of the levels have environmental triggers that need to be activated or some jumping to reach the next destination, but they are too simplistic for me to qualify them as puzzles. Most of the time it is activating something to get your bearings in one of the smaller levels. Frankly, I felt bored out of my mind. Once you have seen one dilapidated building you have seen them all. This is why narrations usually help in these times of lower activity.\n\nAside from the graphical appeal, the game does have a standard ambient soundtrack. My only issue with it comes from the audio being too soft in most cases, making it easy to drown it out with the impact of the player's jumping. Two movements speeds are present, one equating to a slug's pace and the other to a moderate jog. I am not ashamed to admit I was jogging the entire time, thankful that the game comes with a toggle for the faster speed. I found myself spamming the jump button to speed things up further, discovering that your body gets stuck to terrain if you jump against it. It is also possible to get stuck in areas that are too tall to escape, which can be fixed with the \"reset position\" button in the menu. It ends up teleporting the player back to their previous auto-save point (the game only uses auto-save), which is better than forcing a complete restart. \n\nFor the first early access version, it ran relatively well in terms of frame rate. There is an issue with stuttering, however, that is more apparent in the second and third areas. The loading times can be a bit lengthy too. On the crash front, I did experience one loading screen freeze during a transition to the second area. Other than the high contrast making the options menu somewhat difficult to read, this version was halfway decent. \n\nMost of my points regarding the story and the scenery are purely perspective. That is the problem with reviewing something leaning more toward the lines of abstract interpretation than straightforward context. I have my own theory regarding the story, mostly steaming from the cycle of suffering and reincarnation, but without the other two acts I cannot judge the game properly. I can, however, judge the current product the same way I do everything else: value. $20 for a short act with little to no replay-ability is asking a lot. I will come back once all three acts are available for a more complete review, but for the time being I cannot recommend it.\n\nThis has been a EAW PSA.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000561257", "last_played": 1492573169, "num_reviews": 87, "num_games_owned": 2901, "playtime_forever": 101}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1492969031, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500421", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1492984487, "recommendationid": "31324907", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
