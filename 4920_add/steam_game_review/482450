Thus, you will encounter some mechanics from similar games such as air-dashes, a focus on long and flashy combos, burst and roman cancel systems, etc.\nLike other fighters of this subgenre, normals are split into three buttons: A, B, and C, representing Light, Medium, and Heavy attacks.  This game also include additional buttons D and E for even slower and stronger normals, as well as a universal dash-cancelling system.\n\nThe game has a visual novel styled story mode.  The roles of the characters are presented such that knowledge of their original source isn't needed too much.\n\nThe sound effects are decent, and the music is pretty dang awesome.  Every character has their own theme that plays during fights.  You will generally hear the theme for player 2's character, like it or not.\n\nCommand buffering is VERY lenient.  I'd honestly say this is one of the easiest fighting games to get into thanks to the buffer, as it helps to learn basic combos when you first start out.  That said, there's still a lot of depth with its various systems such as the dash cancelling and assist systems.\n\nUnfortuantely, the AI is mostly a joke.  I can easily breeze through fights against them without much problem.\n\nAs per usual fighting game tradition, the final boss of arcade mode is a cheater.  One can easily dominate against the last boss with proper knowledge of their character and the game mechanics, but making a single mistake can be very punishing.\n\nOnline is unfortunately not that active, but one can set up matches within the community discord.\n\nMy only gripe with this game is that the keyboard remapping could be improved.  P1 is locked into using WASD and P2 is locked into using the arrow keys for movement.  There's no way to switch them.  Additionally, P2 cannot remap their buttons to any of the WASD keys, so if you're used to using those keys.  You will need to use an external program to use them for attacks..", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198108044853", "last_played": 1504158867, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 257, "playtime_forever": 3893}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505086807, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507202", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505086807, "recommendationid": "34873320", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Typical beat em up game where dodge or blocking don't work anymore at the half of the game and the final fight is a unfair combo pushing b*tch that even dont let you stand back up, so just like always.\n\nDONT PAY MORE as 2bucks for it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992540088", "last_played": 1505173310, "num_reviews": 56, "num_games_owned": 458, "playtime_forever": 52}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1505172919, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481806", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1505238788, "recommendationid": "34892046", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
