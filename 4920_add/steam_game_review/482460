I very much enjoy the full control system, even on keyboard and mouse. It takes a little time to get used to, but total freedom over your attacks is amazing. Only thing I would complain about right now are few minor glitches, optimization, scarcity of content and the lack of multiplayers which are to be expected from an early access game at this stage. Well worth the 15\u20ac in my opinion.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198028761599", "last_played": 1500747249, "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 636}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499546252, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499546252, "recommendationid": "33385067", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
