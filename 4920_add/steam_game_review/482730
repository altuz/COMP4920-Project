I played Football Manager 2015 and 2016 prior to FM2017. This game promised better gameplay and better 3D graphics. I noticed the graphics improvement in the match simulation. The gameplay did not feel that much better than FM2016. The social media feature seemed a bit empty. I suppose it's informative to know what supporters think of transfers and match results, but there is no real significance. In the match simulation, there are more bizarre results, such as losing 3-0 in a match that my team is the favorite to win. The extra randomness seems out of control. \n\nAlso, the player valuations match the out of control real world values. The transfers are annoying now especially if I start bidding on the low end. With a low bid, the selling club will automatically tack on a permanent sell-on percentage. Usually, I have to pay a large premium on the transfer fee to get around the ridiculous sell-on percentage (around 20%-50%). Transfers are wild now especially when I saw Antoine Griezmann move for $100 million+ in two different saves. I suppose the best I can do is look for bargain bin buys in places, such as East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa.\n\nOne questionable thing in the scout reports that bothers me is the current ability of certain players. Why are so many top-level players considered \"world-class\" in a team? In my experience, I have seen this in FM2015 and FM2016. Sometimes, I can understand the \"world-class\" rating if it's the fastest attacking right-back, the unstoppable box-to-box midfielder, the tackling king ball-winning midfielder, the assist machine winger, the prolific striker, or the greatest shot stopper goalkeeper. I think it's time to add in new current ability descriptors especially for ratings below \"world-class.\" Some possible ideas could be regional ratings, \"Star Player in the Europa League,\" \"Star Player in the Champions League,\" \"Star Player in Europe,\" \"Star Player in North America,\" or \"Leading player in Champions League.\" I think some players would appreciate some more meaningful variety in describing the players' current ability especially if this player is at the top-level although not world-class.\n\nI can predict in the future for FM2018 that the player valuations and transfer procedures will be even more ridiculous with Neymar Jr.'s 222 million Euro move to Paris Saint-Germain. Maybe PSG, Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, Manchester United, and Manchester City will be programmed to be even more ruthless in the transfer market by paying 100 million Euros plus on a big transfer every year. The inflation will be extraordinary. I hope the gameplay improvements in FM2018 will be more significant and meaningful, such as toning down the randomness of matches back to FM2016 levels.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198109349211", "last_played": 1502855287, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_forever": 32822}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505257908, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499424", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505257908, "recommendationid": "34909986", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not worth buying", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198242256100", "last_played": 1499939496, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_forever": 335}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506174445, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498040", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506174445, "recommendationid": "35154033", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Garbage!!!!!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 523, "steamid": "76561198086500063", "last_played": 1506188233, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 1905}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506187432, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496412", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506187432, "recommendationid": "35159339", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not much to it, once uv'e played 10 mins u've played 1546 hours.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 11892, "steamid": "76561198079703974", "last_played": 1507190931, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_forever": 109291}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504826970, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501893", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504826970, "recommendationid": "34804563", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Excellent game!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "steamid": "76561198013250669", "last_played": 1507049887, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_forever": 28077}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1507062524, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500437", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1507062524, "recommendationid": "35456071", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "sucks", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198054177527", "last_played": 1505746143, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 196, "playtime_forever": 4095}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505742012, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498457", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505742012, "recommendationid": "35045427", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "gasdase", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "steamid": "76561198263790119", "last_played": 1506168716, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 4918}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506156524, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501918", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506156524, "recommendationid": "35147793", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It is so hard to keep a good player in a low-reputation team in FM2017~ \nPrice is a little bit high considering only a few changes of the series,\nI would recommend you to buy only one version between FM2012-FM2017 (In my point, FM2014 is the harder one)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 3739, "steamid": "76561198107570236", "last_played": 1507170054, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 158, "playtime_forever": 9080}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506508159, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506508159, "recommendationid": "35239128", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A moment of silence for my GPA and social life.
