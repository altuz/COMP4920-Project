The quest then resolves via a predetermined \"battle effect\" or if not combat based is automatically passed. You can skip the waiting period by using a donut which of course you can buy more of for real money.\n\nThis isn't even a decent model of gameplay for an idle type game.

The game's entire budget has apparently gone to art, so there would be pretty pictures. And the pictures are indeed quite pretty. \n\nBut there's no GAME here. You don't actually... PLAY anything. You just click and stare. There's no strategy or planning involved. You just spend all the various in-game points to get stuff, and when you run out you are done playing until tomorrow when you get some more points. \n\nOr, you know, you can buy some donuts. \n\nIf you can afford to throw a bunch of cash at this game, I don't know, maybe it gets fun eventually.

So I really am enjoying this idle game, but there are a number of things I wish it did better.  For starters, some things either aren't explained or aren't explained well.  This is due to trying to force a game that already existed elsewhere with its own community onto Steam for whatever bizarre reason and this wouldn't be the first time.\n\nThe game is basically a superhero themed idle game with a fair amount of humor thrown in.  You'll be repeating a lot of the same missions and eventually fall into a groove of balancing missions, training, duels, league fights, team management, hideout management, etc.  It's not a bad game overall and there are plenty of collectibles, achievements, etc., but my one major gripe is fighting is very random.\n\nThere are many times my character is WAY better than another, yet I lose.  There have been times where I can also take out enemies that are way over my level.  It really comes down to luck more than stats, which is annoying because it makes it harder to calculate the outcome of any particular encounter.  Overall, the game isn't bad, but you could simply play the game directly from the website rather than Steam and the battles really need to be a little more fine-tuned.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010395257", "last_played": 1486218762, "num_reviews": 190, "num_games_owned": 935, "playtime_forever": 3502}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1486126552, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1486126552, "recommendationid": "29668673", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A cute and easy time-sink game", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010239095", "last_played": 1489317224, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 96, "playtime_forever": 44491}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1486929559, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1486929559, "recommendationid": "29881572", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It good and fun but need to spend alot of money/times to progress..", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198064785014", "last_played": 1471028956, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 286, "playtime_forever": 9948}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1487787543, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497025", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1487787543, "recommendationid": "30104401", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "a really fun super heroes game you make your own super heroe and help people on amazing quest\n\n\nis kinda a idle game so no much gameplay but the art style is fun to watch and it have a charming sense of humor \n\nif you like idle game this is one you should check", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198095693072", "last_played": 1488701037, "num_reviews": 175, "num_games_owned": 224, "playtime_forever": 366}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1487916132, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494919", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1487916132, "recommendationid": "30134623", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A fun game, try it out (for now).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198059955122", "last_played": 1489721384, "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 122, "playtime_forever": 3659}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1487149767, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500278", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1487149767, "recommendationid": "29937881", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "\nI do not like that shit, but I play it", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198248988710", "last_played": 1487346090, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 53, "playtime_forever": 6939}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1485799069, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492529", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1485799069, "recommendationid": "29589765", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "ADD FUCKING FULLSCREEN IN THE GAME\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198108723785", "last_played": 1488750469, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 4836}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485694499, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499514", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1485694499, "recommendationid": "29563627", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's fun!
