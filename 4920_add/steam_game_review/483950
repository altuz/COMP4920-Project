It uses an 960x540 resolution that you can't change. It has also no scripting support. Means you end up with problems like changing UI, Hud, Battle System, Skill Animation, Graphics, features like jumping, craftings, party size, and much more. The sad thing is that it doesn't even had a character generator so you where extremely limited with your playable charakters and yeah, it has a generator now but I have to pay for it? Rlly? A feature which has to be in this program from the beginning? Why do I have to pay for each feature it must have had from the beginning? It's  already 73.99 \u20ac and I still have to pay more for a missing feature? Well as for now I can not support this. It looks really good but if I do have to pay everytime a new feature appears then it's just a rip off. All other RPG Makers are getting these features for free just to make it possible to the costumers to make better games. \n\nAll NOT summer purchased people will get this generator for free and all other people well what should I say about that. I don't mind to pay something for more textures but I also will not do this again with Smile Game Builder because I did that and there was also a lack of Face sets so I ended up with useless purchased DLC because there where no faces I could use to make some new playable characters. Hope it will be better one day but for now I can not give here a thumbs up.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198124306836", "last_played": 1501594231, "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 87, "playtime_forever": 1390}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1502731631, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511422", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1502732139, "recommendationid": "34239911", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I was waiting for a long time a program like this where I can create Art in it and make it alive.

RPG Maker has the advantage in that it has more years under its belt and looking at it, this developer appears to have a positive attitude to what it patches and updates with. \n\nWith the FBX support, it does mean people with 3D knowledge can import their own media. \nThey also provide a generic \"box man\" 3D model for those less skilled in 3D to modify that. This is useful in that I have managed to attach my own models to limbs in Blender and export to Smile without needing to tough any animation. \n\nAnd for a mere \u00a36, you can get their character editor, which is going to be extremely useful for the portion of users who can't 3D model/animate. It allows you to mix and match parts of character models and paint your own textures. It's basic, but powerful enough to give decent enough results for that personal touch. \n\nI would like more customisation options, but they are gradually adding more in that respect. When I was originally looking into this product, I was a bit miffed they did not have a 3D battle system, then when returning found they introduced one, which made me happy. \n\nFrom a developer perspective? It's obviously not aimed to any kind of high end development, but more the bedroom coders, like myself. Having a full time job and other commitments, although I spent my teenage and early adulthood teaching myself 3D modelling, animation and coding to exact my own project ideas, only to come out with a demo, it is appealing. If I didn't have time constraints, I'd likely pursue my project ideas through Unity3D, but as they're turnbased RPG's, I ended up putting it as a toss-up between RPG Maker MV and this. RPG Maker MV being JavaScript and therefore I'd be able to make my own customisations in code if need be, especially as I have decent JavaScript knowledge. But I'd be sacrificing the 3D perspective I wanted for 2D. So this tool actually suffices enough to do what I need it to do. \n\nAnd I have high hopes for what the developer brings in future updates.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197990162989", "last_played": 1505649952, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 204, "playtime_forever": 2069}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1502894510, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500296", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1502894510, "recommendationid": "34277459", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
