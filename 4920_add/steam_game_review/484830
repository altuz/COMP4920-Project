The music and atmosphere is great, and its an interesting style of puzzle. With that said, though, VR does nothing special for this game (asides immersion) which is unfortunate, and the hitboxes in the puzzles can be quite frustrating (resulting in tons of respawns). Load times are quick, though, and for the price it's a worthy pickup for a unique puzzler. I won't be playing it much at a time, but the game is small enough to leave installed and the controls are simple to remember after taking a long hiatus.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002049680", "last_played": 1499596187, "num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 214, "playtime_forever": 34}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499596456, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499596456, "recommendationid": "33400334", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I gave this game a try and I must say it's pretty good!
