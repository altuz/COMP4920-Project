While not very graphically intensive (which is good for anyone suffering from low frame rates), it has unique and ultra fun game dynamics, such as zero-G jetpack mode. There are tons of maps and game modes to play around with, including a few wave-based single player modes and bot matches. \n\nBUT... The sad truth is that it is a rare occasion when you will find other players to play a match with because most VR gamers are playing newer shooters like Pavlov. I like Pavlov, but this game beats it out in playability, which is why I'm baffled as to why so few play it.\n\nBUT don't let that discourage you from this game! If the player-base picks up (from people like you giving it a chance) then this game has a second chance at life. I often check to see if other people are playing and will gladly jump into a match if I see an open lobby. I will also randomly play a few bot matches to see if any players will jump in, which does happen on occasion.\n\nI recommend downloading it, especially if you see it on sale! Even the base price isn't asking too much for what it is.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "steamid": "76561198207788729", "last_played": 1506914873, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 36, "playtime_forever": 1387}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506654065, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506654065, "recommendationid": "35280466", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
