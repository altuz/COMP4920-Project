I never imagined that a game maker could mess up WASD and somehow make the \"input detection\" feel a bit off or delayed, but this game somehow managed to mess that up, not to mention I payed 7 bucks for this game, and after playing the game for a few minutes, I feel as though a better price would be 3 dollars or 4 dollars at most\n\nWhat was most disappointing tho is that you can't do a single player game as the \"ghosts\"\n\nTo conclude this review of Crazy Otto, the game is a fun and unique take on the Pac-Man formula, but has it's problems and it needs to be addressed/patched, just don't expect much for the single player content and note that multi-player is where this game shines. This game is overall an ok game, but I would NOT pay 7 dollars for the game and wait until the price goes down, and in genreal, expect something unique and nice, but nothing that's groundbreaking or drool generating\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198202524232", "last_played": 1478414048, "num_reviews": 34, "num_games_owned": 205, "playtime_forever": 32}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1465806058, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515148", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1465806058, "recommendationid": "23533330", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I've followed this game's development with great interest.  How is it, after more than 36 years, no one has ever tried a multiplayer PacMan?  Other than a \"your turn, my turn\" approach....\n\nAs this game demonstrates - there are enough characters, even if you just stick to the orginal arcade titles.... PacMan, Ms. PacMan, Baby PacMan, and PacMan Jr. - and the four ghosts....  There you go - 2 teams of 4.\n\nWell, this obviously isn't PacMan.  It's Crazy Otto.... it's not even the Crazy Otto that became Ms. PacMan. It's its own thing.  PacMan is well... a PacMan - and he (along with the rest of his Pac family) fight Ghosts.  The old-school Crazy Otto was some sort of PacMan-like-thing with legs, and he (or it) fought ghost-like fruit-like thingies....  This game is all about Ducks and Dinosaurs.\n\nThe controls could use some tightening, and I really hope to see a Super Otto at some point, who can eat eat to unlock doors and grow to Super Sized and just eat through walls and whatnot...  Also vertical warp zones would be great (top to bottom).\n\nOverall, I support and promote it because it takes a third-of-a-century old game and tries something brand new with it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025077833", "last_played": 1478640277, "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 4638, "playtime_forever": 496}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1466052547, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504437", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1466052547, "recommendationid": "23591042", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "For the uninitiated, \"Crazy Otto\" circa 1981 holds a special place in arcade history as the game that would eventually become Ms. Pac-man after being acquired by Bally Midway.  When I first saw this appear on the upcoming releases list, I was floored.  After 35 years, the \"prototype\" version of Ms. Pac was going to be an actual product that I could purchase and play on Steam.  I couldn't have been more excited!\n\nUnfortunately, \"2016's Crazy Otto\" as it's being called by developer Extend Mode isn't exactly the game I was hoping for.  Yes, there are striking similarities between their version and videos/gameplay of the original that can be found on YouTube and other streaming sites.  However, anyone going into this thinking they are getting the [I]actual[/I] Crazy Otto arcade ROM from decades gone by will likely be disappointed.\n\nFortunately though, that's where most of the negatives effectively end with this version.  2016's Crazy Otto is a very capable Ms. Pac-man clone that both looks and plays the part successfully.  The graphics, sounds, and gameplay all capture what the Pac series (and it's seemingly endless number of derivatives) felt like in the early-mid 80's.  Of course, this version of Crazy Otto changes the formula up quite a bit to provide a different experience and challenges.  These changes include \"bonus fruits\" appearing in different positions, power pellets replenishing, and character positions not resetting (game keeps going) when Otto dies.  These help to differentiate Otto from the plethora of other Pac-man clones both past and present.  They've even included a multiplayer mode that looks pretty fun and frantic, especially if you can gather up 7 other people (and controllers) to play locally.\n\nSadly, there doesn't appear to be an online MP component that would making sourcing people to fill those 7 spots all the more easier.  During my time with the game, the controls have also become a slight point of contention.  While mostly serviceable, they can feel a bit slippery and imprecise when playing with the analog stick on an Xbox 360 or Xbox One gamepad.  Support for the D-pad (which seems to have been omitted) tends to clear this up, but more recent official Pac-man titles seem to do a better job with analog stick inputs than Otto does.\n\nNonetheless, 2016's Crazy Otto does enough things right to warrant a purchase from both old-school and newer Pac-man fans alike.  While us classic arcade gamers are not quite getting the [I]original[/I] Crazy Otto with this release, we're getting a game that borrows enough from that title, while adding quite a few interesting features that change the gameplay just enough to make it feel fresh and fun.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970262142", "last_played": 1487807267, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 195, "playtime_forever": 219}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1466776600, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500684", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1467031127, "recommendationid": "23756817", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's fucking awful.\n\nDon't even think about buying this as a joke, it is fundamentally broken.\n\n10/10 would recommend.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198029062932", "last_played": 1465804374, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 496, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1465804436, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467094", "votes_down": 25, "timestamp_updated": 1465804436, "recommendationid": "23533102", "votes_funny": 9, "voted_up": false}]}
