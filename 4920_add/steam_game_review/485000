You get 8 lousy scenarios, and for an extra $5, you can get the \"full\" game with 8 more for a total of 16.  That's it.  You also have the option of replaying them in hard mode, or playing the AI on Easy or Hard mode in a straight up battle with no modifiers. Whee.\n\nEven if they didn't bother to throw in different cards, there should have been at least 3 to 4 times as many scenarios, with at least a few changes in level-specific modifiers to spice things up. One modifier in the game prevents you for buying purple cards, another makes Initiates cheaper for everyone, or the AI gets all card prefilled prerequisites. All this code is already in place, the only thing they would have needed to do is  switch it around every few levels. It wouldn't have been that difficult to make the game significantly longer. As it it, it feels unfinished, and nowhere near worth the price they're asking.\n\nIf you can get the Full game (with the expansion) for under $5, go for it, but as it stands, this game feels like they got it to the point where it was working physically, but forgot to go back in and add any actual content.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024130503", "last_played": 1498459250, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 420, "playtime_forever": 777}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1498445536, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502377", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1498445536, "recommendationid": "32797579", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
