Let that sink in for a minute.[/b] \n\nKnowing that, if you're still down for this VN, then yes, I would recommend you to get it just for the art and music. The story is divided into 2 arcs. The first is very sweet and fluffy and typical romance. The second one takes a sharp turn into darker, more 'wtf' territory. In my opinion the first arc is well written, made my cringe and do all the things that fluffy things do, and the second one... is okay. For some routes I think the psychological horror schtick was a little contrived for shaking out angst and horror. I'm a chickenshit though and usually horror is not my cup of tea. \n\nThere are 9 ends to the game. 1 bad and 1 good end for each romance option and 1 option where you end up with no one and the game ends early. Like some other reviews have said, most of the psychological horror shit comes from bad ends. But even in some 'good ends' I felt like the horror was a [i]very[/i] cheap way of 'maturing' the protagonist Asuka by literally throwing her into some ridiculous dark drama.

While visual novels are generally not literary masterpieces (and this one is certainly not), the writing in Nurse Love Addiction is generally good, the plot is suitably lengthy, and the scenario and plot twists turn into an entertaining, emotional rollercoaster.  This story is \"yuri\" in the sense that the it is about girls that fall in love with each other, but 'love' itself is explored in this visual novel in a emotional and literary manner.  Some scenes are (highly) suggestive (including some kissing and awkward moments) but there is not really any erotic or hentai elements here.\n\nStrong points:\n- The story (and translation) do a good job transitioning the main character (Asuka) from a clueless airhead at the start to someone that grows as the story progress.  The story has interesting twists, and the plot does strongly depend on which path is chosen by the player.\n- Unlike many other visual novels, Nurse Love Addiction is nearly completely voiced, including that of the main character.  The voice acting is superb, particularly for Asuka (voiced by Azumi Asakusa) and her imouto Nao (Ai Kakuma).\n- There are \"bad\" endings to the game, which allow each character's personality to be explored in compared to the \"good\" endings.\n- The art is generally well-drawn and bright, which is appropriate for most of the scenes in the visual novel.\n\nWeak points:\n- I experienced technical issues with the game where the engine occasionally freezes or stutters for brief moments.  It was never clear what caused these issues, and while annoying the minor hiccups did not severely impact my enjoyment of the game.  The worst impact of the stuttering is when the game plays the ending video for each character's \"good\" ending, where the hiccups cause the video and the music to be repeatedly interrupted.  (And I really like the end theme too, Kimi to no mirai (A Future with You), sung by Yumi Hara.  At least I was able to fully appreciate it by buying the optional soundtrack DLC.)\n- While the quality of the art is superb, there is not a lot of it.

It isn't. Some other reviews and the Steam tags have suggested it contains elements of horror. It doesn't. I mention these facts, not as criticisms, but simply to advise that if romance, titillation and/or a scary atmosphere are what you're after, you'll be disappointed. Personally I'd done my homework and bought it [i]because[/i] it wasn't a yuri VN, however it wasn't quite as subversive as I had hoped.\n\nAsuka is a first year student at Teito Nursing Academy. She's there because she found a scrawl in the back of a childhood picture book which indicated she wanted to become a nurse. She doesn't remember writing it, so wants to pursue this career path a bit further to see what could have possibly drawn her to it in years past. Older sister to Nao by age, she's actually quite infantile in her behaviour and relies on Nao for complex life skills like getting out of bed and microwaving food. While at the academy she meets Sakuya and Itsune, both of whom alternate between treating her with kindness and contempt, but she befriends them anyway. This is the jumping-off point for a story which really doesn't have much to do with any of that.\n\nThe characters are all paper-thin and not particularly endearing, much like the world of NLA itself. It also takes quite a while to get to the real meat of the story. In the run-up you need to endure a liberal peppering of the standard sort of irritating, unrealistic, irrelevant slice-of-life exchanges: (fictitious example) \"You know, you really shouldn't eat bananas before paragliding...\" \"Waaaaah, but I love bananas!!!\" \"Uh uh uh, senpai Marimurimato says that bananas can cause gas when combined with stomach-churning activities. That could be quite embarrassing.\" \"Hmmm... that's a good point... okay, I will eat bananas when I return.\" \"Yayyy!!!\" [My sister's eyes gleam with enormous pride at my developing sensibilities concerning food consumption.]\n\nIf it needed to be classified by genre, I'd probably call NLA a mystery novel. I'd love to elaborate on that further, but the mystery of NLA lies not only in the answers, but what are even the right questions. The yuri stuff really is just window dressing. I never felt as if Asuka was building even the faintest semblance of a real relationship with any of the other characters. Rather, the various \"love interests\" simply act as facilitators for the conveyance of different pieces of the mystery, with a couple of brief smooches sprinkled in. On that note it's also worth mentioning that up until the final chapter each route is substantially the same, most choices are inconsequential, and the good and bad endings are determined solely by the final choice, so there's not a tonne of story content. I found my first run quite engaging, as questions and new plot points are introduced at a steady rate, which left me hungry for answers, but the revelations in subsequent runs felt comparatively minor.\n\nAn exception to what I wrote above is dear sensei Kaede's route, which is stereotypical VN romance fare. It's pretty facile, has no relevance whatsoever to the broader story, and can safely be skipped entirely. I actually think the game is weaker for its inclusion, as it's a total waste of time and could easily give the wrong impression to a player unfortunate enough to have it as their first experience.\n\nThe bad endings are a common point of discussion around NLA. Yes, the consequences are a lot worse than the standard failure to get the girl, but they're far from soul-shattering, tear-inducing festivals of despair. My reactions were more along the lines of \"lol wut\" as most rely on Asuka doing things which are quite literally insane. Granted, she's not the sharpest tool in the shed, but she's nonetheless totally compos mentis, which make these abrupt excursions into nutville pretty hard to take seriously.\n\nIs it worth $40? Not even close. I got it for half price and still feel short-changed. The only sprites in the game are those of the major characters, their poses are very limited, and there is maybe a couple-dozen backgrounds. By VN standards the writing is serviceable but far from impressive. It is fully-voiced (in Japanese), so I guess that's what you're plunking down most of the dosh for, but personally I couldn't care less about voice acting in VNs, as I just skip to the next dialogue box as soon as I'm done reading. Price is ultimately the deciding factor in what side of the not / recommended binary I'm putting this on. $40 is a premium price for an interesting but ultimately lacklustre product. If this was closer to $10 I'd say yeah, check it out on a whim, though don't expect to be blown away, but $40 is much too prohibitive for that sort of exploratory purchase.
