The only difference is, you're not in a spaceship shooting at asteroids, and you don't have missiles, but instead you have mines and lasers. The idea is to defend planet Earth (literally, it's Earth floating in front of your face) for as long as possible.  You have the option of having a platform to stand on in space or if you don't mind looking down and seeing the void of space beneath your feet, you can remove the platform.  I don't know if any asteroids are supposed to come from beneath the planet or not.  I mostly kept the platform visible and didn't see any asteroids coming from below.\n\nOn the easiest difficulty, they give you 4 lasers that you can reposition around the planet.  Two of those are beam lasers and two are \"pew pew\" lasers.  Each one occupies a \"shell\" layer over the earth so they'll never collide with one another, but if you block one laser with the other, then only one will ever fire.  Obviously the beam lasers are more effective at destroying asteroids so you want those for the big asteroids or anything that's particularly close.\n\nNow if this was the only thing you had to worry about, you could just take those four lasers and keep swinging them around the planet to destroy various asteroids as they make their way for Earth.  Unfortunately there's also the matter of an alien drone (maybe more than one) that will show up to take potshots at your lasers, or any mines you might have placed.  I don't know what has these Aliens so mad at us that they'd be willing to sabotage our attempts at salvation but screw those guys.... so I always make sure to get a beam laser focused on them as soon as possible.  They tend to move too fast for the \"pew pew\" laser to take em out.\n\nMines are in limited supply though you earn more as you destroy asteroids, They're pretty much a last ditch effort against incoming asteroids though so I wouldn't try to set up a mine field and hope that you will be safe...especially since as I said, the aliens will show up and take shots at them.  Basically if you see that you're overwhelmed and you need to destroy an asteroid while all your lasers are busy, you can put a mine in the path of the asteroid instead.\n\nIn real life, destroying these asteroids would just make a bunch of smaller asteroids that would hit the earth like a shotgun instead of like a cannon, but from what I've seen they don't do that in this game.  However, if you have a laser positioned so that debris from an exploded asteroid would fly in front of it, the laser will still shoot at the pieces.\n\nUltimately though your planet DOES get destroyed, and most of the time you're left wondering \"Where the fuck did that come from?\"  In most of my games it seemed like the shot that took out the Earth came out of nowhere...possibly from overhead.  It would be nice if there was a replay mode so I could see how the Earth was lost.\n\nThings I liked:\n[list]\n [*] The graphics are OK.  The Earth is decently detailed though it's not going to blow you away as you shout \"I can see my house from here!\".  \n [*] It benefits from having VR since you need to be able to easily look in all directions to detect incoming threats\n [*] You don't need a ton of space to play this.  Probably the standard 2m x 1.5m size would be enough.  However, if you DO have more space, you can use it to place mines further away \n[/list]\n\nThings I didn't like:\n [*] You don't always see the final blow, and there's no instant replay or anything\n [*] When the Earth blows up it actually just fragments into several chunks and kinda floats there.  (You can knock it away with your vive controllers though)\n [*] The aliens are more of a nuisance than anything.  It's like trying to play ping pong while mosquitos are swarming around you.   \n [*] On the main menu, they make you grab a laser (like for defense) and use that to shoot the menu option you want rather than just letting you reach out and touch it.  I don't want to shoot the menu option till it explodes, I just want to get the game started.\n [*] The game is really low action for too long and it seems like it needs \"waves\" to start the action, and also to give you a break in the action.  There should be a separate \"endurance\" mode.\n[/list]\n\nOverall it's not a bad game, but it's Early access... It really needs more game modes.... online co-op would be awesome, some kind of game mode where the action comes in waves would be nice...Maybe add the option to throw mines so that you can destroy asteroids that way.   Make some cool in game music (I don't remember any music in the game, so if it's there it doesn't stick with you at all).  It's a cool \"demo\" for VR at the moment though.  \n\nI look forward to the continued development of this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969913402", "last_played": 1468888708, "num_reviews": 149, "num_games_owned": 1966, "playtime_forever": 31}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1467687251, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516852", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1467687305, "recommendationid": "24099274", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very well done if simplistic VR game.  The graphics are passable, don't really need much for flying space rocks, and the controls work flawlessly.  You move around turrets on a sphere a fixed distance from the planet and aim that at hunks of red glowing rocks flying at you from all angles (except directly below you).  It's simple, there doesn't appear to be much more mechanics yet besides a flying ufo that will screw you over royally if you don't laser it immediately.  \n\nMy main gripes are the rocks seem to pop in fairly close by sometimes.  I'm constantly scanning the 360 view and sometimes one is right next to me less than a second later and boom.  \n\nI hope the dev can add a few more gameplay mechanics, but I still feel it's well worth $5.  One thing I instinctly tried to do and was more dissapointed then I have any right to be was after the planet explodes, I really wanted to be able to swing my controllers through the pieces, grab nearby asteroids and hurtle them into the remnants and scatter the pieces to the void in my frustration...alas there is no clipping in this game.\n\nOther nice to haves would be powerups, ability to choose which satellites to build, and some sort of tower defense style resource system to build new or upgrade existing ones.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198303758838", "last_played": 1466648173, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 110, "playtime_forever": 35}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1465270263, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513813", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1465270263, "recommendationid": "23428915", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A simple game and although only early access it is difficult to see how it could develop much further, so I doubt it will hold long term apeal BUT what it does it does very well.
