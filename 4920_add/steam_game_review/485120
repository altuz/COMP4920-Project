Unfortunately this is pretty much the whole game. There's no online multiplayer and single player is extremely limited and gets boring really quickly without bots or any real goal apart from timed runs.\n\nI wouldn't recommend Frog Climbers unless you already have several gamepads and local friends to play the game with.
