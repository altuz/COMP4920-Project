This game should be never touch.\nIt has good element and I enjoy the first 4 chapter. But when it comes to chapther 5..WOW\nThe phyics just like a mess, you character can easily fly out to something or you can't even moving character beacause the \ngravity is too high, the fire extinguisher? or something else whatever can't even work well in the game.\nIs it a part of the game design? Did the game creators even play this game or they just made it and sell it? Very awfull level design. Enemy quite interesting by the way except the spider thing.\nI can see the potential of the game but it just ruined my experiencein certain level, and also the potal is another problem, I \nhave many times saw myself just keep transporting in 2 same potal like a infinite loop...\n\nI see there is 28 thumbs up and just 1 thumbs down so I curious about how people can beat this game, like I am missing something? But I already played the chapter 5 so I think it is not my problems?
