Your objective is to move your orb through various levels of corridors, spikes, bombs and other obstacles until you reach the exit.  The game is simple in concept and entertaining to play but it does come with some issues:\n\n- Audio is loud and volume cannot be adjusted\n- In game text (tips) are almost non-visible\n- Respawn/quit are in awful positions for a game that relies on clicking around fast paced.  Many accidental quits\n- Game auto sets to full screen when going into options menu\n- Possibly relates to the non visible text, but in game objects and items (different bombs, the weird save point ball for examples) aren't explained well\n- Soundtrack does not cycle.  Only changes when you go into the options and you select a new song\n\nIt has interesting level lay outs and puzzle setup.  There are many areas that will test your reflexes and possibly your patience.  Comes with a hard mode for each level to test out your skills and give it more replay ability.  It can be a fun time killer, but definitely has room for improvment.  Since its on sale and sure it will be on sale many other times, I will recommend it since its only a few dollars.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009153711", "last_played": 1465495913, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 387, "playtime_forever": 70}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1465495733, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504638", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1465495797, "recommendationid": "23471839", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Good, I like it.  First impression is that the way the ball thing moves is strange cause it goes backwards as apposed to my mouse movements, I soon worked it out though.  Though controling like that is not easy.   \n\nI like it, its a nice well made little game to play just to kill 10 minutes every now and then.  Worth the money, its neat and fun.  Making the orb fling around is fun when getting up some momentum and flicking around fast. \n\nIts worth the try, if you are after a quick fun game to play.\n\nFor the price I recommend giving it a try at least.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043110053", "last_played": 1482358274, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_forever": 17}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1467109432, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499289", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1467187643, "recommendationid": "23889011", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I was look for a good indie game for my youtube channel and The Orb Chambers caught my eye.
