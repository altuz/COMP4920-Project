Apparently low effort application. \n\nPlayed this on the HTC Vive, and first of all, the sense of scale on the model which is supposed to be \"you\" is like, some shunken malformed guy. Besides that, getting my head centered on this weird maniquin of myself was a needlessly inconvieniet. I had to swivel around in my chair, and move to the center of my playspace to get the chaparone lines to disappear. Then I had to take my headset off my head, hold it in the air with my hand behind me where I eventually wanted to be playing, while reaching back behind me to my computer to hit F12 to recenter. Just recentering doesn't help, because recentering doesn't actually rotate the camera. So, not only is it a spider phobia simulator, it's also a broken neck simulator if your setup isn't facing the way the application expects to begin with.\n\nJokes aside... this application was clearly designed for the Rift, and shoe-horned onto the Vive. You look at a piece of paper to get more or less spiders in the scene. There are 5 levels of spiders. Each level adds more spiders. If you can stand the mere sight of essentially immoble spiders placed around the room, then congratulations--you're *cough* \"cured?\" The spiders never touch you, never bite you, never move aggressivly towards you. Real spiders skitter my friends. Real spiders will crawl on you, and leave nasty red bite marks on you if you let them--and they're the right species.\n\nThe room which the application takes place in is a high-rise building overlooking Central Park in New York. The ambiant sound is frequently punctuated with the sounds of honking cars. I guess this game's target audience is squeemish city dwellers? Perhap the honking were meant to add stress and unnerve you in combination with the spiders... I have no idea. I just found it annoying. \n\nBottom line, if this application were free, I wouldn't be complaining.
