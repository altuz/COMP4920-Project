Upon witnessing the graduation of one of the students, Ichirou begins to question the validity of the practices in the academy.\n\nI have mixed opinions on this visual novel. Having played through and reached all 3 possible endings in this visual novel, the game started out too slowly as a typical school life drama and only after episode 5 out of 9 possible episodes in this visual novel did it build more suspense and thriller and develop as a mystery visual novel and there are only 1-2 choices to make in the entire game which are near the ending and lead to a different ending each(The game storyline could do with a shortening of the school life drama section in the prologue and first 5 episodes if the mystery and thriller part could expand and develop more). Furthermore, although the game had nice anime artwork on the cover, CGs and character sprites, this is one of the few visual novels on Steam that did not have trading cards or achievements which would further reduce the appeal of this visual novel.\n\nOn the plus side, I would definitely say that the game in using music by Patirchev and Ara Hiroshi to produce a great opening and ending movie, theme song and BGMs probably saved this visual novel from being just another forgettable visual novel I would uninstall after finishing this game. I managed to get the game on 60% discount in Steam store and I liked the soundtracks in this game enough to give this game a recommended review. It would also be nice if a soundtrack DLC were to be released for this game in future.\n\nOverall, this game is recommended only for those who like a short mystery visual novel featuring a futuristic dystopian Japanese setting that is easy to reach all endings, nice anime artwork in the game or great BGMs and soundtracks in the opening and ending movie(My favourite BGM is F.G as a soothing and inspiring soft music that is played only in the true ending and end credits). In which case, the game is recommended only when at good discount or bundle offer or when soundtrack DLC, Steam trading cards and/or achievements are added to the game in future.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006413390", "last_played": 1503846595, "num_reviews": 91, "num_games_owned": 2216, "playtime_forever": 288}, "votes_up": 33, "timestamp_created": 1503849049, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571590", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503890562, "recommendationid": "34532579", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
