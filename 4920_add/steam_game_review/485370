The A.I. players have surprisingly good aim, heck, I even got spawn killed a few times by them. =P\n\nThe game itself seemed to run okay, it could use optimization and I did glitch through a few walls, I even jump near the side of a building and shot up into the sky.  However, for the price of this game, I have no problem recommending it to those looking for an easy 100% or simply a low quality, yet very colorful, version of a multiplayer shooter game.\n\nWho knows, if the game could actually get a good amount of people playing, it may be a decent time killer in between other games.\n\nThe added bonus is the sniper rifle is not over powered, so campers on rooftops have to hit you a couple times, giving you a chance to evade.  However, the Shotgun, oh boy, talk about one shot carnage.  Also, if you play the game a lot and earn enough kills, you can unlock other outfits.  Personally I think these outfits should just be available to everyone from the start.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 104, "steamid": "76561198121017576", "last_played": 1506624435, "num_reviews": 214, "num_games_owned": 2169, "playtime_forever": 104}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506528301, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506682", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506528301, "recommendationid": "35244492", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Nice one ...cheap and worthy", "received_for_free": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "steamid": "76561198373291040", "last_played": 1507174398, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 39, "playtime_forever": 9}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1507176948, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507176948, "recommendationid": "35486052", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
