The first second a game hasn't high end graphics and physics it's called bad and other not quite right things. To be fair everyone who starts with something won't be perfect at all. And considerign that this is the first game the developers made AND that it is from what I've read still in early acces I will give my review on this.\n\nNow a question to everyone out there: How many RTS have you seen? How many shooters? How many survivals and rough likes and point n clicks and turn based and beat em up and card games and simulators and survivals? It's everything turning out to be the same. No matter which game Ubisoft or EA or Valve or TT develops it is always the same thing of a huge grey thing. There is nothing new outthere nothing exiting always the heroes of a edgy squad or the knight with his so \"epic\" armour.. nothing which hasn't been out there already. But now try to search for something like a game where you can play anything natural like a wolf. I have only seen a few games out there and still they are all so humble and infamous that I really start scratching my head if people go offensive at a game like that only because it's not a battle field 10 or a Call of duty 68 or a RTS with a lot of tanks and rocketlaunchers. Now I gotta say I have palyed the game for a few miutes and I have seen.. yeah it is laggy and yeah it has some problems but HEY the team who did this is not a 6 Mio. $ heavy puplisher company. It's a group in their first project doing their first steps in their history of making games.\nI like the game for being a NEW idea. There aren't yet new features or gameplay mechanics (I hope that there will be more mechanics to explore) but the setting is finnally something else than a squad of oh-look-at-me-how-badass-I-am-with-my-sniper-rifle. No it is a wolf which you can train and evolve. There's a pack to build and terretories to conquer. For me it feels like a whole new sort of game and I really enjoy to play it and look forward to explore it more.\nI would suggest to really take some updates in the movement and physical behaviours and the animations should be overhauled but still for me it is playable and I can understand that a new group in the game buisness is not yet skillfull enough to bring everything into a game which any big company could do. So even the missing phyics are forgiveable.\nAs some words to the developers I wish you just the best with the game and maybe you will be able to make something big out of it. Every journy no matter how big starts with one step, and many will follow. Don't let yourself be discouraged by unsettisfyable gamers: Even the best will not be good enough for them! Kepp going and grow your team and skills so this game will grow as well. Maybe you will find people to help you making the game big? With new models and graphics and suggestions. Because we need new ideas and people who aren't afraid to develop things that are NEW.\n\nThumbs up for the courage of creating things which never have been there before and to be different to other games.\nAnd now I gotta play some more to grow my pack and level my wolf.\n\nCheers\nYour Kodiak", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198070684007", "last_played": 1505217481, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 291}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505066328, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505066328, "recommendationid": "34867785", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
