I have waited for this game a long time and now it`s finally released! Is the game worth its money or not?\nI`m kinda in ambivalent moods right now... i don`t regret buying this game. Well, it`s technically not one game, but a whole game collection with an enormous amount of games. Here`s the point: Some of these games are really good, but some aren`t (at least in my opinion). Some games are incredibly boring and not fun at all and that`s really unfortunate. On the contrary there are many really great games which i really enjoy, but those are not the majority right now. \nEven so I do reccommend this game for players who want a challenge in different minigames and try various mechanics. For those i`d definitely reccommend this game. The achievement challenges are incredibly good and it`s fun to reach those achievement limits. The enormous amount of games justifies the price of 15 euros, but in the current state (21.12.2016) i`d reccommend you to buy this game rather in a sale. If some more fun games are added in the future, then  i fully understand the 15 euros. Nevertheless, this game is really good (except of the flaws i mentioned). Only fits to people who want to be challenged in various game types though ;) And people who just want to experience a huge variety of games too. But be aware that not all of those games are good ^^", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198161727032", "last_played": 1486210371, "num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 580, "playtime_forever": 1237}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1482357428, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503512", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1482357428, "recommendationid": "28516652", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
