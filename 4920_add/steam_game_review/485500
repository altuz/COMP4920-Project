At least in nuclear throne there are lots of different enemies, weapons, and characters to keep you entertained. In this game it's walk, shoot, walk, shoot. \n\nThe next problem is that you get almost no money. After playing (if you can call this playing) for almost 2 hours I was finally able to buy 1 item. The things you buy stay with you between playthroughs, but the only things you can buy are 3 new weapons to go with the 2 you start with and upgrades for those weapons (you aren't told how your weapon will be improved though) Even buying new weapons doesn't mean very much because the weapons seem to be pretty close to evenly powerful, and you can only chanmge weapons by walking back to the spawn point on each level.\n\nOther minor problems: \n\u2022 the game doesn't have anything to do with smithing so it's a little misleading\n\u2022 you can't use the mouse on menus\n\u2022 music stops playing for the rest of the level if you pause too long\n\u2022 there are bonuses like \"long shot\" for killing a far away enemy or \"multi-kill\" for killing multiple enemies at once, but all these bonuses seem completely random. You can get a long shot for killing an enemy one quarter of the screen away from you, then not get it for killing an enemy way offscreen. Then you kill another offscreen and you do get the bonus?!\n\u2022 I've seen a few things that look like power-ups. But when I pick them up, it seems nothing happens. I can understand that in a game like the binding of isaac, but this game is so simple what could I possibly be missing?", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198114959760", "last_played": 1466470327, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 147, "playtime_forever": 146}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1466471639, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508927", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1466471639, "recommendationid": "23678259", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very very the best!
