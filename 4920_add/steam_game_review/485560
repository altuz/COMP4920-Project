It's cheap, the badges are good, the gameplay is good and fun, and you can play this without worrying about damaging your achievement stats!\n\nPro's:\n1. Fun game with no achievements to worry about\n2. Trading cards with decent looking badges (as seen from an outside website, don't have actual badge yet)\n3. Decently challenging level objectives for people who actually want to play a game\n4. Dirt cheap!  got mine for $0.99\n\nCon's (not really cons, but just personal gripes)\n1. The sheer amount of levels per area is giving me post-traumatic flashbacks to Intergalactic Bubbles (not really that many, especially since you don't have to worry about achievements)\n2. the obscurity of the title... in all my couple of thousand games recommended to me in search ques, this gem never popped up.  It's a great game, and I would have never known of it if a friend didn't have the badge!  Steam, please feature this game or something!
