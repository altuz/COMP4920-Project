Also, every time you guess a peg, you have to wait three seconds. Oh, and to get to the next stage, you need to do 10 math problems. \n\nIf you make it, the end. \n\n\n\nLook, I'm sure this game was just made by some guy in his spare time, and I don't really want to be mean, but this game is a waste of time. This game is exactly like losing at slots in a casino. You play and lose, and try again, and there is only a small chance of winning, and just like slots at a casino, there is no strategic input the player can provide to increase your odds. \n\n\nInstead of spending money to play this game, flip a coin 30 times. If you got more than 7 tails, you lose, otherwise, you win.
