Sadly, most of the work on this game went into making pretty clay shapes.\n\nThe game is really boring (pun not intended). Even with the difficulty ramped up to \"genius\" (yes, I tried the non-maze levels which were supposed to be harder) it isn't a challenge. Levels are randomized rather than fixed, so it's a stretch to call these puzzles. The first and second sets of maze levels take forever to complete, and it doesn't correctly award you a star once you do, so there isn't any way to open any of the maze levels past the first two sets. And to get all the points for each maze, you have to beat it at least twice! If you beat it four times, you don't even need to collect cheese to get all the stars. Just find the exit four times and you've hit top score.\n\nIn essense, the creator took something that looks vaguely like a puzzle game and instead of writing actual puzzles, greated a random generator to do it. They didn't even take the time to generate the puzzles and playtest them individually to see which ones worked. They just generate the puzzles on the fly, which most of the time are solvable (sometimes in multiple ways, and on occasion not at all), and the only \"puzzle\" part is jumping through hoops to reach the end. Despite a number of game elements that look interesting and do novel things, there isn't any challenge to using them and most of the game elements don't interact with most of the other game elements.\n\nI'm sad that I wasted five bucks on this. If you enjoy puzzles this is not the game for you. I'm not sure who this game is for, to be honest. Maybe young children? I'm not even certain they'd enjoy it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197979963899", "last_played": 1494032446, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 168, "playtime_forever": 57}, "votes_up": 21, "timestamp_created": 1494040196, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543384", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1494040196, "recommendationid": "31571766", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Its better than a McDouble for the same price (on sale)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198047548794", "last_played": 1498853780, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 212, "playtime_forever": 123}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1498608990, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484689", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1498608990, "recommendationid": "32899889", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
