So overall its what you expect you have to click to earn votes with each campaign being 24 hours. You can invest in votes for those upgrades  so you can earn votes per second while offline. However, the boosts in this game almost want you to stay on full time though I don't know why. See this game doesn't have quotes from the candidates like it boasts. It does have the 3 Hillary and Donald trump debates but that is only if your so sadistic to want to read them. The problem is the amount of votes you can click only goes up to 100 votes and even if you pay the 0.49 cents for the boost like I did its impossible. See you have to spend votes for the upgrades and even with a 3x mutiplier for the upgraedes and a 2x upgrade on that you will still find it nearly impossible. You get coins if you win a majority or a landslide. Though I'm not sure how its calculated they never explain. You can unlock other candidates but with the ridiculous requirements like 20 landslide victories or 999 vote coins (keep in mind 20 landslide victories means you will have been playing for 20 days) there is nothing to this game and its very boring very quickly. I wish they somehow included the republican and democratic primaries or the other debates and quotes like they promised but they didn't. This game is honestly not worth playing the only reason you would is if like me your curious to see if somehow there will be more but there isn't.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046190088", "last_played": 1502570204, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 538, "playtime_forever": 37982}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487197275, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487197275, "recommendationid": "29950695", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "it NOT cool", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198149123455", "last_played": 1475896578, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1488156925, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1488156925, "recommendationid": "30210015", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
