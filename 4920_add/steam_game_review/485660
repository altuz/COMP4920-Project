It has so much going for it \u2014 absurdly cute graphics, fun level design, great music. But the controls were a massive nightmare and the levels were repetitive. I hemmed and hawed a lot about whether to rec this or not and ultimately put it here because I did spend so much time frustrated, but it was also enjoyable, so\u2026? IDK. If the issues that bothered me seem minor to you, you\u2019ll probably enjoy it and should pick it up next time it\u2019s on sale.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain the problems with the controls. You can only jump a certain distance, and you can\u2019t move while you\u2019re in the air. This makes the precise jumping platforming requires impossible. On top of that, sometimes when you hit a wall you turn and face the other direction, and sometimes you don\u2019t, and I couldn\u2019t quite figure out when each happened. So you\u2019d try to chain jump and just end up spinning and going back the way you came, usually dying. And even once I started to get used to the jump distance, I found it absurdly frustrating to have to line myself up just right (which sometimes was impossible) and then press A and cross my fingers. I also found that the controls were not sensitive enough to detect tiny movements back and forth, so a lot of time I\u2019d try to line up a jump over and over and over only to discover that it was almost impossible to get to the exact spot I needed to be in. Worse still, the game was bad at indicating what was coming up \u2014 I often found myself getting into a rhythm only to be killed by a baddie just offscreen that there was no way I could have anticipated. This is the worst kind of difficultly in a platformer.\n\nBut even once I got used to that and got through the first set of levels, I was disappointed to find the other three locked level sets were just the same ones with fewer checkpoints and/or more baddies. So the game was actually only 25% as big as I thought it was, which was super disappointing.\n\nYet I kept playing it. There\u2019s something oddly relaxing about it right up until it gets frustrating. I found myself playing in 10-minute spurts \u2014 I\u2019d clear a level, hit a point I couldn\u2019t get past for 5 minutes, quit in frustration, do something else for an hour, and then start over. The game had all the elements of something I liked, but just couldn\u2019t follow through. And it\u2019s so sad, because I want it to work so badly, but ultimately it just couldn\u2019t get its shit together for long enough.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040882512", "last_played": 1484591831, "num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_forever": 159}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1496253370, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524532", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1496253370, "recommendationid": "32090987", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
