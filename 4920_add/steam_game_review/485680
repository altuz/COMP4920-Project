Put a contemporary political podcast on.\n\nLose yourself in the greatest cyberspace-like experience since Rez.\n\nThe game is not without issue\u2014the main one is, sometimes the game hangs, almost always when you die by flying into an asteroid at high velocities. Because of the way the game is made, this hang causes the game to stop rendering while it resolves crazy collision stuff or whatever. This is pretty much always when you die, so it's not a HUGE issue, but it would be great if this could be fixed. Plus, the game is written from scratch in a custom engine, so it's hard to hate it.\n\nOther than that, the game is pretty much perfect. I love the aesthetic, and the roguelike-like repeatable gameplay.\n\nI've fantasized about VR games with vector graphics on the inside of a sphere for years\u2014it's great to see that it's as awesome in practice as it is in theory.
