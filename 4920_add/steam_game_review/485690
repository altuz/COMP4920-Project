I barely had fun with it.... some of the puzzles were ok but sometimes clicks werent registered...ie one game i had to use hint button because and had clicked on the item it showed me 5 times!! ... and also names didnt correspond with items ??

It was not the worst game I've played but marred by too many mistakes.\n\nARGH! So frustrating! These HO games need a proof reader!\nI kept getting clues for things that didn't match which objects I needed.\nSpanner is a wrench is always fine but when is a Trumpet a L-bend pipe? Darts > dartboard key > monkey wrench etc.\nThe worst was when it happened twice in a row: A key that is actually a spanner and a spanner that's actually a key! \n\nOn the plus side, I did learn some new words like ampule and petard.\n\nTo make it even worse, clicks would often not register on HO scenes. At least there was no penalties....\n\nThere were a lot of the usual annoyances that you have to put up with in these kind of games:\nHO scenes appearing out of nowhere - but at least they're located on the map\nHaving items in the scene/location but not the ones the game wants you to have.\nHaving to use an item once sometimes but multiple when the game chooses.\nNon-specific or slightly incorrect clues (bow > violin bow, cog not a gear) etc.\n\nThe story actually intrigued me but it was handled poorly. It had the potential to be a decent (albeit cliche) horror story.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993803638", "last_played": 1501994630, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 462, "playtime_forever": 193}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501995310, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505831", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501995346, "recommendationid": "34052730", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
