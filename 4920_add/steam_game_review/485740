It still has a way to go but im looking forward to when the glitches are fixed. Here are some of the things that need to be changed:\n\n-It takes WAY too long for the next piece to come out. Once your current piece lands, there is a large delay between when it lands and when your turn stops. This would be okay if you could still move, but you can't. The piece just sits there until it thinks that turn is over.\n\n-The pieces fall too fast. It would be a big help if you could change the fall speed, difficulty, etc.\n\n-The pieces fall like they are affected by gravity. This wouldn't be a problem except that the physics are buggy. Every once in a while a piece will bounce and go flying off, sometimes out of the boundaries.\n\n-The white pieces are glitchy. Occasionally you will be able to control the white piece, but most of the time it just goes back and forth, left and right. This sometimes messes up lines that are set up.\n\n-We need two rotate buttons. One clockwise, the other counter-clockwise. It would also be nice if the pieces stayed in place when rotating instead of moving around.\n\n\nThat's about all I can think of at the moment. I hope these get fixed soon.\nThank you for your time!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198086466047", "last_played": 1467836922, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 57, "playtime_forever": 71}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1466900477, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501313", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1466900477, "recommendationid": "23809870", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Inspired by classic games, this one offers much more versatility with a number of fun game modes.

There is now an instructions page that pretty clearly explains how to play the game. The only thing it wasn't completely clear on was which blocks are cleared with the line being cleared. (Only the ones directly touching the line being cleared, if they are the same color.)\n\nSecond, menu setting values for music and sound now save across all menu and game screens. Set it once and it sticks between screens.\n\nFigured out the control issue reported in the past review is a bug. I suspect the issue has to do with collision detection algorythm. Left, Right, Rotate Left and Rotate Right will stop working in some instances where a collision with either the walls or falling into a well of pieces, even through there is room to move away from the obstruction or flip the pieces. \n\nSince the developers did repond to my critisim of their game and have fixed some of the issues I brought up, I can move this review up to a tentative recomends. If they fix the collision detection bug, I would definately move this review up to a strong recomends. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOld review below. Changed recomendation from would not to tentitively would recomend.\n\n[olist]\n [*]This game does not have any tutorial system or anything to explain how it's played. After playing the game, I still can't tell you how to eliminate rows.\n [*]In game, controls will stop working as some pieces fall down. I don't know if this is a game mechanic or a bug, and if it's a game mechanic, what triggers it. Again, no explanation for it.\n [*]Controls are Left Arrow, Right Arrow, Down Arrow and Space. Most Tetris games use either the entire arrow pad and/or WASD. It's a Unity game, so I'm assuming you can change this in the starting screen before going into the game, but there is NO OPTIONS MENU in the game.\n [*]There are two options that appears on every screen: Volume and Sound. Volume goes quickly from no sound to very loud and then doesn't seem to have a noticable affect after moving the slider more than 1/8th of the way. Sound turns all sounds on and off. There is no separate sliders for music and sound effects. (and the sound track increases in volume periodically. The game does not remember what you set the controls to when you change screens. Going from Main Menu, the Game screen, back to Main menu requires fiddling with the sounds three times.\n [*] The interface looks nice, but game elements appear in the main menu and may be confused with the main menu elements. I have no idea what the spaceship themed UI is supposed to mean or if the gameprogress has any affect on the animated background, but that is distracting.\n[/olist]\n\nOverall, I would love to say this is an interesting twist on the Tetris concept. However, I have no idea what the dev was trying. Some of these issues (UI design, menus, and options that don't stick) are all things taught in introduction programming and game design courses, so I'm scratching my head.\n\n[B] UPDATE:[/B] I went back and looked at the Unity starting menu. The Input selection does let you change the keys, but all the control names are for ship/character movement and not a Tetris style game. This definately feels like a game put together by someone just learning the trade.
