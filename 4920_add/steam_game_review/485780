Using a midi keyboard, you can only use two octaves then it says midi key too low/high and doesnt activate any note, theres no way to expand the range of the virtual keyboards to make a 88 key fully usable. its also not very efficient either, takes a long time to get things working and gets in the way of creative flow. its got a learning curve but even after that, its not that expressive. the main detractor for me is the mic latency, i just want to mess with a mic looper setup, cant. also the mic quality is garbage on the rift. its worse than a walmart $2 mic even though the Rifts actual mic sound is great. I tried installing sound drivers I don't need and it didn't help. \n\nOverall, its novel and fun to show to others new to VR, but not something I'll be investing much more time into even when I have a music itch.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044083625", "last_played": 1499312517, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 102, "playtime_forever": 549}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499313345, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499313345, "recommendationid": "33299672", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
