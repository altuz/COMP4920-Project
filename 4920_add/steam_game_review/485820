If you're like me and can only play at night, or can only spend an hour or two on it, you're going to get frustrated real quick. \n\nI knew it was real time, but I assumed that meant waiting X amount of minutes before X task was up. I didn't realize that meant it would be dark in game from my reallife 5 PM to 4 AM. Since I work until 5 every day, that means I essentially can't play this game at all. To be able to advance at all you need to do things that you can only do during the day. \n\nI've been drooling over this game for quite some time. I only played a short amount of time so far, since I could do very little in game (it was too dark), but it seems well put together, and it does make you anxious about planning what to do next (Hurry! I want to do X next! or :O A wolf!!? That's just what I need while I'm starving and searching for berries!) I wanted a survival game that puts you in realistic shoes and forces you to go farther than just surface worries and a point and click. I wanted something that would be educational and mentally stimulating. It is. \n\nI *don't* like the real time aspect of it. Chances are I won't be able to play this at ALL with my schedule. And a minor annoyance is that when you're 'writing' in the journal, you can't speed up the typing by clicking. I read really fast and it's kindof annoying that it goes so slow.

I've spend some time learning the ropes in guite a few early runs, but started more seriously at the beginning of summer. That is, durring May as a prospector taking Normal difficulty and Fast-forward option. Propably that's the easiest playthrough you can get. At the time of writing this review I'm well off and ready to survive the winter in all it's glory and peril. Thus I'll be starting anew right now in a harsher conditions (it's Fall/Autumn right now) and maybe as a fisherman. \n\nOn the plus side, the game is constantly in developement and new content and fixes are appearing. Is it playable? Yes. If by any chance you get a crash or find a bug give a shout on the forum in a constructive way and Dev will gladly fix. The more detail you disclose the quicker it will happen. \n\nThis Review will be updated with any future playtroughs so stay tuned.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1061, "steamid": "76561198193010528", "last_played": 1507199752, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 49, "playtime_forever": 13201}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506807702, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506807702, "recommendationid": "35355121", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
