It continues to feature regular updates which include bug fixes, content additions and tweaks to gameplay as requested by the community. The updates are small but regular. The workshop features roughly 20x additional content for the game but it's fun enough without it. \n\nI would guess the game will come out of early access by or near 01 2018 but I am confident that we will still see some minor tweaks after that. With all small indie projects, the success of the game relies on the support we, the gamers, provide along the way. Negative reviews that fail to account for the development process and such will only stunt the ability of the studio to make a great game. This is a great game and a wonderful developer. Buy it, play it, support it with good reviews and spreading the good word. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197978541117", "last_played": 1501893893, "num_reviews": 37, "num_games_owned": 1495, "playtime_forever": 496}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1500312473, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500312473, "recommendationid": "33612349", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great Fun to begin with,\nShows potenial and the developer is willing to take input from anyone to imrpove their product.
