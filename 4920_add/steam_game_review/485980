There should really be a thumb sideways \"meh\" recommendation rather than just thumbs up/down.....\n\nAnyway, its not a terrible game or anything but it could have been much more than it is. Apparently the dev team is tiny so i guess its understandable, but its meh as fuck nonetheless.\n\nThe game feels somewhat similar to the Close Combat series of games, as its designed to be slow and realistic and features no base building, but has modern 3D graphics. A slow and methodical strategy game is exactly what i was looking for, and its not bad but there are a few shortcomings that are quite annoying.\n\nFirstly, the game constantly pushes you to try and move fast by introducing small secondary objectives such as \"rescue this random idiot, rescue that random group of civilians, etc..\" that can only be completed within a set time limit. This is annoying because it messes with the slow and careful approach and if you rush, you lose soldiers which is punished by points. What is even more annoying is that you don't know which of these objectives are on a timer, nor how much time you have left.\n\nIf you fail these secondary objectives nothing really happens anyway so you just feel pushed and rushed for no reason. Is easy to win a mission in general, but getting the \"perfect\" run means a lot of saving and going back to old saves after you realize you had to move to a particular objective quickly, plus just accepting higher soldier loss.\n\nSecondly, your infantry is quite stronger than the enemy, but the enemy sometimes has infinite reinforcements in some areas, and I HATE infinite enemy reinforcements mechanics in any kind of game.\n\nThirdly, there is NO SKIRMISH!!!! WTF M8? I can get past no multiplayer, as i don't care for it and most strategy games are ignored in that regard thanks to starcraft or whatever, but no skirmish is a war crime.\n\nFourth, the pathfinding for some units is awful. Especialy for trucks.\n\nOverall, those four complaints bring this game to meh levels. I got it on sale for 10euro so i 'eint even mad but i'm not even gonna be bothered to finish the last missions.\n\nIf you ever played the Close Combat series and loved it, you might like this game.
