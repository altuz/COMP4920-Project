Some nice thought been put into the maps with 2 cities to explore but thats where the game falls down. This IS NOT a role playing game you have no decisions within the game about how the story unfolds beyond some voice choices which just change the last bit of dialogue you get to hear but have no impact on the story. No weapon choices, no levelling, class system, or path choices that you could say that makes a game an RPG.\nLeaves us with the battle system within the game, there is no dodge, parry or block mechanics which should boil the game down to a hit and move style but the health button can be used as often as you like with no cool down meaning the best way to fight is to press an attack button and just keep pressing heal.\nThe game has one boss in it which was no different from another fight, you are shown a dragon fight that just auto-resolves, you are shown big fights which you do not get to take any part in and the story does not go anywhere, resulting in no reward systems built within the game.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/biS1ti74rA8", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994868319", "last_played": 1486129354, "num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 81}, "votes_up": 33, "timestamp_created": 1486140625, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1486152471, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554692", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1486140625, "developer_response": "Hi! \n\nThanks for the feedback! Really appreciated! We just updated the game with a day 1 patch.\n\n1).  You now have the ability to block with the \"R\" button therefore giving more variety to the gameplay. \n\n2). Health now has a 15 second cool down period. Hopefully this will make the fights more interesting. \n\n3). At far as choices. There are some choices in the beginning which can kill of a character or not. As for the forest part you mentioned. If you don't kill the orcs you have more enemies to contend with at the end of the game during the battle. The game is also episodic so you wont see the some of the long lasting results of your choices now but in a future episode. \n\nAlso there was a bug which cut the final dragon boss fight short. It is being patched now. You do get to fight the dragon at the end. :)\n\nMore patches will be on the way to continue to make the game better.\n\nThanks again for the feedback and I hope you adjust the review after taking another look at the game. Cheers! \n\nBaq\ufeff", "recommendationid": "29673157", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "https://youtu.be/QaafqGlg8F8\n\nWhile I was recording the footage for my First Impressions video I was impressed at what 3 students was capable of and at the same time baffled that the developers would expect a full $10 price tag for a game of this quality. While I do wish to give them praise, as a YouTube Gaming Critic I have a duty to my channel and my viewers to put them first and unfortunately, Hero does not live up to it's asking price.\n\nBuggy, glitchy, and full of some exceptionally painful visual and graphical effects. Within the first half hour several elements were introduced that were clearly meant to have some form of emotional impact, but I found myself having a larger reaction to the fact the Dragon was forced to destroy the gate before flying over it. Also, the deaths of people that we have been given no reason to care about, and then are expected to have a reaction towards. This is the underpinning of poor or incomplete story writing elements.\n\nThe combat also is extremely bland and feeling like very little thought was given to it. In addition to that, the audio levels for the terrible voice acting is all over the place. Some moments glaringly loud while others I could barely even register that there was a voice.\n\nAll in all it was impressive for 3 College students and this would be a very good $1-2 game. But at $10 it just doesn't have the quality. Give this one a pass until the price comes down.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030863487", "last_played": 1486182564, "num_reviews": 174, "num_games_owned": 427, "playtime_forever": 41}, "votes_up": 19, "timestamp_created": 1486194580, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529959", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1486194580, "recommendationid": "29686902", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's really incredible what a team of 3 college kids were able to do. If their goal was to create an homage to 90's adventures games then I think they're really onto something. Hero is very reminiscent of some indie adventure games from that era. Most notably games like Gothic and Draconus Cult of the Wym come to mind while playing Hero. The game isn't without its flaw however. While I never experienced and crashes or lag I did notice that the dialogue seemed to be playing at different volumes and wasn't placed in 3D space. Some NPC's would sound so quite I'd have to lean in while other were nearly clipping my speakers. These are minor issues and i'm sure will be fixed in time. I'm enjoying the play through.
