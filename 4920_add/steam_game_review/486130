The type of game that wants you to laugh, smile and enjoy its pixel art as a whole package, and doesn't shy away from being exactly what it is. The dedication by the developers is evident - they have put together a joyful combo of fun and great pixel art.  \n\nBecause charm is somewhat abstract here are some other points. \n\nThe story is simple, to the point and (again) charming. It wears its heart on its sleeve and that's awesome. The idea of father and son demolishing everything together is novel and I've never seen a similar idea before. It kind of breaks a fourth wall into the developer's minds while you're playing. \n\nGameplay is mostly simple, but deep if you want it to be. Run. Jump. Shoot larger than life collectible weapons. Shooting is like contra. Up and diagonal, left and right. Super fun. However hidden depth found in some strategy and planning - especially in latter half of game. Weapon management and a slow measured approach is required. If you play on medium or hard - you are not going to want to be careless with your approach - otherwise lose massive health and 'game over' will be upon you in no time. Control of best buds is really good on the run and in air. Good high jump, with good feeling of flight but solid control in air for landing on platforms. I think Super Icon deliver a superb feeling of movement in their 2d platformers with tight control.  \n\nExplore 11 extensive stand alone levels that deviate in different paths full of pickups. Levels are pretty big! A little puzzle orientated to find everything which encourages you to explore the whole landscape.  \n\nDifficulty is really well done. 3 options to start off with, something for everyone.\n\nThe developers are active in the discussions here on steam, asking for bugs etc. A few bugs have been identified but nothing game breaking and updates are already coming. This is a very very small team and its awesome to see their commitment to the game.\n\nLastly I just really like the game. I loved life of pixel - also by this developer. Thanks Super Icon for making this! It's awesome to see the game out in the world! Definitely consider picking this up to support a really cool developer.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198128878785", "last_played": 1487644521, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_forever": 1950}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1481516019, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508554", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1483151429, "recommendationid": "28321526", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I had been waiting for this game to be released, but was surprised local co-op was not available.  I initially decided not to buy, but then I read the devs intend to add this feature so I got it anyway.\n\nIt does exactly what it seems to want to do: replicate a late 80s or early 90s run-and-gun platformer. The levels themselves are tributes to various classic games of the era. There are some puzzle elements to the game as well, plus a good variety of weapons and other items to pick up along the way. A wide variety of different video options are available, too (raster effects, edge curvature, color adjustments).\n\nI recommend the game for anyone to whom this sort of game appeals, although I personally wouldn't have bought it if two player co-op was not in the works...
