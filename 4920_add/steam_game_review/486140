It's buggy, confusing and generally not fun. It may only be $1.99 but this isn't something that is in a state where it should be charged for yet. \n\nIt doesn't even feel like a lot of effort was put into it. I can overlook some issues if it seems like the dev/devs cared about the game. This just feels slapped together and tossed out to make a buck.\n\nVR Gameplay 2/10 (swing your arm in front of you and hope it activates your attack)\nVR Graphics 8/10 (It was pretty, kinda reminded me of Kojimas Death Stranded trailer)\nAudio 6/10 (Out of place music and repetitive sound effects that sometimes randomly went off for seemingly no reason)\n\nLocomotion 1/10\nWeird pull the trigger then step to the side to hop platform to platform. It was buggy and kept popping me up in the air.

More satisfying than slicing a bunch of fruit. The 'dodgeball' aspect gives some motivation to move about although the difficulty takes a while to ramp up.
