It's a point and click adventure, it's a visual novel, it's a driving simulator, an FPS; it's the mad ambitious stew you dreamt of making when you were thirteen years old and you still believed  being a game developer was your perfect job before you learned through heartbreaking internet testimonials that it was a ninety-hour-a-week deathmarch to the grave.\n\nOf course, it doesn't do any of this well. Of course it doesn't. Look how much it costs. You spend the first five minutes of this mess watching your player character painstakingly wake up, brush his teeth, shower, get dressed and eat his breakfast, all in gluey slow motion as if you're sitting through some sort of erotic drama. \n\nThe pace doesn't improve in the actual playable sections either. The point and click sections are a maddening ordeal where you're forced to pointlessly interact with objects and NPCs in an arbitrary order before being allowed to collect key items. If you want to make the cloth strips, you've got to examine your unconscious wife twice, examine the lamp, examine the sweater, grab the kitchen shears, grab the sweater and [b]THEN[/b] combine the two in that goddamned order, as if you're recreating the painstaking scraping together of the cogs in your character's moron hutch of a skull as he fuddles his way through even the most basic of thought processes.\n\nThe script and the animation are hysterical though.

I still have to admit that the graphics are FANTASTIC for an indie developer. The edges are sharp and clean with amazing detail, the textures almost look REAL.

For some reason the developers have tried to go for a faux cell shading effect with an awful photoshop cartoon filter. This makes the already old looking graphics even worse. And the animations have so far all been uniformly bad. \n\nAnd finally the pacing of the game.  It shambles along with less pace than your average undead, and from what I have played so far, there is very little actual interaction in the game other than some limited conversation choices and a couple of 'action' events. I really could not get invested in the game at all, but I will try to play on for a while and see if it picks up. \n\nHowever based on my play so far I doubt I will be getting chapter 2 if it ever appears on steam unless the developers make some changes to the pacing and improve the graphics somewhat.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nOkay I managed to make it to the end of the game, and sadly it actually gets wose. Cumbersome  controls and camera angles combined with the slow plodding nature of the game just add to the frustrations of navigating. Item hitboxes can be hard to trigger, and you are not allowed to interact with objects until the game allows you too.\n\nThe 'crafting' mini game you use once to make a pistol. Thats it.\n\nThe live action sections are (mercifully) short, but the awful zombie hitboxes combined with skyhigh mouse sensitivity make them more frustrating than frightening. Also you camera is locked until you fire or swing once, so its not even bug free. \n\nAs to the 'driving' section why even bother - it adds nothing, you just drive a preset course through an ugly empty city. \n\nAlso the game directly rips off the resident eveil 2 police station for the second level - I'm not too sure capcom are going to be happy here so I'm not sure if this game will be available for long.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989290281", "last_played": 1465248876, "num_reviews": 108, "num_games_owned": 1203, "playtime_forever": 117}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1465237859, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496998", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1465289324, "recommendationid": "23422625", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It was funny...\nfor the first 20 minutes\nafter that the game is incredibly painful to go through", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198088164161", "last_played": 1474426349, "num_reviews": 102, "num_games_owned": 245, "playtime_forever": 92}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1474426683, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497018", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1474426683, "recommendationid": "25613009", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Urgh...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997713639", "last_played": 1467912094, "num_reviews": 44, "num_games_owned": 2090, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1467912112, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487839", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1467912112, "recommendationid": "24161781", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Play as a man who locks a crazy person (zombie) in his garage without warning his family, but first wandering into his neighbor's house. \nCall 9-1-1 and find that the police aren't answering, only to call them a second time to the same result, this time, ignoring the phone ring when you put the phone to your face.\n\nThis game isn't even ironically bad.", "received_for_free": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025777627", "last_played": 1501392895, "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 384, "playtime_forever": 64}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1493082085, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1493082085, "recommendationid": "31348685", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
