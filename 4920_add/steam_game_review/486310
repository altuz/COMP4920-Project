Each time you log in, the game feels like a new and magical experience with every journey you take, even if you happen to memorize every nook and cranny of this insanely large sandbox world's landscape.\n\nYou can play by yourself and relax to the charming acoustic soundtrack and the white noises of nature, or group up with others to journey across the seasons and open strange obelisks with the power of your voices (and squeaks) combined.\n\nThere are many animals to choose from, all with a vast array of pelts to unlock. Some are DLC required to use (the big badger, big lynx, baby lynx, bear cub, and eagle), but these animals are not pay to win. Quite the opposite in fact. All the fast and furious animals are unlockable without paying for any DLC (frog, rabbit, goat, fox, and pheasant). And the best part is the mods of this game are continuously updating it and will be adding even more free animals and skins for the older animals as well. So there is almost always something new every other month to come back to and discover.\n\nI adore this game. It's a relaxing experience and a great place to go if you need to wind down from more competative games with toxic communities. There is no chat, only emotes and emotions run to the rawest. The first time you will have to say goodbye to a complete stranger in this game will break your heart, staring at the snowflakes as you wonder if you should just lie down in the place they logged out and disappear too. Meadow is a must experience game for any indie/animal game enthusiast, and for measley 3 dollars, I have had 1,000 hours of bliss, and will continue to do so.\n\nSee you in game, you future baby badgers. 10/10 Would squeak as  baby badger again.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1233, "steamid": "76561198241167176", "last_played": 1507182539, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 43, "playtime_forever": 59843}, "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_created": 1505622831, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538600", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506226404, "recommendationid": "35014000", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "After first logging in I was hopelessly confused (I've not played any of the Shelter games before so had no idea what i was in for - or even if this would have helped!). The tutorial is none existant and you are kinda just abandoned with no idea what you are doing. \n\nFound a helpful bird friend who showed me to an Obelisk before having to leave, which shed some light on what is going on but I'm still confused.  \n\nNext thing, I've Joined up with a small herd of animals and then spend two hours running all over the map with them collecting things. I'm suprised at how much i enjoyed this. You aren't really doing anything but the groups that form up are incredibley nice for an online game, its honestly the best MMO experience i think i have ever had and its likely down to the fact that you can't actually talk to anyone with words!\n\nThe only semi-negative i feel is that (some) animals are locked behind owing other games in the series.
