The physics are perfect. Back in the 1970's I used to take a bus to the Dearborn MI Amtrak station and take a train to Ann Arbor. They had several old school pinball arcades. I havent enjoyed playing pinball as much as I did then till now. I would definitaly buy more pinball games by this company.   My only suggestion for the current version is some sort of random/pop up target in the middle to add more random paths for the ball and the upper left flipper to be a bit lower or farther out into the playfield.  A few times I got into a pattern of  not scoring or no bumper action. Not a complaint just an observation.  I like that the ball changes its appearance during the game and the multiball is really cool. A 2-4 multiplayer version would be cool as well. Over all five stars. A great value for the money. I recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 110, "steamid": "76561198160594967", "last_played": 1506824785, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_forever": 237}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503969369, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503969369, "recommendationid": "34565962", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
