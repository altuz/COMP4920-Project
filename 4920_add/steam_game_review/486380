The ukiyo-e style presentation is unique and defines the game's whole atmosphere. The mechanics are tight, with a meaningful alignment system and deadly combat. The writing is excellent, dialogues are witty and it's obvious the developer made a lot of research into the setting to make sure it's historically accurate - supernatural beings aside, of course!\n\nThe only downside is that the game is a little small, after several runs you will become intimately familiar with most of possible events and their outcomes. However considering the low price, demanding more content is baseless, especially since what we have is so high quality. Unlockable characters allow for more replayability, while ancestral favor is accumulated between runs and can be used to make the game easier, or to experiment with non-standard playstyles.\n\nThe developer is very receptive to feedback and keeps improving this game, so I really hope it becomes more popular as it deserves!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 97, "steamid": "76561198131332135", "last_played": 1506690113, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 1794}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505613256, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503922", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505613256, "recommendationid": "35011672", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "There's a lot of game here for $3. The map portion is a node-to-node affair, like FTL without anything chasing you. Reach a node, do a brief dialogue option and carry on until you've defeated the 7 legendary masters. Whether you enjoy the game depends a lot on how you take to the original combat system and tolerance for repitition. \n\nIt's turn based, deadly and heavily influenced by timing (in a tactical way, no reflexes required). It's simple with a few attacks, defences, feints and so forth, but it has layers. You'll reach competence plateaus and think you got it, then get killed and realize there are more effective ways to fight. My playtime is inflated by a factor of 2 because it's the sort of game you want to have lurking in the background for quick bursts. It can get frustrating if you play for prolonged sessions (it's permadeath and ironman so once you get good there's some slog until you catch up to where you were last time).\n\nThere's some very good but light RPG. The art and atmosphere is great assuming you like feudal japan. It's small but built for replay, being procedural, quite difficult and with some nice unlocks. I'm done with it for now but I'm going to have an itch until I come back and finish it, even if it takes a month of daily 20 minute sessions. Nice job all around for a small game, tons of value at $3.\n\nFeel free to check out my [url=https://oldgrizzledgamers.com/reviews/hidden-gems/shigatari-review-72/]full review.[/url]\n\nUpdate - I couldn't help it!

After a few play throughs, you'll get familiar with the possible outcomes from every event.  Though this seems at first like a \"lack in content\" (which it's not) or that it would highly reduce the replay value, once you have a feel for the event possibilites, you can plot your course through the regions with more intention and reason to be the most powerful swordsman Japan has ever known.\n\nI LOVE the combat system.  There are a combination of stances, strike styles (Slash/Thrust partially dependant on stance) and regions across the body of your opponent you can strike.  Example would be \"Attack > Thrust > Left Shoulder.  There are multiple ways of defending yourself as well, Parry, Weave, Disengage, and each stance holds advantages and disadvantages against the others.  Every action that you take takes \"Time\" within the battle; this includes attacking, dodging, using an item, changing stances, changing weapons, etc, and is really where the skill of dueling comes in.  If your opponent's blade is coming crashing down towards your head, you're definitely not going to want to be \"Exhausted\" (too tired to move) or not have enough \"Time\" to make the move you wish before getting struck or potentially killed.\n\nAs you play through (and probably die pretty regularly your first few takes) you'll be gaining Ancestor Points which you can spend at the start of a playthrough to add some edge to your attempt.  Examples: Adding % chance of missing to your opponents, and adding % chance that you avoid a fatal blow when hit.\n\nThe art style is really enticing and hasn't gotten old to me.  Everything is minimalistic, classic, and elegant at it's face value, but the combat and planning/executing a killer player build is really where this game shines.  There is nothing like having a maxed out Waki Stance tree, waiting for 2 heart beats (which will not stack speed and damage boost per wait), and taking 1 unit of combat \"Time\" to Overkill crit decap a dojo leader for 2k damage.\n\nThere are many new characters to unlock for you to start the game with, each requiring a unique condition to be met for unlocking, and each coming with their own start bonus'.  An example, to Unlock Miyasashi, you need to \"Be late for a duel, then win with a Bokken.\"  (I actually just pulled this one off against the Gedan Leader using Maxed Speed and Chidan stance).\n\nIt's cheap, it's fun, it's unique, and I think you'll really have a good time with it, especially if you're a samurai enthusiast.  The dueling is  really satisfying.  I died in my first regoin of choice probably 10 times before starting to make real headway in the game.  You start off really squishy, but man, it feels fucking awesome later on when you single handedly tear through a mass of samurai and warrior monks across some random bridge encounter.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 614, "steamid": "76561198071165800", "last_played": 1506892131, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 149, "playtime_forever": 614}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506808783, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502757", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506808783, "recommendationid": "35355576", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a truly excellent example of a FTL-style rogue game. It's simple enough to give the feel of a samurai story, doesn't take itself too seriously without being a clown like Way of the Samurai 4, and it's combat system is deceptively deep. The only downside to this game is there's not much to look at eventually, but I feel that if a Shigatari 2 was made and a greater budget secured, actual combat animations could follow. However, it's an extremely satisfying experience, especially for those that love tactical turn-base combat, rpgs, and anything having to do with Samurai.\n\nHopefully when a second game comes out, other melee weapons unique to the Samurai could be added. The spear could be a perception based weapon, the kanebo could be a strength based weapon, the wakizashi could be the speed based weapon, and the sword could be balanced.
