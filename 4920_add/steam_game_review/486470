A dead universe and you are picking through the bones and remains. But the problem remains as there are several massive bugs and glitches in this game, and it does not seem to be getting anymore support from the developer. The shotgun seems to do 0 damage, if you shift tab in game you walk slower and only speed back up upon getting in your ship or switching screens and coming back. If you take a quest from a person you have to left click, which makes you swing your sword which kills the quest giver. I like this game, the ideas, it is interesting the problem is, it needs more work done on it to polish it up to make it a solid title.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "steamid": "76561197999814631", "last_played": 1506961325, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 476, "playtime_forever": 366}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499283436, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503854", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499283436, "recommendationid": "33288386", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
