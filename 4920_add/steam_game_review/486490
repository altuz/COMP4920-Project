I bought Witan because I thought the graphics were beautiful and I was intrigued by having a young female protagonist in a fantasy game who didn\u2019t look overtly powerful. I thought that this game would be story-driven and one where you could rely on your wits instead of bashing skulls open with a sword. The story has a strong opening that many young women could relate to: you are a girl in the company of a baron who has made unwelcome advances on you. You rejected him and he accused you of being a witch, which in this game, is a death sentence. This is pretty much explained in the first minute of the game. It had a lot of potential and could have branched off in many different directions from there.\n\nHowever, this is where the inadequacies of the game start coming to light. First off are the controls. They are very clunky and not what you would expect of the typical WASD configuration in other games. You can only go forward. Left and right will only rotate your character, and you have to go forward from there. There is no strafe and you can\u2019t walk backwards either. The second glaring inadequacy is the gameplay itself. There is no save feature. You can only start a new game and when you die, that\u2019s it. You have to start over from the beginning, and in this game you will die a lot. The very first peasant that I came across yelled \u201cWitch!\u201d and immediately started attacking me. Then a second peasant came along, and then a third. In a matter of seconds, I was swarmed by the entire village, and no, there was no escape. You have to choose \u2018Run Away\u2019 in order to run away. You can\u2019t just simply move out of an enemy\u2019s way once they are on you. So I died and started a new game.\n\nThis time, I avoided all people on the streets and only went inside the houses. This was a better deal. You can talk to the people and learn a little more about this game. I bought one wooden pole as a weapon and one spell. There wasn\u2019t much to do in town so after talking to everyone in the buildings I left the walls of the castle and started exploring outside. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the game is beautiful and even the sound was impressive when I came across a monastery and started hearing chanting music. However, I got jumped by an enemy, tried to run away, and then fell into this dream sequence where I was in a marsh and had to follow an angel. That was interesting and I was starting to get hooked again. As I was walking, however, I noticed my character was making pained sounds every time she came over a corpse. You couldn\u2019t really tell it was there because most of it was submerged. I didn\u2019t realize this was damaging me and so, by the time I touched a third corpse, poof, I was dead. I didn\u2019t want to start the game all the way from the beginning, so I decided to turn it off for a bit.\n\nEdit: I have confirmed that there is a Save feature in the game, but it is hidden. They want you to find it first. If you want the spoiler, click on \u201cSee Full Review\u201d above. I posted it as a comment.\n\nI may give it a try again later tonight, but I\u2019m a little disappointed. I think this game has a lot of potential and could appeal to certain people that are fascinated by witchcraft. As I was playing, I felt like a teenage girl trying to find her place in the world, although in a gothic fantasy setting and not a high school. There aren\u2019t many games like this, so that\u2019s a plus. On the other hand though, this game feels like a very rough draft of something that could possibly make it later on. It doesn\u2019t feel finished to me at all and should have been tagged as Early Access or something. The gameplay mechanics are well, terrible, and the visuals and atmosphere can only get you so far. Also, the combat is atrocious. If the developers want to continue working on it, I applaud them and would probably support it. However, I can\u2019t really recommend this game to anyone the way it is right now. I\u2019m going to give it a positive review for the potential I see in it, but if you are looking for a full, immersive RPG experience, you are better off looking elsewhere. On the other hand though, it was only $3 dollars so I don\u2019t feel like it was much of a loss and will pretty much be regarding it as a charitable donation to Imigea.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198293982910", "last_played": 1482896636, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_forever": 235}, "votes_up": 26, "timestamp_created": 1468367596, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535891", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1468696329, "recommendationid": "24285302", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Took two steps in the game and was immediately impaled by a pitchfork, which pushed me back 40 feet against a wall.

Graphics are OK. Controlling is terrible. It reminds me very first 3d games of PlayStation one. But, that's also not problem. The major problem is game is too complex and contains too much mystery. Actually, think about someone taking you back to a small medieval age's town as a little girl. That's it, if you want me to tell you what's the game story, or what did I understood so far. I played Witan 4 hours and I still not understood much things yet.\n\nHere some points that i've figured out;\n\n      *Peasants are BAD! They will always attacked you. Don't get close to them. (Except inside of buildings.) \n\n      *There 4 town \"Greyhame\" (the town you started), \"Wotansburgh\", \"Cloakshame\", and \"Ravensford\". There is also sign showing the way of \"Thurswood\". But couldn't find that place/town.\n\n      *When you walk to the lake. An angel came and guide you to teleporter. (There are some kinds of creatures in the lake. Follow or Die situation.) \n\n      *Wishing to the well gives MP.\n\n      *Sleeping at Inn refreshes your HP and MP.\n\n      *You can buy herbs and spells from Herbalist. (Best spells available in Ravensford.)\n\n      *You can buy weapons from blacksmits. (Best weapons available in Cloakshame.)\n\n      *Fruits on the paths will heal you. (Red Fruits)\n\n      *I realized that herbals has power. So far i know;\n          -\"Fly Agaric\" teleports you town to town. Randomly? (Sometimes it teleports you outside to same town.)\n          -\"Garlic\" and \"Willow\" gives you 5 hp.\n          -\"Hemlock\" and \"Yew\" kill you instantly.\n          - The other herbs still can not understand.\n      \n      *The guy in the Town Hall is important I guess, because, you have to buy drinks for him. I believe that quests will be available after he tells you about rumors and gossips. \n\nSo, I've figured out these during the 4 hours of playing. \"Saving\" is really an issue. I've saved game for a couple time. But, still don't know how did I do that. I guess it releated with some herbal. I've tried to buy all herbals after I realized that. However, still no sing of how did i saved game. That is what i'm talking about. Retro graphics OK, yeah characters and places is are same (at least you could design different stores for each town instead of placeing same store, with same people in every town. Controlling character can be acceptable that's indie game. I'm supporting you. But man come onnnn. Mystery sounds good. But, THERE IS TOO MUCH MYSTERY. Unnecesarrily mystery. Saving game is mystery, even the history is mystery come on. At least you can give us little briefing before we start the game. At least pressing \"ESC\" could access to pause/settings menu instead of killing character. That's not fair! I've lost 65 gold when I realized that pressing \"ESC\" kills me. On the otherhand, I went Wotansburgh Castle, and the guy gave me a quest to kill someone. (I couldn't understand the mission.) Then I killed by a knight at town. Then I turned back to my save point. I went again that guy. And he said to me \"This is a castle. Not a place for children.\" or somthing like that. I don't understand why I can not take misson again. I guess we should buy couples of drinks to the guy in town hall to get rumors. I tried that also but I actually do not remember that I could take that mission again or not. And also I went Ravenford Castle and that guy asked me \"Do you want to join Ravenford Clan?\" then he dueled me. Then obviously i slaughtered by his sword. I went his castle again and I could not tak that mission again. I guess it related with the guy in the town hall again.\n\nAnyway, guys good and weird game with lots of unnecessary mystery. If you have obsessions to solve something you couldn't. Yes, you will play hours, days, maybe months. However, I know many hundreds of people that they will stop playing that game after third time of ther death. So, if you achieve, or figured out anything else please message me. \n\nThank You.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013875815", "last_played": 1468492765, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_forever": 603}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1468448209, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511384", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1468453003, "recommendationid": "24304266", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "this is a great game and I recomend it to anyone who likes hard rpg games", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198085820857", "last_played": 1470415060, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 43, "playtime_forever": 122}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1468626236, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490979", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1468626236, "recommendationid": "24343669", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very Very interesting game, every new game i discover something new I can do, from my little play time i have im having fun, sleep was the reason i had to stop :/.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198029267571", "last_played": 1505511116, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 148, "playtime_forever": 23}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1468399612, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479062", "votes_down": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1468399612, "recommendationid": "24291507", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very bizarre, not sure if it is actually good.
