It's not pay-to-win, it's grind-until-you-can't-take-it-anymore.  It's relaxing, so if you're into european colony sim games, you'll probably come back for more.\n\nIt's the most similar game to Settlers II I have seen since Settlers II with a couple of differences that you would think add depth or annoyance:\n\nIt has a couple annoying quirks such as having to click on buildings to collect taxes and have to click three times to repair buildings.  All of that is automated after a certain point of each game yet you can't help to feel you're playing a mobile game (which it used to be).\n\nIt has micromanagement, lots of it.  You have to manage buildings and occupancy; forget something and you'll end up screwed eventually.  You also have TINY warehouses, so you need to keep track of them and sell to a merchant that doesn't invest (ever) in transportation.  Seems roads were dangerous as they wouldn't buy stuff in bulk.\n\nIt has a research \"tree\" that unlocks while you're gaining experience; now, here's the interesting thing: experience carries on through different playthroughs.  So you can't see everything or run a high-octane colony during the first playthrough (or you can but it gets so Factorio you'd rather start over).  Maps are small and for good reason, I remember havng Settlers II colonies so huge that at some point everything broke down in inefficiency that it was only but a beautiful mess.  In here you destroy and replace.\n\nIs it worth full price? I'm not sure... I had such a Settlers itch that for me it was.

You HAVE to click the locked building to get this information.\n\n- The names of each building, in the buildingmenu, doesn't pop-up. You HAVE to click the building in order to see what the building is good for, (this makes it confusing when you're trying to complete missions, since you have no idea of what building you need to build).\n\n- No Restart button.\n\n[7 hours of gaming]\n\n+Once you've leveled up to about level 9 and upgraded some stuff, the game starts to become more fun. You get more understanding of the concept and you start earning alot of coins! Like 10k+ coins.\n\n+ When you've got 4 tax collectors, you wont need to click all the time on houses to collect coins. Finally more freedom for building!\n\n+ Upgrading buildings is important in order to use the houses full potential.\n\n+ Getting a carpenter helps you to repair ALL buildings so that you don't have to repair them manually (That's if you got the coins to pay).

The name of the building, what it does and what it cost. Why would you think that players wants to click on each building to get that information? It's just a waste of time.\n\n- You often missclick and open a house... this makes the speed fall to normal... really annoying!\n\n+ I managed to build a quite big city and it flourished, but then all of the sudden everybody got sick and left my city.
