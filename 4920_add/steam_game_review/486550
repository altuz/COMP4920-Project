Has real potential but is incomplete since the following basic features are missing.\n\n* Keyboard control configuration option instead of forcing the player to use WASD for movement.\n\n* Dropping held items rather than forcing the player to hold onto food and gold already picked up.\n\n* Optionally, spiders and other creatures should cast shadows to help with dodging and detection.\n\nCurrently worth about $2 USD. However, if the features above are added, I'd be inclined to give this a positive review. As a stretch goal, the devs should add a map import feature from 'Dungeon Keeper 2' or 'War for the Overworld'. Even if map import were limited to copying the dungeon map itself then procedurally adding everything else, I'd still be willing to pay $20 to $30 for this feature.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197987550966", "last_played": 1500084438, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 959, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1500137966, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500137966, "recommendationid": "33563975", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
