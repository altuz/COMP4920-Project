Classic concept. Now imagine it with monsters chasing you. That's Toxic Terror. While the basic idea is there, and the idea of moving stuff/yourself around a level whilst being chased isn't so novel either (Burger Time, Wrecking Crew, Crazy Castle come to mind) it works well here and is combined with the right kind of clever level design that it needs. Also the horror theme works well, as it reminds one of classic gaming titles with a similar theme and characters (Castlevania, Vampire-Master of Darkness, Nosferatu, etc.). \nI'd recommend it! \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nHey, developer!
