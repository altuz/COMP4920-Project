The Cheating dynamic is my twist added to the game. When playing the harder modes that require more wins BLOCKING the CPU from Cheating if they have 15/16 will usually 'BUST' them. Cheating can also fix YOUR Bad Hands. (In the video I 'Cheat' a 14 hand to 20). If you like Blackjack its a fun twist (even though you can play with Cheating OFF)\n\nAlso the 26MB is due to very efficient coding. The size will expand as I add more characters/video and music (the stuff that takes up the most space). I'm already expecting a size increase with upcoming updates thats why I state 50MB for the game. I'm sure laptop users are glad to see a low storage game that wont use use GB's of space for one game. The game logic is multiple 10,000's lines of code but compresses nicely to a small package when compiled. Very neat and streamlined.", "recommendationid": "23486837", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
