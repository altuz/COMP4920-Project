Here we have, in one game, a masterpiece that rivals Hideo Kojima's own Metal Gear Solid franchise as a whole. The depth of story, character diversity and development is truly a remarkable achievement, with graphics that shatter all expectations and wholly flushed out and ever changing gameplay mechanics that will leave you wanting more from start to finish. I came here looking for a game...but what I got was an experience unlike anything I could have imagined. I implore you, the consumer, to buy this game and support the love, devotion, blood, sweat and TEARS poured into this master class of gaming. Because it's not just a game...this...this is a work of art. \n\n10/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198060857157", "last_played": 1505167024, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 170, "playtime_forever": 88}, "votes_up": 38, "timestamp_created": 1505170521, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552898", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505170521, "recommendationid": "34891622", "votes_funny": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The peak of Gaming", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198161527855", "last_played": 1504912075, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 373, "playtime_forever": 267}, "votes_up": 21, "timestamp_created": 1504912146, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527773", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504912146, "recommendationid": "34824944", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A well put game with a brilliant storyline and beautiful graphics.
