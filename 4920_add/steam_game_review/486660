A very steep learning curve. I'd also recommend a controller highly, not sure if this is because i'm used to pressing space to jump but keyboard and pressing either shift feels unnatural for me. Trying to use a Steam Controller with this and it's okay and works, but i'm sure it's more to do with the actual controller rather than the game. \n\nGameplay is unique and a few minor bugs as you'd expect with an early access.\n\n\nEDIT; Updated keyboard controls!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019566584", "last_played": 1477408427, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 86, "playtime_forever": 66}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1477335718, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507230", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1477666492, "recommendationid": "26202618", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Painfully short, however as a bare bones beta all the building blocks are in place to make this a fun challenging little platforming game and although the mechanics are few they are highlly polished to the point where I'd be happy with just the release of more levels.
