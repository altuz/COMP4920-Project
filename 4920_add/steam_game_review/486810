This bundle contains 3 Snark hidden object games and 3 House of 1,000 Doors games. I almost didn't buy this because I already own the first two House of 1,000 Doors and I knew nothing about the Snark games. But let me tell you, this bundle is worth every cent. I found all 3 Snark games extremely enjoyable and the third House of 1,000 Doors lives up to the greatness of its predecessors. I'm feeling too lazy to give a detailed review but I will say that this bundle should be in every hidden object fan's library.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 966, "steamid": "76561198138437975", "last_played": 1506737112, "num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 1174, "playtime_forever": 966}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1506682145, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529576", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506682145, "recommendationid": "35289307", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
