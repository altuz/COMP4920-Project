After spending time with Abrix for \"Kids\" however, it's as if everything good about the original has been removed and only the crap is left over. Somehow, the controls feel even more laggy then the orginal, which I'm not sure how is even possible considering it's using the exactly the same base code. The new levels that I played where just terrible.. the incorrectly spelt \"Labirynth\" levels do nothing but disorientate and frustrate.. the addition of poorly implemented gnomes to avoid further adds to frustration. And this game is aimed at kids? I fail to see the point.. stick to the original and completely avoid this disaster.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198329795660", "last_played": 1481022102, "num_reviews": 82, "num_games_owned": 896, "playtime_forever": 272}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1481024189, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505067", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1481096420, "recommendationid": "28217810", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "first mission...\n\nMy eyes... \n\nIf you try to look at the block and it look like 3D but it trick your eyes while you walking around\n\nthe control is flocking.  they don't move same speed as your reaction. lame\n\nthanks for free cards!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198094213432", "last_played": 1485897603, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 273, "playtime_forever": 199}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1485897694, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502455", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1485897694, "recommendationid": "29614621", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "5/10 stars for this game", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198366027187", "last_played": 1496833847, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 98, "playtime_forever": 243}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1496832162, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490369", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1496832162, "recommendationid": "32236505", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Most boring:(((", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198089739933", "last_played": 1480054416, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 2258, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1480054471, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495730", "votes_down": 14, "timestamp_updated": 1480054471, "recommendationid": "27391073", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198033107016", "last_played": 1491001200, "num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 349, "playtime_forever": 176}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1470432286, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457035", "votes_down": 17, "timestamp_updated": 1479663191, "recommendationid": "24731744", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
