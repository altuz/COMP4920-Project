Its gameplay focus is well split into all the aspects that characterise an RTT game: game rhythm, upgrades, buildings, unit variety and relevance, population realism, battle simulation... One has got to admire the effort put into crafting the unit functioning and overall building management in this one. Superb.\n\nCossacks offers plenty of pleasurable elements. First, there's the outstanding number of nations, each with its own architectural identity (wonderfully done, by the way); as well as the outstanding number of unique units and their precise importance on the battlefield or in the development of one's domains. Second, there's the realistic representation of population growth, with civil infrastructure costing you more as your settlement expands, although there is no set limit for your population. Third, there's the artillery/infantry details, amazing to watch as they engage in battle. Fourth, there's the customisable gameplay, as the options for a skirmish match are reasonable (type of terrain, type of elevation, game speed, resources, etc.), gathering all the good and fair choices everybody should have when playing a free-build or skirmish game mode in any RTS/RTT. Last but not least, the naval conflicts: it's just too exciting to watch your territories and riches grow and have to formulate quick strategies with your coffers and coal reserves so you can build a solid, fearsome fleet that can outrun the enemy's.\n\nWhether you're playing the main campaigns or the 17th and 18th centuries battles in quick match mode, Cossacks: Art of War shall bring you strategy-ecstasy. The huge battles (details of hundreds of men can be formed), the realistic artillery ballistics, the exciting invasions on the enemy's settlement, the fast-paced management of your resources (wood, gold, food, iron and coal) and workers, and the extreme attention that one has to keep on the keeping up of improvements and specific upgrades, will determine who prevails in the hot war scenario of this game. Cossacks can give you this kind of thrill, if you're fond of the genre.\n\nBear in mind that, while I'm writing on the Art of War page, this goes for all its \"sister\" games (European Wars, Back to War)."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1388959210, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509083", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "8581187", "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011447554", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1359273600, "num_games_owned": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2346}, "timestamp_updated": 1388959210, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Glorious game! if you don't have it already GET IT!"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1388045369, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510427", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8291915", "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198015071002", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1493469480, "num_games_owned": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 135}, "timestamp_updated": 1388045369, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I have fond memories of this game so I'm probably pretty biased.

Would you like each soldier to keep track of how many enemies they kill? Well you better be able to pay them! This is Cossacks a no nonsense RTS for those who like an indepth game but still casual capable.\n Game play wise this is easy to pick up if you ever played the AoE series or Rise of Nations. Excpet you only live in the 17th and 18th C. Build a town or more, control citizens and put them to work, build army, build defences, build navy, and upgrade tech. Simple right? Well no. There is more than just gold to mine for. You have coal, iron, ect. Then you have wood and stone.(they are located typically close to each other) You have mills and fishing for food. If you can not pay an army they will rebel, and if they can not eat they will die. The thing is numbers matter here. You can have over 2000 citizens and so can your enemies. So be aware you need to grow. Also you can capture enemy citizens if no military is near them. So you can absorb your enemies culture. The naval battles are really cool and controling waters with a coast line city is a big advatage. A frigate can easly destroy a incoming army when in range.\n Now the indepth part. The technology trees are massive and pricey. Do not upgrade your 17th cent soldiers and just rush to 18th instead if you have a western euro nation. They are pricey and take time, then you will not use them once you are in the 18th cent. Each mine can be upgrader to support more workers. The military and agriculture upgrades are very indepth. Rifling and gun powder advancments make all the difference. So you can have a highlander or other ranged soldier on a hill snyping and weakening a passing army. Remember when I said each soldier keeps a tally of how many he has killed. Well I have had a soldier kill more than 2500 troops due to time and a cliff.  \n Now for stradgey. This is kind of a grand RTS at times. It can take a long time to complete a game. So you can take advatage of the land. elevated troops(on a hill or cliff) shoot farther and well placed cannons can turn the tide. Dragoons and other horsemen are great for fleeing troops and artillary, but aweful in a siege. Naval control is a massive advantage but very expensive. If you lose a man o war to muntiny you will struggle to get the sea back. Picking a wise local for your city is near impossible. If you are on the water and you lose control of the sea you're lost, if you take a valley you can become a sitting duck. Think of your entrances and exits.\n So what about the nations? Each has their own advatages and unique troops. The middle eastern and eastern Europe counrties are all better early in the game. If you pick these nations like Turkey or Russia be aggressive, cause man the computer will be. These troops cost the least but have major weaknesses. Once you get to the 18th C the power drastically turns. Countries like Britain, France, Prussia, and Sweden are the stronger. With countries like Spain some where in the middle. This game follows historic fact so some technologies do not get developed in some nations.\n Now for the bad. Back to War is the last expansion but does not recoginize any resolution other than 768 and 2160p for me. 2160p is not compatable with this game and it will crash. It also will not take a custome res. This game, the Art of War does support all resolutions. The highest it will support is 1440p. Since it is 2D it will just zoom farther out. The game also crashes at times. Typically around the 3-4 hour mark. Loading is fast and it does auto save.  \n So if you like AoE II or any other RTS. Give this or Back to War a try. It's like them but bigger and more focused on historical accuracy. For a game hitting the 15 year mark I would still strongly recommend it."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1434057498, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502081", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 10, "recommendationid": "16314395", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198079463059", "num_reviews": 56, "last_played": 1434591548, "num_games_owned": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 164}, "timestamp_updated": 1434148795, "received_for_free": false, "review": "FUCKING ALGERIANS KILLED MY POPE\n\nin all seriousness, a very fun game with lots of variety. cossack games and their spin offs are great ;)"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1409458365, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500306", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "11930124", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198024349855", "num_reviews": 125, "last_played": 1359100800, "num_games_owned": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 610}, "timestamp_updated": 1409458365, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Classic RTS must have for any RTS fan!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1356044217, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500578", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "3125417", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198017857285", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1444710609, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3510}, "timestamp_updated": 1356044217, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good fun, a classic RTS."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1342985894, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500162", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "3690048", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198026118964", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1490752277, "num_games_owned": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1207}, "timestamp_updated": 1342985894, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Sure, the graphics may not be as great as AoE or Civ V, but the fact that the unit limits are so large, and there are so many countries each with unique abilities makes the game extremely fun."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1472556613, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502987", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "25247302", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197969749884", "num_reviews": 753, "last_played": 1497696107, "num_games_owned": 1382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 10168}, "timestamp_updated": 1472556613, "received_for_free": false, "review": "RTS classic.
