So good, in fact, that I will write my first review.\n\nThe Good:\n+ Challenging and in-depth gameplay with many aspects (army and town management, diplomacy, and most importantly PILLAGING, WARRING, AND MURDERING FARMERS)\n+ Leveling system is in depth and each skill has a good effect in game, no skills feel useless.\n+ Epic battles with hundreds of units, castle sieges and bandit raids.\n+ Easy to pick up and play, even when you're high.\n+ Online multiplayer is good for testing your skills against other players (however don't expect a great deal in comparison to the glory of singleplayer) \n+ ASTOUNDING MODDING COMMUNITY - Content from the Steam workshop and other sources gives the game almost infinite playability (Yes, there are Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings mods).\n\nThe Bad:\n- After a while (~100hrs), all fighting begins to feel a bit the same. (At this point, if you aren't already into diplomacy and town management you might find yourself getting bored.)\n- Potato graphics (Think oblivion without the weirdly gross heads), but they hold up well enough.\n\nOverall:\nThis game is a work of art. I first began to play in 2016, and could not believe I hadn't heard of the game sooner. As an RPG it is every bit as good as any Elder Scrolls title to date. A wonderful example of what can happen when developers put their heart and soul into a game, and encourage community input through mods. Thoroughly looking forward to the next installment, Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord!   \n\n9/10 - Truly a great game!"}]}
