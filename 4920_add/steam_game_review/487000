Co-op is working now and it adds a whole new bit of excitement, i.e mobs are even tougher then when by yourself. Sometimes combat can be a pain if your fighting close to a tree or rock as you will most likely hit one of them instead of the enemy but overall ive had no issues murdering them. As of right now im still testing what skills are usefull and which ones i think are a waste of the shards needed to get and upgrade but freeze i think will be a must. I do think the drop rate on the blue shards is a little low seeing as you need them for anything u can get for gear or skills.

Being armed with only a shovel to start out with (no Shovel Knight here), I'd say I'm not doing too bad...It's a slow pace at first, then gets much faster as you progress.\n\nI haven't tried the co-op yet, but it's something I will surely check out soon. QH has a lot of potential, I'm not blown away by it, but I like it. Right off the bat I'd like to see more skills as you level up and more enemy variety. Gameplay-wise and the look and feel of QH kinda reminds me of games like Wanderlust Adventures, Magicka (minus the spell system), and DeathSpank. \n\nDon't let the Isometric view and the RPG tag fool you If you're looking for a Diablo clone. This has puzzles and adventure style of gameplay mixed in and is no way comparable to Diablo, which is not a bad thing at all, just wanted to get that out of the way for anyone that was possibly wondering what the actual gameplay consisted of. QH seemed a bit \"kiddie\" to me at first but only before I died a dozen times and also before I started to feel the old-school/Zelda-type of gameplay it delivers. \n\nMy only con atm is that dying is pointless in it's current state. Part of the reason I've died so much is that I'm not afraid to. I would like to see QH updated with some sort of penalty for dying besides being warped back to a checkpoint, which always seems to be very close by.\n\nI recommend Quest Hunter to those seeking a simplistic Iso-ARPG/Adventure game. I'm addicted to it atm and I'm looking forward to grinding my way to the top and then showing off my \"OP-ness\" with the online co-op. Over an hour in and I just got my first real weapon and a hat so I'm stoked.

It needs a lot more work before it becomes enjoyable though.\n\nSo, my experience so far: Start new game, done a few quests. When I started on the second location (camp) I realised the game has no vendor for healing potions and the food does not restore that much health. Even the simplest monsters do a lot of damage. You sometimes die, but you can start at the beginning of the current location, I did not notice any penalties for deaths but once the stone monsters became frequent the game became a sequence of: hit -> die -> respawn -> repeat.\n\nSo, this is an interesting idea with lots of potential, but for the time being I'd say it is considerably weaker than torchlight or even the second diablo.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198031590504", "last_played": 1502993734, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 169, "playtime_forever": 37}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1502994481, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501058", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1502994481, "recommendationid": "34312679", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "NOTE: This is a \"First Impressions\" review, played 80 minutes in so far, co-op, not read the forums or seen any other information about how to play etc.\n\nI like it, it has it's flaws (I'll come to those in a minute), but so far it seems to be a solid start.

You can only do this if you exit the game you are in and go back to the start.\n\n- There doesn't seem to be any run option... No stamina bar what so ever which makes the game feel slow at times. Since there are alot of dungeons, one would like to be able to run back to the entrance instead of walking slowly back.\n\n- No quest option to read which quest to do and so on...\n\n- When you sell items, you can only sell one item at a time.
