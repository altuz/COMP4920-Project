I know that because I've added the whole series on Neoseeker. That's why when I saw it on Greenlight, I voted yes, despite the fact that it's just puzzles after puzzles.\n\nIt would be my first real time with that type of games and I must say that at first, I was bored and kinda wondering what I was doing. I knew the mechanics: you have a series of numbers indicating how many tiles are used for a drawing in the column or in the line. Sometimes, it's easy as the whole line or column is concerned but at other times, it's really a matter of   making your brain work: if for example, three tiles are needed and known, you know that the tiles just next to the beginning and the end can't be used for the column or the rest of the line.\n\nI must say that I was surprised to find myself really deep into the game. True, the game is just simple: the plot isn't really developed as it's a penguin family travelling anywhere and the 14th game introducted apparently a fourth color to the game.  I can't make a comparison of what's new, what's an evolution or what's a drawback. Heck, even the drawings aren't really interesting at the end. However, it's the challenge that makes Fantasy Mosaics 14 interesting.\n\nIt also means that only those who loves a brain challenge will be interested. I've only played in casual mode, where numbers are crossed, as I'm not really into having an harder difficulty: some of the puzzles are already hard in themselves as you have to make choices without any indication or logic.\n\nAnyway, I'm really recommending the game, though you should wait for a discount (10 euros is a little high for me for that kind of games). I'm just waiting for the rest of the series, though it seems that only those after the number 14 are being released. It would be great to see the earlier work on Steam, just to enjoy the evolution (but they're also released on Big Fish Games).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "last_played": 1499452424, "num_reviews": 352, "num_games_owned": 2214, "playtime_forever": 1699}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1499595607, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534332", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499595607, "recommendationid": "33399987", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
