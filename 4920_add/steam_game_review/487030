Given the low price and additional content and improvements in the Steam version, though, I'm not going to hold this against the game.\n\nHowever, it's pretty much just another Braveland - a super short and dumbed-down King's Bounty clone. It only took me a little over an hour (69 minutes) to completely finish the Warrior's 16-stage campaign with all stars, and the Overlord's campaign was even shorter to finish, only being 6 stages long and not allowing for grinding. In general, there's not much in the way of character or army customization. Due to the unbalanced leveling rate and amount of early-game grind the game encourages as a result of it, you quickly end up with a maxed-out character, so your choices just amount to which abilities to gain first. As far as army customization, the Warrior has five army slots and six possible unit types, so your only choice is which of the unit types not to bring. In my experience, ditching the slow basic infantry unit is basically a no-brainer, so that's not even much of a choice. (And yet, it's still better than what the Mage gets, only having five unit types for five army slots. He just gets to bring everything.)\n\nI mentioned an unbalanced leveling rate, and it's probably the only true mechanical problem this game has - it follows the King's Bounty formula of letting you recruit units up to a maximum amount defined by a Leadership score tied to your level, but until the endgame you gain levels faster than you gain money to recruit units, so any time you come close to filling up your army, you gain another level and need to spend thousands more money recruiting units. And this is if you don't need to replace lost units! In fact, replacing lost units is so expensive that early-game grind is heavily incentivized so that you can get an army strong enough to not lose any units in most of your fights.\n\nAll of the above, except for the simplicity, does not really apply to the third campaign, in which you play the final boss of the first two campaigns, however. It is far simpler than even those, as there is no level advancement or army recruitment, only you using the final boss unit and being able to summon stacks of Minions as your only spell, once per battle for each of the six battles you've previously won on any difficulty. That... does not end up having any real strategy to it at all.\n\nIn bizarre choices, by the way, this game has achievements - 14 of them, of which I have 12 - but they're not implemented through Steam, so they're only visible in-game and not on your profile. I'm not sure why they weren't implemented as Steamworks achievements.\n\nIn any case, I can't really describe Beasts Battle as a poor value, since it's $1 and probably about three hours of play, but it's also less good for anything other than a quick timewaster than even the Braveland series, which was already pretty mediocre as this subgenre goes. Stick to the actual King's Bounty games if possible, and skip Beasts Battle.\n\n(Edit: Now I've beaten all three campaigns, though I'm missing 8 stars due to the last few Overlord levels being a bit annoying and not wanting to grind up an army for the Mage campaign's postgame levels on Normal/Hard after I lost a bunch of it.)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988663774", "last_played": 1467443852, "num_reviews": 182, "num_games_owned": 2229, "playtime_forever": 232}, "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_created": 1467420814, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533929", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1467440156, "recommendationid": "24001578", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is a very simple HOMM clone in the style of the Braveland series.
