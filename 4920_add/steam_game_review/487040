I was looking forward to it, the concept isn't unique but the characters are but the game being nothing more than a fair gimmick and after about an hour and a half worth of gameplay, I decided to refund the game as I was disappointed above anything else.\n\n[B]I'll start with the things that I loved:[/b]\n\n-The characters of this game and the variety that they come in are the star. The animations for the characters themselves, the one-liners, the abilities, really make their personalities come alive. Alot of them - well most of them are references to pop-culture (movie and other games).\n\n-Voice acting is actually pretty great, each character sounds set apart and none of them sound similar.\n\n-The controls are tight, very responsive and tuned for the Xbox 360 controller. It's so precise and reacts to every little touch.\n\n-The art style (for the playable characters) is very reminiscent of 90's Sega Genesis games. Very faithful and nice to look at.\n\n-Puns, puns and more puns. Parodies and references aboard, if you're not down for that then you probably won't enjoy this game or what it brings to the table.\n\n-The sound is decent, the soundtrack isn't great but isn't bad either.\n\n[B]Now we'll look at the bad:[/b]\n\n-Weak enemy variety. Seeing how you're always playing as another character, ot gets boring seeing the same enemies over and over again. Alot of love went into the playable characters and no love went into the npc's.\n\n-Animations for the npc's are sub-par. I love that all 88 Heroes have their own unique abilities (well most) and animations but those things do not reflect off of the npc's and that's sad to realize.\n\n-The poorest made bosses ever. I understand that the bosses have to accessible for ANY character to beat but holy crap, it seems like the devs were lazy while coming up with them.\n\n-No real depth or sense of progression. Unlike something like Rogue-Legacy you really don't have anything to look forward to. When you beat the game, it unlocks solo (1 hero mode) and 8 hero mode but that's hardly rewarding, especially since you already know what the surprise is.\n\n-The art style for the npc's and the levels is totally det apart from the art-style of the playable characters. They feel boring while the heroes feel fun.\n\n-Getting squashed by the ceiling isn't a challenge, it's annoying. Since this is a one hit death kinda game, it becomes a burden to be precise in an unnecessary way.\n\n-Vast majority of characters feel stunted because they cannot attack in the air - even ones that should!\n\n-I wish I could say that none of the characters are clones but I consider at least 8 to be clones. 4 Teenage Mutant Armadillo brothers and the pixel people that can't do anything but run.\n\n-Invoking useless playable characters purposely. I think this just destroyed the balance of the game, mainly because you have 3 types of characters: The strong, the average and the completey useless ones which don't have any abilities at all and can't attack. Only run.\n\n-No video options. Regretfully there are no video options. Would have been cool if the game had some filters or other types of things to give it some extra visual flair - especially since you can play as just one character later.\n\n[I]I don't hate the game, I just don't think it's worth the $15.00 for what it is. I don't reckon that this is as polished or executed as great as it could have been. I really loved Super House Of Dead Ninjas which is by the same folks but I think that this title is one to get at discounted price. Perhaps $7.49 would be fair for it.\n\nYes. It's a lovechild of Rogue-Legacy and Broforce but not as satisfying as either... at least not at full price. That's my review and those are the reasons why I refunded. With phenomenal titles like Hollow Knight for the same price, there is NO excuse for devs to get lazy in design. I'll buy the game again later but only when it's on a discounted sale price.[/i]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198166620870", "last_played": 1492358180, "num_reviews": 96, "num_games_owned": 282, "playtime_forever": 76}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1492367742, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522239", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1492368166, "recommendationid": "31184275", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "88 Heroes isn't just some generic retro-styled game - it positively reeks of the aesthetic of 80's and 90's British computer games.
