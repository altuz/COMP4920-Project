I know i do not have a ton of hours, but i\u2019ve been with this game since launch day.\n\n\nThis review comes from the perspective of playing the game, and hosting a private server for the game. My server; Avalon - was up an hour after the game launched, and to this day as i\u2019m writing the review it is still up. So to say i\u2019m generally invested in this game is an understatement. \n\n[b]Here\u2019s a basic tl;dr of the main issues as i see it[/b] - i\u2019ll try to elaborate on each.\n\n[b]Map is small/mobs are boring[/b]\nThe devs said in their live stream they have no plans to add to the size of the map. Really disappointing because the map is fairly small. \n\nThe monsters in the game aren\u2019t that great. You can range them down before they even get to you. Adding to that, there\u2019s only like a total of 15 mobs in the game right now.\n\n[b]Lack of objectives[/b]\nThe only objective of this game is to level and build; and leveling is only a means of unlocking new items to craft/build. And building in incredibly easy, as resources are abundant. Once you build yourself a nice base, there\u2019s really nothing else to do. There\u2019s no deep or intricate production/craft chains.\n\n[b]Lack of direction[/b]\nI think the dev team is great; they seem passionate about the game and want it to succeed. They\u2019re very personal with the community (discord) and sometimes they release 2-3 updates a week. But the updates are shallow and the current updates lack a proper direction.\n\nEach week they release an update; but the updates they release don\u2019t add that much gameplay. They added marble structures. Most players will come back; build for 1-2 hours and then leave. They added a few creatures; most players will come back, try out the new creature and leave. \n\n[b]No point to pvp or raiding[/b]\nThere no point to pvp besides to player kill. There\u2019s zero competition for resources, zero reasons to engage someone. Which breathes a way bigger issue; griefing. Veteran players will simply kill newbies for the sake of killing them, because they have nothing else to do. The devs said they plan on adding a rank system for pvp, this is just going to encourage more griefing.\n\nFor raiding it\u2019s the same thing; there\u2019s no point too it besides wanting to wipe out someone\u2019s base.\n\n[b]Quality of life[/b]\nThe game for some reasons lacks basic features that a game should have before hitting EA. You can\u2019t delete your character, you can\u2019t make a new (second) character, there\u2019s no local chat, chat commands like /r don\u2019t work, settings constantly reset. I just think by now these things should have been addressed.\n\n[b]Optimization[/b]\nIt feels like they release an optimization patch each week; and it seems like half of them don\u2019t do much. At the start of a new server you\u2019ll load in within a minute and be at a stable 60 fps at max settings. Come back in a week you\u2019ll take a lot longer to load in, and you\u2019re fps bounces between 35-40.\n\nI know structures built causes this sort of thing; but there are a ton of other games out there that resemble citadel that don\u2019t have this issue. Even as a server admin this becomes annoying. For some reason when servers are up for 3-4 hours they start to lag and a restart of the server usually resolves it. Eventually restarts take 10 minutes because the game world takes so long to load.\n\n[b]Servers[/b]\nAnd this leads me to another issue; the servers. I wish the dev team would consolidate servers, and rent their own hardware to host. They currently have servers hosted by g-portal - for anyone who has hosted a server in the past, hearing the name g-portal should tell you everything you need to know about their service.\n\nI find it really weird that the official servers are hosted on game-servers with worse hardware than private servers.\n\nI have 3 months left on my server host (paid for 5 months) and after that i\u2019ll be moving on. I supported the game for a while, but after the past few updates i don\u2019t see a proper direction. I didn\u2019t want to write a negative review; but this may be the only way to get feedback noticed it seems. Despite constantly leaving feedback on the discord.\n\nAdd some objectives, give players things to do besides build - because building really has no purpose in this game other than crafting stations. There\u2019s no point to pvp besides PK. Make some arenas, add towns and npcs, make currency a thing. Resources are too abundant.\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "steamid": "76561198140568564", "last_played": 1506272600, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 3873}, "votes_up": 31, "timestamp_created": 1505675745, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551993", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505675745, "recommendationid": "35031135", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "i love the concept of this game, however, the game is broke AF. i tried to find a server to play on, and looks like all of the servers are dead already? i'll be paitently waiting for them to update and make the game more playable and worth my time. :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198119948525", "last_played": 1504564311, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 48, "playtime_forever": 2213}, "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_created": 1504668253, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520719", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1504668253, "recommendationid": "34768815", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ok, so I am casual player and have now spent a fair bit of time playing this game. I can see that there are mixed reviews for this game which I can sort of understand as the game is not perfect and is still being developed. The developers are quite active and often respond to posts on the forums and I get the feeling they are listening to our feedback, which is always a good start. The developers have also provided a chart of the things they working, what coming next and things they would like to introduce at some point. This is great when engaging with the community.\n\nSo first off when you get in the game the graphics are great and the world environment is nice with two prominent biomes (forest/mountains and snow/frozen areas). The interface has recently been given a face lift and very easy to use and navigate with the building commands and the spell etc nicely set out and easy to understand.\n\nThe game on the whole runs really well and smooth. Although occasionally you do get patches introduced which may mess this up. But these often get resolved fairly quickly (not always quick enough for some though!). The building in the game is nice and easy. Essentially there is a hidden grid system so when building everything will join up nicely. Indeed all elements of your base need to be connected in some way to claim ownership (by placing a throne).\n\nThere is plenty to do if you like building and making grand cities. PVE wise, there is a limited about to do. There are various caves you can explore which are usually filled with mobs to take on. The AI of these mobs is not so great at the moment and still needs to be worked on. There is talk about having world bosses in the future for large group encounters which will be nice. PVE still gets the usual griefing where people build in caves or block areas off. The devs are working on this to keep things fun and content accessible. If you have probs though there are a few servers to chose from.\n\nAs far as PVP goes, this is quite fun. They made changes recently which makes this aspect of the game a lot harder, as people found their bases got destroyed to easily. Now its more of break in and grab the loot situation unless your determined to take a base out and willing to spend a lot of time and resources (assuming people hide their thrones well). Whilst this makes raiding harder it actually improves the experience a little, as a lot of raiding probably occurs when people are off line. You can use turrets and shield to beef your base up more which are effective if done right. Together with harder raiding, you can sleep knowing that if you built with pvp in mind you base should be ok. If you do get hit, then your loot may be all gone (depending how you hide it) and your base will be their still. Repair and reinforce and restock. For the raider though, while off line raiding some say is the cowards way, it gives you more time to try and break in, like a puzzle, looking for the quickest route in using the least siege spells to make it worth it. Often people build a base like a maze so you need to try and work out the best way to go when confronted with 3 doors for instance. So I actually find the pvp side of things good. A nice balance between effort of raiding and defence.\n\nI have not done much pvp against other players when roaming around. People either just fly away on their broom or are just friendly....(prob attack you in the night instead :D). I have taken plenty of peoples dragons out when they forage too far away and then I take whatever loot it had on it hehehe\n\nI would say at the moment the pvp servers are best to play on as you can pretty do the RPG PvE stuff on their with an added element of potential conflict with others.\n\nSo at the time of writing this review, there are a couple of bugs work out. There is a decay system to remove buildings of inactive players. But this seems to be affecting active players at present with random wall panels and or floors going missing. This will be fixed soon I am sure. There is also an issue with the severs it seem with low fps and things loading up in game. Again this is not normally an issue so I am sure it will be sorted next patch.\n\nSo in conclusion, this is a well polished game, particularly for an Early Access. The game is really fun to play and although it has limited content, there is still plenty to do. It will take you a while to reach level 60 but things will unlock along the way to keep you interested. I am not level 60 yet and I have been playing nearly 300 hours!!! mind you I haven't been power levelling.\n\nSo I would say get the game, try it out as you will get plenty of game play for only a few quid!

Being British I have no need to be rude to get a point across, I can be scruplessly accurate instead in my native language. The two developers I had reply to my threads both responded quickly, a point in their favour, but likewise both their replies weren't really to do directly with the points being raised, so ultimately useless.\n\nFor me, the game is broken now, I am unable to play for more than a few minutes at a time without some UE4 exception fault or another happening and crashing out the game.  I asked in one thread for help or at least advice on how I might remedy the problems introduced with their last 3-4 patches, and got none.\n\nIn the other thread, I identified for them how seriously underpowered their game servers are, leading to a terribly sub-par experience on the only European pvp server left with ANY population left worthy of the word. All the others having 0, 1, or occasionally 2 people left playing. The second developer tried to refute this, but didn't offer any quantifiable data to back up his insistance that things were fine, when they are quite obviously not.\n\nWhen lightly pressed for some kind of specifics as to the actual specifications and supposed requirements of a server for this game, I was left ignored.\n\nIn the end, my comment to him was exactly this \" Steam numbers down 90% in last month. GG Denis.\" This was making the final point that if everything was fine as he espoused, then people wouldn't be leaving the game faster than rats during a building burning.\n\nThis comment got me banned from their forums for being \"unnecessarily rude\".\n\nThis game is broken in its current form. The developers, such as they are, seem unable to fix it, and unwilling to acknowledge how broken it is.\n\nThere is no end-game past leveling to lvl60. There is no meaningful pvp left, just offline ninja-raiding. This has turned the end-game into a tower defense game instead, but to build anythig that can survive in your absence overnight against even 1 or 2 determined players is ultimately self-defeating as the servers they use can't handle their sub-standard, laughably optimised, buggy coding.  If you build something that can survive such a ninja-raid, then the game breaks.\n\nGG Denis.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 12294, "steamid": "76561197986641201", "last_played": 1507202244, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 148, "playtime_forever": 52552}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1507139888, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499443", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1507139888, "recommendationid": "35477312", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "When it first came out there was alot broken, That said, the state of the game now in the short amount of time it has been.

The best mechanics in this game are the building ones I mean you can build huge and expansive castles that look insane.

If not then do not buy this game because it has little to offer besides its building mechanics. Lastly I feel that this game would have such a larger player base if the devs had just waited a few months to get all of the bugs fixed. 9 out of 10 people who have stopped playing this game have stopped because of stupid bugs that could have been easily patched if the devs had waited to release the game. This game has alot of potential, I just hope that they player base will be consistent enough to encourage the devs to keep inporving this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 215, "steamid": "76561198107681540", "last_played": 1506314818, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_forever": 10424}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504753956, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500010", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504753956, "recommendationid": "34787283", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great game with great potential.
