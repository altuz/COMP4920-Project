I have nearly 300 hours in the game, and I will certainly be putting in at least 3000 more.  This game has the most compelling plot that's been seen since Dostoevsky's own \"Crime & Punishment\".  The game's cinematic qualities rival those of Citizen Kane.  The artistic qualities of the graphics are superior to those of Michelangelo's paintings in the Sistine Chapel.  The music outclasses that of the great Luciano Pavoratti.  But what is truly magical about this experience, beyond all of that, is the gameplay.  The controls are more realistic than real life; the combat is more exciting than actual military combat; and as an experienced equestrian I can attest to the fact that the horse riding could not have been more perfect.  In this game you can commit genocides against people of or races and religions, namely Muslims and Catholics.\n\nSimply put: 10/10.  The perfect game."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505491241, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512911", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34975407", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198075680859", "num_reviews": 168, "last_played": 1505043548, "num_games_owned": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 320}, "timestamp_updated": 1505491241, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I played this game after a very long stint of War band.
