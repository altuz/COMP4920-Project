Grating. Limited.  \n\nUnity Engine. Tablet-style draw a line levels. Lots of white saturation everywhere grating the eyes. Redundant with half a dozen better titles. \n\nThis franchise opts for sequels to add more content, and just recycles the engine. As opposed to Unium whom has Steam Workshop support instead. Thats not even counting all the pipeline games that twist the formula and makes it better. Either A Virus Named Tom or Mighty Hose. Alternatively you could go play Anode which is tetris with draw-a-line through colors mechanic to collapse blocks.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "last_played": 1504639503, "num_reviews": 1973, "num_games_owned": 4956, "playtime_forever": 526}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504639678, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504639678, "recommendationid": "34763109", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
