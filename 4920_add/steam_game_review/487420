While it is 'functional' and they player is able to engage with the gameplay, it feel very rough around the edges. The entire game is left up to you to discover how it works and why things do what they do. While this is desirable at some points, this game does not implement this aspect in a good way. \n\nI feel as though Space Radiance could be a good game and I really like what it tried to implement, it just isn't yet finished. Hopefully the developer will keep at it and make the interface and gameplay a bit more smooth and presentable for the final audience. \n\nThe first few levels only allow the player to use one 'form' yet there are multiple green gases to cover. While I understand the strategy and intent behind this (preventing the player from essentially just walling up and winning) there are times that this makes the level essentially unwinable. The flying beams have seemingly random velocites when they enter the screen and there are often times, such as the case in level three, where the beam moves too fast to click and move your 'form.' \n\nI don't see much fun in a game that you can really win at when that is not the intentional goal. I would love to be able to do longer term levels where I could 'train up' and then build a better protection 'form' to use in future defenses. The game plays a bit like this currently but it is a lot of trial and error, and a lot of restarting levels simply because you were faced with an unbeatable challenge.\n\nI'm wating for the next big update to move this game in a new and improved direction, but until then I think the best bet is to pass on it or find it in a bundle.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065170817", "last_played": 1465544100, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 104, "playtime_forever": 50}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1465439472, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512270", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1465544471, "recommendationid": "23461613", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I liked the graphics of the game but the music in it gave me very bad headaches, that's probably just me.\nThe game mechanics were something not very unique, I've seen it almost everywhere and I've seen some games more enjoyable that were free.\nI mean no offense to the developer but I wouldn't recommend this game for purchase, even $2 isn't quite worth it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069299552", "last_played": 1465433448, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 9}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1465433713, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510102", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1465433713, "recommendationid": "23460674", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
