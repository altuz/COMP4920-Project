The symbolism used by... THIS GAME IS MADE BY GOD HIMSELF AND IF YOU DO NOT BUY IT THEN YOU ARE NOT WORTHY TO ENTER HEAVEN. IF THE GAME CRASHES ON YOU WHEN LEAVING A LEVEL IT SHOW THAT YOU ARE A SINNER AND ARNT WORTHY TO PLAY THIS MASTERPEICE OF A GAME", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198120517662", "last_played": 1499025404, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 36}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1498939259, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514412", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1498939259, "recommendationid": "33098999", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[u]Pepe Porcupine is a a masterpiece[/u], and i love it (as you can see from my hours). The game has two categories: Head scratchers and Head Bangers. Both the gamemodes are packed full of action, and contain around 90 puzzles. \n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]The graphics are fantastic, they have gone for the 3D 2D, meaning that its a top-down game, but the protagonist (Pepe) and the boxes have a sort of three dimensional shape to them giving them more life. \n\n[h1]Music:[/h1] The music in the game is fantastic, its playing classical music at full volume; giving more life to the overwhelming puzzles. It appears to be playing the song \"Gloria\" by Antonio Vivaldi which in my eyes is a masterpiece.\n\n[h1]The puzzles:[/h1] The puzzles in the game are challenging, but fun. The category names really fit the puzzles, seeing how some of the puzzles really made me scratch my head. The puzzles can either be really easy, or they can be puzzles that look impossible.\n\n[h1]Final verdict:[/h1] The game is really worth the price, and im surprised the game doesnt cost more. The game deserves a lot more recognition because of the amount of work that has clearly been put into it. The game is fun for anyone, and everyone that enjoys puzzles. The graphics, and music is astonishing for the price of the game, and the game runs a lot better than a lot of games on steam. Plus, the game is only 75 mb. I highly recommend the game and hope that this review will make people appreciate the masterpiece of a game this actually is.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198086056339", "last_played": 1499242715, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 97, "playtime_forever": 783}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1498817682, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500363", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498817682, "recommendationid": "33031957", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
