She walks a few steps, a jigsaw puzzle starts, solve it and she walks a few more steps, then next puzzle. Over and over again.\n\nYou have to start with very easy puzzles, that gradually (slowly) increase in \"difficulty\", aka more pieces per puzzle. In other words, if you want to begin with a large amount of pieces, it's not possilbe. At least to the point where I stopped playing, there is nothing else to it but more pieces. Maybe rotations later, I don't know.\n\nThe pictures you assemble, are ugly landscapes, made even uglier by the terrible resolution. Since they're so ugly, and since there are piece outlines in every puzzle, you will often use the outlines instead of studying the image to find out where a piece goes. And btw, the no-rotation + piece outlines makes this a VERY easy game. Since that's forced, it's a very bad thing.\n\nA good puzzle game needs features like choosing image and amount of pieces, ability to turn both pieces outlines and rotation on and off, and using custom images. This game has NO OPTIONS at all.\n\nEven though it's cheap as dirt, I would have requested a refund if I could, but it doesn't seem I can for this product, though. Both because I don't support this kind of lazyness from a dev, but also to completely delete it from my library.\n\nThis is NOT a game I recommend, even if it was completely free.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198052214710", "last_played": 1467369688, "num_reviews": 47, "num_games_owned": 261, "playtime_forever": 32}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1467370575, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528725", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1467371000, "recommendationid": "23981285", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[i]This item was purchased during a sale for 1USD, and therefore was NOT full price.[/i]\nThis is actually an interesting little time waster. The only actual gameplay is puzzle-based, as in placing pieces of a puzzle together. It starts out insanely easy, but gets harder as the game progresses. The appeal of the game is placing limits on yourself, trying to complete the puzzles as quickly as possible, in as few moves as you can. Some of the art on the puzzles is quite nice, as well.\nI'd say if you have the money to spend, and the game is on sale, go on and pick it up if you can't find anything you'd rather have right now, and spend a little while quickly throwing together some puzzles.
