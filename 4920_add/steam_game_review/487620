I had hoped it would be really cool in 3D.  Unfortunately it just doesn't feel right in VR.  \n\nFor those who may not know, the idea is that there's a bunch of disconnected bits and pieces suspended in a small area (like on a table) and you have to change your viewpoint so that these pieces fit together as a coherent form.  When you do, it pops into view as a regular 3D form and you're able to go to the next puzzle.\n\nSometimes it was pretty obvious what you were looking for and you just needed to find the right angle.  Sometimes it was a mishmash of squiggly polygons and even when you got the solution it was like \"WTF?\". In fact, I'd say the further I got in the game, the more of an exercise in random squatting and turning it became.\n\nThings I liked about this game: \n[list]\n [*] the koi fish in the pool was kinda a nice touch\n [*] it's an interesting concept\n[/list]\n\nThings I didn't like about this game:\n[list]\n [*] Most of the solutions popped up before I had the \"aha!\" moment.  As a result, it felt like I was just randomly moving around while the game decided to show me pictures occasionally.\n [*] for some reason, when you looked past one of the black 'supports' that held the pieces together and water was behind it, it would make a black squiggly line as if you were supposed to be seeing it underwater or reflected off the water, but it wasn't right...it looked off somehow and distracted from the game rather than added to it.  \n [*] What music there is in the game is pretty unmemorable.\n [*] I think you're better off playing the non-VR version of this game\n[/list]\n\nI'm not the type to go back and refund a game just because I didn't like it (though I would totally do that if I felt ripped off), however I AM thinking of using the \"not what I expected\" option to refund this.  I just can't see myself wanting to play this much at all.

There was a not-room scale version that got bad reviews and criticism, but now it's really fun to play!\n\nTL, DR: The game is great! The idea of a visual puzzle game for a HMD is brillant, the headtracking is intuitive, the room scale works! The puzzles are pretty hard, but never unfair and always fun. Furthermore the price/content-ratio is perfect! There are like 70(?) puzzles for just 5 bucks!\n\nI refunded this game in the earlier version, because the head tracking was giving me extrem motion sickness. But I immediatly bought the game again, as soon as room scale was added - and I'm not disappointed!\n\nThe head tracking and room scale are as intuitive as VR games should be - you can look around the hall and move freely in your play space to change the perspective, the angle, the distance and so on. Furthermore you can rotate the objects via the touch pad on the motion controls to get the perfect angle - thus the title - and see a motive in the pieces.\n\nThe developer said, this game would be extremly hard with room scale - and he's not wrong. Some puzzles are really confusing and sooner or later you'll get cross-eyed and see nothing but rubbish. But that's the reason why it's sooo statisfying when it finally makes *click* and the pieces sort themselves: You find the motive and solve the puzzle.\n\nFurthermore the dev added clues: You can get more and more help by pulling the trigger if a puzzle is too hard. I think, that's the best solution and it works really well.\n\nAll in all, it's a great experience! A calm, relaxing puzzle game with a clever idea, solid execution and it's really statisfying when you solve a puzzle after some time of thinking and looking. The dev listened to feedback, added room scale especially for the HTC Vive, and it's only 5\u20ac!

The game feels polished and complete. \n\nRegarding actual gameplay, it is sometimes annoying because as you are rotating an object trying to see the final object often times the object turns green/ completes itself before I actually see what it was. That element of rotating and getting the shape by chance ruins that 'eureka' moment that makes a game of this genre enjoyable. I would much prefer a 'check' button that tries to size up the angle you are looking up revealing if you are correct rather than it auto filling the object. My other gripe may be personal to me- why would I be in VR keeping one eye closed in order to see the object...? I don't know why this is the case, or if it is just my brain doing what it feels to see better, but I don't think I should have to close one eye to make sense of the shapes. \n\nThe hint system is otherwise very well designed, and the difficulty and depth is likewise very polished and feels gradual for the most part. The game is expectedly repetetive, which isn't a bad thing, just the nature of the game, once a player base grows it would be cool  to implement a time trial mode where you race to discover the object vs an opponent. \n\nAt this price point and with consideration to the other games available for VR platforms, I do think this is a nice experience for yourself or un-experienced players you may be DEMOing you Vive/Rift too.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198052923952", "last_played": 1474247105, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 72, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1474643180, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1474643180, "recommendationid": "25651846", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very good game, and well suited for VR.
