Its often the simple ideas that are the most addictive.  Rather like Space Pirate Trainer - simple yet so well executed is extremely addictive.  I cannot wait for the update (especially headers from corners).  Highly recommended, and can only get better.  Oh,, and its WAY harder than you imagine before you play it.

For the most part the ball reacts to your headers as you'd expect, you can put some force into it or just do a gentle nod for targets that are low down.   I've even tried jumping up for a few headers and it worked, although I can see that ending badly for my ceiling.  \n\nPlenty of different levels too and seems like plenty to keep you going for a while.  I'd have loved to have the option to be trying to win headers in an actual game and trying to beat a keeper but that's a minor niggle.  You'll also probably do what I do everytime the ball bounces back and automatically try and kick it...additional sensors for your feet can't come soon enough.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197964032818", "last_played": 1503870922, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 1213, "playtime_forever": 149}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1475701457, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501364", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1475701543, "recommendationid": "25875466", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Well done.
