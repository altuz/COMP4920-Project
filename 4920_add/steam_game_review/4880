There is a lot of complexity that can go on within the game, and really gives the player a sense of creating a city. I've put over 100+ hours into this game before purchasing it on steam (I lost my CD)!\n\nThey've done a great job to differentiate the different races within the game as not all units look the same.\n\nThe unit types are various, from priests, to serfs, to mercenaries, to drummers, to officers, to musketeers mounted on horses. Different units obviously offer different strategy. Priests and the like heal other units, archers to musketeers are available for range, ground units can be swordsmen to horsemen who ride extremely fast. If there is water present, the user can build shipyards and amass some major galleys or frigates. The ship battles are just as intense as the unit battles. One of the main features in this game that surpasses other RTS's is the unit organization. Units can be given a drummer and an officer and be given certain formations. Other units can be told simply to line up or square up accordingly. Until someone for themselves see how this system works, it becomes a game of \"line up my armies behind one another\". It's quite appealing and makes it extremely easy to line up and manage units. Building in the game is quite neat as more than one serf can work on a building at a time. Problem is though unlike some games, you cannot build more than one building at a time with the same serf. Meaning, you cannot line up to build a bunch of dwellings with one unit. You will have to either wait till he completes his work, or assign other serfs to build in different areas. \n\nAll buildings have a purpose and are diverse in their functions (such as marketplaces all the way to blacksmiths). What adds a unique touch to the game besides the buildings themselves, is the ability to build a wall all around your city, as well as gates and guard towers that shoot cannons at enemies. To harvest supplies, mines need to be built over certain resources while other resources such as wood or stone can be found above ground. Store houses need to be built by these areas for harvesting to be done properly. Food is also a commodity to look closely after and harvest as the more units you have, the hungrier they will all get! This is where Knights and Merchants sort of made sense as serfs would be needed to run out food to the armies. This game does that automatically. There can be a lot to manage and do in this game, and the computer does like to throw sneak attacks here and there. Building a giant city up is gratifying but beware when walls start getting attacked randomly from all sides. \n\n[b]Graphics[/b] are decent even for this day and age. 1920X1080 is possible but there are a few friends that have mentioned that they cannot for one reason or another, switch to 1920X1080 and they are stuck on a lower setting. I've personally had 1920X1080 work but I've seen my friends issue with his computer and am unable to find a solution at the moment. [b]Sounds[/b] are appropriate and extremely varied attempting to immerse you into the game. \n\nThis is a classic to me and I would be extremely biased in saying this is a must own on your steam library. I did buy this game on sale as it's stated price is slightly exaggerated, but none the less you are getting a top quality RTS.\n\n\n\nRating : 7.5/10\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Gameplay[/td]\n\t[td]B+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Replay-ability[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Overall [/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]"}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1416603949, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541979", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 4, "recommendationid": "13031602", "votes_up": 29, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164122555", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1416606276, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 40}, "timestamp_updated": 1416603949, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's not working on Window's 8.1!

While in Age of Empires all you see are tools lying around the building's foundation till it is complete, in Cossacks you can see the buildings get built up bit by bit.\n\nOtherwise, there are many similarities between the two game francises - you start with some villagers, build a town center, build a mill for farming, market for trade, barracks and stables for your army, shipyard for your navy, foundry for your siege engines, blacksmith and university for technology upgrades, and towers and walls for defence.\n\nThats where the similarities end. In Cossacks, priests can only heal and not convert. The convert mechanic is instead put on the shoulders of your military units, who can effortlessly capture enemy buildings and peasants if there are no enemy soldiers nearby. Same goes for you - so it is vital to guard pretty much everything, from your villagers tilling the fields, chopping wood, breaking up rocks or working in the mines with soldiers, as well as your buildings. This includes towers!\n\nSpeaking of towers, these need to be built OUTSIDE your walls as they cannot fire over the wall, which is very annoying and contrary to the mechanic in the AoE series.\n\nCossacks has more resources than Age of Empires - apart from food, wood, stone and gold, you also have iron (needed for ranged units) and coal (needed for ships). Food is also constantly depleting, and the rate increases the more units you have, so famines can break out and your people get killed off one by one if you arent careful!\n\nYou have the diplomatic centre, where you can recruit units for gold really quick. Useful if you need to defend your areas from being captured by the enemy quickly, or recruit cossacks for quick exploration of the map (and capture enemy mines for example), but these units are otherwise subpar compared to units trained from the barracks or stable.\n\nThe units you train can then be upgraded several times, each costing more than the previous one. These upgrades increase their attack and defense, or in the case of siege equipment, reduce their cost and recruit time. Infantry units can march in formation if an officer is recruited, but you need a minimum amount of soldiers to be able to create a formation (which gives attack and defence bonuses).\n\nYou start in the 17th century and can advance to the 18th century about mid-game onward, giving you access to more technologies and an improved barracks that lets you recruit better units. But again, you need to train these from scratch, so if you have already spent a lot of resources into training 17th century units, this will be an initial setback.\n\nThe downsides of this game is that you cannot have AI players play against one another in skirmish mode - the more enemies you play against, the harder it is because they are all allied against you. The campaigns are quite tough and not nearly as enjoyable as the ones in the AoE series.\n\nThe music is AWFULLY generic and more of an earsore than anything worthy of remembrance like the AoE scores. \n\nThe graphics are a bit rougher/coarser looking than AoE, but they're otherwise fine. I don't like the fact that your villagers never manage to fully chop a tree and move on to the next one, so the presence of vegetation is of almost no strategic importance whatsoever and merely aesthetic, as the trees, rocks and mines near your base will last you for the rest of the game. The game supports many resolutions out of the box which is great, and its speed is very scalable which is also neat. You will need to run the game shortcut on compatibility settings (e.g. XP SP 3) so that it works on operating systems like Windows 7 or newer.\n\n3.5/5."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1430169743, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501800", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "15588083", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198048049547", "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 1485127519, "num_games_owned": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6145}, "timestamp_updated": 1430169743, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Played this game a lot as a child and coming back to it now, a lot harder than I remember!\nRounds of the game can last for hours and you don't even know it!
