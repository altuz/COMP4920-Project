Looking for more of a productivity aspect to vr and this one hits it.  Able to display multiple monitors to view stocks, reddit, and cats! While I already have multi monitor set up the ability to split off apps as their own virtual monitor, resize to a 100\" screen, and move it over in 3d space is a very nice plus over my current 4 monitor setup.\n\nThere still is the Issue of typing. There IS a keyboard in the app in addition to typing on your real keyboard but its not good for anything more than light web surfing at which point Cortana would actually be better.  I feel this will be solved with 3rd party gloves/tracking in years to come or more practically voice to text recognition with a button on the controller.  Tying something like dragon to a button would be amazing but we aren\u2019t quite there yet. Currently have a webcam pointed down at my keyboard and have the webcam showing as its own monitor in the VR world as I look down.  It works but is very lacking because of the lag time with my crappy web cam. If you can type this won\u2019t be much of an issue. \n\nIn addition to monitors your able to add things in your world that help it overlay with your real room. For example you can place a chair where your actual chair is and a wall is or balcony where your actual wall/bed is. Allowing you to custom build a room with barriers that coincide with the real world. Instead of staring at a wall you can now view Saturn out of your window.\n\nAs a con splitting apps other than pre-defined ones are hit or miss (this feature is beta) things like discord or Firefox will not split off. While apps like PowerShell and YouTube will. There is also a quick launch menu that have some of these apps pre-defined to split off like reedit, YouTube, and twitch. I Would love the ability to add my own in future Updates such as Discord, Readit, outlook, ect. \n\nOverall grate product, well worth the money and has room to grow.  The dev is extremely helpful and active. I Reported an issue with my GPU and he had a beta version to test within 48 hours that fixed the issue! If you\u2019re looking at getting a VR desktop app,  this one might have a slight learning curve, but is definitely worth it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 50, "steamid": "76561197965276988", "last_played": 1506067921, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 119, "playtime_forever": 1335}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506061764, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503284", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506061764, "recommendationid": "35121596", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
