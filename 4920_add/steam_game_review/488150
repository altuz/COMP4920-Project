Was kind of hoping for something with tron style disc throwing... This is not that but it's still interesting. \n\nThe disc is basicaly a generic physics object so it's like throwing a lofty brick, not a frisby. It can be quite difficult to aim your throw with it as well due to expectation on how it should behave but I suspect it's something you'll overcome with practice. It's in early access at time of writing so the mechanics might change as well, possibly improved. The system is workable at the moment regardless. \n\nWhat makes it interesting is the ability to call it back to the hand of your choice and getting a score multiplier for hitting enemies that you had previously missed from behind as it returns to your hand. This makes it more dynamic and makes missing a bit less frustraiting as you might have a second shot at taking out the enemy for an even higher reward.\n\nWhile held it acts as a shield and allows you to reflect enemies shots back at them. It was a really nice design choice to make a hud on the shield that it gives you targeting reticle with which to aim shots back. I think this could be expanded in later developement to show player health on the shield and more importantly a radar like feature that shows where enemies are realitive to the direction you are facing so you know when they are charging up for a shot behind you.\n\nBasically the game is space pirate trainer with throwable weapon instead of guns.
