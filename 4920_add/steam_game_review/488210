According to other gamers who've bought this game, it's virtually identical to Drag Racer v3. \n\nNormally, I wouldn't fault a game for seeming similar to another, especially since there's only so many ways to design a game within the same genre. That said, JDMTR provides nothing new or of any value beyond the free Flash game that apparently inspired it. \n\nThe basic concept behind JDMTR is illegal racing where you take normal cars, modify them way beyond the manufacturer's specifications (which is dangerous in real life) while adding various bits of ridiculous design elements, such as an overly large spoiler.\n\nThat alone would make for a fine game (and in fact, it's worked in other games), but JDMTR breaks down immediately once you start playing it. \n\nHow so? Allow me to explain...\n\nThere is NO documentation, tutorial, or any instructions/guides whatsoever. The game itself isn't difficult to play, but many features within it \u2014 such as knowing how to fine tune your gear shift \u2014 or explaining certain acronyms (i.e. NOS) and initialisms (i.e. RPM) are left entirely up to the player to figure out. \n\nThe menu system is confusing and clunky to use. For instance, there's a section entitled \"setup,\" which most gamers will assume means \"this is the options menu.\" Not so in JDMTR. This section lets you tune your gear shift, but like I explained before, offers no guidance on what any of it means or how it works. \n\nThe money you earn while playing lets you purchase new vehicles and upgrade components. The problem with this is there's no \"undo\" function. \n\nSome people might say, \"There's a downgrade option to solve this!\" \n\nWell, yes and no. Downgrading will get rid of the last upgrade you bought and installed; however, it won't refund any of the money you spent, so downgrading leaves you worse off than before. \n\nThe graphics are passable, but static and look at least a decade out of date, if not more so. Honestly, the graphics in JDMTR are the least of its issues, which doesn't say much for it.\n\nThe actual gameplay is extremely limited and as far as I can tell, is entirely keyboard-only except for navigating the menus, which uses the mouse. \n\nRacing consists of pushing \"up\" on the arrow keys, while \"left shift\" will shift into a higher gear (oddly enough, you can't downshift) and the \"alt\" key will fire NOS. Aside from clicking on menus, that's all the gameplay present in JDMTR. \n\nNow to be fair, there is a positive to JDMTR: It's incredibly cheap (normally priced at 99 cents USD, and I got it on sale for 69 cents USD) so at absolute worst, you've wasted one solitary dollar. You can't buy anything for a dollar nowadays, not even a cup of coffee or a bottle of soda.\n\nSo would I recommend JDM Tuner Racing? Absolutely not.
