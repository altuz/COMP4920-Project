I guarantee that there will be some aspect of the game that you will enjoy if you decide to pick it up. Unfortunately there isn't a huge playerbase, and therefore no new patches since a few days after launch. If you do enjoy the railing part of snowboarding, then I would recommend getting this game over Steep. However, some people find the magnetism to rails too strong, I'm not too concerned about it because I don't try to play this game realistically. \n\nPros:\n+Map editor\n+Fun\n+A campaign which takes some work to finish 100%\n+Player customization\n+Better rails than Steep\n+Great to play when doing something else like watching YT or a movie.\n+Sharing lines is working very well and there are loads to play if you get tired of the campaign\n+Not hard to mod to get custom textures if your favorite sponsor isn't in the game\n\nCons:\n-Low playerbase, no one to play with\n-No updates due to lack of popularity\n-Magnetic rails (this is subjective as stated earlier)\n-Might be repetitive after a long while\n-Some achievements unachievable due to low playerbase\n-People abusing rail glitch to get unobtainable high scores in mp contests\n\nOverall I would recommend it if you enjoy snowboard games, however if you're looking for a multiplayer experience or a game that gets updates, this is not it.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 4225, "steamid": "76561198019060690", "last_played": 1507154676, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 177, "playtime_forever": 84710}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504707071, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504707071, "recommendationid": "34776210", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
