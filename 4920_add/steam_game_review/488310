My go-to game whenever I play VR.\n\nSome possible future improvements:\n\n-- Tournaments, ladders, leagues, trophies (maybe with a custom trophy cabinet in that displays in your play area when you're the host?). The games are really fun, but very disposable without competitions.\n-- More environments, especially cozy interior ones like the loft (though a school gym would be good)\n-- A wider selection of background music. The single song that plays can get annoying. Ability to play your own music library through the environment's speakers would be perfect.\n-- An optional lobby area where you can mess around with other players while waiting for a game (instead of just playing the AI) if you want to.
