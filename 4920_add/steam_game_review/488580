It should be free.\n\nHover 2030 is a semi-polished alpha demo disguised as a game. You have only one world with 20 levels (most are just very basic first world levels you would find in any platforming/collect-a-thon game.) Bad level design, no alternative backgrounds on levels or skins on anything.\n\nI finished the game in 45 min, Hover 2030 should've been free. You could probably find simular games like this on the internet called \"My first try at a video game\" and that'll atleast be free.\n\nIf Hover 2030 ever gets a sequel and fixes nearly everything with this one (Like actually making a game and not a demo), I would pick it up. I enjoyed the art-style and the gameplay was fun.\n\nBottom line, Don't buy Hover 2030.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001125382", "last_played": 1494982319, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 489, "playtime_forever": 46}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1494984306, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521923", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1494984306, "recommendationid": "31797312", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "actuallly very hard but still fun", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198295495227", "last_played": 1495093139, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 56}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1495047484, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499542", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1495047484, "recommendationid": "31810040", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
