So, I'm not disappointed. It's just very painfully average.\n\nWriting is pretty bad. Lots of inner monologuing that is supposed to be funny, but ultimately is cringy at best. Lots of \"...\" and \"Uhm...\", that are there just to artificially prolong gameplay. The story itself is very rushed. As if the author knew where he wants to start and finish, but had absolutely no idea what to put in the middle. If you take away all the grinding, unskippable animations and constant \"...\", you could probably finish the story in an hour. Some routes and characters seem like an afterthought, way less developed than the others.\n\nThere are no dialogue choices. At all.\n\nThere is gameplay in this game. I wish there was not. It's very simplistic and repetitive. The enemies are unimaginative cubes and spheres.\nThe dating sim elements are dumbed down to \"buy # of items she wants you to buy, then go and farm for more money\". With time restriction of 28 in-game days this is just annoying.\n\nUI is terrible and settings are minimal. Can't speed up or skip animations (which makes already tedious combat all the more slow and frustrating), can't set the transparency of the text box, can't set the speed of text itself. No separate audio slider for voices.\n\nThe art is inconsistent. Character sprites are amazing. Backgrounds are ok. CG are... 50/50. It's as if they had two different artists who drew for this game. And one of them was sloppy and didn't know anatomy at all.\n\nMusic is just there. It's not memorable, nor is it distracting.\n\nVoice acting is... sigh... it's for the most part incredibly amateurish. Eve and Jen are fine. Great even. Especially Jen, her voice acting was on-point, very emotional. Great job. Cecile and Yumi are... acceptable... but Cornelia can, in my opinion, safely nominate for the worst voice actress in history of gaming. Zero emotions (and no, not because her character is unemotional) and bad sound quality. It's as if we're back in 90s.\nThey remind me of Honey Pop. But when in HP it was so bad it was funny, here it's just so bad that it's... bad.\n\nOverall, it's not the worst visual novel that I have ever played. But then again, I have played some serious shit that I don't even want to remember. This game was just unsatisfying. It's cheap, and if you like visual novels, you may give it a go to kill a bit of time. Maybe you'll find it amusing. But if you LOVE visual novels, then stay away from this.
