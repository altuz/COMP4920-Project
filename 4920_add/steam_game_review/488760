She screamed and tried to rip the Vive off, failed, and ran directly into the wall then fell on the ground.  \n\nObviously she's out, but I've now played through to the boss of Sathariel (only the second area).

My favourite VR game, even above Vanishing Realms.\n\nWhen someone makes the first decent VR MMO, I hope the mage class's gameplay is filthily plagiarised from Left-Hand Path.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "steamid": "76561198078230626", "last_played": 1506847379, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 699, "playtime_forever": 410}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1501314724, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501639", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1501314826, "recommendationid": "33875123", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": true}]}
