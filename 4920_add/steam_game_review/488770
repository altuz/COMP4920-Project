Great visuals and excellent voice acting coupled with plenty of poking fun at the various nationalities (stereotypical racism rules !) made this a very enjoyable experience.\n\nI found a couple of the puzzles a bit obscure hence the slightly longer playtime than some other players but got there in the end, 2 - 2.5 hours would seem a more realistic time for more experinced players of this genre. Plenty of achievments that will take a second play through to get 100% (unless you've already sneeked a peek at the guides.)\n\nMy only gripe was that it was too short so I strongly advise you buy this game so the devs can continue their great work & make episode 2.  \n\nWant to play more from these guys...9/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989804353", "last_played": 1501936985, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 347, "playtime_forever": 211}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501939027, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505840", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501939027, "recommendationid": "34037992", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Oh my god this game was hilarious!  It only took about two hours to complete but seriously I was cracking up the whole time.  For the price of this game you could a) get an Adam Sandler comedy on DVD, b) leave it in the bank and accumulate 1p interest in oh.... say 10 years? or c) buy this game and spend two hours cracking up with laughter!  If you picked anything other than c for the love of god get your head examined!\n\nThe gameplay on this was tight, the voice acting was brilliant (just a little campy just like the game itself perfect fit!) and the comedy was on point the whole time.  Assuming I dont get hit by a giant red double decker bus before a sequal comes out I would definitely buy it!  I just wish I had seen the kickstarter campaign to have backed it.  Really glad this was made and that I got to play it.\n\nOn the basis of how the game runs I played this on Debian and can tell you it ran flawlessly so you would undoubtedly be fine on any Debian based operating system (e.g. Ubuntu / Mint).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198139299207", "last_played": 1499715756, "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 258, "playtime_forever": 102}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499716240, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501424", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499717411, "recommendationid": "33439237", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Such a fun game with great humor in it, it is a bit short but over all a enjoyable experience.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198375668471", "last_played": 1499472009, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 55, "playtime_forever": 347}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499443499, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499443499, "recommendationid": "33346884", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A surprisingly well made and well written game.
