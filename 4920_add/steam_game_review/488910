It even seems improved over astral masters. I like using the special ability to do 2 damage to all minions and draw a card. I think that makes newbees more wanting to try it. I only have 2 hours into it and although it seems to be getting harder, I still manage to win sometimes after multiple tries and also by reconstructing my deck, I tried a coulple other free to play collectible card games but they are not as captivizing as this game is. For any one who play astral masters, I think they improved over it. I'd like to know what happens if you run out of cards or do they keep recyclling them into your deck? I wish you could redo some areas to get their bonuses again.

The fast paced gameplay and non-ptw style will provide you with hours of fun.\n\nWhen you start off the game progression moves at a proper rate.  However, I have noticed a bottleneck once you hit 8 or so hours in.
