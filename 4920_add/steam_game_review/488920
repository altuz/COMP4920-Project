This needs to be a little more boxing and a little less Punch out on the Wii, dodging is bad, certain punches are spotty, crimson tiger the second fighter is bullshit, sometimes you dodge, sometimes you hit, there is no reason, the devs say timing, but if thats the case the timing window is so small it doesnt even register a punch on a right hook into her face after you slip her windup, as my fist goes see threw and passes harmlessly through her only to reapear after Ive returned to a neutral stance, which the game also always reads as blocking, which would be fine if that didn't \"eat\" your block. We have 1:1 hand and head tracking damn't, use it. The game also needs to do a better job of explaining certain things, like why even though the punch was on the overside of the room it still hit, or that crimson is invicible unless staggered and that you have to hit her seven times in a row without getting hit to stagger her so you can hit her. \n\nThats what makes this whole thing infuriating, this is a fun game, with good graphics and design, until you actualy get to the fighting... what does it matter if I can throw 2 left straights, a right upper cut and a hook if there is no point to doing those combination. The game works out more to dodge ('slip\") throw a right hook that sometimes works, if the npc is staggered unleash flurry of jabs. Also a major part of my issues is that the npc will be WIDE OPEN, but be invincible as its not time yet to hit them, so your fist just lightly taps them and they ignore it like the fly it is. \n\nIf I haven't made my feelings clear by now, wait until this actual is finished before buying and if you want a actual 1:1 fight go play vanishing realms, it might be sword fighting, but dodging works, blocking works, and attacks and the directions of the attacks work and matter.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002150760", "last_played": 1500707919, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 579, "playtime_forever": 89}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499392319, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499392319, "recommendationid": "33329993", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
