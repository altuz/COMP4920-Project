However, there are two reasons for this negative review and they are very  strong unfortunately. First, i'm afraid this game feels like a scam of some sort. I saw it and liked what i saw, i felt the price was adequate for it and it was in promotion so i bought it. Big mistake. The game is full of gliches and bugs that severely hinder gameplay to the point of making it broken. I tried my best to overlook those and just focus on what i liked and the reason i bought it in the first place. Steampunk world and story. However after struggling against all the game breaking obstacles i was faced with (this is the reason i seem to have that many hours of play, in reality, it was mostly reloading and trying to overcome the bugs and gliches in truth there is not much of game content here to justify the time i have spent with it) i reach a point in the game that shows me i have an incomplete game!!\n\n I went back to the steam page and what i find is the developer saying that this is only part of the game and the rest of the game will unlock if we buy the ultimate super collectors edition... \n\nWhat is this? I was shocked! There was nothing warning me about anything like this on the steam page for the game! Is this the state we're in now?! Shady tactics to force consumers to pay for a game twice?!! One for a demo and then a second one for the real game?!! A paywall for a broken mess of a game at that!  No, i wont do that for any game.\n \nNow i have noticed the developer added a comment about it on the steam page claiming it's going to be an episodic game but that wasn't there when i first bought it. It was added because some users commented that he, the developer, could get in trouble if he did not warn people properly. I wasn't warned, i wasn't informed. It was concealed from me at the time of buying, I want a refund because i would not have bought this game had i known it would be sold in such terms.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198123929626", "last_played": 1475428183, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_forever": 547}, "votes_up": 56, "timestamp_created": 1475431276, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594126", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1475431276, "recommendationid": "25825739", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game has a lot of serious issues, it feels like an early alpha build, it's just that buggy.

And the execution, while not terrible was a bit- just a bit, rushed.\n\nYou take the role of a 'hybrid'..an outcaste, who has some special abilities, is a bit of an witty ansewhole with a goldden heart etc etc, your usual video game plot.\n\nThe game world itself is imagined and designed well.\n\nHaving said that, I cannnot say that it isn't enjoyable. It is an enjoyable experience in some ways and the game needs improvement and polish in some other criterias.\n\n\nIt is a third person action game with hack and slash combat, minor puzzle and very minor platforming.\n\n\n\n[h1]The gameplay[/h1]-\n\nVery enjoyable, hack and slash, 'cinematic', fluid. Only con is that the camera angles are fixed. The 'world' is split into separate realms of night and day.\n\n\n[h1]The music[/h1]-\n\nOne of the major pros of the game is music. It goes with the steampunk-victorian setting and is actually pretty good, enjoyable.\n\n\n[h1]The voice acting[/h1]-\n\nAgain a pro, good voice acting conveying the feelings of the characters, but the movements of the character models sometimes don't go with the voice.\n\n\n[h1]The story[/h1]-\n\nA bit of lore, an average story.\n\n\n\nNow for the cons, there are many-\n\nCharacters movements, facial expressions deep in the uncanny valley\nRandom bugs, like getting stuck on ladders and all\nSome crashes on frist tiem starting the game\nThe world seems a bit lifeless (to me), it requires a bit more vibrancy\n\n\n[b][u]What I want to say is that this is the dev's (fuzzyeye) first release on steam and sure, they made some mistakes, but they have been constantly putting out updates, been active on the forums, taking any advice and replying to each and every inquiry by customers as well as potential customers, kudos to them for that.[/u]\n\n\n\nAll in all, it is a promising title, available on a good sale at release. Some might want to wait out until the bugs are fixed, some would get it at the moment....right now, it just makes the cut (JUST) worth the price.\n\n\nVerdict- You can do two things-\n get it right now and watch the game develop as it does\n Wait until they fix the bugs, polish it more and again when it goes on sale\n\n\n[h1][u][b]Caveat emptor- This purchase is just the first chapter of the game, for the rest of the story (ie full experience) you have to buy the Ultimate Collector's edition[/h1]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198188722919", "last_played": 1479776501, "num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 727, "playtime_forever": 464}, "votes_up": 27, "timestamp_created": 1475260710, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516589", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1475261193, "recommendationid": "25786264", "votes_funny": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game has a nice story, and the world is beautiful.\n\nOther than that it's deeply broken.

Also, why does Lex crouches almost all the time? The way you are introduced to the story is bad, as well: you are thrown into it, but since it lacks proper dynamic (which should be present in such cases), it makes you feel bored, instead of excited. Even Rise Of Tomb Raider threw you in along with good dynamic and it felt right and all. Here it does not. The temp suggests that it should have been a more gradual introduction to the characters and the world, and it then would have been more realistic to present the main story as \"beginning of another job\".\nAll in all, I'd really love to see a good steampunk game, but this is just not it.
