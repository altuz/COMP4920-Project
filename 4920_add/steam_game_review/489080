It's very unique and definitely not for everyone but I love it. I haven't played much yet on my PC, but play it on Android. It's very solid and smooth. It's a magic spell upgrade game with stationary battles. The spell skill trees go pretty deep and higher level spells look awesome.  The swipe controls are awesome on the Android version and though I have to use mouse/keyboard here, it's fine with me. I will still play the Android version a ot more since I have time invested in it, but more than happy to support the devs for their hard work. \n\nAll I've done so far with this version is load it up, check out the controls, and kill a few monsters to make a comparison to the Android version and it's acceptable to me.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009474915", "last_played": 1480239716, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 95, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1480575014, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505544", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1480575014, "recommendationid": "28114030", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "dont like it infact hate it, if i could get my money back i would", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035402609", "last_played": 1477525615, "num_reviews": 43, "num_games_owned": 690, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1477525708, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475285", "votes_down": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1477525708, "recommendationid": "26238393", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
