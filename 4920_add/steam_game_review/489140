Yeah this is accurate, however this game is not a rip off. you'll get a simple mechanic of dash with cooldown to start with, but a variety of mobs and levels with new mechanism that will hook you for 2 to 4 h of pure fun.

If still interested, only buy on sale [i]>50% off[/i].\n\n---\n\nMr. Shifty is one of those games I would rate as neutral, if I had the option to do it. \n\nThe premise is quite obviously pretty cool: Hotline Miami with superhuman strength and Nightcrawler's teleport ability. I'm sold. Right from the start it is clear that this mixture works and is translated perfectly into entertaining gameplay by the responsive controls. So far, so good. \nSadly, Mr. Shifty's premise suffers from a lot of problems other areas of the game's design cause. Despite the good controls and awesome powers the game becomes pretty dull for large parts of its campaign. This is due to uninspired level design that will not challenge you for a majority of the time, the ony exception being some stages were the devs just throw more and more enemies your way. This only changes in the last few levels were some interesting new mechanics are introduced and you are not just challenged by the sheer number of enemies but also get some genuine ideas thrown in your gears, those parts easily provided the most fun I had with the game. But even the later levels hold some frustration based on questionable design decisions: You don't have the option to safe after reaching a checkpoint, instead you have to start over if you quit before finishing a level. This would not be a problem if the levels had a similar length to the ones in early or midgame, but thanks to the \"difficulty-through-numbers\" approach the levels are often three times as long. Also for a game that has a linear campaign of about 4 hours the amount of backtracking I had to do inbetween was at least slightly irritating.\nAnother negative is the implementation of \"story\" (if you can call it that) into the game. The dialogues are poorly written and can not be skipped. Even when they are supposed to be cheesy fun, they are not. There is a lot of cringe you have to sit through. That aside, the prompts also bring the flow of the game to a full stop, killing all the momentum you had. You finish a room, rush forward, ready to fight and... you get a cringey text with irrelevant drivel you can't skip. Oh, I'm finished. You're allowed to fight now. Have fun... and don't forget your lunch! PS: Someone you don't care about.\nThose design complaints out of the way, I also encountered some minor glitches and performance drops that should not happen on my system. \n\nI think Mr. Shifty would've benefited a lot from longer developement. At the moment it feels unfinished, almost like a proof of concept to show that its basic premise can work, while everything else is just thrown in half-heartedly. As I said in the beginning the basics really do work, and they are fun - the developers really were onto something here, but that is about it.\n\nIn conclusion I think Mr. Shifty could've been a lot better than it turned out to be and its current price tag does not fit quality nor quantity of the product. That is why I will not recommend the game. However, if you are still interested, I suggest buying Mr. Shifty on sale with at least a 50% discount.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960334445", "last_played": 1502972421, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 428, "playtime_forever": 346}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1502996923, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506198", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1503022436, "recommendationid": "34313357", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
