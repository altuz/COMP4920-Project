It's an indie game so dont whine too much. Its not bad.\nHaving said that. It is a a game ported from a mobile game sothere is bound to be issues.\n\nPros\nIts exactly like the mobile game as in it is exacctly liket he mobile games minus the dlc. in the mobile game the dlc are something you have to buy kromium to get. Here at least you just have to buy the the dlc and you get the titans.\nIts for casual gamers. Dont think of spending hundred sof hours into it. Seriously its just a casual gaming game. If you want to grind by all means but its better playing it, stopping doing other things then when you feel like it go back to it.\n\nCons\nIts exctly like the mobile game. I mean come on at least change it up a bit its suppose to be in the computer. Try out better graphics or having more ship not just use the exact same game and just port it to the pc.\nTHe fact you have to grind like hell just to get things. Like seriously no to grind, a little  bit is okay but to spend mroe than a few minutes just to afford a new shp or a new weapon thats given at random is freaking insane.\n\nHaving said that have fun and give it a try", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198012829426", "last_played": 1496222684, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 274, "playtime_forever": 790}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1495353733, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505510", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1495353733, "recommendationid": "31877482", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Galaxy Reavers, good or bad game?\n\nThe game is very entertaining to play and fun for a couple of hours. The game have two currencies, a primary and secondary currency. The main currency is gold, gold is the ingame standard currency you can purchase new ships and items with. The secondary currency is Khorium, this is the real money currency, this currency seems to have no role in the PC version though you are collection it through emissions..\n\nSo way two currencies, well first i played this game on my phone and in the phone version you can purchase ships and items for khorium as well gold. You can still collect Khorium playing the game and watching advertisement or buy lots of it for a not too pricey price.\n\nSo yes there is two version of the game.\n\nPersonally i say Galaxy Reavers is more suited for an mobile or tablet then the pc because the resolution and the GUI scale. But the game is much, much cheaper here on steam.\n\nPurchaings the game on steam with DLCs is like purhcaings the ingame items on the mobile or tablet version but sheaper.\n\nI like this game, it's fun to play and have good atmosphere around is. But at the current stage of the game i can't say i can \nrecomend this game, especialy if you have more copies if the game. ;)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007822632", "last_played": 1493209853, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 191, "playtime_forever": 89}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1492608196, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500781", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1492608196, "recommendationid": "31236989", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u6bd4\u8f83\u5bb9\u6613\u4e0a\u624b\uff0c\u4e5f\u633a\u6709\u610f\u601d\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5feb\u6377\u952e\uff0c\u8230\u4f53\u4ea4\u9519\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u8f83\u96be\u5207\u6362\u3002\u81ea\u8eab\u6218\u8230\u7684AI\u5e2e\u5012\u5fd9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5360\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u3002\u611f\u89c9\u4e0d\u662f\u548cNPC\u5bf9\u6297\uff0c\u662f\u548c\u5df1\u65b9AI\u62a2\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u3002\u4e2d\u540e\u671f\u88abNPC\u56e2\u706d\u90fd\u662fAI\u4e71\u653e\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u4e71\u6539\u884c\u8fdb\u8def\u7ebf\u3001\u4e71\u66f4\u6539\u6253\u51fb\u5bf9\u8c61\u9020\u6210\u7684\u3002", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198149243313", "last_played": 1502517167, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 72, "playtime_forever": 1968}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1493979100, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488277", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1493995621, "recommendationid": "31556184", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}]}
