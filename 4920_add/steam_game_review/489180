Unfortunately for me, the price is just too high. In essence: This is a software for professionals. Considering that the unlimited software costs 7500$ a year, I guess the price is actually quite cheap, but still too much if photogrammetry is not your hobby, but just somethig you want to do sometimes. I would still recommend it: If you want detailed 3D models from pictures, there currently just is no better and faster software as far as I know and you know the price.
