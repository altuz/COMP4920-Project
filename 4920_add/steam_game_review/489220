The story is fairly simple, you recruit your fighters in an inn and march across the world to rid the land of corruption and evil. While the game is a bit linear, it offers a lot of choice in designing your party which I liked a lot. Some of the boss encounters might seem a bit difficult at first but if you make a strong team and prepare properly, you shouldn't have too much trouble. Also, dog and chicken are hilarious.
