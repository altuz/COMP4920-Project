The artwork, detail, clues and random scribbles on the wall add to the game. \n\nOkay....review begins\n\nAt first, ill admit i havent progrssed much. It seems like a major house layout. Just the house. Wander here and there unlock the doors, find the clues. The environment however is WELL ABOVE par. The details such as the insane scribbles on the walls, notes, details on character lives and misc events are scattered all over the place, providing major insight into your situation. \n\nInteraction is GREAT. You click and the character goes \"hmmm makeup, syuff, ugh nothing useful\", when events happen she speaks, comments and fluidly responds to the demanded reaction.\n\nThe ambience is CREEPY. The hallways, doorways and ducts are dark, gloomy and the sound effects in the background make me go \"CTRL CTRL CTRL DUCK DUCK DUCK\", oh and trust me....youll know when to shut the hell up and be very very wary of your surroundings. So far, ive been very sneaky sneaky. I dont wanna spoil the effects and sounds, download the demo and try for yourself.!\n\nVoice acting could use a revamp on emotional reaction. Shes WAY too happy. Valley Girlish almost.\n\nScares.....well....it is scary. Believe that. You practice every move, check corners, halt and listen for the sounds. Its always on alert for me. \n\nOverall this is an amazing game. The graphics are GREATm detail is GREAT, notes, readings and misc findings are GREAT.\n\nPLEASE DEVS, MAKE THIS GAME GOOD", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198134994152", "last_played": 1485210455, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_forever": 366}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1482346059, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506516", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1482346059, "recommendationid": "28513507", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Waking up in a bathroom; and then there is this strange place with narrow corridors and an odd collection of paintings. -\nWhat may sound like just another SAW-inspired game (to those who are not familiar with older stories of the horror genre like myself) turns out to be an interesting story based on much older references. But even if you don't understand all these links to other stories, the game still offers an entertaining story.\n\nThe goal in the first part of the game is best summarized with getting to know the gameplay and solving some already challenging puzzles. Depending on your patience you may find these easier or harder, fact is - you need to collect as many information as possible or you end up trying all possible combinations instead of combining existing hints.\n\nThe graphics are good looking (as usual for Unreal games with efforts put in asset design). The atmosphere is consistent with the different stages of the level however there are still enough changes throughout the level. \n\nCurrently, there are some minor and major bugs. At least the former may result in problems for players who do not know the solution, yet, because some information is missing or some other problem makes the player stuck in a location. However, the developers are working on these issues as stated in the news stream. Thus my recommendation to you is: if you have fun with trying to solve a puzzle even if you need to replay a good portion of the game, then this is a definitive yes. Otherwise, you may better wait till a more stable version regarding gameplay is released.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198165446038", "last_played": 1485697540, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_forever": 942}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1478011302, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501952", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1478011302, "recommendationid": "26355708", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Awesome game for an early access :D i got scared <3 10/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197990272586", "last_played": 1484252887, "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 1365, "playtime_forever": 77}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1477790734, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463044", "votes_down": 19, "timestamp_updated": 1477790734, "recommendationid": "26304793", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "My PC runs most fps games in the 60-80 range with no problem like Ark and The Long Dark. Now I only buy games that your able to use a controller with so when I saw that option for this game I was thrilled and excited and purchased the game. I downloaded it and pressed play only to wake up in a bathroom to begin my experience. First thing I noticed was the FPS wouldnt go over 2 which caused me to lag all over the place then I noticed also that the controller wasnt working the way it should have. Overall my experience was bad I think this game has some major issues that should have been sorted before being released. I was refunded since this game was not playable.
