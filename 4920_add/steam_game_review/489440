The two worst offenders making this game feel unfinished are grouping/path-finding and the level design.\n\nGrouping/path-finding - everyone seems to be having trouble with this. You can get your little buddies to clump together by pressing space, or on an Xbox controller by double tapping (for some reason?) the A button. Pressing these buttons will only help if your newly converted friends are within a certain limited radius, but if they have gotten themselves wedged somewhere, prepare for some tedious maneuvering or leave them behind.\n\nLevel design - it's really unpolished and includes a lot of unclear obstacles. There are invisible walls that block you, and visible walls that you can walk through. Numerous times I have experienced clipping through the ground, and sometimes (what I assume people are mistaking for the ability to jump) being ejected into the air due to obstacles or sometimes for no apparent reason. I could be wrong about that; maybe there is a jump button, but nothing on my keyboard or Xbox controller seemed to do it and since the in game controls only list WASD for movement and nothing else (not even space for clumping), I'm assuming the \"jumping\" is caused by flaws in the level design.\n\nSome of the later levels can be frustrating so the urge to give up may be great. I struggled through to the end and was rewarded with [spoiler]nothing. The final level was just used to show you the credits, written on the road you walk along, and there was no end cinematic! I assume there was meant to be one because you LITERALLY GO TO THE CINEMA, but no, it just kind of ends and you quit the game feeling disappointed.[/spoiler]\n\nDespite it's problems I do like Tentacult; it just has too many issues for me to be able to recommend it to anyone else.\n\n[h1]4/10 fun, but frustrating and flawed[/h1]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197973923018", "last_played": 1475699438, "num_reviews": 71, "num_games_owned": 861, "playtime_forever": 206}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1475625753, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505863", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1475698917, "recommendationid": "25861788", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Outstanding purchase for a 99 cents.

The game starts off so well & is indeed both fun & funny but the difficulty ramps up very quickly & the bugs start to bite harder as you progess.\n\nMy first problem was the game would not return to the start if you selected the option screen, in fact it locked up completely meaning task manager required to get out, it does not do this every time therefore I did manage to actually play. \n\nThen any changes you make in options have to be reset every time you fire the game up, it does not remember your settings.\n\nThe worst bug however is the sticking/jamming, not a problem at the lower levels as there are plenty of people to convert but as the difficulty rises the population dwindles quite dramatically & the number of snipers/grenadiers rises meaning you cannot afford to lose any of your little dudes by them getting hung up the map & becoming sniper bait.\n\nThere is mention in a couple of the other reviews that you can jump but having pressed every key I still can't get them to do it, perhaps its a perk reserved for controllers only.\n\nHaving spent over an hour trying to get past level 6 I finally give up. I know it can be done as I've seen it on You Tube but then the guy who did it gave up trying to complete level 7 before skipping it, I stopped watching at this time so perhaps he went back to it, I lost interest as he couldn't do 7 then there seemed no point in perservering with 6 only to get stuck on the next as well.\n\nPros: It cost less than a \u00a3/$       \n         Lots of fun with plenty of humour at the lower levels\n\nCons: The jamming / sticking problem is a real gamebreaker as far as I'm concerned\n          The background music is awful after a short time, the music on the menu screen is far better imo, although music is a personal taste so you may like it.\n          Settings / controls are vague, I turn the music off at the start but as I progress the level rises again & has to be reset again & at the start of every game.\n         Just because a game is cheap it does not mean that is an excuse to produce/release a buggy game\n\nOne more observation, at time of writing, I checked the other reviews before writing this to see whether I was the only person having problems, I have more time in game & more in game achievements than any of the other reviewers, for so many positive reviews I wonder why so many of them have already stopped playing it. \nI don't believe people should be allowed to write a review whether positive or negative on any game when they have only played for a few minutes, it can be very misleading at times.\n\nIf the devs were to refine the sticking or introduce more people into the maps people would have a better chance of progressing in what is in fact a potentially good fun game. 4.9/10\n\nTo those of you who have completed the game\"Respect\"", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989804353", "last_played": 1475853365, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 347, "playtime_forever": 384}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1475429924, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501572", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1475429986, "recommendationid": "25825298", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Hello fellow servant of our Lord Cthulhu.
