The scenes and objects have nothing to do with the story and vice-versa.\nThe hidden object scenes themselves are lazy, and after a couple you discover that you are being asked to find the same objects over and over with just a background change.\nIf you like HOGs for the story ... there isn't much of one. If you like HO scenes you'll find them extremely easy and basic. The story is just a link device between unrelated HO scenes.\nThe game is incredibly short and beatable in less than an hour.\nAbout the only positive thing I have to say is that I didn't encounter any bugs.\nNot recommended unless you've picked it up for nothing and have 40 minutes to kill.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971047607", "last_played": 1494545130, "num_reviews": 116, "num_games_owned": 1424, "playtime_forever": 48}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1494545677, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507208", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1494545677, "recommendationid": "31692205", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The only reason I purchased this game is because 1.
