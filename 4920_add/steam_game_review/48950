But in actual fact, it's far more linear - which can be a tad disappointing at first if you were expecting the former. But in further playing (especially the campaign), there's actually a nice level of strategy to it. So when setting your expectations: Treat this more like a digital board game, than a full-scale strategy game.\n\nThe aim is to basically capture tiles and harvest resources in order to build more walkers, your 'infantry' unit; cannons, one-off ranged attacks; and carriers, an expensive one-off ability to let you move one tile of infantry to anywhere on the board. The fun catch is that harvesting resources weakens the ground around you, to the point where it eventually crumbles into the abyss... so the board itself disappears beneath your feet! This creates a fun dynamic where breaking the land is as viable as conquering it. You can even 'aggressively harvest' tiles to wreck your opponent's turf or cut off chokepoints... and make money while you're at it. Score!\n\nUnfortunately, this dynamic is also where the game can get a bit repetitive. In a handful of turns, even the most sprawling of levels quickly deteriorate into a handful of isolated islands where each player is rushing to get aircraft. There doesn't appear to be a strong mechanic of choosing between long-term flow or cash-grabs... So it's more just gut the place and make obscene gestures at your neighbours until the game gives you enough resources attack them.\n\nThat being said, it retains the \"strategic dance\" of games like chess: Where each player is carefully positioning and waiting for the other to slip up or expose a weak point. Though the execution is perhaps a bit shallow, the tactical depth is at least there and the campaign is good fun. In addition, the design and graphics are simply delightful and the quirky (almost 20's-esque) soundtrack gives the game a fun, playful and inviting vibe.\n\nSure it's no turn-based Dawn of War... but if you like board games like chess, this will be right up your alley!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1496121095, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32056042", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197972871079", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 264}, "timestamp_updated": 1496121095, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Simple, Enjoyable, strategy focused game with great replay value."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1492059679, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500179", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31110314", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198012618979", "num_reviews": 25, "last_played": 1464919396, "num_games_owned": 1050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 76}, "timestamp_updated": 1492059679, "received_for_free": false, "review": "So I played this a long time ago back on Xbox, and got it again for the PC when I could (which should tell you a lot right there). Very simply, it's fun! It's a light strategy game, but that's not to say it isn't difficult when it wants to be. The gameplay mechanics are very straightforward and it's very easy to pick up and learn. Games don't take too long, so it's a nice thing to hop into every once and a while to cure a craving for some strategy."}]}
