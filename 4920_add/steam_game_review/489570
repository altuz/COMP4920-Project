The playerbase is currently very small, although to be fair the game came out not even 24 hours ago from when this review is posted.\n\nIf you've ever played Lethal League then this game is quite similar in that you interact with the ball to eliminate the other player. The only difference is that instead of picking a character with set qualities, your \"sphere\" is customisable in appearance and in abilities. You can use these abilities to manipulate the ball and the opponent to eliminate them.\n\nThe game is very pleasing to look at and has a good enough soundtrack to not annoy you but won't stand out particularly either.\n\nThis game could absolutely shine with a larger playerbase.

It's actually a lot of fun, and I seriously recommend it. I wish there were more people playing the multiplayer as right now it's impossible to find a game, but the gameplay shown in the challenges and tutorials is fluid and fast.\n\n--------------\n\nOLD REVIEW:\nNot really much to say here that I haven't already said in my [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j56QGDFqJvc]livestream (40 minutes long)[/url] (or the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU6JcYDs45E]edited version (15 minutes long)[/url]).\n\nThat said, I'll summarise the problems I had (as of release day).\n\nThe controls are incredibly unresponsive (on keyboard, didn't test a controller). Several tutorial levels are near impossible to start, and the end screen upon completion of a tutorial level does not close upon pressing space like the game says, forcing you to ALT+F4 out of it.\n\nThe loadout screen is fairly unintuitive in terms of how to close it, you need to close any active menus before you can back out which isn't obvious at first. Also, the game doesn't tell you that right click closes any active menus.\n\nAs a minor complaint, the mouse sensitivity settings don't seem to change much (if anything) and the rotation feels way too sensitive to me as I usually play games with a fairly low sensitivity, leading to a lot of over rotates.\n\nWith all of these control issues, I can't recommend the game in its current state. It has an interesting premise, and the match I played was fun, but the inability to close menus hits even after playing a match; you have to ALT+F4 and relaunch the game after every match you play.\n\nIt's entirely possible I'm part of a minority with these issues, and it's entirely possible these issues don't exist on a controller, but reading the other reviews for this game only emphasises the point that something is currently broken control wise, for both keyboards AND controllers alike.\n\nWhen these problems get fixed, I'll come back to the game and give it another look. If they have been fixed then this review will be positive (unless a new major issue rears it's head, but that's unlikely).\n\nIf the premise of the game interests you and you don't mind buying into a product that has a chance of barely functioning, then pick this game up. Otherwise, wait a few weeks for some patches to roll out and for the game breaking issues mentioned here to be fixed (which the dev's have informed me they are looking into).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009082372", "last_played": 1500559428, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 84}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500159701, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500560543, "recommendationid": "33571841", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "To quote Rogal Dorn from Emperor's TTS Device.\n\n5/10 It was okay", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010653835", "last_played": 1500295084, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 108, "playtime_forever": 120}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500725406, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491917", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500725406, "recommendationid": "33719569", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Edit 2: This game now works on my PC after a hotfix released one day after the game's launch. The stuff below is no longer applicable to my review. Thank you for a fast fix, devs! So far I'm really enjoying the game, and will update the review again once I have a more developed opinion.\n\n\nEdit: I should have prefaced this before in this review - This is only about my experience with the game. I've seen plenty of people who are able to play and enjoy the game just fine, and only a few others who are experiencing issues similar to mine. Either way, I cannot play due to a game-breaking bug with no currently working fixes, and I view this as a major issue.\n\nSimply put, the game does not work for me. The menus are fine, the music is pretty good, the concept of the game is interesting, but the game itself does not work at all. \nAs soon as I try to enter the game, neither keyboard + mouse nor my Xbox 360 controller works to play the game, which are both the recommended control types for playing. I cannot move my ship whatsoever in local VS mode, and I cannot progress past textboxes while in-game. I have tried pressing every single key and button to see if some sort of interaction button has a strange default bind that isn't acknowledged in the controls menu, but nothing works. \nThe game also enters a fully softlocked state for me whenever I enter the game, as trying to exit out to the main menu triggers the menu music and a loading icon to appear, but nothing else happens. Oddly enough, you can pause again in this state despite the game being paused already, and I cannot select any of the options in the glitched pause menu that appears if you pause while exiting to the main menu.\n\nI want to like this game, but it's very hard to do so when the only part of it that works is the menu.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198117200484", "last_played": 1500160856, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 83, "playtime_forever": 42}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500062739, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500159455, "recommendationid": "33543682", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Nice little casual game to enjoy on the vacation, kids seem to enjoy it to", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198101981010", "last_played": 1500117234, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 118, "playtime_forever": 60}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500117310, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496739", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1500117310, "recommendationid": "33557042", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Really awesome indie game!
