Those reviews said that it was smooth and fluid and really similar to its obvious inspiration in the 'Strikers' arcade series.\n\nWRONG!!\n\nThis game is glitchy and controls terribly. I couldnt bring myself to finish the first level due to the player ship freeling heavy, unbalanced and anything but smooth.\n\nI have a good enough specce'd PC to play most modern games and yet the frame rate of this game is jumpy and not what is expected from a fairly simple game.\n\nLuckily i didnt pay the full price for this.\n\nThe most annoying this about this game is that it feels like it doesnt need much fixing to actually be good. My questio is why release a game that isnt finoished, the programmers obviously played it and didnt care.\n\nThe new 'TATE' mode doesnt actually work, it flips but in a widescreen fashion and doesnt actually scale to a full vertical aspect. this is one of their new features ???\n\nOne other review stated that ' All shmup fans MUST play this, Ignore this completely. If you are a casual gamer you might not notice the flawws. if you are a serious shooter fan then avoid at all costs, you will regret the purchase immediately.\n\nlets hope its fixed in future.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198339611166", "last_played": 1494962048, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 87, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1494962053, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496900", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1494962053, "recommendationid": "31792943", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
