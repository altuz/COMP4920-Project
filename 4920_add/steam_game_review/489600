Once the outdoor activities start to slow down I anticipating putting a lot of time and energy into this game as I get my golfing fix for the winter. \n\nWhat this game has going for it?: \n- Almost unlimited number of courses\n- Very immersive as you actually feel that you are on the course. \n- You get to drive the golf cart to find your ball\n\nWhat can be improved:\n- Would have loved to see multiplayer, even if just one other player. We get around this by playing the same course at the same time and talking on discord. \n- The controls for the cart, at least for me, are finicky and I haven't gotten the hang of them yet. I spend most of my time driving in circles. \n\nI am still overall very satisfied with this game and look forward to really getting into the action.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198087974479", "last_played": 1505406786, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 217, "playtime_forever": 119}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505639140, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502549", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505639140, "recommendationid": "35018318", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
