Can be frustratingly difficult at times and elegant at other times, but never felt unfair. The basic puzzles are in the vein of Portal (with a twist) while introducing a slew of new mechanics throughout the 65 levels. The only thing missing for fans of Portal are the voiceovers, but Fabric's puzzles are possibly even more challenging and mind bending. If reviewers could mark off more than just a \"Yes/No\" I'd subtract a point or two for the subpar ending.
