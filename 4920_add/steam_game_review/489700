The forums are bare, and a couple of the reviews seem rather harsh. Surely the game can't be that bad.\n\nTruth is, it isn't. However it isn't a great game either. You can tell a lot of passion went into it, as the graphics and sound, while not exceptional, do their job well enough. Considering one guy did it in maybe five months, it's pretty impressive honestly.\n\nThe gameplay itself is rather simple, but it is a beat 'em up so they are supposed to be simple. You move from left to right, beating up groups of enemies that come in five types with a combo, a heavy move, or a special move that you can constantly recharge and use over and over again. Along the way you fight several bosses, including 'The Bleeder' who sprays slime everywhere, 'Mike' (no seriously that's his name) who makes clones of himself, and the big bad, Professor S, the most evil of all scientists, who...randomly drops copy machines that shoot paper airplanes at you?\n\nThe story is clearly a bit tongue in cheek as you can't take it totally seriously. But that's fine, you don't come to this sort of game for a story. With that being said, one playthrough of this game will take you less then an hour. But there are four characters and a handful of achievements so you're gonna get about four, or maybe five hours, on a $2.00 (Canadian) purchase. That's not too bad for a game like this. You certainly won't be battling forever, but you'll get enough enjoyment out of it for your money.\n\nAn easy to play, time killing, not-quite-forever lasting recommendation.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009316076", "last_played": 1475829301, "num_reviews": 63, "num_games_owned": 549, "playtime_forever": 108}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1473920820, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489533", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1473920882, "recommendationid": "25506983", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
