Once you filled the bars the enterance you entered from will open up for the next level, but not before a button mashing minigame where most of your Conga line will go missing, i'll leave it you to find out how should you buy the game. There is also a Endless mode where you just simple make a long Conga line, thats it. There is also a good amount of people to choose from and plenty to unlock, each with their own 4 stats ranging from; movement speed, turning speed, attention range and affection gain. There are dangers in game also, ranging from Cleaners, Brutes and even Pigs *the animal*. The only flaw i have with this game is that it could be a bit repeatative, i'm fine with some games being a bit repeatative but i'm not sure about other people, be expected to hear alot of \"What could possibly go wrong?\". I have not tried the multiplayer so i have no idea on the grasp on that.\n\nIn the end its a game where \"what you see is what you get\", personally its a fun game where you can chill out too but i would recommend to wait till its at least close to 50% sale before getting it if your not too sure.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198090026955", "last_played": 1474141035, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 317, "playtime_forever": 306}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1473968733, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500925", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1473968733, "recommendationid": "25516349", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Played solo, had a fun time but ended up with this obsession about clapping my hands every three or four steps.\nPlayed with friends.
