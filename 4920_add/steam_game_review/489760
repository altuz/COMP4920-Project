If you are into arcade games with mechanics that are simple-to-learn, yet impossible-to-master like [i]Downwell[/i] or [i]One Finger Death Punch[/i], you'll likely really enjoy [i]Demon Truck[/i].\n\n[i]Essentially, you only need two buttons; the right mouse button accelerates/shields you, and the left mouse button attacks in random directions.[/i] The truck is possessed, and steers itself. It generally avoids obstacles, but if you are going to hit one, you just accelerate/shield through it. By using the attack, you refill the accelerate/shield meter, and vice-versa. Sounds complicated, but it is brilliantly simple. There are neat upgrade choices at the end of each round. Do you want another turret, or would you like to refill your health - that kind of thing.\n\n[b]Definately has that one-more-run appeal that will have you chasing your friend's scores on the leaderboards.[/b]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Really neat and novel mechanic\n+Controls are as simple as it gets - literally two buttons\n+Each level ends with a choice of upgrades that add a cool high-risk-high-reward component\n+Super cheap\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-I'd be hard pressed to find any 'cons' with this little gem - if you know of any, please comment below\n\n[b]Well worth it for any lover of indie games.[/b]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040884867", "last_played": 1486850170, "num_reviews": 618, "num_games_owned": 1196, "playtime_forever": 43}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1485708119, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531322", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1485708119, "recommendationid": "29568122", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fun bullet-dodger/bullet-hell with a slightly unique twist to it.

You're supposed to push the boost button to break through them, but if you're too slow you will take damage.  The truck is supposed to help you by auto-steering around them, but you quickly discover that this gimmick is something you simply cannot rely on.  The view is very zoomed in, so you cannot see these hazards coming in advance.\n\nThe meat of the game, fighting enemies, is really easy.  You will effortlessly parry enemy fire, chew through bosses, but every run will end because of road hazards chipping away at your health one by one.\n\nYes, I have the reflexes to deal with the roadblocks.  No, I don't think it's fun, because that is the only challenge this game offers.  You're just trying to be vigilant about one small part of the gameplay while you utterly decimate all other threats.
