So why the negative review, you ask? Well, let me tell you. \n\nBethesda has seen how popular mods are, so they thought \"let's shut down modding, and make people pay if they want to mod their game\"\n\nThat's correct, you now have to pay for mods. Mods that used to be free. Oh, and did I mention that many of the mods they will be offering are DIRECT COPIES OF ALREADY EXISTING, FREE MODS? \n\nSo yes, please get this game if you want to be taken advantage of by the greedy individuals who created it. \n\n\nOn a completely seperate note, this game does not use your computer's resources very well. It uses enough to run vanilla Skyrim at 60 FPS (which the game is hard capped to) \n\nHowever, if you try to use any graphical mods whatsoever, the game will have issues staying at 60 FPS. Probably because it refuses to use more than 30% of my GTX 1080TI's power. \n\nIt's extremely annoying to get the game upgraded to 4k via the mods (back when they weren't paid, anyway) and then have it run at no higher than 40 FPS, even though only 30% of your graphics card is being used. \n\nDON'T GET THIS GAME. \n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2837, "steamid": "76561198078967418", "last_played": 1507193277, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 6705}, "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_created": 1506748452, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506703", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506748452, "recommendationid": "35323641", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Bethesda Softworks ruined everything", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "steamid": "76561198209344583", "last_played": 1506102904, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_forever": 1339}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1506969356, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502693", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506969356, "recommendationid": "35425805", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "FUCKING BURN IT AND BUY THE ORIGINAL", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198126075612", "last_played": 1503914567, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_forever": 24}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1506607001, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500848", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506607001, "recommendationid": "35262441", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "oh ffs game studios pull yer head out of yer asses and breathe!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198275108596", "last_played": 1496432600, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 49, "playtime_forever": 479}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1506973826, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508847", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506973826, "recommendationid": "35427194", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2584\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2590\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2584\u2584\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2584\u2580\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2590\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2590\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2588\u2590\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591 BETHESDA Creation Club \u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "steamid": "76561198345501599", "last_played": 1506739634, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 63, "playtime_forever": 3622}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1506795565, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510572", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506795565, "recommendationid": "35349237", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "An amazing and addictive game...\n\n\nRuined by microtransactions.
