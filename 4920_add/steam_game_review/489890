I tried to play it and must say it is not what I expected.  I managed to get through the first 3 very small puzzles before I shut it down.  The gameplay is EXTREMELY laggy and moving the puzzle pieces is annoying to say the least.  I tried to find an options tab so that I could tinker with the settings to see if I could fix it and there wasnt any options available.   I would hold off on purchasing this game until the Devs work on the game a little more.  If you decide to go ahead and buy it, expect to spend at least 10+ minutes putting together a 25-30 piece puzzle that would take a toddler a few minutes to assemble.\n\nWill change rating and review if any updates are ever implimented.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034664874", "last_played": 1466533370, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 236, "playtime_forever": 85}, "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_created": 1466122352, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521639", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1466122389, "recommendationid": "23605565", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I picked this up during the latest Steam sale. 40 jigsaw puzzles for $1.01 seemed like a pretty good deal and it was. It took me a little over four hours to get through the game and it was a nice casual game. There isn't a lot of substance to it. You are essentially on rails, going from picture frame to picture frame where you put jigsaw puzzles together. While each puzzle is different, each one features a skull in some prominent fashion. \n\nAfter you finish each puzzle you are told how long it took you and how many moves you took. It's very straightforward and if you like jigsaw puzzles, this is a really nice game. I should warn you that the story is non-existant. When you start you are given a letter by the last person who entered (and died) in the house but that's it. When you beat the game, you just get a \"the end\" screen. Nothing more, nothing less. At the same time, besides the fourty jigsaw puzzles, you fill find various books that you can click on, each one containing a story or poem by Edgar Allen Poe in its entirity. These are cute, but more than likely you've read or even own a lot of these already and there is no real point to reading them in game. If you do, that would definitely increase the length of time you spend with the game, but like most people, I'd rather read a book outside of a video game.\n\nAll in all, I DEFENITELY got my money's worth out of this. In a perfect world, I'd have liked a story based ending but other than that I wanted something a bit soothing and calming in the form of jigsaw puzzles and that's exactly what the game gave me. I realize it sounds a bit weird to say that a game based on a house where a serial killer murdered a bunch of people, but it oddly is. For a dollar, this is well worth picking up if you're a fan of jigsaw puzzle or the type of games you find over at Big Fish Games.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198033609883", "last_played": 1466909075, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 1161, "playtime_forever": 256}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1466909501, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508777", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1466909501, "recommendationid": "23812890", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you like jigsaw puzzles and skulls then you will like this game.

You'll be doing jigsaw puzzles and a lot of them. The display nice skull scenes and still retain a good amount of difficulty without being too hard. Overall, the game does not lie and for the cheap price it certainly isn't the worst thing to pick up if you like jigsaws. \n\nMy only complain actually comes from the \"story\" as it were. You are sent in to solve the mystery of the dead wives and their trapped souls. An interesting concept but one that is completely fluff. There's nothing to that story beyond giving you the content of skull as the jigsaw theme. The story never expands from there and when you get done it'll leave you feeling want from the lack of a proper conclusion. There are a tossing of Edgar Allen Poe material around the game but that feels like a cop-out instead of present a true atmosphere towards the setting.\n\nAs stated, the game itself isn't bad and in fact is good considering price and what you are expecting to buy. I just feel they could have done so much more with the story itself.
