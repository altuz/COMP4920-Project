Overall I would recommend this funny little game, especially when all the bugs are fixed.\n\nPROS\n- Brilliantly punny, I love the inappropraite sense of humour and dialogue in this game.\n- Great range of characters and background art\n- This version is much longer than episode 2 which was great as I felt the first was far too short\n- Great soundtrack and brilliant voice acting\n- Gavin's sayings or 'clues' were excellent, they really helped me out at times throughout the game\n\nCONS\n- Bugs including the dialogue cutting into itself or repeating for no reason\n- Bertrams head disappearing \n- Some characters or background assets looking very low-resolution in places\n- Story [potential spoiler]; [spoiler] I felt the game was really nicely paced until the very last part of the game. The ending was rushed and the developers really missed a trick by not revealing that Geoff was actually a character that we've already met in the game. There were plenty of red herrings to chose from such as Lord Arthwipe, Lady Bertram or even Bertrams lady friend and it fell a bit flat at the end in terms of the storyline. [/spoiler]\n- It concluded the adventure in just two episodes, but I want more. I think this adventure could have been three episodes! But I do hope it's not the end of Bertram and Gavin's adventurings!\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198168512964", "last_played": 1504555249, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_forever": 556}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504790501, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504790501, "recommendationid": "34794254", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
