It feels highly polished already and it just released.  I spent at least a few minutes just waving the fans around feeling like a geisha.  There is a handle underneath the table that adjust's it's height!  Just stoop down and look under it.  I'm so impressed and immediately feel like I already got my moneys worth and I only played two levels so far,  I will difinitely be playing more of this.

The game trailer gives a very good representation of what to expect so you should already know if this is for you or not.  Simple premise but nicely presented.  \n\nYou can play seated or standing by reaching under the table to change its height, or rotate the table using the wheel around the side - more importantly holding the Right menu button on the Vive brings up a little flag which recenters the play area so you can make sure the whole table is easily within your play area.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030519086", "last_played": 1497798290, "num_reviews": 53, "num_games_owned": 687, "playtime_forever": 40}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1497786682, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517491", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497786682, "recommendationid": "32534847", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A beautiful, original and fun game.   Some minor things are worked on right now, but it's already perfectly playable.\n\nPRO\n- I love the overall concept of the game\n- the room is very beautiful\n- the Japanese music is perfect\n- it's fun to play (although not always easy to get the crates :-)\n\ncurrently being worked on some improvements like :\n- when playing seated, it would be better if you could change the height \n- in-game menu to set the music softer and to quit the game\n- improvement of the wind effect \n- when the landscape \"enters\" the bowl during gameplay, it just moves through the edge of the bowl and especially with higher stuff like buildings, this is a bit weird sometimes. A visual effect to illmuniate the edge of the landscape (where it still touches the edge of the bowl) with a fine line in a different color would be a good idea I think. It would give the game a more polished look.. \n-  some crates are mandatory to grab, some are optional, a coming update will make this more obvious to the player\n\nI think the price is right for this beautiful and fun little game and I can recommend it if you're looking for something rather casual and a bit different.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198258022771", "last_played": 1497653411, "num_reviews": 143, "num_games_owned": 370, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1497694110, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513622", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1497694110, "recommendationid": "32499748", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pro: \nThe room is beautifully done, the music is very appropriate and really enhances the atmosphere.
