But this port is not the same game. Overall, yes, it is the same game. The story is there, the mechanics are there. But in the hour I've played it, here are some things I've noticed\n\n+ The music is catchy, it's not the original soundtrack that I adore but it still fits.\n+ Some of the graphics have been redone to be HD, (IE my profile image is a grayscale version of the original source texture), and although it's much higher quality than the rest of the game, it still is aesthetically pleasing and looks as though it fits.\n+ The controller controls work very well. Other reviews have stated that the KB+M controls do not work well, I cannot vouch for them as I have not tried them, but I do recommend trying a controller if you can.\n+ The combat bonus minigames have been adapted very well, but again I have only tried using a controller.\n\nHowever, there are a few things that tell me not to recommend this game...\n\n- On Day 7, I already saw a frozen texture, (one of the knights stuck halfway through an attack animation during the cutscene).\n- There are audio cues which are supposed to inform you when a structure is close to destruction, which now seem to activate randomly when any structure is attacked.\n- The turrets seem to have very poor tracking. They won't attack Clockworks that are clearly within their range, (I've played enough of the original to know when and when not Clockwork are within range). Sometimes they're barely within range, other times they're right next to the turret and can wail on it until I send Lock in to stop them.\n- Sometimes after a wall is placed, I try to select it for destruction and instead it gets shifted one tile backwards and nothing else. I had to restart the game to fix it.\n\nAnd, personally, the fact that they replaced the Antonia Defence with more waves disappoints me. That was the one thing I loved most from this game, it was a refreshing change from the normal gameplay and it's not something that I think would be impossible to port or replicate.\n\nThe problems aren't truly gamebreaking, and if you can get past them then it's still a really fun game. But, if you're looking at this game with the mentality of \"Hey this looks nice, maybe I'll try it!\", then there's a chance you'll get frustrated. \n\nAgain, I played the original, and personally this port is a bit of a letdown, but it can still be fun if you let it. In the future, if and when there are any updates I will try and update my review as well.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057307846", "last_played": 1496181377, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 111, "playtime_forever": 58}, "votes_up": 74, "timestamp_created": 1496183418, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626990", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1496183531, "recommendationid": "32073115", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "TLDR: PC keyboard mouse controls harder than the NDS version, 1st map unusually hard, other bugs, hard but playable, mixed recommendation but hopeful. Probably should wait to see new updates, caution advised.\n\nI was about to write an angry rant for my favorite NDS game remaster, but took another crack at beating the first map before I posted. I have now finished the game and updated this review. The controls on PC keyboard and mouse for ratching and special attacks are indeed harder than the NDS version and changes absolutely must be made to make them easier. At the bottom are my ideas for keyboard changes, but here are other important differences between the PC version and the NDS version:\n\n1) The first map is unusally hard.\nOn the NDS, the first map is a breeze, but you can and probably will lose structures on this map. The biggest part of that is the controls for ratching and special attacks, however, there are a few more problems that contribute to the overall difficulty. \n\n2) Clockwork aggro is not exactly the same as the NDS version. \nThey will not target Lock as well as before, meaning your structures take more damage and the game becomes harder. This actually feels present mostly on the first map for some reason and less on the later maps. \n\n3) Targeting lag and suspended fire from turrets\nAssuming a straight wall going left to right, turrets sometimes do not attack clockworks if they are attacking a wall piece to the left or right of the turret. I know the archer clockwork is made to be partially out of range, but this happens with the melee clockworks. Furthermore, Lock can have some problems when chosing a target, but that was already in the NDS version so its not a big problem. Brutes do not counterattack if Lock attacks them mid charge, and they stand next to Lock perpetually charging while they are killed. Brutes don't stop their charges if they don't reach a structure, which wasn't in the NDS version, but it helps when they get stuck against terrain. Some targets for Lock to free or set explosives etc. have trouble being targeted when first right clicked from a distance. Many or nearly all physical barriers do not stop arrows, this can be a problem when archers are out of tower range, but that is their intended role.\n\n4) Build mode selecting and rotation and support towers.\nSelecting from a cluster of structures is harder on PC than the NDS version. At the stone fort on the second map the stone structures cannot be rotated. The NDS version allowed for this, so I am unsure if the developers intend for us to move them. I feel these stone structures should be allowed to be rotated because that was how the NDS played out. I am not sure that helpers, the support towers, do much. The tower for detecting phantom clockworks works properly, but the repair helper did not seem to repair anything no matter the orientation relative to the damaged structure. I cannot speak for the other helpers because even in the NDS version I never really used them.\n\n5) General movement problems.\nMovement problems were in the NDS version too, but on PC, clicking and draging to guide Lock in a timely NDS like manner is not possible. I use left clicking to get by, then right clicking while on the way to a target. \n\n6) The later levels will become harder if you are not prepared.\nGiven the differences in controls and movement, strategies that I used to get by the first few levels with as little resources as possible do not work as well as before. I play an extremely agressive Lock that looks to engage in fisticuffs and tactical pick-offs, but I can definately say the game is harder with PC keyboard controls. I definately use more resources than before to passby all levels than the NDS version.\nIf you cannot bank resouces you may have trouble on some levels where you must defend two to three targets.\n\n7) Seige Mode is replaced and there is no post game like the NDS version.\nThe cute seige minigame-like defense of Antonia is replaced with the new Antonia defense, the one with the Kingdom Force. It is a sad tradeoff. The far worse change is the disapearance of the post game. I wanted to go to the developers hall but no, the file resets to day 74 every time after completion.\n\n8) Personal differences I noticed (the little things).\nThe brute charge cannot be stopped by using Lock as a meat shield and this makes me sad, but hey, at least they reduced the charge damage. Where are the scrap pieces too? They give the structures unlike the NDS version. Graphical errors are present too, I saw a knight in a cutscene freeze in a hurt position, but there are other cases throughout the game. Some images appear to be partially behind the background or flash in and out of view. Lock can also phase though a lot of terrain that used to be impassable in the NDS version. However, this phasing actually helps you to repair your structures. When a clockwork is being healed by a healer clockwork, its healthbar and maybe sound effects may stay around if it dies during healing. I don't like the new healing sound effect, its loud. Mute, the mage clockwork boss is much easier than before. The special abilities must be selected at the start of every battle round, unlike the NDS version where your preferences stuck.\n\n9) Story and cutscene changes.\nKenan's recruit quiz is gone. I believe there are a few dialogue changes but none that I can say are game changing. There are fewer days so the story is easier to follow, but it's a shorter game now.\n\nI have played all of the PC version as of now, and I can say that there are problems with this version, particularly the difficulty increase. If you are a veteran who has enjoyed Lock's Quest who is considering to play this version, the answer is yes if you want to revisit the story and gameplay. But, you may be better off not playing it if you own the NDS version. If you are not a veteran, you should consider if you want to see a unique tower defense rts with a nice story albeit difficult and buggy. Hopefully they will improve it; it is playable but harder than the NDS version. It is possible to finish the game.\n\nAfter playing the game I decided to make a strategy guide for new players:\nDon't sit in your base idle, you need to be an active player; you cannot wait for the clockworks reach your walls. If you run out at the start of the round you can kill or damage one clockwork. Prioritize types you hate the most. For most towers you should try to connect them to walls, they gain damage reduction bonuses based on how connected they are as seen through the shield and wrenches above them. Try to angle you towers so they face the clockworks directly in front, especially since of targeting issues (and always make sure your towers have their front sides forward because they have reduced range in the back). There is no hope for the first map. Try your best. For some reason its hard, probably because of the strange controls. Always try to reduce total costs for your runs, you need to save up for the end map at the Antonia gate to spam when the bosses come out. Use traps asap, they make the early maps easy until the fliers come out (poison freeze poison freeze...). I only use the basic and splash turrets, sometimes the last turret they give too. Not every level will have fliers, phantoms or burrowers, don't be afraid to reset your defenses to save money.\n\nPersonally, I hope special attacks will allow for keyboard controls. For the strong hit, 12345 will work. For the other abilities that I know appear later in the game, maybe Q,E, and R will work for different rotations on poison touch, maybe going up and down between arrow keys or Q and E will work for freeze touch, and maybe vampire touch can actually be the sliding bars with the mouse. The stylus on the NDS is simply far faster than the mouse on PC, so keyboard keys should be adopted for speed. The most important thing in my opinion, is ratching. It needs to use the scroll wheel up and down on the mouse.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198302657083", "last_played": 1503368022, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 13, "playtime_forever": 763}, "votes_up": 21, "timestamp_created": 1496275091, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538354", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1496629894, "recommendationid": "32096838", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I have played the original NDS Version and it was one of my most favorite games.\nBut sadly, the remake is not as good as the original\n\n+: Same good old Story (Avoid the Trading Cards, one of them contains a spoiler)\n+: Good Soundtrack\n+: Nice Genre Mix\n+: XBOX360 Controlls are good\n+: Harder than the NDS Version\n[spoiler]You thought you know who is the boss of the game after Agony revealed his true Identity, you thought you know who is the boss of the game after you have beaten him, but after you have faced Sapper using MK Controls on hard difficulty, you (perhaps) know the real one[/spoiler]\n\n-: Either my save file is corrupt or there are 74 Days, not 75 (or 100 from the NDS game)\n-: XBOX360 Controller doesn't work when using Xubuntu.

I was originally going to recommend this (with the review below), but there are just so many things wrong.

It's not terribly expensive and a nice nostalgic experience but for new players... perhaps consider a different game. It's fun and a nice idea but not very well executed.\n\n----\n[Old Review]\n\nAnd with that it is finally on Steam. Before I say anything else, please note that this is more of a preliminary review in case you'e been wondering what the game is like.\nI've played the game right after it came out all those years ago and jsut fell in love with it. THis is probably my favourite NDS game and one of my all-time-favourites in general.\nThat said, here is my (slightly nostalgia biased) list:\n\nThis is basically a story heavy tower defense game in which you have to hold off a constant stream of different enemies for a certain amount of time.\n\nWhat is different from the old version (as I've seen so far):\n\nThe soundtrack has been updated and greatly improved (better quality and all that), although it does seem to lose some of the vibes the original gave off, mostly because the original was more limited sound wise and thus had a certain feel to it that's hard to describe. Don't get me wrong, the soundtrack so far seems top notch although I had the impression that sometimes they went overboard with it and caused the rythm/melody to not be felt as much.\n\nThe graphics themselves have kinda improved, but mostly the sprites displayed during dialogue, the rest seems the same (can't really tell a difference). EDIT: The graphics have been much improved and the environment looks way better now. The only things that seem the same are the character sprites during combat.\n\nEDIT: Also: the segments where you had to defend Antonia's walls with a turret have been replaced by a normal combat section where you can deploy soldiers. Something that I'm not quite sure I like all that much since the wall defense was kind of refreshing once in a while.\n\nSome other small things also disappeared (e.g. the quiz Kenan originally has for you, not sure about the hidden areas, though.)\n\nThe only thing that I have some problems with are the controls.\nThe original was meant for the DS and you can definitely feel that. While not particularly clunky, it jsut feels a bit off at first but you can easily get accustomed to it.\n\nNow, I don't know what it's like when playing with a controller, but with a mouse, power attacks (like the first press the buttons in order thing) feel weird and unprecise, same with repairing. It would be better to be able to utilize the keyboard a bit more for the M&K controls at least. Like pressing the 1-5 buttons in the right order for the first combo attack.\nHowever, I may have just overlooked some options, but I don't think so.\n\nEDIT: There also seem to be a few bugs here and there. Characters stuck in an animation, enemies unable to complete their attacks and stuck in one place,small stuff like that. Also some poor gameplay choices like only being able to repair walls and stuff from behind.\n\nEDIT: After some more testing, I can say that I find the M&K controls to be horrible. Everything's fine and fluid in bulding mode but in combat... You cannot properly dot he mini-games to get that bonus effect. It worked fine on the ds because you could be really precise with the stylus but it jsut doesn't properly work with a mouse, at least not with the speed needed to do combat properly.\n\nOverall: If you like tower defense, action and awesome music wrapped with an great story, plase consider giving this game a try. It's not at all expensive for what it offers and, while still feeling a little rough around the edges, I am certain the game will be further optimized.

It's a very interesting twist on tower defence, but if you have a DS of any kind, I'd recommend the original rather than the PC port, maybe it's better on consoles, but the PC port is really disapointing.\n\nI had high hopes for this port, since Lock's Quest is one of my favourite games of all time, right up there with Drawn to Life 1 and 2, originally made by the same people. \n\nOverall, I'm happy to see it get a second chance but due to the fact it didn't even see itself on the \"New Releases\" might be the final nail in the coffin for this game's populairty, to remain only as a cult classic for the fans who owned a DS during the 5th Cell era.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198074707270", "last_played": 1496498626, "num_reviews": 75, "num_games_owned": 269, "playtime_forever": 32}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1496499172, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465162", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1496499172, "recommendationid": "32153480", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I managed to bug the game so hard that i cant play it anymore even after installing it completly new so right now even if its hard to say because i loved the game on the DS i wouldnt recommend it until the controlls are better and the game got checked so you wont run in bugs like that so fast", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198055272530", "last_played": 1496423645, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_forever": 17}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1496424256, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499339", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1496424256, "recommendationid": "32133899", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Black People", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198170195925", "last_played": 1506128210, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 153, "playtime_forever": 917}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1496185329, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500329", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1500354168, "recommendationid": "32073579", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Well the little bit of the game I played was okayish gameplaywise. It seems like this is an interesting tower defense game with some poorly executed action rpg mixed in. I am not sure if this a port issue or what but wow the controls are horrific. At least as far as the keyboard and mouse are concerned. Maybe gamepad is better but I'm requesting a refund while I'm still in my window. Also it seemed like I source was magically disappearing between battles.
