Just like the other Quell games but with a Japanese theme.  Even the titles of the levels have a Japanese translation beneath the English.   There are nice visual touches: cherry blossoms on some of the stone blocks, Japanese styled window panes, samurai swords on a wall rack, a huge ornate cabinet with many little drawers.   Unfortunately the music doesn't seem at all Japanese to me.  It's still soft, soothing, background music for solving puzzles, but I'd think they would choose something more to fit the theme better.\n\nThis game combines many features of the previous Quell games.  The beginning few levels are mini tutorials to get you up to speed.   I played the first game but never got around to the others (because I'm a completionist and hadn't gotten the first game 100% yet!) so some of the puzzle aspects are new to me.  I assume they are in the other Quell games, or maybe they are new here?  \n\nFor those new to the Quell games, the object is to guide a bubble through a maze of obstacles until it hits all the pearls.  You can only move in four directions: up, down, left, right.  Once the bubble starts moving it will continue until it runs into a wall or another obstacle.  Avoid spikes!  There is also optional stuff for achievement hunters: do the level in a certain number of moves; find the hidden gem; find the warp ring to a special puzzle.  \n\nYou can retry a puzzle as many times as you like.  And there is no time limit, so take all the time you want planning your moves.  \n\nDifficulty goes from easy to brain numbing, especially if you want to get 100%.\n\nI used keyboard and mouse.  Not sure if gamepad works.\n\nWill update more as I play more of the game.  Just wanted to give a quick review for those wondering how it compares to previous ones.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198064050389", "last_played": 1469570718, "num_reviews": 59, "num_games_owned": 3500, "playtime_forever": 209}, "votes_up": 23, "timestamp_created": 1468543929, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544627", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1468554239, "recommendationid": "24325247", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is one of those two-dimensional puzzle games you can find by the dozens here, a brain-teaser with neat abstract objects and increasing difficulty that keeps you busy for a few hours.  It has more features on the board than some of its competitors. Also, the whole presentation is aesthetically pleasing, and so I can give the game a thumbs-up.\n\nI do have a small problem with the advertisement though: This is not \"the embodiment of relaxation\" or \"an unforgettable journey\", in fact it is not special at all. There are just some meditation-related buzzwords like \"tranquility\" and \"zen\" as well as pseudo-literary texts (that are completely unrelated to the actual game) thrown in, and the very good sound design includes soothing background music. You can achieve the exact same effect by playing one of the many other similar logic games and run your favourite relaxation playlist in a separate app. Still, the ad tries to suggest to you that this game would be something unique, selling you a feeling instead of a product in a quite transparent and pretentious manner. This does not mean that Quell Zen was somehow worse - but it surely is not better than the others the way it claims to be. I felt that this needed to be said.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198116527414", "last_played": 1485264283, "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 230, "playtime_forever": 341}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1485261575, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515762", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1485278170, "recommendationid": "29461294", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Quell Zen is a very relaxing and calm puzzle game that starts out easy and gets harder and harder with every level. There are 192 levels in total which means you will be busy for quite a while.\n\nThe general mechanic of this game is that you control a raindrop that, when you press a direction, constantly travels until it hits a wall or obstacle - similar to ice puzzles in many other games. The puzzles themselves are fun and constantly introduce new elements like teleporters, spikes, crystals and more - variety is certainly a strong point of Quell Zen while still never straying too far from its roots.\n\nSomething to note about this game is the extremely amazing music. If the backgrounds and the general feel of the game (that are very japanese in design) aren't yet \"zen\" enough for you, the music will do the rest. I grew up with the classics and heard plenty of amazing video game music in my life - but whoever composed the music for this game needs to be paid much more than they currently get. It sounds amazing, is relaxing, peaceful and fits the mood of the game incredibly well. It draws you in and relaxes you - \"Zen\" indeed.\n\nIf you are looking for a relaxing experience that still teases your brain a lot, look no further. Quell Zen is a great puzzle game with plenty to do. It is visually pleasing, contains many puzzling elements and includes absolutely amazing music.

Sometimes you just have to collect all the pearls, sometimes switch lights on, or enable a multiple grid of light beams that hits all available targets simultaneously, sometimes all of the above.\n\nAfter the early tutorial levels the difficulty increases and then the fun begins. So many times you avoid all traps, devise a logical route and method to collect all pearls, solve all problems, achieve all goals and then you discover that you are just one move short of a perfect score, teasing you, if you are so inclined, to peruse every move you have made to try and find some way of shaving just one move off your solution. If your solution is, for instance, 53 moves and your perfect target is 52 moves, well, some time may pass as you try to find that elusive one move reduction.\n\nAdd to this the challenge of discovering all the hidden jewels in each level, sometimes they are quite hard to find as well as seemingly inaccessible, can you find a way of getting to them? There are levels hidden within levels, can you find and solve all of them?\n\nComplete each section and, in a series of letters, a touching story unfolds.\nThis together with the accompaniment of a relaxing soundtrack enables a pleasant immersion as you progress.\n\nThis is the sort of game that you might start to play on a rainy Sunday afternoon, the next thing you know it is the early hours of the morning and the birds are singing.\n\nExcellent game, can't wait for the next one.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971111724", "last_played": 1475536525, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 239, "playtime_forever": 4517}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1473970825, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1473970825, "recommendationid": "25516795", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I was hooked on the previous Quell games (Quell, Reflections, and Memento), but this is the best one ever!
