Yes.\nIs it meant soley for fanservice. Yes.\nDoes it do these things tastefully. Yes.\n\nFor all the juvenile pleasures the game(?) delivers, it is still surprisingly respectable.\n\nThe overall production quality is greatly improved from the prequel ( if they can keep that trend up, they have a bright future) and I have to say that I find myself really enjoying the plot (seriously, it's not too bad, I hope the devs can keep respecting thier own writing).\n\nAs for improvements: I understand that a \"visual novel\" is essentialy a self-reading comic book, but more choices and paths would really expand the game (yes, this makes development and writing MUCH harder, but anything worth doing is hard).\nAlso, they need a LOT more art and portrait variance; MOST of the draw of the game is the character portraiture and descriptions-- and they seldom match. Yes this is because the characters are constantly changing, but you don't actually get much of a sense of that from the art. The art quality itself has also improved from teh prequel, but they will have to keep improving it to expand the series further.\n\nAnimation is hard, but it may be neccessary for what the devs have intended here. And given the nature of the plot, I can see how they may have to start writing unnofficial patches to still get this on steam.\n\nStill, I actually respect the game and the devs. I hope to see a sequel some day.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993495947", "last_played": 1498883389, "num_reviews": 44, "num_games_owned": 280, "playtime_forever": 282}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1498007952, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509082", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498007952, "recommendationid": "32606780", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Alright, regardless of what people on my friend list have said about me playing this particular visual novel series, its a good one. One of the few I actually played (mainly because the others are a bit pricy, this one wasn't really). I have thoroughly enjoyed Time Tenshi, Time Tenshi 2 with DLC, and Busted. For Time Tenshi, the story was really well done; it was a rather interesting take the sci-fi concept of time machines and time travellers with an anime twist. Kyo was probably my favorite character, I'd say. I wouldn't mind there being a Time Tenshi 3 or a whole series of games involving these characters and future additons. From what I've seen in Busted, there are characters that may show up in other games by Silver Cow Studios.\n\nOverall though, this was probably the most interesting visual novel game I've played. While I'm not very partial to the genre itself, this is one of the few games that made me want to play a novel game.
