I Sent him home to bed early and played 2.6 hours on my first try.  If you liked trains as a child and loved the idea of having a very large track layout in a room, then this is for you.\n\nAt first, the control scheme is a pain, the tutorial needs real help, and I didn't look for a tutorial either or notes on how to use this simluator.\n\nAs far as it goes, the trigger is important on the controls:\nHolding Trigger grabs objects and if you grabbed a table and while the control illuminates red, hit the trackpad once to unlock and move then press tracks again while holding trigger and table to snap tables in place and on the floor.  (its a pain at first but feels very natural after getting the controller scheme figured out.)\n\nHolding Trigger to an object and while gripping the controller at the same time deletes objects including table (it turns red and brightens to max and deletes).\n\nHolding trigger forms finger to press buttons on virtual controls and virtual drawer.\n\ngripp one controller in air to move height or direction by moving your arm.\ngrip 2 controllers at the same time and swing your arms around side to side to rotate room.\n\nlots of wierd combination but once you figure out what these do during gameplay, you then realise it is one overlooked piece of simulation that needs your attention.  After figuring out controller scheme, it feels very natural.\n\nAnother trick.  Holding a piece of pavement and over a table with trigger hold, while holding trigger, I hit the track pad and sprinkle the pavement on the table like parmesan cheese on spaghetti.  So cool.\n\nRight now, I'm trying to figure out how to divert my son's attention so I can add more hours into this simulator.
