Being 1999 IG2 was actually one of the first 3D strategy games ever made which was quite an achievement from the small Hungarian studio Digital Reality. I've created a [url=http://blakessanctum.x10.mx/Games/Imperium/]Imperium Galactica Legacy Website[/url] that tributes IG and looks at the most similar games out there if that's of interest to anyone. But nothing really comes close to IG as it truly is a one of kind hybrid series.\n\nIG2 improves upon IG1 in many areas. You can play as 3 different races across 3 epic campaigns with literally hours of cinematic videos spread across each story. The FMV cutscenes were very realistic for the time as you can tell Digital Reality had really got into the groove with video making (the dramatic wormhole intro still gives me goosebumps to this day!). The 3D in-game graphics was equally amazing as now the galaxy map, planet surface view and space battle view was truly 3D allowing you to rotate and zoom in any direction. A fully 3D galaxy to conquer is something many modern TBS space games still don't do, and seeing the clouds and sunsets over your planet cities still looks incredible to this day, the space battles were equally impressive especially when in orbit of a planet as the orbiting ships and surface batteries literally battled through the clouds.\n\nI loved how you could zoom in on a star and see your planet circling it and if you left clicked on its stats you could zoom into orbit of the planet to view all the space stations above the clouds. Battles also had this seamless cool zooming in from main galaxy effect adding even more to the game's immersion. Ship design and configuration was enhanced plus new Spy management and Trade port screens were added to the game. Ground combat was expanded too with more unit and defence building types. You could even build support tanks to order awesome fighter and orbital bombardment strikes during the battles. Also finally added was a full skirmish and scenario mode allowing fans to play the sandbox galaxy conquering games they couldn't play in IG1.\n\nIG2 had become a forgotten classic however Digital Reality in their final years enhanced and rereleased the game on Ipad. Now in 2017 THQ Nordic have taken that IG2 enhanced version and rereleased it on PC Steam, GoG & even mobile phones! This version has updated graphics, supports all modern HD resolutions, and with some nice force applied anti-aliasing & antistrophic filtering the game still looks pretty good after all these years. Even more amazing is that THQ Nordic are still patching the game with new updates and fixes! I strongly suggest you check it out!\n\nI made some videos showing off this updated version here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGouCiy95_Y\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcfRSnE7jHM", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198058803521", "last_played": 1500473842, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 49, "playtime_forever": 4449}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506145708, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506145708, "recommendationid": "35144992", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
