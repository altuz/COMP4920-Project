It manages to take the gameplay of a bullet Hell game and fit it to a FPS game in VR. Also, the style and humor add a whole lot of charm to it. Another plus is the weapon design aspects. You can really make your gun act the way you want it to by picking the base frame, barrel, magazine, projectile type and more. These impact what is shot from the gun, how fast it shoots (cycles), the speed of the projectile, it's spread, how many projectiles are shot at a time, if you manually reload or if it charges over time, the capacity, if it explodes with AoE damage, if you have a laser sight, and more. Also, you get different shields that act differently.\n\nOverall, there's a good bit of polished content here and most importantly it's a lot of fun.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004410106", "last_played": 1504736541, "num_reviews": 136, "num_games_owned": 576, "playtime_forever": 101}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505628274, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505628274, "recommendationid": "35015290", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "BOTU is a wave shooter set inside a retro themed arcade game - it's conscious about you playing a VR game.\n\nYou have a gun and a shield.

As you make kills, your weapons special ability charges - this brief effect (also customizable) can be anything from a powerful ray to invulnerability.\n\nThere are 4 levels in the campaign, each ending with a boss fight. Once a level is unlocked, you can also play it in endless mode. On top of that there's a challenge mode which runs for a few days, with a predetermined weapon and shield. There are global leaderboards for all levels/modes.\n\nPROS\nVaried enemy types.\nThe boss fights.\nThe weapon customization.\nThe deflection shield is actually useful.\n\nCONS\nNo loadout, no dual wielding - just a gun and a shield.\nGameplay a bit on the slow side.\nOne particular enemy spawns silently and cannot be dodged nor shield blocked - feels unfair and annoying.\nThe reload mechanism feels dodgy and unreliable.\nBugs and performance issues.\nAnnoying attempts at humour.\n\nIf bullet hell wave shooters is your thing, then this is a recommended purchase, but imo this is a poor man's Space Pirate Trainer.\n\n65%", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "steamid": "76561197971348987", "last_played": 1506790381, "num_reviews": 63, "num_games_owned": 217, "playtime_forever": 1306}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505638284, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505638304, "recommendationid": "35018065", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's been a long time since I've played a game that has kicks my butt so bad, but I just can't get enough!!!!
