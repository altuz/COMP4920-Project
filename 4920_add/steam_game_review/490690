You can tell they are actually trying, but severly defficent in resources and training/experience. Not worth five bucks but def worth more then .50 cents, I'd say 3.00.\n\nOnce again, like previous title I enjoyed the game. I went in expecting MSTK3000 comedy but actually really enjoyed the story for serious this time. The plot had several unexpected twists which were cool, the changes in story based on decisions were impressive. There was a decent ratio of art to text. Game is designed more like choose your own adventure then a VN, designed for multiple playthroughs.\n\nThere is no voice work, the music is meh and too loud in relation to sound effects, the sound effects are very few and suck. The menu is pretty bad. no animations. There were still some lolworthy faces but I actually like these. The sex scene was surprisingly taseful and not just wank material, that booty thicc though.\n\nthe tavern minigame sucked and was confusing but I guess it was nice of them to try including something intresting. Translation was much better this time, though I enjoyed laughing at last games failure, nice for people that want serious.\n\nI liked the game but its rough, low budget, and very european , keep in mind before you buy. Needs better sound effects, more varied and better music, better use of rpg mechanics, more freedom of movement and less linear choose your own adventure style of play.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198092477150", "last_played": 1494304873, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 283, "playtime_forever": 198}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1492881549, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503973", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1492881549, "recommendationid": "31301602", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
