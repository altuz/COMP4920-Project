This game costs $2.19 so i didn't expect much out of it. So i'll start with the controls. It is responsive but it's too complicated\n(for me). The game looks nice to be honest i enjoyed a little bit but as i continue to play other levels i felt like it's getting repetitive but i \ndon't find it as a flaw. If you're a casual gamer you'll probably enjoy playing this game with your friends setting high scores and such. Overall\ni kinda like the game. 7/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198339421398", "last_played": 1479481449, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 34}, "votes_up": 19, "timestamp_created": 1479481491, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450526", "votes_down": 39, "timestamp_updated": 1479481491, "recommendationid": "26673146", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
