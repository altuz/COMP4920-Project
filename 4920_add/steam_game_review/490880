Seeing they 'improved' the game, I felt like giving it another go and why not add another perfect game to my list? Overal Score: 5/10\n\nThe additional difficulty didn't feel balanced at all. The gimmick is that every dying enemy releases a sphere of projectiles on Hard and that certain enemies are even more cheap with their projectiles, be it adding a slight homing to them or additional bullets per volley. After Stage 4, all my attempts at perfect runs felt closer to luck than skill. I got a perfect score because the enemy didn't instantly spawn behind me and unleash their kamehameha while I attempted to dodge the exploding corpses. Stuff like that. Took about 5 hours of retrying stages to get 9 perfect victories.\n\nThe flash version isn't that much different than the version on here and it's not worth buying for the update. Maybe for the local co-op survival mode, but again, it doesn't do anything special. It isn't a bad game by any means if you stop at Normal difficulty and Normal is what you get with the Flash version. I'm downvoting the enhanced version because of the many flaws that should have been fixed to justify a release like this. There isn't even a restart level option as a small example of some touch ups that the game should have been given.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009596311", "last_played": 1493486900, "num_reviews": 109, "num_games_owned": 4142, "playtime_forever": 426}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1493487940, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1493487940, "recommendationid": "31445437", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
