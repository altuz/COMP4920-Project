All the other features made up for these shortcomings and made for a pleasant experience. I just highly advise players to put this game on hold until part 2.\n\nAs far as the story goes the front half are relatively slow pacing with not much happening at all it takes its time to set the stage but the pacing felt a little to slow because I did get a little bored while reading the front half. But once you made it though the halfway mark and go into the back half of the story it becomes one hell of a roller coaster ride. Which made the read through really exciting and engaging all at once with the combination of visual effects and more.There is a huge amount of typos. I honesly do not know how it got through the QA team \n\nThe art, however, is pretty. Len certainly does make a lot of expressions, Uzume\u2019s passion for Len is very vivid, Shinome has an excellent smug face, and Ruka\u2019s \u201cice queen\u201d expression during Shinome\u2019s story is really cold. The girls all look beautiful.\n\nThough it ends with a cliffhanger and is showed that Ne no Kami \u2013 The Two Princess Knights of Kyoto Part 2 will be coming winter 2016.Though do not be held back by the cliffhanger because these type off cliffhangers are good as it does not leave a bad instead it left me with the excitement of wanting to know more of the story with the well timed character role twist at the ending.\n\nMy Verdict : I would recommend Ne no Kami \u2013 The Two Princess Knights of Kyoto to people who love yuri and romance and of course action. It is relatively short and enjoyable game. 3/5", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198276383313", "last_played": 1494941866, "num_reviews": 164, "num_games_owned": 1989, "playtime_forever": 883}, "votes_up": 30, "timestamp_created": 1494943868, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562691", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1494943868, "recommendationid": "31787674", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is an interesting game.
