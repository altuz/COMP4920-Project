The art style is just haunting enough to keep you on your toes and really think about your choices. It really gives the game a sense of urgency, especially when the frost counter gets really low. That said, I think it could definitely get stale after a while. There are dozens of cards to unlock, but they unlock in random order. My first few games were pretty frustrating as I didn't have a lot of idea cards unlocked that could help me, and I was struggling with the learning curve. Once you figure it out though, it's a lot more fun. I just started so I am still playing on easy difficulty, but it's still not as simple as you might think.

In the game's 'Classic' mode you become a leader who must collect the resources needed to traverse the land in search of a mythical place called the \"Refuge\" whilst also trying your best to outrun the titular snow storm that threatens to consume all.\n\nEvery concept is rendered in card form with your own personal deck consisting of resources like Food, Materials, Survivors, and other gubbins such as weapons or even Ideas. Other cards stand in for the Regions that you must cross as well as the special events or obstacles that your tribe will run into along the way.\n\nAlso rearing its ugly head here is the time-worn mechanic by where a useless card (in this case representing Fatigue) is routinely dumped into your deck as play progresses. As with The Big Book of Madness, the inclusion of bogus cards makes thematic sense here because it's important for the player to feel pressured.\n\nNevertheless, I'm generally not a fan of mechanics like these and whilst Frost does offer you the default option of Resting in order to remove Fatigue, I really dislike how it's included in your starting deck. There are times when my first turn is skipped in order to remove Fatigue and that just feels wrong. Fatigue can also be incurred when activating certain cards that grant a random reward. Specialist cards like Supplies, the Gatherer or the Frigomancer are made very unattractive due to this foible and the same applies for when it's time to scavenge.\n\nScavenging is a necessary evil early on when your tribe lacks the resources required to physically pass into the next Region. By discarding a Survivor card, players run the risk of gaining Fatigue or killing the Survivor (!) for a chance at discovering Food, Materials, or other Survivors. These random draws can be of critical importance and yet Fatigue or fatalities can quickly pile up before you have a chance to really get going. When you consider that Regions and Ideas are also randomly generated, it only makes sense to continue harder games when the first round conditions are beneficial. In short: you can expect to be pressing the 'Restart' button a lot.\n\nMany things are governed by random elements in fact, even down to certain card abilities that have a percentage chance of activating. You can spend time building a Trap, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything tasty is going to fall into it. To a degree this actually makes good thematic sense, but again it's the element of chance here that can make formulating reliable combo chains and other tactics next to impossible. It's this facet of Frost's design that's going to be the most taxing on your patience.\n\nYou lose the game when the Frost timer ticks down from eight to zero, and whilst the timer ticks up every time you travel onwards, it's extremely unlikely that your deck will contain the goods needed to do this consistently. One one hand this makes the game remarkably tense and the designer's unsubtle use of creepy music and jarring screen effects only enhance that tension further. Because of the reliance on randomization, however, Frost is a supremely difficult game to gets to grip with and that hard time only continues to get harder as new cards and scenarios are unlocked.\n\nScenario play is more interesting than the Classic mode as in addition to collecting items or seeking out the Refuge, your scenario character will have goals of their own. The Hunter and The Meditator for example have simple objectives, but some like The Shadow and The Skeptic have quite involved missions with fresh patterns of play. Mixing this up further is the addition of character abilities that give each leader their own unique advantages and play styles.\n\nThe other thing about Scenarios is that they're hard. Really hard. And it's likely that most players' luck and patience will simply run out before they can achieve victory in each one. Part of the problem here once again revolves around the game's inherent randomness.\n\nThe developer has taken care not to label Frost as an actual deck-building game because of the false implication that you're in any way building an engine out of the cards that you collect. Getting the cards you desperately need to make your deck work is a process governed by chance and smoothed over via careful play. You're not so much building a deck as you are managing an ever-changing pool of resources, so there are times when defeat is going to be an inevitable outcome of drawing poorly and falling behind.\n\nWhat's nice though is that Frost's intense difficulty is built up gradually as the player continues to finish games. By the time your card album is complete, you'll have discovered all sorts of new tools including stacked resources, Charisma checks, and as the result of several free updates; cards for Pets and Weather effects. With this breadth of content comes a sharper learning curve, but the on-screen tooltips and instructional blurbs are usually on point in explaining exactly what you need to know about each of the game's symbols.\n\nWhich brings us to Frost's rather wonderful presentation. It's certainly not one for photophobics, mind, but the all-white menus and eerie music do a near perfect job of transporting you into the setting. Also notable is the game's artwork whose roughshod charm resembles the works of Quentin Blake quite nicely. Story threads are limited to whatever awkwardly translated text you see during splash screens, which is a shame, but the overall theme of the \"Frost\" meaning different things to different people is an intriguing one nonetheless.\n\nDespite its light and addictively simple gameplay then, Frost is not really a game for casual players. The real meat is found in the Scenarios and yet the sheer difficulty and trial and error nature of that mode is likely to frustrate those who go in unprepared.\n\nNevertheless, I'm currently finding this to be an equally difficult game to put down. Whether it's my intense fondness of card games or a hidden masochism that's responsible, I've taken great pleasure in exploring the bleak and uncompromising world that Frost represents.\n\n[url=http://www.celjaded.com/review-frost-digital-card-game/]Read the full review at my blog \u00bb[/url]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035874665", "last_played": 1503944779, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_forever": 978}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1503829709, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503829709, "recommendationid": "34526256", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Brutal singleplayer deckbuilder with a unique and beautiful art style. It's really its own beast- it doesn't play like your typical deckbuilder, but has its own ebb and flow that I find very satisfying.\n\nHere's the basic game flow- you start with a handful of food and wood, and a couple survivors. You use your survivors to gain more resources, which you'll need to gain idea cards and to pass the area. Ideas are extremely useful and give you better access to resources, thin your deck, or remove negative cards. On the other hand, you only have a limited amount of time total to bypass a certain number of areas, so you can't usually dawdle around and just build a lot of ideas. But if you don't build enough ideas, then you'll be doomed when a particularly difficult area arises. \n\nEach area also has an encounter- sometimes friendly, sometimes not. Not all encounters are difficult, but they always throw a wrinkle in your plan.\n\nYou're always pushed forwards, but additional ideas are unlocked for each turn you stay in an area. It's often a difficult decision- do I stall for a turn or two to gain an excellent card, or do I forge onwards and hope it doesn't matter? The right choice isn't always obvious for a couple of areas, so learning what sorts of threats are likely to be ahead of you matters.\n\nAdditionally, more interesting cards and obstacles and areas are unlocked as you play.
