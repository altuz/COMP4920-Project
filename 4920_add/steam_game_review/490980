Feels like it is a boardgame\n2. Atmosphere created by blurry low ress images and sounds is great\n3. Very new and fresh concept along videogames\n-\n1. No tutorial - painfull learning curve not suited for everyone.\n2. You are not an editor, you send out people on quests A. fighting enemies B. overcoming obstacles C.investigating cases. \n3.

Otherwise not recomended.\nGiving it thums up just because 3\u20ac is suitable price for this game (around 3,99\u20ac was a normal undiscounted price when I bought it).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198014544594", "last_played": 1504699664, "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 93, "playtime_forever": 375}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504700343, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505244", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506374112, "recommendationid": "34774419", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Once you get the hang of it, prepare to be thrilled.
