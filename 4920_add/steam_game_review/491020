Don't say this often but pass on this one. Unless your a huge fan of the genre and it's on a serious discout. Or in a bundle. Or free. You get the idea. The controls are wonky to start. Where you click, might not be where the game thinks you should click for starters. There's puzzles where you have to grab and move things that don't work well. Like really bad collision detection and hit boxes. Then there's the whole thing with activiating the bonus episode. Trust me the least said the better. On top of all that the game just kinda of sucks as HOG goes.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972999224", "last_played": 1496186512, "num_reviews": 78, "num_games_owned": 2463, "playtime_forever": 342}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1496186727, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503377", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496186727, "recommendationid": "32073897", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
