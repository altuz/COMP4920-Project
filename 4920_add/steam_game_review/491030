Right from the beggining the difficulty is high, but unlike a game like Super Meat Boy the controls are not good enough to make it feel like it was your fault. The game lacks dynamic jumping, so if you hold or tap jump it will always go full force. This would work if it were a mechanic, but there are a lot of timed jumps i would want it for. The aestetic of the first castle seems like what would be a final world, but instead of working it into the story there isn't a story in the first place. The idea of playing as a chair would be somewhat funny as an unlockable costume, but starting the game off as an animationless chair combined with the lack of story makes emotional investment impossible. Fall damage in a 2d platformer could... ok that one  never really works. I could go on, but in short there is no charm. I don't feel an attatchment to the chair, the character changing makes that even harder, there is no story to tie them together. It is in early access, but it seems this is just to add more levels instead of changing the gameplay to fix these mistakes. But hey, it's cheap, and the graphics and music are not too bad.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065038013", "last_played": 1470715681, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_forever": 9}, "votes_up": 31, "timestamp_created": 1468616296, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548868", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1468616296, "recommendationid": "24341407", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "An interesting game with the worst hitboxes of all time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006057736", "last_played": 1494243707, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 412, "playtime_forever": 762}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1476036198, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494752", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1476036198, "recommendationid": "25952648", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A quirky game with a horrible, disgusting hitboxes in the whole gaming industry.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198073045017", "last_played": 1484308860, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 188, "playtime_forever": 58}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1484309084, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503248", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1484786088, "recommendationid": "29222186", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "good game, bad hit boxes", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198133198347", "last_played": 1479525863, "num_reviews": 49, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_forever": 104}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1478326377, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485566", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1478326377, "recommendationid": "26429470", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "only  hadcore  and plaese go russian lounge))))", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198263255215", "last_played": 1470494139, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_forever": 47}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1468336048, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477748", "votes_down": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1468336048, "recommendationid": "24276089", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[h1] Difficulty [/h1]\n\nThe game ain't that bad, the game just gets very hard very fast, from big hit boxes, to no check-points on long levels.\nOther than that, the game has a cool looking art style.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198138132744", "last_played": 1499077171, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 112, "playtime_forever": 230}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1497964113, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497964113, "recommendationid": "32591783", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
