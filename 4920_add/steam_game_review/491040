The game feels, sounds and looks great. \n\nThe game can seem simple, but there are a lot of mechanics and the devs knew how to use them smartly. I found the normal difficulty to be just fine, with a few levels (especially the last boss) requiring \"a few\" retries. In the time it took me to finish the main story (~2 hours), even during those harder levels, I never felt like a death was the game's fault.\n\nThe game makes you want to try hard mode and all stages with all hearts (plus, there are extra missions!). This might be too much for me, but I'll try just because this game's fun to play, no doubt about that.\n\nAlso from what I've seen devs are awesome so I can't recommend supporting them enough.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 153, "steamid": "76561197968298287", "last_played": 1506373457, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 238, "playtime_forever": 178}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506360744, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505322", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506360744, "recommendationid": "35207289", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "i dont typically write reviews for games, but whenever I see game made by basically one person that is this fun, I gotta give em props. I am a sucker for old school games, But I hate people who think nostalgia alone is enough to act as a hook. That is not the case with Bot vice. The game does a good job of making fun of old school games and the corny stories that they follow, while also making the game adicting and fun! If you make a light parody/homage type game, this is the way to do it.\n\nNext off lets talk about the game play. This game does a great job of establishing all of the controls and power ups from the very beginning as well as the maneuvers. The controls are simple and tight and the game plays like a cross between Sin and Punishment, and  Wild Guns (not a bad combination at all!). My only real gripe is that I wish that there were more guns ! I don't need like 20+ but maybe 3-4 more would do it for me. \n\nMoving on I will cover  the games look and design. I love the variety of bot designs and bosses, They are nicely animated and have a vibrant appeal to them. The baddies also have an array of attack styles that make you have to adapt accordingly, usually by waiting for an opening (Snake bot I'm looking at you!) The satges also are beautifuly designed! each of the stages look unique and have interesting gimicks that can add to the mayhem, such as trains ramming through the stages, armored trucks launching bombs every where.or even Robot trash bugs chasing  you out of trash cans! \n\nMy final talking point is music. I love video game music and music and general so For me a games soundtrack appeal is crucial to my desire to want to play a game. I believe that A games soundtrack should enhchance and support the overall game. This game nails it! I love the Megaman and TMNT esque soundtrack that this game delivers! the 80's and 90's synth fit the homage style and each stage has it;s own theme! No reused songs except for the bosses at the end of the main levels, but each boss specific stage has their own high octane but kickin background theme! I only wish that the Music was dlc :D\n\nMy only real gripes are that I wish there was more guns , that there were a co op, and that the game innovated a little buit more in establishing its own Identity. but judging by the ending, I am sure we will see more from the creators one day! and I look forward to it! Get this game if you like frantic high octane shootouts and a cast of corny quote spewing enemies with laughable voices!  For a Arcade game 8/10\n\nAlso when you beat the game be sure to check out the extras, because the fun truly begins there ;)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 150, "steamid": "76561198055230426", "last_played": 1506612329, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 349, "playtime_forever": 264}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506297201, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502862", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506612433, "recommendationid": "35193093", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Super fun game.
