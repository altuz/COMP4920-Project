It's really fun!\n\nPros:\n1. Great graphics\n2. Fun gameplay\n3. Easy to pick up and play\n4. Challenge ramps up in a fair way.\n\nCons:\n1. No custom controls.  I want \"X\" for attack, and \"A\" for jump.  Not included.\n2. Xbox Controller isn't fully recognized.  The shoulder buttons do not work, and the start button doesn't work, either.\n3. No ultra wide screen support.\n\nFor the price you pay, it's definitely worth it, but I think the controls need some fixing.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198022657661", "last_played": 1503725624, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_forever": 26}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1477599090, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504198", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1477599090, "recommendationid": "26250789", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Sidescroller-2d-pixelart jump-n-run brawler with 1to3-star-level-rating replayability plus \"get the bag next time if you didnt got it the first run through\".\n\nWhat a lovely game!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198253511863", "last_played": 1478746058, "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 182, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1478746872, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490601", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1478746872, "recommendationid": "26512568", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
