Now through this game you will encounter skeletons of varying types depicted by their running different speeds, different helmets for armor, and different sizes. So far I have encountered 5 different enemy types and I have been led to believe that\u2019s all there is. Now as you kill skeletons you earn gold which will allow you to purchase upgrades in between levels. You are able to purchase upgrades like more ammo before you have to reload, more and different weapons if you are able to earn enough gold etcetera. In addition to that you can also purchase upgrades for your tower which add defenders and increase it\u2019s health. All very Mobile device-esque. All that seems to be missing here are microtransactions.....\n\n...The game just really doesn\u2019t have much going for it. On the 4th wave the game goes through a fairly predictable major difficulty spike which one typically sees in mobile games where microtransactions or cooldown timers are involved. And I would fully expect these microtransactions to be fully in-place in the iOS App Store. However, beings they are missing from the PC port, all you are left with is a fairly expected progression system to a nearly impossible difficulty level to which you will have to play the level absolutely flawlessly and purchase exactly the right upgrades.\"\n\nThis game has nothing to offer anyone except casual players and is best left to the mobile platform where it belongs.\n\nSee my full critique here:\nhttps://youtu.be/xEd8rkUIjbs", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030863487", "last_played": 1466401149, "num_reviews": 174, "num_games_owned": 427, "playtime_forever": 126}, "votes_up": 26, "timestamp_created": 1466404619, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526322", "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1466404619, "recommendationid": "23664466", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "For 1.99 it's a great time waster and pretty fun.
