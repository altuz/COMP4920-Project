It leads to some boring puzzles that invlove more observation than contemplation.

Or because you couldn't see a pillar you had to activate until the second attempt.\n2.Deaths feel cheap and unnecessary. The games deaths are normally because of the aforementioned purely observational puzzles. It is not \"well I messed up that.\" it is \"Why was that necessary to the puzzle?\".\n3.The game has a toggle crouch and a minimalist style. I don't know about you, but those two things do not match well for me if there is no indicator.

[i]Red Trigger[/i]'s most obvious influence is [i]Portal[/i], from which developer Maxime V\u00e9zina seems to have taken a liking to sterile white corridors as a form of minimalistic art direction, which would be fine if the way 'white corridors' had been accomplished weren't simply solid blocks of untextured white.

The thing that really stops [i]Red Trigger[/i] from finding it's feet is just how purely unoriginal it is.

Had it contained at least one original mechanic or exciting gameplay feature it may have at least held [i]some[/i] value.

So I guess it's also friendly for people who are color-blind...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009822540", "last_played": 1488194300, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1488194493, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1488194493, "recommendationid": "30217585", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is like Portal meets Tron; a fun, challenging, unique, plain and simple FPS puzzle game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197979020702", "last_played": 1489612787, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 33, "playtime_forever": 236}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1486164256, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1488420174, "recommendationid": "29680229", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "fun.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198263169580", "last_played": 1468256701, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 10, "playtime_forever": 60}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1488315254, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1488315254, "recommendationid": "30248076", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "First off the game is a lot of fun and also similar to the Portal games, it really tests your knowledge of your surroundings and using things around to get from place to place.
