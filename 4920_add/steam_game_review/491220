On one hand, it has a really great strange style, that can remind you a bit of Machinarium, but is, at the same time, distinctly Chinese. It looks and sounds interestingly and it's weird surreal story with little comic book cutscenes between chapters are extremely charming. But then, there are puzzles. Which start as something interesting and fun, but later devolves really heavily into advanced math knowledge, references to movies and things that you might not know and will have to search and committing other \"game design sins\" of puzzle making.\n\nWhich, in the end, really killed the game for me. I went about halfway without even considering to use a walkthrough, but using internet for help, because getting a set number out of a formula of 4 other set numbers is not a task I can solve on my own. But then had to almost exclusively play with the walkthrough in the later parts of the game, apart from some more obvious and not too obscure puzzles. It's charming, it's bizarre, it has all the potential to be amazing, but unless you are into the same things the creator of this game was, I don't think you'll enjoy this journey.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989807190", "last_played": 1502033359, "num_reviews": 112, "num_games_owned": 1511, "playtime_forever": 107}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502151901, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502151901, "recommendationid": "34092461", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
