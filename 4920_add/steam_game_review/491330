For a classic path-based time management game, it worked wonders. The game itself sticks to a set storyline throghout, with themes in every level and cutscenes to match. The whole dynamic suits the story, and the theme of the game - with each level providing a structured and stratified way about playing while still sticking to the key themes. The game itself flows really nicely, with progressions of difficilty and a simple GUI to not overcmpliate things. Some levels are challenging to complete in good time but that ads to the difficulty of the game - to achieve all achievements it took a fair few hours, and as an expirieced time management game player I can tell you that this was definitely worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed every momnent, achieving the harder achivements involving thieves and developers records was fun and rewarding and the final moment when you achieve them all is simply so satisfying its unbelieveable. I really enjoyed this game, and for 40p how could you say no?", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198108114994", "last_played": 1495306464, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_forever": 1346}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1495307174, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506611", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1495307174, "recommendationid": "31867104", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Strategy clicker. Nice casual game, can be finished in a couple of hours, but you can also make it challenging and replay it to get all the achievements. It's part of a series of pretty much the same games, the first 5 at least are very similar.\nOverall fun and enjoyable, well worth the money.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198101756699", "last_played": 1498568402, "num_reviews": 37, "num_games_owned": 540, "playtime_forever": 1146}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1498557063, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506547", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1498557215, "recommendationid": "32848833", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's a Time based Management game with the story about Hercules. Where Hercules needs to save the children from being used as child soldiers by Ares, save the children, stop Ares.\n\nI can highly recommend this game for some nice casual puzzling and relaxing.\nNice to play for a quick game but easily to get sucked into playing more!\nEach Chapter has 10missions and each Chapter starts with a Voiced cinematic intro.\nEvery mission will have 1puzzle piece to find. With all pieces found in a chapter the bonus level will unlock.\nYou can get all achievements aswell within 19 hours, the beating all levels on gold take some more time. \nIt also has a level guide, telling you the optimal way of clearing the level. Bad thing is its still there on the hardest difficulty. And i think it should be for easy/normal mode only.\n\nPro's:\n- Great Time Management game\n- Hercules theme\n- Voiced Cinematics\n- Great Audio\n- Puzzle pieces unlocking bonus level\n- Level guide for easy/ normal its oke\n\n\nCons:\n- No bossfights/minigames\n- Level guide for hard, should not be there. Go play easy/normal!\n\nGreat price aswell i really loved them up to 5 and including 5.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198008038210", "last_played": 1492117135, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 509, "playtime_forever": 1123}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499096292, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499096292, "recommendationid": "33189050", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
