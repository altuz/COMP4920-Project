If I had to give a brief flow of my discovery + playthrough of this game so far, it'd be this:\n1) \"Oh wow, the guy who voices the dragon is British. This has to be good! Playing games where the narrators are that way is always fun!\"\n1a) -buy game-\n1b) -launch game-\n2) -do tutorial, play for a bit, about halfway to the pass-\n3) killing people\n3a) a guy farts\n3b) laugh way too hard for way too long.\n3b-a) reflect upon why laughing so hard at that may have been rather immature\n4) make it to pass\n5) ADD kicks in, exit game due to desire to do something else\n5a) get mad at myself for leaving the game after 15 minutes. I need a longer attention span, this is going to be the end of me\n6) write this review\n\n\nAs for a true in-detail review for those looking for points as to why or why not to buy this game, I'd say the game is worth it if you're looking for a simple passtime for something filled with comedy that's so bad it ends up being \"cheesy enjoyable\" and it's just awesome.\n\nWhy would I recommend this game?\n - Really simple, fun game to play during your freetime\n - From what I can tell, the map is huge\n - Really, really stupid humor that ends up being tolerable and funny ([i]comedy that's so bad it ends up being \"cheesy enjoyable\"[/i])\n\nWhy would I not recommend this game?\n - If you dislike simplistic, single-purpose titles (the point of this game is to burn houses and people. Nothing else you can do, from what I can tell so far) this game may not be enjoyable for you.\n - A bit repetitive at the start of the game. That said, this may be false - I haven't played much. (That means you can disregard this as an official point right now)\n\nI do have some personal dislikes:\n - No manual zoom. While I know first person wouldn't really work for this title, I'd at least like to be able to zoom in or out.\n - (Minor) Billboard GUI characters. These are the kind of characters you see in old titles like DOOM where they are just images. This game does try to be a bit intuitive and has a lot of angles for all characters rather than only having a front sprite. This is just personal preference, again. I know people who really love this style and I don't think it's a bad thing at all for this game to have it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197999855219", "last_played": 1499832835, "num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1499755743, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507735", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499755828, "recommendationid": "33449369", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
