However the game is very unpolished and has more than a few flaws. For example it is possible to get stuck by an enemy teleporting you on the first floor with no possible way to move. If this game still had some support or a community that could give guidance I would say this game is definitely worth it. Sadly it does not, so I'm going to have to say this game is a pass, even with it's neat concepts.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198036171707", "last_played": 1497237496, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 261, "playtime_forever": 1573}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1496947920, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518992", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496947920, "recommendationid": "32272363", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
