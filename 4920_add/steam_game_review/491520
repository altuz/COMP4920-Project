But nope. Too many problems for me to really enjoy it.\nThe controls are a bit odd but would work okay in theory. One of the trackpads lets you move up, down, left and right relative to where you're looking, and the triggers move you forward or backwards relative to where you're looking. The game consists of struggling with these controls in order to try and get through the hoops. Your controls seem to have to little influence that it's just kind of frustrating. It gets even worse if you hit one of those damn yellow boost cans. Doing this blasts you off in a direction that you have no control of, and trying to influence the course of your boost seems to do nothing.\nI couldn't tell the difference between simple and hard mode. Really. They seemed exactly the same. The levels were all fairly repetitive and a little boring. On both modes I got stuck and gave up on a level which draws you into the wall of the thing you start in, making it impossible to get out until a seemingly arbitrary amount of time has passed when it's then possible to awkwardly make your way out to find the station you need to get to quickly flying away. There is one boost can, but once you've gone out of your way to get that the station is well long gone. It seems impossible to catch up to either if you go for the boost or not.\nSpeaking of levels, there doesn't seem to be any level select, so you have to do the whole game in one go or start from the beginning as far as I can tell. There also appears to be no options menu, which is a problem since this means you can't turn of the naff soundtrack. There are 2 songs I seem to remember, one of which is particularly obnoxious.\nAlso, each level begins with a confusing cut-scene? It just serves to disorient the player really but they can be skipped with the grip buttons. Also each level ends with 2 confusing cuts, which isn't very nice.\nSo yeah, don't waste your time.

Instead this \"arcade\" game employ friction causing you to (mysteriously) slow down forcing you continuously thrust,\n2) On realising thrust was... \"arcade-y\", I quickly figured the counter on the controllers wasn't a fuel gauge but a timer making this basically a sort-of 3D racing game. Which should have been given away by... \n3) The equally arcade-y music.\n\nSo fine, this is actually just a space-themed, arcade-realistic, 3D racing game, As for the VR? It's OK.

You fly to in whatever direction you're head is facing with forward and back thrusters on the Vive controller triggers. The left controller will allow you to raise or lower yourself and \"strafe\" left or right. The game will give you rings to fly through but I'm not sure if it's even necessary to go through them before heading to the airlock. The spacestation you head towards can also be moving a high speeds, high enough to where if you missed it, you can't gain enough speed to make it back and you fail the mission after burning all your fuel.\n\nFailing the mission causes you to rewatch the intro cutscene (all of which are basic and pretty poorly done) and I thought that pressing the top button the Vive would skip it but it seemingly just restarted the cutscene from the beginning so I had to watch it anyway. It's annoying since the cutscenes are the same \"panning scenes of the planet and space station\" type deal since mission 1.\n\nVisuals are decent enough but don't have their own style to set it aside from many other space themed titles and the most that changes are the backgrounds. I will compliment the audio though, the soundtrack has a 80s vibe to it but I don't really know if bouncey synth themes fit with the dark visuals.\n\nIt's hard to not recommend the game since it's so cheap but there really isn't much here and the novelty wears out pretty fast. Flying from point A to point B with nothing in between to do isn't fun and that's all you'll be doing. I'm a sucker for space themed stuff but I don't even think I'll give this another go.\n\nUpdate: Shortly after I posted my review I got a friend request from the developer and they appreciated my review and are reading reviews for ways to fix the game and make it more fun. They also mentioned that this is their first title and really want to give it a good polish. I find this to be absolutely excellent when it comes to connecting with their community and they really seem to really want to make a great product for their consumers.\n\nI changed my review to a recommendation because the developer is keen on addressing issues the community has and making a great product. Entering the game industry is hard, especially a niche one like VR, and this isn't a cheap cash in like many other VR titles and I have faith in the devs to deliver. The game is still definitely rough around the edges, but if their word is to be trusted, there will be a lot to offer in the future.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961725353", "last_played": 1466113391, "num_reviews": 44, "num_games_owned": 550, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1466120311, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501779", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1466214115, "recommendationid": "23605159", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Quite repetative, but not a bad overall pickup game.

The only thing you do in this game is fly through rings. The game does not used the tracked motion controls like it claims, you have to steer yourself by looking in a particular direction and the only thing the controllers are used for as the triggers, which apply thrust. It's certainly not room scale in any way either. The physics in the game make little sense, since there seems to be a lot of drag.\n\nThe game also does a number of things which it shouldn't; for example it forcibly moves the player down a corridor at times (which is painfully jarring), and for some reason it has out-of-body cutscenes at the beginning of levels.\n\nUltimately, it's quite dull.
