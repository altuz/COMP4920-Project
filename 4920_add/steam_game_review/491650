So we can say it looks like an Amiga500 platformer with bad gfx.\n+ Cheap, has cards\n\nNeutral:\n~ A bit short, but hey, it is cheap\n\nCons:\n- Controls! Theyre too cluncky for a platformer.\n- No windowed mode selection. Im ok with retro, i love pixel art but this game hurts my eyes on a 24\" monitor man, come on! C64 or Amiga never had that kind of big screen, this is why it worked at the time.\n\n3/10 And those points are going to the soundtrack and retro art... Its a pity i could have liked it more if it had a windowed mode and better controls.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009654132", "last_played": 1495819871, "num_reviews": 76, "num_games_owned": 1632, "playtime_forever": 186}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1495812722, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504375", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1495812722, "recommendationid": "31975788", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Reset 1-1 has a nice 8-bit feel and good music to go with it.
