It's easy to learn but it helped teach me how to think strategically and consider my opponent's moves in advance.  For a children's game, that's good.  It made learning chess a lot easier.\n\nScreen resolution seems to be limited to 800x600 but it doesn't look too bad, even on a widescreen monitor.  You get a choice or different \"board\" designs, and three difficulties with minor differences between them.  There are default setups but you can move pieces around by swapping them to set up your board the way you like.  You can also choose whether your highest ranked piece is #1 or #9.\n\nThe unfortunate problem with this game is  the computer AI is terribly passive, even on the hardest difficulty.  It won't attack you unless it knows your piece has moved first.  To the computer, every stationary piece is a potential bomb.   The flag tends to end up in one of the two corners, surrounded by bombs.  Standard play when starting out, but when you expect the same thing over and over, charging in with a scout, a miner, and  a high ranking piece makes the game easy.\n\nThe only way this game could have be worth buying is if it included multiplayer.  Since it is not included, I can't recommend it unless you grab it super cheap or in a bundle.  Even if you're a fan of the game, you will grow tired of the computer's weak antics after a few battles.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197986553417", "last_played": 1503971827, "num_reviews": 54, "num_games_owned": 663, "playtime_forever": 57}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503970741, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503971128, "recommendationid": "34566278", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
