If the developer is willing to update the game to fix the issues I listed, this could easily be worth $5.\n\nI'll Update as time goes on.\n\nMy original review :\n\nI can sorta respect what the developer is trying to do here.  You get a nice cheap little shooting range and you can have some fun with it right?  Well, a few glaring problems made me want to get out of this game pretty quickly.\n\nThings I liked about this game: \n[list]\n [*] There's an easy reset button in case you need to restore everything to the default position\n[/list]\n\nWait, that's it?  There was nothing else you liked? \n\nYeah, that's pretty much it.  I sorta liked the monkey you could shoot and the plane, and all the other little things but none of it really added that much to it.  It was more of a distraction from the bad things which I'm going to list here\n\nThings I didn't like:\n[list]\n [*] The scale of the game is all wrong.  it feels like the pistol would be about 2 feet long and 1 to 1.5 feet tall.  Either that or maybe I'm supposed to be a kid that got into the shooting range unsupervised as a warning tale of the dangers of lax gun control?\n [*] The graphics are ridiculously simplistic.  PS1 level graphics without PS1 level gameplay.\n [*] Grabbing the weapons is awkward and you often have to grab it with one hand... pass it off to another and then grab it again with the first hand to sorta get it to where you want it. \n [*] The guns never align with the way they SHOULD.  I feel like I'm holding the gun kinda askew and the trigger feels like it's in the wrong spot.  Contrast this with A-10 VR or Space pirate trainer and you'll see how it's supposed to feel.\n [*] Shooting the targets seems like the scale is off there too.  You see a huge target (I'd estimate it as a circle 4 or 5 feet in diameter) but the actual target you are expected to hit is more like a small circle 1 foot in diameter.\n [*] The gun sounds are horrible  Nothing sounds like you're firing a deadly weapon. They sound instead like you shot a cap pistol.\n [*] they want you to grab the clip and insert it into the gun like you were doing a real reload, and then don't provide you with an accurate way to do that.  You pick up the clip sideways and slap it against the butt of the gun and somehow magically you just reloaded!
