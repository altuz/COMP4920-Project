You have to dodge the obstacles by jumping as well as killing your enemies with the directional arrows ! It can takes some time to get used to the jumping mechanic (the game works well but you have to be rigorous with your inputs, wait for the character to land before pressing the button again and don't hesitate to maintain the jump button to gain some height). You have to get through 6 levels with various abilities (jump, double-jump, dash and gravity switch). The game offers a lot of different modifiers that you have to unlock, tweaking or changing the rules of the game. If you are into runners or challenging games, you could try this one, it's advantegeously priced, you'll have some hours of playtime (and I hope fun) and if you stumble against a glitch or an inconvenience, Khud0 (the developer) will gladly help you out.

Fix clunkiness, control scheme, add gamepad support, and make the letters easier to read (I get it's 8bit, but they're almost impossible to read at speed), and it'd be a pretty good game.

At your consideration I gave your game a second chance and was pleasantly surprised by the changes you had made. Button layout is now very easy to pick up, while difficulty has been toned down. Overall, for its price, I believe you have made a fun, enjoyable game! \n\n\n\nIt is true that this game is hardcore, but that doesn't mean that it is fun. The crowded, awkward button layout combined with the lackluster gameplay really just adds up to a mediocre game. That being said, it seems like the price is so low that you'd be crazy not to at least try it. However, check the time played of the other reviews. Most people don't even play it for more than half an hour. If you want to spend two dollars on something that you won't play for longer than that, then this is the game for you.
