Now I understand you people aren't ones for understanding facts, but the \"right\" to murder your children isn't under attack.  Emperor Trump has only decided to stop funding abortions outside of the continental USA.  Which begs the question, in what sane and logical world would you ever fund abortion programs in other countries? Secondly, the cuckservative position on abortion is rather simple... You can kill babies all you want, but the state and the taxpayer shouldn't be forced to pay for your immoral actions. \n\nNow don't get me wrong, I'm all for supporting a women's freedom of choice and control over their bodies... As long as they aren't consenting to the dissection, and brutal destruction of people that are developing separately from their parent.  With unique DNA structures... Those \"partially\" formed globs of cells that you disgusting wretches refuse to recognize as human life. \n\nNow, back to the freedom and choice of women, if you consider birth rates, about 50% of pregnancies are female. Therefore roughly 50% of abortions ( when you don't consider other social variables ) are performed on female children.  Therefore, one out of every two abortions takes away the rights of a woman. It takes away her right to control her body. It takes away her right to choose anything in the future. It takes away a right more fundamental than the right to choose - the right to not be killed.\n\nNow I know what you're going to say, Women will die of unsafe abortions if we make it illegal.  That's a great argument, and you're a sociopath if that's how you think. Currently, people are dying because of these laws. According to world meters, 3.6 million people have already been terminated through abortions This year alone. Once again I stress my original point regarding COGNITIVE DISSONANCE. Studies show that RU-486 and current abortion practices can cause continued bleeding and infection, coupled with the direct correlation between abortion and suicide, deaths from legal abortions surpass the threat of \"illegal alleyway\" abortions due to both the frequency and availability of your precious murder factories. \n\nNow let me guess you're probably trying to rally around the fact that these young women's lives will be devastated. Great back to the cognitive dissonance. We cannot choose one person's convenience over another person's life you filthy degenerates. \n\nYou are most likely virtue signaling at this point, and you are going to bring up rape and incest which by the way was never a dominant issue, considering how statistically rare the occurrence is. And if rapists typically don't deserve the death penalty then why does the completely innocent child deserve such a fate.  And you're going to revert to psychological well-being which is an invalid argument.  Studies and statistics show Abortion = high suicide rate  / Rape = high suicide rate.  Abortion + rape = Extremely high suicide rate, you catch my drift, you moron? \n\nNow I know people are going to mention this \"it's a fetus, not a human\" Fantastic argument f**k Face. Basic biology states that a species reproduces with its kind.  That \"fetus\" is a gestation stage for a human baby. Using the argument that they are not, in fact, a human, is like saying that a newborn infant isn't a human as it doesn't resemble an adult.  The development of a human being begins as soon as the egg fertilizes.  This fertilized egg, being a cell, immediately starts the process of building a human. That is unless some selfish creature decides they'd rather pass their self around like a F**k doll for another ten years while having no regard for the implications of their actions and decides to visit their local baby butcher. \n\nThe moral of this story is this. Nasa can go looking for single-celled organisms to locate life in the universe, but if that life has the potential to affect your expendable income, it should be destroyed. \n\nOr if you are looking for a unique way to become a hero to the pro-choice movement what better way to do it than to have an abortion entirely filmed in a 3-D medium and be the first person to project your broken, and degenerate world view into the VR platform. It's groundbreaking, unfortunately...\n\n - SOMEONE FUCKING DIED TO CREATE THIS EXPERIENCE\n\nAnd finally a message to the stars of our show: \n\nF**k you, you don't deserve to procreate.  And with that said, if you have no desire to pass on your genetic code and adequately invest in the prosperity of the next generation. Then you should have no god damn say in the governance of society as you have no stock in the future.  So, get out of our way, we have a better world to build for our children, you don't matter.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961795093", "last_played": 1485996848, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 225, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 94, "timestamp_created": 1485999418, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.349998", "votes_down": 276, "timestamp_updated": 1486008772, "recommendationid": "29639831", "votes_funny": 17, "voted_up": false}]}
