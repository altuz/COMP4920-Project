I would love for there to be some music when in the UI, more maps available and for the game to be brighter in general.\n\nHowever, as I say, for the price of the game, it is very well done and offers a lot more than something like an app of which costs the same amount! \n\nI've recorded a video of me playing the game if you would like a feel of of how it plays.

Oh you can play with mouse and keyboard and that works better , but its not the same. If you liked Buck Bumble as I did.. give this a try. Its a imaginative little game with decent graphics , just needs decent xbox controller key bindings where you can fire without taking a hand off the controller.\n\nI`ll conclude...
