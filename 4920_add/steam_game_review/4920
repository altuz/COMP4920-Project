There are many arguments why you should not buy it, so for the sake of clarity I will display them in a list:\n\n- Matchmaking is nonexistent, which means you will be constantly running into championship winners going 50-2 and destroying any hopes you had of having fun. Additionally, you are kicked out of rookie-only servers after passing a certain level threshold, which takes about 3 hours to reach. Surely after those 3 hours you should be dominating the players that played this game for the past 2 years everyday! \n\n- Server rules are enforced by hypocrites, and filled with worthless plugins. The most annoying of them is \"hive skill\" which in 75% of the cases prevents you from playing on a team you want to play on. Want to play Marines? too bad! you need to be on alien team to perfectly balance the game with your 100 skill score. Admins don't give a shit about anything and there are ZERO official servers maintained by devs, which leads to...\n\n- Flaming and toxicity. They are literally outstanding in this game, as a rookie/new player you will constantly find yourself being insulted by man-children, and as I said admins will not even bat an eye. The only method of dealing with them is muting everyone's voicechat. Doing so will surely help you win considering factors mentioned above.\n\n- Censorship is ever-prevalent on the Steam Discussion page of this game. Several of my topics have been removed by moderators just because I tried to warn people not to buy this game. It's filled with fanatics spending thousands of dollars on one studio for whatever reason.\n\n- Optimization of this game is horrible. It's been made in custom engine which shows. For several years after the release only the strongest rigs could handle this game. It's been improved marginally with a lot of options FOR GRAPHICAL SETTINGS. Do not buy this game if you have weak computer, you will be laughed at by a community of retards.\n\nBut wait, you can command in this game, right?! it gotta be cool! WRONG! \n\nTry and jump into a commander seat, I dare you. You will be ejected after ~5 minutes, denying you content and satisfaction. Keep commanding and you will get banned. Banned for trying to enjoy the content you paid for. \n\nHonestly, they should either make it FREE or remove this game entirely. This game could have been good but it's one big ball of FAILURE that nobody is watching over.\n\nALSO IT'S DEAD."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505439933, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500576", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34961706", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198257921842", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505435011, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5552}, "timestamp_updated": 1505439933, "received_for_free": false, "review": "good game, good graphics.

The game was challenging and teamwork was key for success.\n\nNow in 2017 (yes, I'm 5 years late to the party), I gave this NS2 a shot. While the visuals are naturally very improved compared to NS1, the gameplay is similar to its predecessor. While this gameplay type isn't my strong suite, I managed to play before with friends on NS1 and that was the good fun. To my personal taste, I do prefer ARENA type shooters but decided to try this one out. Whether it is 5 years after the release, the gameplay doesn't appeal much to me but might be something you would enjoy.\n\nNatural Selection is not a brainless shooter. It requires strategy and heavy teamwork. That's how it is based upon and you are required to play that way.\n\nAlas for NS2, there seems to be some requirement to play on specific servers... the ones who's got the most players online. So there you go, jump hopping server to server trying to find one that won't kick you out.\n\nThe visuals are still decent now in 2017. There is a good tutorial that explains the basics of the game and that is very welcomed to newcomers.\n\nConclusion: I'd say for newcomers, this game is really unfriendly right now. We are late to the party and most servers just kick you straight out OR you are the primary prey for the opposing team (if you can join that server that is!). Again, this is not my main kind of competitive FPS so that affect my recommendation against it but if you are willing and VERY patient... and maybe find tons of friends, you may get some good fun out of this!\n\nAnother note: Game runs well on my setup and supports ULTRAWIDE Monitors without any hiccup. This is handy when in commander mode."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506096854, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497774", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35131654", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198076363887", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506235624, "num_games_owned": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 917, "playtime_forever": 2209}, "timestamp_updated": 1506096854, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game highly suggest to buy"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506383168, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498119", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35212639", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061505801", "num_reviews": 108, "last_played": 1413486151, "num_games_owned": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 434}, "timestamp_updated": 1506383168, "received_for_free": false, "review": "fun but dead"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506746454, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499761", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35322919", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197980288911", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506745363, "num_games_owned": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2250, "playtime_forever": 7879}, "timestamp_updated": 1506795346, "received_for_free": false, "review": "One of the most dynamic fps combat experiences I've enjoyed, but hesitantly recommend this game. This is because it has a steep learning curve and many in the community don't comprehend this, because they only play NS2 and consider its complexities second nature and therefore have very little tolerance for players that make mistakes. That being said, the game does have mechanics for reserved server slots and ability to eject inexperienced commanders, but in most cases the new commander is met with beratement rather than constructive criticism prior to being ejected. When a player makes a mistake it's best not to treat them like they are retarded, or to berate them without politely requesting they take a particular action in the game first. Also the passive aggressive talking about other players on one's microphone about their playing ability as if it's a popular subject to demean other people is a very common in this game.

Safety in numbers.\n\nThe aliens are bit more complex in that the base alien is melee oriented, with several evolutions to branch into, ranging from bat like creatures that shoot at people, to giant rhino like beasts that trash everything. \n\nWhat I haven't mentioned yet is the RTS style gameplay of the commander role. The commander issues orders to the real people of the marines and the aliens to take and protect resources in order to buy upgrades and build fortifications. A half decent commander is hard to find, but its worth noting that a bot commander gives you HP or ammo immediately no questions asked, so there's almost room for every player to just know enough to push the supply lines along by building stuff, and then getting out so the AI can give field aid faster than a human. A high quality human command will probably always be best though, so if you find a cool commander, consider befriending them, because they would probably appreciate a coopartive foot soldier. \n\n No matter what roll you choose, there is quite a lot to know and understand about the mechanics of the game, so if the playable tutorial provided aren't your thing, I'll bet there's some \"What you should know before starting Nat S 2\" videos on YT. \n\nI'll admit I played this more on my friends acct/rig because the graphics were better, but the servers are still impressively active considering how long this game has been out, and I think that attests the most to how fun Natural Selection 2 is, wish I had more homies who played it. \n\nHope my edits have made this review more helpful!"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505682868, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494827", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35033314", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197966463890", "num_reviews": 131, "last_played": 1355731200, "num_games_owned": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 407}, "timestamp_updated": 1505682868, "received_for_free": false, "review": "An underappreciated classic in asymmetric fps team games"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505618929, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495616", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35013090", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197967101452", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506963020, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 151, "playtime_forever": 44515}, "timestamp_updated": 1505618929, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Best Pterodactyl Flight Simulator. 10/10 Would buy again"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506611730, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498930", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35264290", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198104540256", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1506745019, "num_games_owned": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 36, "playtime_forever": 1396}, "timestamp_updated": 1506611730, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Juego entretenido, lastima que en ocaciones sea desvalanceado por tener un buen o mal capitan que administra los recursos."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506562377, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498762", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35252572", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198254863364", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1493258775, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2334}, "timestamp_updated": 1506562419, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The player base is basically dead."}]}
