Quest creation is simple but very flexible.\n\n I would like to be able to reward the player with items directly from the quest giver as well as the key reward but I love the fact you can fill a building with a with treasure and then specify the key that unlocks it from the quest giver without having to create each individual door. Everything in that building is automatically grouped so you can move the building at will and everything inside moves with it. \n\nI would like the ability to lock the objects so you don't acidentally move the buildings around which happened to me a few times.\n\nCreating a quest is done completly from the NPC which I really appreciate. It's very easy to create challenging quests quickly.\n\nCreating the atmosphere or biome is similar to disney infinity you choose the skybox and that creates the mood for the world.\n\nThe character creator allows you to create NPC's and opponents.\nyou can shape the terrain and also create impressive landscapes by combining preset mountains and landmasses.\n\nOverall it's heading in the right direction as far as simplicity which is no suprise since this is from the same publisher of game guru and FPS Creator another excellent tool.\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nB1trider", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 207, "steamid": "76561198055572010", "last_played": 1507136975, "num_reviews": 32, "num_games_owned": 226, "playtime_forever": 221}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1507099883, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507099883, "recommendationid": "35464808", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Combat feels very Dark souls-ey but occasionally has some hiccups. The sandbox editor is great.
