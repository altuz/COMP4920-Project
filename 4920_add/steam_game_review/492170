Even at its normal price! \n\nIf you enjoy clearing blocks, harvesting, accumulating things for $2.00 you will get your moneys worth in my opinion. Sure its simple, maybe it is cloned from somewhere but honestly what is truly unique these days? Everything is cloned from something! \n\nThere is currently one type of game mode to play where you can dig down to 1000m. The developer replied in the discussions that Endless & Timed were coming, and possibly a fourth based on the poster's suggestion. \n\nThe basics are collecting up to 16 & a ? resource with your ship and sell for currency to buy buffs and upgrades. There are two other ships, three buffs, and four categories of ship components with four upgrades each. \n\nBuffs: [list]\n[*]A beacon to teleport you to the top. \n[*]Explosives that destroy multiple blocks including lava instead of hurting your ship by digging it. \n[*]Insurance that spawns you a new ship instead of ending the game. \n[/list]\n\nShip upgrades: [list]\n[*]Drill: Speed your ship can destroy/collect the blocks. \n[*]Hull: HP, or amount of dmg you can take. Two lava blocks in a row with max will almost kill you.\n[*]Fuel: If you can't reach the top to refuel you explode.\n[*]Storage: How much you can carry before you need to head up to sell.\n[/list]\nIt's also worth mentioning... \n\nThere is an option to use a Teleporter to save your game progress so you don't have to start a new game every time. Making it a very casual thing you can just open up and destroy some things and then close if time is limited. \n\nIf you are a completionist, this takes less than 2 hours to 100% in its current state.
