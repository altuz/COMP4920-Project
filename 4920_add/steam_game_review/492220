A nice variety of options and it doesn't hold your hand when you're doing something stupid, like contradicting sworn testimony from others. I thought that the framework of the game was very well done, it flows and rewards intelligence and planning.\n\nHowever the implementation is frustrating. The graphics are subpar and the opening murder scene has some atrocious character models. While I enjoyed being left to my own devices in how I crafted my alibi for the night, it would have been nice to have some cues as to who I am framing and why certain actions will lead to framing certain people. Also, part of the case relies on how much the judge trusts you and while you get a note implying that his trust level has changed you don't know whether his trust goes up or down. \n\nOverall- worth a play through if you like novel games and are prepared to work through some rough edges but probably not worth the replay for all the endings.\n\nLast point- bonus for the scene when you quit saying court is ajourned for the day.
