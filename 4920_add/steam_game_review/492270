The Cat! Porfirio's Adventure is a platform game for kids... which is cute.\nYou are Porfirio, a city cat who visits country cats and you have to prove that city cats are no worse than the other.\nThe game contains 2 hours of gameplay in average during which you have to participate in races, looking for fish and herbs or escape from dogs, wolves and boars. There's a quite nice bright graphics and sweet-looking environment.\nPorfirio jumps high and is quite fast, but he surely has some problems with balance and climbing. But he's nice. He's a cat after all. And there are few more cats. Friendly cats. Yes.\n\nSo... if you are looking for some game for a young kid, this one should do. If you are looking for a short game to rest with, and moreover you like cats, you should be satisfied. Especially if you bought it on sale. But still the price to the amount of content is alright.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198048735141", "last_played": 1505734486, "num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 1154, "playtime_forever": 144}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505758961, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502054", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505758961, "recommendationid": "35050514", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
