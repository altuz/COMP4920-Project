The decisions are more \u201caesthetic\u201d than anything else and are more a means to get more information and immerse oneself better in the world of this game. This is what they call a \u201ckinetic novel\u201d where the story is linear. There is gameplay though, in the form of an image puzzle game. The story revolves around a young man named Jack Beckwith, who joins a detective agency in the capital of the fictional nation he lives in.\n \nOk, so the facts are done, on to the review.\n\nStory \n\nWhen you\u2019re doing this type of game, your story better be damn awesome. In that respect the game passes with flying colors! The writing is solid and the dialogue is very stylistic towards Victorian speech that really helps towards immersion. There is a whole and fully fleshed out fictional world that one can believe the characters live in. The characters themselves feel rounded and real and the mystery plotline that caries the game is intriguing.\n\nArt\n\nThe sprites aren\u2019t very good, perhaps the greatest failing of this game. The backgrounds on the other hand, are excellent and very stylistic. The general steampunk style behind the UI is very satisfying and should please even the most hardcore steampunk fan.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music was very appropriate towards the feel and the style of the novel.  The melodies were nice and complemented the storyline and general emotions behind the piece.\n\nMinigame\n\nThe VN has a minigame where you put a scrambled image together. It can get a bit tedious and repetitive at times but were in themselves generally harmless.  Some of the images chosen were (perhaps purposefully chosen to be ) quite difficult due to the strangeness of the images (you\u2019ll see when you play it yourself).\n\nDuration\n\nThe game isn\u2019t what they call long and given you\u2019re not someone who does a lot of these image jigsaw puzzle things in their free time they may take a bit of time. The game has these nice little cutscenes, which also add to the duration, but all in all I\u2019d say the game should take the average player around 2 hours. It ends with a cliffhanger, unsurprisingly\n\nOverall\n\nI liked it. It\u2019s not the best Visual Novel in the world but it\u2019s certainly not the worst. I enjoyed the 2 hours entertainment it gave me and am looking forward to seeing chapter 2.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198233532424", "last_played": 1469266137, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 63, "playtime_forever": 377}, "votes_up": 29, "timestamp_created": 1468448909, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533686", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1468448909, "recommendationid": "24304425", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A really short VN with a few puzzles.
