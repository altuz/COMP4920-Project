You control 3 Heroes with different characteristics and you kill enemies that come in 3 lanes with attacks and spells, as seen on the screenshots in the store page. This may seem simplistic but it isn't. On the way to the final boss you navigate the map where you can go to several locations and meet various merchants (Spell and Items and buy what they sell), Treasure Chests, Altars etc, strengthening your Heroes.\n\nAs far as difficulty is concerned, other reviews vastly overstate the effects that RNG plays. Roguelikes need to balance RNG with deterministic outcomes and this game does it sufficiently well. While at first i thought the game was poorly designed after understanding the game mechanics i realised that it is actually very well designed. RNG dictates which items and spells will be sold to you, what kind of enemies will appear in combat stages and to a constrained degree the amount of damage your Heroes deal. This manages to keep the game fresh as each playthrough feels different from the last. I played about 50 hours before i felt saturation. That is more than AAA games manage to achieve. \n\nProgression wise, when a game is over, either Victory or Defeat, new items and spells are unlocked. At Victory a new Hero is unlocked and after you unlock all the basic Heroes you can try to unlock their other skins by beating the game and opening the final chest with that Hero. The new Hero skins usually have more powerfull stats than the previous ones and a different starting spell. That gives each subsequent playthrough greater variety.\n\nThe strategic element appears in the positioning of you Heroes (you can switch them around every time one finishes a melee combo), the timing of your spell usage, which Hero picks which item, which Hero attacks which enemy and so on.\n\nFor achievement Hunters: This game will take about 100+ hours for 100% completion.\n\nSome hints for the game: \nGive the +% increased critical hit chance items to the Rogue, the +% increased melee damage to the Warrior and the +% decreased spell cooldown items to the Mage. The +10 melee damage items go for a case by case choice. \nTry to at least get Fire Immunity to all 3 of your Heroes (the Pill items do that, like Red Pill and Blue Pill). If you can get Fire and Poison Immunity you will usually be set to win.\nDon't swap the Heroes with drag and drop like the tutorial suggests. Instead use the mouse wheel. Trust me it is far far better that way and less strenuous for the fingers.\nWhen 1 of the Orbs fills with souls of defeated enemies, use it immediately so the Orb empties and new souls can refill it (I mean immediately, like pause with right click and cast a spell even while souls are flying towards the Orb. If the Orb is full the souls trying to enter it will go to waste. DON'T let that happen)\n\nI fully recommend this game but advise you to check the guide section to see some mechanics because the tutorial is a little thin on info.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198048989747", "last_played": 1504698156, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 144, "playtime_forever": 11295}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1504954469, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532202", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1504974897, "recommendationid": "34834522", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}]}
