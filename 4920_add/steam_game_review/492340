During a tournament there is no option to change formation, so you have to play with the default formation that is set for each team. \n\nThe arcade look is nice, and the style could be nice too. However, the mechanics are very flawed and easy to work out. Perhaps unsurpisingly, in easy mode you can dribble, pass, shoot and do whatever you want without your opponent ever interfering. I won the european championship with the weakest team, Albania. A nice way to get into the game.\n\nPlaying at a higher level of difficulty should be fun. Opponents should mark closer, pass better, shoot at your goal more often...bring it! It's just...it suddenly feels like there is nothing I can do to stop the opponent. This is because it's now impossible to choose which of my players I want to control: In normal or hard mode, the game will decide wether it wants to let me switch between players and if so, when. This means I can almost never select a player that is near the ball (or not in time) and the cpu team can just cruise towards my goal while my players are M.I.A.\n\nThe game already has only two buttons to control your players kicks and tackles, but with one becoming completely useless on the higher difficulty settings, the game becomes even more predictable. Forget about switching between players and short passing, all I found myself doing was pounding the kick button, making my players belt it upfield all the time and challenge for aerial battles everywhere. \n\nThis would actually stop an opposition attack every once in a while, but more importantly, allowed me to score at least a couple of highly unlikely goals where overhead kicks from outside the box flying over the daydreaming goalkeeper were no exception. While this don't-let-the-ball-touch-the-grass approach looked very spectaculair, I'd like to think that I'd have a little more control over what happens. I also believe that Panama should not be able to win a tournament playing like this.\n\nThis is a work in progress. I know that. But the developers should seriously consider to postpone the release to december, 2018 to fix the controls, the gameplay and this time, really add everything that makes football fun. If they release it like this, I can only conclude they don't really like football.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198074000575", "last_played": 1505331132, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_forever": 153}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1505333592, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512591", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505333592, "recommendationid": "34926489", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
