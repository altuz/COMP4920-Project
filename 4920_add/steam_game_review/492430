But give the player the means to beat the game fair and square.\n- Controls are slippery: there's some kind of inertia when stopping or changing directions which makes you fail at simplest jumps. Imagine if Super Meat Boy was slipping when trying to stop or switching direction. That's a deadly sin for precision platformers\n- Traps are usually unavoidable unless you die first to know where they are: that's the cheapest way of making a game hard, like jump scares are the cheapest way to make a horror game\n- Levels don't reset when you die, they just continue on the same timeline, which means you can respawn and get killed immediately, or be in a pattern where the elements won't synchronize properly for you to finish the level\n- But the worst part is setting death traps on locations where you have to stand and switch the dimension to find your way to continue the level: you just made it through a hard part of the level and ended up on a safe platform. You're looking for your next moves to continue the level and switch dimension to see where the platforms are in order to prepare your strategy. But BOOM, the platform you're on has a trap in the other dimension! \"HA HA HA, Pwned! Restart the level, sucker!\" Yeah, very funny.
