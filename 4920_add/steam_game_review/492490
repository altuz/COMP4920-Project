While precisely half of the game consists of finding \"hidden\" objects to assemble a \"zombie car\" to escape the city (hey, just like the title!), the other half is a miserable excuse for a first-person zombie-shooter game. Complete one of the object-searching screens - they're not real hard, unless you have an almost game-breaking bug like I had, with a shotgun shell staunchly refusing to be picked up - and your reward is a one-minute point-and-click shooting range of dead'uns which goes from stupidly easy at first to practically impossible by the end.\n\n   What can I say? I gave up, somewhere close to the end as best as I can tell (unless the car was gonna get WINGS).\n\n   The real question is: with a title so suggestive of quality, how could they possibly have gone so wrong?\n\n   Verdict: 3.5/10.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198048974498", "last_played": 1466271771, "num_reviews": 429, "num_games_owned": 1513, "playtime_forever": 38}, "votes_up": 31, "timestamp_created": 1466268481, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526560", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1466271546, "recommendationid": "23635511", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Steam REALLY needs a \"meh\" button.\nThe game isn't as bad as some reviews make it out - though it is lacking and rather uninspired.

The objective is to first play a level with hidden objects in it, which is usually so babyish that you could probably find the items required simply by headbutting your keyboard. After one of those levels you then you get TORTURED by a rush of zombies coming at your screen and you have to click on their head before they get you. Survive the onslaught and you get treated to another hidden object level and repeat. The click fest eventually enters in the realm of absolute absurd rage quitting experiences. Unfair speeds, small hit boxes, impossible numbers, developers offers no other perks to help you. While it may play alright on a touchscreen device, its gameplay mechanics is not suitable for pc. Therefore the game very, very, very, VERY quickly becomes a chore to play, it is not fun and you will never see the end of this game anyway at least on pc. The furthest ive seen someone get on pc is to put tyres on their car and that was no where near the end of the game. If you want to see the end of this then you will have to get the app.\n\nThe game is made by these ios developers http://www.playanarchygames.com/ who have failed to properly port this to PC. For one thing the app allows you to blow up barrels which creates kind of a pink smoke which slows the zombies up a little, or limits the directions of them coming towards you. On PC exploding the barrels does absolutely nothing. \n\nHowever even the app is a crazy touch screen fest and the game will either end with you being diagnosed with RSI or you needing a new phone since your forefinger is somewhere embedded into the screen. In final PC forget it.
