This newer version contains some bonus stuff in the Story Campaign which were hinted in the credits. Also a lot of game crashing bugs have been fixed, but there are still some left. Awesome 20+ hrs story (or mby even more if you take your time), a few challenging bonus missions (if you are a new player, it's advised to complete the Story mode first). If only this game gets all of it's bugs fixed and also gets multiplayer in the future it will be the best medival Strategy game ever in my opinion! :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198172724761", "last_played": 1505600988, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_forever": 1311}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1502830199, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503179940, "recommendationid": "34263810", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
