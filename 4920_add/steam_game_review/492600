Sometimes I don't feel like playing games that require lightening reflexes, or involve running around shooting the crap out of stuff.  Sometimes I just feel like chilling out, wandering around, looking at some beautiful graphics and solving the occasional puzzle.  The Vanishing of EC was one such game and, from what I've seen of it so far, Ridge may just fit the bill too.\n\nI have played it for 92 minutes according to Steam and to be honest I still haven't got an actual clue what I'm supposed to do yet.  There are stone runes, you have to charge them up (this seems key to survival); there are clues on notes left dotted around and I've found a notebook containing cryptic drawings which probably are trying to tell me what I'm supposed to be doing if only I was smart enough to interpret them; there are orbs of light that follow you around and will kill you; some \"control towers\" that the game also hints are key to surviving; and that's about all I can fathom at the moment.\n\nSome of my 92 minutes were spent messing about with the graphics settings, as this game does seem to hammer the GPU heavily.  On my GTX 960 4GB it runs at around 30fps with regular dips into the 20s at 1080p with everything on \"ultra\".  After turning things down and gaining only a few extra fps at the expense of making it look f-ugly, I decided to leave everything on ultra.  It does look quite pretty and is certainly not unplayable.  I think it could do with some serious optimisation though.\n\nI felt compelled to write this review of sorts due to there being just 3 reviews of this game on Steam currently and 2 of them are negative and posted by people who have spent just 0.2 hrs and 0.3 hrs respectively playing the game.  They cannot possibly have given it enough time to establish whether it's any good or not, and certainly not progressed anywhere at all with it in the space of just a few minutes.  To dump all over a new independent title like that, especially one developed by one person, is just ignorant.\n\nThis game is definitely interesting, intriguing and pretty enough for me to continue with it some more.  Even if I only play it for a few hours and give up on it, it will have been worth the paltry purchase price.  Based on what I have seen so far I would recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993646070", "last_played": 1486949974, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 466, "playtime_forever": 119}, "votes_up": 19, "timestamp_created": 1468867643, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521025", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1468867643, "recommendationid": "24394638", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "no fun at all .....\nlooked good ....played ok.....but nothing really to it....\nif on sale for $2 then buy ....\nempty world fighting balls of light ....\nits not ruthless its pretty lame.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198084077567", "last_played": 1468165604, "num_reviews": 84, "num_games_owned": 379, "playtime_forever": 37}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1468948100, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489108", "votes_down": 19, "timestamp_updated": 1468948100, "recommendationid": "24411330", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Don't buy this game.
