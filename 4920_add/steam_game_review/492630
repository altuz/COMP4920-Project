The only reason I even have 3.3 hours is because I got stuck on one of the puzzles, and have also played through half of episode 2 before getting bored of it and stopping. I just can't be bothered to put in the effort to solve the puzzle, which is why I decided to stop- because theirs nothing intriguing me to solve it and find out the rest of the story, unfortunately. \n\nI would really like if the characters/setting/design/voice-acting stayed the same but the story was just changed up and actually made interesting.
