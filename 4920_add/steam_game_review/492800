Also fans of the old Double Dragon or Battletoads games, music included. Create a very limited character ( manga /anime, style but only like a dozen options and few colors. don't expect too much ) with pixel graphics and off to your Shonen adventure. Create a Shonen character and get outfits and pets to help personalize him and sometimes get perks. Train in Shonen ways and journey a map beating up pixel baddies and bosses. All working for a End Game Boss called Kurowashi. Level up the Shonen skills in training like PUNCH and KICK and RUN with Kai you gain from defeating baddes. The more training the better you get.  Like actual training....DUH and travel the map like I said beating one area to another. The pixal art is funny and neat sometimes for the baddies. Music is where I think if they had more of it and a rotation of diffrent type songs it would be solid to run on my computer in the background all the time. Catchy and old school. So if you like to stay idle and not even have to click here, and run a nifty Shonen through levels to head bop-ing music to defeat a pixel army and bad guy named Kurowashi,.. play young grasshopper.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035383340", "last_played": 1496289152, "num_reviews": 163, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_forever": 121}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485834325, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485835057, "recommendationid": "29597742", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pretty good game while your sleeping or not doing anything else.
