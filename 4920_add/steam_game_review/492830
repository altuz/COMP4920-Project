There's better games for free on the web-browsers like Kongregate and the like.[/b] Throne Rushers is a 2D action-platformer game where the only goal is to get to the top of the map [b]by whatever means necessary[/b] which is including but not limited to: deceit, malpractice, taking extended naps, prostitution, and most importantly, murder. You double jump along the sides of terrain to climb and throw shuriken, because for some reason you and all your competitors are ninjas, even though nothing else on the map is ninja-esque. It's not even night time. You also have some sort of inner-fire thing with right-click that allows you to deflect projectiles. If you ignore the previous statement the game drives close to impossible because enemy shuriken fly at slightly-slower-than-light speed.\n\n\n[h1]The Good:[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay is okay, a bit jagged at times but generally tolerable. It's simple and effective. The game is mildly entertaining at best, but there's really not a lot of reasons to keep playing aside from the character customization that the developer put in. Unfortunately, that quality is a good attempt, but not good enough to make the game worthy of playing for more than a couple of hours.\n\nAnother good quality is that the developer made the multiplayer expandable up to 30 simultaneous players on a locally hosted server. The downside is that none of your friends will play this game, but the effort is pretty good! Hit me up if for some reason you want to waste hella money and we'll host a Throne Rushers tournament. I'll buy pizza, or something.\n\n[h1]The Bad:[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay is good, yes, but there are these anomalies that make it difficult to determine if they're bugs or not. Some of the terrain is unclimable, which is inconvenient if you try to scale one specific side of the map. Enemy shuriken can come from off-screen, and they move pretty darn fast, almost guarenteeing your death unless you've got twitchlike reflexes.\n\nThere's no music in the game, even though the trailer had something. This game has officially thrown me into the crisis of whether I'd rather have no music in a game, or have the same looping sound-track throughout it. The game also only has [b]four different sound effects in the game[/b].\n\nSome minor things is that when you spawn, you generally die four to five times due to all the Rushers spawning on the same level. Throne Guards (the dudes on top of those wooden shrines) can throw shuriken through their own, but not yours. Enemy AI rushers can float through the throne terrain and go directly to the throne (but not the general map terrain). The previous isn't so bad because the enemy AI is about as naturally intelligent as a bag of rocks. Then lastly there's really no longevity to the game. [b]The game's biggest downfall is honestly that it costs money to play, otherwise I could see it being a multiplayer game that is on the same level of Battlestick[/b].\n\n[h1]Score & Breakdown:[/h1]\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with my channel, my scoring is a little less-than-traditional, but still relatively simple. I rate five categories from 0 to 2, 2 being perfect 0 being pretty terrible. The four categories are as below reviews, with the last being a \"[b]Wildcard[/b]\" category. This category allows me to grade games based on criteria that some games have that others won't. For example, I wouldn't try and grade this game off of story.\n\n[b]Score: 3/10[/b]\n\n[list][*][b]Graphics: 1/2[/b]\n[*]Given a one because the art is fitting and appropriate, but the animations are very lackluster.\n\n[*][b]Sound: 0/2[/b]:\n[*]frist of all how DRAE you make me listen to only four loud sound effects while I play this game\n\n[*][b]Gameplay: 1/2[/b]\n[*]simple, yet effective. shaken, not stirred. lack of depth, and there are some bugs that take away from the game.\n\n[*][b]Enjoyment: 1/2[/b]\n[*]Game was mildly enjoyable, I didn't absolutely hate playing it so there's that. I got into it, admittedly.\n\n[*][b]Retention: 0/2[/b]\n[*][i]Wildcard Category[/i] - There's very few reasons to play this game more than a couple of times, or more than two hours. Character customization is nice, but with no new maps and no real scaling difficulties, the game is too shallow to enjoy multiple times.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]If you've ever wanted to do a cart-wheel off of a cliff while listening to the sweet succulent sounds of my voice, check out the fully URL'd video review below:[/h1]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFctCTVP_vM", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041592505", "last_played": 1475668093, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 238, "playtime_forever": 115}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1475954229, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496463", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1475954229, "recommendationid": "25932040", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Good game!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198199281646", "last_played": 1480184021, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1480183856, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486702", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1480183856, "recommendationid": "27706979", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "MAJOR improvent needed but still room for petiental (i dont care if i spelled it right).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002405707", "last_played": 1470963331, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 40, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1470963471, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479439", "votes_down": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1470963471, "recommendationid": "24834783", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
