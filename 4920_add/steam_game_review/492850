For like 3\u20ac you can have one hour easy puzzling, but nothing more. 15\u20ac is far too expensive for the content!\n\nLike other reviewers said, the game is a bit like Lemmings: you have to get your astroderps to the goal, while they wander mindlessly into certain death or jump off of cliffs - thus the title lemmings. Instead of manipulating the astroderps directly, you change blocks and stairs and form a way for the astroderps. \n\nMost of the levels are fairly easy. The art style, the controls and the sound are okay, but nothing more.\n\nOnly the amount of content is really frustrating - there are few level and I finished the game in under 1 hour! That's not enough playtime for a complete game. The price/content proportion is a no go and I can understand, when other players won't recommend the game because of this. But the game itself is okay, so I will give it a recommendation - but only barely and only if it's on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197964221138", "last_played": 1466328287, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 596, "playtime_forever": 39}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1466333194, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515088", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1466333194, "recommendationid": "23649118", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game sells itself as a puzzler and from the concept in the trailer you can see the idea of the game mechanics has a lot of potential. None of the seperate mechanics introduced as you play are ever really combined. It feels like playing a bunch of tutorial levels to teach you about the diffrent ideas they had for in game mechanics. This game may be fun for people 8-12 years old. I say that because as an adult in my 20's there is no challenge in any of the short list of puzzles (beat the game in 30 mins). I looked at the company online to see that they are a VR programming school teaching with unreal engine 4. So this game may have very well been developed by students.

However, while in Lemmings you manipulate the little dudes to make them reach their goal. Here, you manipulate the enviroment by placing blocks, stairs or lowering bridges to make sure your little derps don't fall, get burned or drown and get to where they want to be.\n\nI play in a small area (2,1mx1,5m) and I had no problems with the provided space. Standing next to the little world and placing blocks and making sure they all survive is fun and challanging.\nAlthough, I think that this is not a game that really NEEDS VR to work, it definitely is is more fun in VR.\n\nEDIT: \nafter it was pointed out to me that this game is indeed not an early access title, I unfortunately have to say that I would not recommend this game to everyone.\n\nIt is quite short and the price is definitely to steep for about 40 minutes of puzzle solving.\nI do understand, that the VR market is so small that you need to charge a little \"early adopter tax\". But the framework exists and a few (like 5-10) more levels should not have been a problem. \n\nSo my ne final verdict is:\nGET IT!  if you want to support the developers (this is the reason I'm keeping this game). The idea is nice and I hope that maybe this game will get some free map packs... or a level designer would be awesome (you listening chronos VR?)\n\nDO NOT GET IT if you expect an awesome Lemmings clone.
