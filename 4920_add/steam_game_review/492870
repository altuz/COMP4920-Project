The game comes on the heels of its predecessor \u2013 [i]FIVE: Guardians of David[/i] \u2013 but falls completely flat in comparison. \n\n[b]Story[/b]\n\nKing David has become aware that the conquered Ammonites have erected arenas and have been using them to continue their blood sacrifices to their god \u2013 Moloch \u2013 under the guise of arena combat. You \u2013 under the command of Hushai, David\u2019s agent, are meant to fight and make a name for yourself in the arenas to \u2018disrupt such blasphemy.\u2019\n\nMost of the backstory is introduced via the opening cinematic. Once thrust into the game, the story continues in the form of quests. The problem is that the game propels the story forward at a tremendously slow pace. You have to unlock new story quests by completing arena combat. But after a while the combat becomes so grindy that you inevitably lose all conviction to propel the story forward. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nThe game does allow you to customize your character, which includes a host of options, such as \u2013 gender, Biblical lineage, skin/hair color, name, etc. \n\nThe gameplay and its mechanics will be familiar to most Action-RPG players. A unique difference to most games within the genre is that you can equip all the different weapon/armor types right from the get go. With each different weapon type equipped, you get a new set of skills to use. You immediately get two basic skills per weapon type but have to invest kills into that weapon type in order to unlock four additional skills.  It\u2019s important to note that when you unlock skills, you unlock them permanently. They are not bound to the weapon you\u2019re using but the type of weapon. \n\nThe mechanics can be enjoyable at times until you look underneath the paint. You\u2019ll experience mobs getting stuck on walls/edges, poor pathfinding, weapons that don\u2019t behave as they should. The bow isn\u2019t able to perform critical strikes as an example despite having a skill that boosts critical chance. \n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\n\nDull and uninspiring compared to its predecessor. There are only several arenas in the game and one small main hub area and the texture work is very poor in addition to missing shadows in some areas. \n\n[b]Music/Sound[/b]\n\nNothing particularly note-worthy when it comes to the music. However, some of the sounds feel like they are placeholders from earlier in development and break what little immersion the game tries to create. \n\n[b]Achievements[/b]\n\nAs of writing this, I can say with certainty that there are at least three bugged achievements. There are probably more but I haven\u2019t tested more of the ones I suspect of being broken. So for achievement hunters, I do recommend you steer clear for the time being. \n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\n[i]FIVE: Champions of Canaan[/i] comes across as a game that could\u2019ve worked as a DLC to its predecessor \u2013 if scaled down and reworked. Instead, I feel what we\u2019ve gotten is a game that is needlessly bloated, grindy and wholly deserving of the question: \u2018what\u2019s the point?\u2019", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970842337", "last_played": 1498460202, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 833, "playtime_forever": 765}, "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_created": 1498461406, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557565", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498464701, "recommendationid": "32804042", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The Veggie Scross: Arena.\n\nBetter than it sounds.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198248714336", "last_played": 1498333665, "num_reviews": 95, "num_games_owned": 464, "playtime_forever": 42}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1498333121, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480601", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1498333121, "recommendationid": "32740727", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
