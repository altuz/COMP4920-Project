Level design and enemy placement reward memorization, dexterous platforming and careful melee. Best played with a gamepad!\n\nThere's a ton of game here. On top of a single-player / co-op campaign spanning 6 unique zones complete with boss battles and optional challenge stages, the devs have packed in an impressive amount of bonus content by way of additional game modes, 3 of which wait to be unlocked.\n\nGetting into the habit of blocking is paramount for survival as the 3 hits you're afforded can vanish in a blink. Bringing up that SSB-ish shield, however, saves you from suffering any non-spike damage for as long as it's active. While your attack range feels Wonderboy wimpy, there are random power-up drops that offer a Castlevania Adventure-like projectile to accompany each slash, although these are limited use.\n\nDungeon Run mode is my personal favourite of what's available in Battle Knights, taking the classic \"pushy level\" and making it into a self-contained, multi-stage adventure. Like the rest of Battle Knights, it's punishingly difficult and the forced scrolling can get frustratingly speedy but there's real satisfaction to be had learning a Dungeon Run level and executing it perfectly.\n\nI'm looking forward to trying the multiplayer modes out with a buddy! :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057694897", "last_played": 1491572816, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 151, "playtime_forever": 81}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1478143719, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504841", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1491698828, "recommendationid": "26394252", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's pretty fun.
