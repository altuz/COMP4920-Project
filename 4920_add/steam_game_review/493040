I don't think it's worth $20, but pick it up on sale if you like rhythm games.\n\nI bought it expecting it to be really bad, and have terrible hit detection, per the reviews I read, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The hit detection seems fine to me, I can hit the notes fine, you just have to rotate and slash with your swords, that's the mechanic.\n\nPros:\n- pretty fun, slashing the notes is pretty satisfying\n- unique, different take on a rhythm game\n- play your own music\n\nCons:\n- tower defense mechanic is meh, seems unnecessary\n- hard to read ahead, the notes block other notes behind them. You can still the staff of the notes, so I imagine if you're good enough you can still read ahead, but it feels unnatural to me.\n- the idea of slashing notes is fun, but the concept could probably be refined a bit\n\nOverall:\n7/10 - Pretty fun! Not as good as Audioshield, but worth picking up on sale if you like Rhythm games.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198087671877", "last_played": 1482228873, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 2039, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1482378651, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1482378651, "recommendationid": "28521148", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I like this game, but its one of those where I wish Steam had a \"Maybe\" vote instead of just Yes or No.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\nFun mix of Audioshield and ZenBlade/Fruit Ninja style gameplay.\nAn interesting mechanic with the Tower Defense playing in the background, tied to how well you are doing slashing beats.\nAutomatically generated beatmap doesn't feel too off in the songs I've tried so far. Having custom beatmaps is a plus.\nMany of the swords work different. Rapier can't slash beats, only 'stab', for example.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\nUI needs some work, especially during a game (accidently hitting reset can happen if you are getting a bit crazy with your sword slashes)\nIt's hard to pay attention to the castle/minion bars in any song that isn't somewhat slow, especially on Medium/Hard\nBeats are a bit large, can't see past them to prepare for subsequent beats.\nSword slash detection can feel off, the 'cutting edge' isn't very generous (like in say, Fruit NInja)\n\n[b]Middle Ground[/b]\nThe Tower Defense thing is a nice, unique touch, but it isn't very flashy or obvious. Some improvements to it could make it stand out.\nSuccesfully cutting a beat doesn't make a sound, though that may or may not interfere with the song (option?)\n\n[b] Final Verdict (as of 7/13/16 version)[/b]\nIt's fun and interesting. I like it a lot, but I cannot suggest it at this price point. It needs some work in the UI and control department, but they aren't extremely bad, just 'passable'.\n\nIt gets a Yes from me though, as the Pros outweigh the Cons.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960388753", "last_played": 1468415605, "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 1465, "playtime_forever": 23}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1468456816, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494795", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1468456816, "recommendationid": "24306008", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very cool game. i love how they allow you use your own music.
