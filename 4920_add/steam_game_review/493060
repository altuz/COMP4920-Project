For some reason, the game can't decide whether it wants a mouse or controller, even though I have my controller connected. Another problem, pausing the game sends the pause menu off screen to the top left corner where I can barely see \"Exit\". The game also needs some proper calibration as the turret controls are a little stiff when using a controller. One last thing, there's A LOT of slow down for a game that doesn't require much in power. My PC far exceeds the requirements.
