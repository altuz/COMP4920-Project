I'm not going to thumbs down it however becuase it's still a blast to play and it still works. My review below still stands, just be aware that it's starting to look like the game that you buy now is all you will get. \n\nHonestly I was expecting something like Space Pirate Trainer.   Compared to this game SPT is downright boring!  The soundtrack is old-school 80's style.  The commentary reminds me of the old \"HEADSHOT!\" days of Unreal Tourney.  And holy cow is it a workout.  Honestly if you are trying to choose between SPT or this game, go for Belly Bots.  You won't regret it.\n\nPros:\n\nSoundtrack.\n\nRapid action that doesn't stop till you are worn out.\n\nDifferent levels offer some interesting variations.\n\nYou have a top hat and moustache on your space helmet. (Look at your shadow)\n\nYour helmet actually cracks when you take damage.\n\nCons:\n\n[strike]No menu or way to pause/escape the action that I could find. [/strike] [i] Edit. They added pause ability.

This game is woefully underrated.\n\nIf I described it as \"wave shooter with one weapon and three enemy types\" that would be an accurate description, but it would do nothing to convey how insanely fun and *relentless* this game is. I had to take a break (thankfully supports pause with Menu button) to wipe down my headset and controllers, wash my face, and strip down to my underwear (in the middle of winter). It's such a workout. It's simple in the best of ways, as an arcade game should be.\n\nThe appeal of it is in the carefully laid out waves of enemies that come in all kinds of patterns and layouts. Twenty levels feels more like sixty... I was loudly exclaiming \"NO MORE\" and \"FUCK\" as I bent backwards like Neo to avoid enemy fire while shooting my dual pistols each to one side. I kept wondering if the levels were generated on the fly because it honestly felt like I was at level 50 or something. \n\nAt $7.99, it's reasonably priced for what it has.

They all stand still on platforms. Eventually you get some shields you can \"hide and dive\" behind, but you can accidentally blow those up yourself as well. \n\nAt the time of writing this review, this is all there is to the game, there's this voice that will tell you how fantastic you are while hitting those robots, and each \"level\" consist of new pods to stand on, sometimes higher, sometimes closer and sometimes lower - but essentially the same design each level.

I'm GUESSING this one would even work with low end graphics cards.\n- Potential to become a great shooter, it's an EARLY access game after all.\n\nCons:\n\n- Seems like an early Beta.\n- Repetitive with little new added to each level.\n- No scoreboards, not even local.\n- Increasing score, you don't get a chance to start from scratch.\n- There's no menus (at least I can't find them) so it's basically just shoot-and-go-and-repeat.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983030739", "last_played": 1471381077, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 72, "playtime_forever": 56}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1469566392, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505282", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1469566392, "recommendationid": "24544287", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game really took me by surprise.
