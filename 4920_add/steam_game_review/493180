This game rocks. Dynasty Feud combines the sustained, tactical tension we love about TowerFall's one-hit-kill mechanic with the stage and character diversity of a Smash Bros. The \"dynasty\" mechanic--coming back to life as a new character with a different move set each time you die--is brilliant. It constantly shifts the feel of each match, and adds an almost Overwatch-like strategic layer to \"hero selection\" as you attempt to counter the other player's current fighter in real time. One of my friends is an illustrator, and he was blown away by Dynasty Feud's character design, to the point where he was wishing there was a single-player campaign. I myself could care less about story modes in brawlers, but it speaks to the strength of the characters that they make you naturally curious about their back stories. The art style and overall tone reminds me of Guacamelee!, another favorite.\n\nWe're looking forward to our next play session. We unlocked all of the clans except for the aliens! Right now I'd say we're in that fun discovery stage of a fighting game, learning each fighter's moves. Because the pace of the game is so fast (that's a good thing), you may initially experience some frustrating spawns, where you basically die right away before you figure out what's cool about your character. But when you do have that Eureka moment, like, \"I can move around as this devastating tornado!,\", \"I  can reflect projectiles with my stubby punches\", or \"I have a shield instead of a dodge!\", it's very rewarding. At first we thought the supers were OP, but after some experimenting we realized you can dodge, and in some cases shield-block, the ultimate abilities. If the game is this fun now, I can only imagine what it will be like when we know what we're doing.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197987136260", "last_played": 1496077902, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 104, "playtime_forever": 86}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1495638859, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495638859, "recommendationid": "31935930", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A really interesting surprise. I expected a fun experience, but it turned out to be deeper than that. The variety that the 40 characters offer and the nuances each of them have can make the combat more complex that it might seem at first. \n\nIt is the kind of game I like to play with my friends, fun for beginners and deep for more harcore fighting players. Only having one life gives dynamism to the battles, because as soon as you lose a character you need to think about who will be the next one. The movements and attacks of each character are simple to execute, but timing and deciding which one to use can be crucial (this is where the hardcore gamers shine).\n\nThis is the game that perfectly meets the \"easy to get, hard to master\". It might seem overwhelming at the beginning with the amount of characters you need to learn about (and maybe there is some of that), but for me the initial learning process was really smooth.\n\nThe main flaw the game has is the lack of a single player mode. I did not miss it much, but I think it needs to be pointed out.\n\nTo sum up I really recommend this game for those who like to beat their friends!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198298682464", "last_played": 1495626855, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 3, "playtime_forever": 154}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1495621563, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495621977, "recommendationid": "31932097", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It was a dissapointing start when I realized Dynasty Feud wasn\u00b4t exactly a brawler but a team based mini fighting game, but once you get in you cannot stop playing.

For example, I was going to be killed by a players final movement, I foreseed it, so when he activated it, I threw my character to the train rails, so I could escape and come back to hit him with my viking spear!\n\nAlso the music is awesome, I would like themed music depending on which Dynasty wins, that would be great.\n\nI only wish I could pick up props/corpses from the environment to throw them and hit my friends with the corpses of their ancestors.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984005410", "last_played": 1497624830, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 137}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1495616014, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1495616677, "recommendationid": "31931123", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game really nails the \"easy to play, hard to master\" mantra.

In order to become a competitive player, you will need to master not only every champion inside your dynasty, but also the champions of the opposing dynasties. This way, you will be able to wisely select your next champion to respawn once you die and counter your adversaries.\n\nIt can be enjoyed as a single screen local multiplayer, or online multiplayer. From my experience, the online aspect seems to be lacking some optimization, as I have experienced a couple issues while playing online. Though it works without problems most of the time and the local experience is just superb.\n\nIf you are into game lores, this game also includes a \"Codex\", which gives an accurate description of all the ~40 champions and also some tips. I really enjoyed reading through it.\n\nConclusion:\nEasy to play, but with a lot of depth to satisfy serious players. \nPlaying as a dynasty really makes for an strong tactical aspect. \nOriginal champions and mechanics.\nSome online conectivity issues.\nCan definitely work as a party game.\nRecommended.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995475909", "last_played": 1503316942, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 902}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1495631578, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495631578, "recommendationid": "31934135", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Really entertening game to play with friend on LAN or online, easy to start playing at unlocking new dynasties!!

I find them too similar, meaning that there are few variances of the core gameplay (attack, health damage, combos, die, repeat). The addition of dynasties, 1 hit deaths, and hilariously comic characters are some of the great calls that the indie studio made. \n\nYet another core highlight is that there is always something to be looking at during the gameplay. When a player dies, the respawn mechanic allows the dead player to annoy and strategically place themselves. This makes death yet another mechanic on itself, leveraging the game rhythm. No boring interludes, time \n\nThe community seems great so far.
