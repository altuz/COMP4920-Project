Gamepad doesnt work. Very repetitive, wave after waves, combat is arcadey and the whole setting is grating.\n\nWoody Two Legs is superficially charming at first, the 2d cartoons are not great but fit the game's thematic, the whole haloween thing was kind of an excuse to thrown in zombies, and the 3D ocean, ship and central island looks pleasant enough on first impression. There is only one song of a violin playing and it loops too often and grates on the nerves\n\nWhat kills this game is the gameplay, It is basically a Tower Defense style where enemies rush in to try to get to the middle of the map and leave, and you have to hunt and kill them all down, its very arcadey, you can shoot your cannons unrealistically fast, and you can pick up power ups from dead opponents. Naval combat is not great for twitch arcades though as you need a wider arc to turn around using an actual ship than you would in most shootemup games. \n\nThe AI sends waves after waves, it feels like it never ends, until you fight a boss. Then you get to tally your score based on the damage you took and the gold that was taken from the middle of the map, a little text blurb later to advance the setting of the game and hint at progression you are back doing the same thing against slightly different looking ships. It gets real old, real fast."}]}
