The story is told without any dialogue whatsoever, leaving atmosphere and emotional suggestion with most of the heavy lifting. The design will feel almost random as you piece together the hints within, a form of ordered chaos if you will. I found it difficult to feel invested in the game until the latter levels where the entire vision begins to come together and you understand and appreciate the how and why. While you may begin to figure out the general concept about halfway there are certain details that do not truly hit home until the game is finished.\n\nThat being said the game sometimes felt like a chore to play, with the reward and satisfaction being reserved for the final scenes, but I am glad I carried on. If you play the game and feel uninspired to finish I urge you to push through, it is worth the effort and may just prompt a second playthrough.

You get the feel \"well i guess i have to explore this island\". But then the first revelation there is nothing or at least not much to really explore. That island really feels like a level that tricks you into thinking it is an island. And seriously why is this game running to piss poor, i have a 1080ti and R7 1700x and this game runs with 40fps on max details on 1440p, the looks of this game and size of levels don't justify this performance. Then you start to enjoy the art style but the feeling that the developer were just lazy. You can make a minimalist artstyle but then you have to make up for it so it doesn't feel cheap and empty and yes this game feels cheep and lazy. \nA big problem what comes in hands with it is the massive hand holding, it is impossible to miss the goal because first you have a fox that leads you to every spot they can't mark white and second because well they made every edge of importance white. This little detail should have used on almost every edge, not just on spots where the game wants you to go and would improve the graphical quality of the game.\nI am pretty aware that many games are dumbed down compared to games that were released in the 80s and 90s but this game shouldn't have that massive amount of hand holding and lack of stakes. You are playing a boy who is on an adventure...but there are no stakes not sense of real adventure. Where is the adventure when the game holds your hand and says \"you go there, then there and then there oh and by the way you can't really fail\". I would hate that as a child, it's like going to the playground with your parents and never leave their side. It doesn't make any sense in the context of this game. And don't come with \"well that big bird can snatch you\" at me, you totally know that it was so easy to avoid that from happening. The puzzles-if you want to call them that- are way too easy and obvious because of the handholding. So you don't get any feel of accomplishment. You are basically just running to spots where the games leads you to, then walk to different spots where the game leads you to to collect keys to open gates and doors from previous spots. Yep no thinking or figuring out involved, just running from spot to spot, no puzzles in this game folks.\nNothing to say about the story, very surface level and not very interesting or engaging. But they still figured out to ruin this experience. The last scene of the game is a big \"DO YOU GET, THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS THIS AND THAT OBJECT THIS, DO YOU GET IT?\" which really made me angry. The game was over with the scene on the boat, everything what comes after ruins any attempt, since the actual scenes with story are so scarce. \nLast point i have 6.1h on the clock but real play time is about ~4h. I bought it on the sale but it still overpaid for the play time this game offers. This game isn't worth 34,99\u20ac, 10\u20ac at best.
