For a Doom-like that I had never heard of, which is in of itself quite the impressive thing, the quality of the game blew me away. And the fact that it runs so smoothly and nearly flawlessly on Windows 10 is just impressive.\n\nAnd don't bother looking for video reviews for this, because you'll be met with the inferior 3DO version.\nThis ''port'' is the got-to ''port''. It has greatly improved graphics, the same beautiful soundtrack, and run very solidly on modern systems thanks to some wizardry on the port-ers part.\n\nFlaw-wise, the mouse movement feels wonky, and if panic ever sets in (and in close quarters, it will), you will really feel it's limitations. A controller option is present, but I haven't tested it, so, threat lighlty. The gun sounds, especially the Tommy Gun, are abit unsatisfying, but get the job done.\n\nBy today's standarts, this is not a special game, but it not a bad game.

The cutscenes work and the game doesn't freeze. It works 100% on Windows 10. The only thing the game still does is that the games music will still cease to functions when there is a lot of combat going on, so loud sounds like explosions will stop the music, unless you leave, and re enter the area you're in.\n\nKilling Time is worth checking out.
