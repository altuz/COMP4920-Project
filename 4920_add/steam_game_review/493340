But after some reflection I realized I just couldn't say that I thought the game was worth it for $45, hence the negative review.\n\nSo, this is a Roller Coaster/Amusement Park building game, meant to remind people of the Roller Coaster Tycoon series of yore, but also, to make a modern \"next gen\" version of the Roller Coaster Tycoon series, and to properly bring it up with the times, since Roller Coaster Tycoon's actual developers don't seem to be doing that.\n\nIn a lot of ways this game succeeds at being the modern version of Roller Coaster Tycoon. It's all there, the in-depth ride building, the park development, and the just general sense of fun and whimsy is all intact and it's great. But in a lot of other ways I feel like the game is missing the mark.\n\nFor one thing, although this is likely a big draw for a lot of people, the level of detail and customization is just a little too intense for me, and there's very little pre-made stuff to select from. Now, the sort of stuff that can be built with the in-game engine is really impressive, but there is a very steep learning curve to be able to get to that point. There is some pre-made plug and play stuff that you can just drop into your park and start using, but not very much of it, and the stuff that is there is mostly made with the handful of themes from the games \"story mode\" scenarios in mind. \n\nActually, on the subject of the learning curve, another big gripe I have with this game is the tutorials. Namely there is no in-game tutorial. The game recommends you go to some Youtube videos to learn the basics of the game, which I think is just ridiculous on the face of it, but even after I watched the Youtube videos, there was still a lot of basic stuff I didn't know how to do. There's  a decently sized community of people on Youtube who all post video tutorials and training academies on various Planet Coaster topics, and I really recommend you keep some of these channels in mind as you play the game, otherwise you'll have no idea what you're doing at all, and even with that help, it's still difficult.\n\nIn general I feel like there should just be more game modes and more stuff to do in game. Besides the lack of a tutorial, the game types that are included just feel shallow. There are a handful of \"story mode\" type things where you're given themed parks as a base to build on and specific tasks to complete. These ramp up in challenges and difficulty as time goes on. There is also a free play mode, where you can build to your heart's content, and not worry about the challenges and scenarios associated with running the park if you don't want to.\nThat's it though. Those are all the game modes. I feel like there should be more variety here, more to build off of in the beginning besides just a blank slate maybe, or maybe a more fleshed out version of the story mode scenarios.\n\nAnd finally, I think the most disappointing thing about the game for me, was that when I first started up the game, I took the time to watch some video tutorials and messed around a bit to get used to the basics, but then I immediately went into free play mode and started to build a really crazy roller coaster. \nIt was the sort of roller coaster that you couldn't actually do in real life. It started out with a huge incline leading to a massive drop, had several parts that went underground, a number of loops, and as many sheer drops as I could fit in. It was glorious. I tested it out myself since the game has a first person camera you can use to view what your rides are like from the passenger's perspective and it was great. I got a real sense of adrenaline off of it.\nThen I opened it up in my park, and I realized that by the objective rankings the game uses... the ride was terrible. No one rode it, and anyone who did ride it, hated it.\n\nSo, I went back to Youtube and watched more videos on roller coaster design and I started to realize that this was not quite the Roller Coaster game I had envisioned. The game's system for rating roller coasters is based very heavily in reality, unfortunately, and adrenaline-thumping heart-racing monsters of steel and wood aren't going to cut it, if you actually want to use a custom coaster in game.\nNow I know the realistic coaster system is actually a big draw for a lot of people. There is a big community of people who love roller coasters primarily from an engineering and physics perspective, and those people love this game. But for me I wanted it to be a little more fantastical, and it doesn't quite deliver on that front.\n\nI'm still playing the game, and I'm still having fun with it. I do actually want to learn how to make a good roller coaster by the game's standards, but the learning curve is steep. It does take time and effort to learn how to make good money off of your parks and make likeable roller coasters.\n\nTo the credit of Frontier Developments they do seem to be developing this game a fair bit as time goes on. There are regular free content updates and support, bug fixes, etc. I can understand why some people were pissed off about the addition of DLC to this game though, because you shouldn't really be releasing DLC for a game that still feels sort of incomplete, which this honestly does.\n\nSo, unfortunately I'm posting a negative review here, because as it currently stands I wouldn't reccomend this game for the money. However, it is a fun game and I'm hoping that the continued effort of Frontiers Developments eventually brings it up to its full potential. In which case I will write a positive review for the game. But right now this game seems like a missed opportunity and a whole lot of untapped potential.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995200857", "last_played": 1500430763, "num_reviews": 73, "num_games_owned": 173, "playtime_forever": 628}, "votes_up": 312, "timestamp_created": 1505529124, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641631", "votes_down": 136, "timestamp_updated": 1505529124, "recommendationid": "34985895", "votes_funny": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So... Planet coaster,\n\nWhen I first saw this game, I never thought that it would become what it has become for me. It is my single favourite game of all time, but lo and behold, I had sunk more time into this game than any other on my first week. \n\nThe controls are relavtively straightforward, and the tips will help familiarise you with how the game works. The building mechanics allow for unique and visually distinct restaurants, shops, and decorations across your park, be it your first resturant building, a jumble of pieces, or a 2,000 piece toilet, with monstrous amounts of pieces all contributing to a detailed, interesting design. Or just place down a blueprint from the workshop, if you're that way inclined. The workshop support is seamless in my experience. \n\nAnd the coasters? Well, with huge variety in the coaster types themselves, and full control over where they go and what they do, no two coasters may ever have to be the same. The flat rides are all cleverly designed, and for the most part will fit into anywhere you want them. \n\nThe scenery options are equally as diverse as the buildings. With the ability to rotate and precisely place any piece from the huge selection in any and every possible way, every item can be use din different ways than it would at first seem. The five scenery themes (western, pirate, fairytale, sci-fi, and basic park) can be interchanged with absolute freedom! Want to build a park based around space cowboys? Go ahead! Ever want to know what a pirate theme would look like in a mountainous park? Be my guest! There are almost no restrictions that the game will throw up, and the gargantuan collection of pieces will give you the tools to build anything you want.\n\nThe only downside that I have ever experienced with this game is some lag issues when you build larger parks. But the scale of a park necessary for serious frame issues is honestly gargantuan.\n\nIn short,\n\nPlanet coaster is a fun and engaging game, which you will sink hours into without realising it.

The framerate takes a serious nosedive once your park reaches a certain population to the point that it sap's the fun right out of it.  There appears to be a fundamental flaw with the simulation calculations that means most (if not all) cpu's become stuttering fools once you have 2000+ guests in the park and it becomes a bottleneck for the whole experience.  This translates to you only really being able to build a dozen rides on 20% of the available terrain whilst maintaining a smooth consistent experience.  It is a known serious bug/flaw that I dont think frontier developments can rectify.  Their \"fix\" is to let you limit the parks population to an amount you specify. \n\nThe problem with that is when attempting to progress in the career mode you end up with a park that is too big and too sparsely populated for it to be finacially sustainable.  It is a massive shame as you are given enough tools to be incredibly creative (some of the user created parks are amazing!!) but run out of the enthusiasm to use them as the inevitable frame rate drops linger right around the corner.\nFor info I run this on a 6700k at 4.4Ghz with a Gtx 1080 ti.  (i've tested it on a 7700k at stock with 1080ti sli also with similar results - game resolution or graphical settings have very little affect on performance on the rigs i ran it on)\n\nIf the population issue is ever improved or solved I would recommend this to everyone, but, it's Fdev, so they wont, so I can't.

The same development team had a crack at bringing their shining gem to modernity.  And in many ways they succeeded.  But in one hour play session all of that promise and the newfound joy in me was suddenly pulled out from beneath me, for DLC had encroached on my stock campaign.  \n\nI understand the allure and benefits of the DLC model to developers but I don't respect it, in fact I despise it, but understand, from a business perspective, why it creeps its way into pretty much AAA game these days.  But what Planet Coaster did was much more nefarious.  Let me describe...\n\nI was playing the 2nd set of levels in the main campaign, the ones themed around fairytales and storybooks.  After about an hour of play and as I was tiring, I tried to save, and was met by a dialogue stating that I was \"unable to save due to unpurchased mods being used.\"  I had no idea I was using mods...I'm a 30-year old male that grew up with video games and at that moment I felt like I must have stumbled into an accidental click usually only reserved for those that don't have the tools to distinguish click-bait from the ACTUAL download link.  It wasn't until I started a discussion on steam that I found out that there's a menu option that enables/disables DLC objects from populating in your game.  But this isn't disabled by default.\n\nThis means you can open the game, have no interest in the DLC and even make the concerted effort to click \"no thanks\" on the barrage of BUY ME!  HALLOWEEN PROPS FOR SALE! dialogues that litter the welcoming screen.  And even then, when staying within the what looks to be stock campaign you could just run into the pitfall I did.\n\nI think this is a pathetic business practice and I have lost tremendous respect for these developers.  It's truly dumfounding how just when we see a beacon of hope in the Tycoon genre - and really, other than the DLC, these guys did everything right - only for it to be gutted and left as a sort of seedy sales machine that embodies a virtual ATM.  \n\nYou want to do DLC content?  Fine, great, no grudges held.  I understand.  But automatically enable a feature that, unbeknowst to the user, embeds potentially \"stock game\" breaking function.  I either would have to go through each scenery piece and determine whether or not it was DLC or stock, or simply not save.  \n\nI didn't save my game that night, and I am feeling like I don't want to open that game ever again.  It was a real eye opener on the state of DLC affairs, and one that sadens me.  It's not just a sell-out, it's a big middle-finger to the people that make this artform so magical.\n\nThank you Frontier Developments!

After 170 hours of gameplay I still cannot get use to it and I'm still struggling in tight spaces. The music is often inaudible and there's no in game volume control of park speakers. Scenary object cannot be scaled and thus limit how you can build stuffs. The DLCs don't have the same kind of quality as in RCT3, instead of full fledged expansion like water park, you just get small scenery pieces that act to divide workshop audiences if they don't have them.

Si subes el nivel gr\u00e1fico realiza muchos lags con lo que se pierde la sensaci\u00f3n de velocidad de estar dentro de la monta\u00f1a rusa.\n\nPero mi opini\u00f3n negativa es sobre todo porque empieza la veda abierta de DLC's de pago. En pocos meses ya tenemos 3 DLC con poco contenido a 3\u20ac cada uno y ahora van a introducir contenido tem\u00e1tico de terror por el m\u00f3dico precio de 11\u20ac nada m\u00e1s y nada menos. Muchos juegos completos (sin extras de DLC) muy buenos y con m\u00e1s contenido valen menos que esto. Y m\u00e1s a\u00fan, mucho contenido descargable en workshop, creado por los fans y que les ha costado mucha dedicaci\u00f3n y tiempo, valdr\u00edan igualmente m\u00e1s dinero y los est\u00e1n ofreciendo gratis. Dan ganas de decirles a la comunidad que dejen de regalar sus obras de arte por amor al pr\u00f3jimo y exijan cobrar por sus dise\u00f1os,  como hacen los desarrolladores. Es una pena. VAYAN PREPARANDO SUS CARTERAS.\n\n\u00bfQue ser\u00e1 lo siguiente? \u00bfpagaremos por atracciones acu\u00e1ticas, piscinas, personalizar grupos de visitantes, zool\u00f3gico como en RCT3 que ya ven\u00edan de serie en el juego? Y encima, sin haber optimizado el juego completamente, ya est\u00e9n queriendo ganar dinero a costa de sus fans, por a\u00f1adir items.\n\nRecomendar\u00eda este juego si costase menos de 5\u20ac para que te quede suficiente dinero para comprar todos los DLCs que quedan por llegar y tener el juego completo por un precio razonable.

Let's start paying with DLC's for every new theme they want create. (We have three in a months 3\u20ac+3\u20ac+3\u20ac and now.... 11\u20ac for anothers items. What next? Water rides? Personalize your family guests? Zoo rides like RCT3?  PREPARE YOUR WALLET).\n\nFans who gave a fantastic design in workshop: demand money for creations you did, because of lots of spent time in them and creativity. Most of them better than their DLC.\n\nThat is why I give them negative opinion.\n\nI AM SO UPSET.
