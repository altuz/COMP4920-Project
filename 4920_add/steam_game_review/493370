You played Ragnarok and enjoy a dash of nostalgia\n2. You like clicker games (or specifically clicker heroes)\n3. You use cheat engine speed hack x200\n\nIt's an obvious Cash Grab by Gravity, the same way they've made classical Ragnarok Online pay2win, this little game here is no different. The prices of the emperium (upgrade) packs go up to 100$ which is just ridiculous. Some people no doubt will be tempted to spend money on this considering the grinding is HORRIBLY slow but please don't. Cheat engine will help you out and make the grind durable thanks to the speed hack. Playing this at the original speed is just masochism.\n\nAnyway. I fulfill all the criteria and I'm having a lot of fun so far. The rebirth mechanic that was taken from clicker heroes actually fits the Ragnarok setting very well.

honestly i don't care about copy or somewhat, if you like Ragnarok and kinda wanna feel nostalgic feeling just try it, if you already play clicker heroes and prefer that one, i won't recommended this
