Feels a little like Wizards Chess from the Harry Potter Universe.\nAnimation has been added, although a little slow at times it now allows you to not only see the movements your opponent makes but also looks great.\nMusic too has been added. Tranquil but little repetitive\n\nStill missing for me though is:\nSound effects for the pieces \nAI settings\n\nI personnaly would like to see use of the room scale VR for this but thats just me being picky.\n\nAll in all a huge improvement to this game and its now at a playable version. I will be keeping an eye on any future releases in hope that the sound effect and AI settings are addressed.\n\nVersion 1\n\nHow can you go wrong with chess?\nSomehow ChessVR managed it.\n\nNo animations, blink and miss the move\nNo AI settings\nMusic option laughable as there is no music\nGrapics of surroundings are terrible\nNo use of room scale\n\nbought at steam sale for less than \u00a33 yet I still feel ripped off\nCannot recommend this even to the most Chess enthusiast", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197985259258", "last_played": 1475528150, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 189, "playtime_forever": 31}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1469890791, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509844", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1475529719, "recommendationid": "24616313", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very nice VR Chess game.
