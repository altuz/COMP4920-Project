You can see my earlier review below, but now that the game is out of EA I can change my recommendation to \"Yes\". The game is still a stand-your-ground wave shooter, which many people do not care for and are fatigued over, but it also isn't as expensive as most. For only $10, it's a very polished shooter with a very nice steampunk theme to it which I really like. One of the best parts of it is the local leaderboard that asks for the player's initials after every round, which makes this a great party game. My only suggestion (other than add some new weapons) would be to add in a Daily Local Leaderboard or something. Many of us will get all of the top 10 highest scores as we own this game and our VR stuff, but for the people that come over to parties and such, they are going to be new to VR and this game, so it's going to be very tought for them to even beat our lowest score on the leaderboard. Let us start with a clean slate so that friends and family have a chance.\n\n*Early Access Review* The visuals and steampunk theme are great, the shooting feels fine, the audio is cool, the enemy types are enteresting, but I still can't recommend this game as it seems that the devs have moved on. I made a post on the Steam discussions about this and they even responded talking about how they are still working on it, but that was months and months and months ago. Back when I first got this, standing, wave based shooters were par for the course in VR and this one was one of the more interesting ones, but now half way through 2017 that's just not the environment. We have shooters like Arizona Sunshine, Sairento, Serious Sam, Raw Data, Onward, Dead Effect 2, and much more.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004410106", "last_played": 1504755194, "num_reviews": 136, "num_games_owned": 576, "playtime_forever": 49}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502237768, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504815452, "recommendationid": "34114779", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
