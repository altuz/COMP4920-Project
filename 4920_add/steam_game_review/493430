Do I think it has potential? Yes I do if they are adding the complete pyriodic system you will be able to make complex molecules as well as making reactions what whill be amazing for studies and what not.\n\n[h1]So for who is this for?[/h1]\nfor chemisty enthousiast who love chemestry and would love to draw with molecules in vr. And for student looking to visualise reactions and molecules. I don't think you will enjoy this without any chemistry knowladge or intrest in chemistry.\n\n[h1]What can you do now:[/h1]\n- they have a short tutorial explaining how nano-one works.\n- You can place down C, N, H, O, P\n- you can make double,tripple bonds \n- they have a few sample molecules\n- you can paste molecules and move them around as wel as the indidual atoms\n- you can take ingame screenshots using a 'camera'\n- you can delete a molecule as well as an individual atom\n- you can draw.\n\n[h1]what I like and what I did not like[/h1]\npro:\n- being able to visualice molecules in real live\n- being able to draw what is realy handy for writing down notes or the name of a molecule\n- controls\ncons:\n- no sound\n- no scene / molecule deletion conformation I have deleted my molecule twice by acident in my small playtime what is realy frustrating\n- saving doesn't seem to work at all\n- not alot of atoms\n- no tools for spacing atoms or tools like a ruler/snap for straight lines and good looking molecules\n- not much content in general as of yet.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198093911632", "last_played": 1480849243, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 449, "playtime_forever": 46}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1478889983, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525694", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1478890012, "recommendationid": "26542098", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This has potential.
