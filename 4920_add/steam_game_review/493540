Everyone who down votes this game because of lack of action or something along those line, or comparing it to limbo or little nightmares is just wrong.  This game is not a hack and slash game so dont expect it to be that either.  I recommend trying to play it all the way through in one go, its a great wake up sunday morning and have it done by the afternoon, that being said it could be cheaper that what it is now id say 10 bucks would suffice.  this game is about the story not the action and it tells a pretty good one if i do say so myself. youll leave this game with a smile on your face.
