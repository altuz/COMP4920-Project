I'm really surprised it hasn't seen more exposure and more reviews.  Not the typical JPN bullet hell but extremely creative, fast paced, and challenging Vakyrius Prime manages to create just the right feel.  Nice enemy variety and pacing plus a credits system allows module unlocks to enhance the gameplay in later playthroughs.  Ship dodging system on the horizontal plane is wicked and the slight aiming deviance when turning the ship gives a slight feeling of Roche Fusion.   Great game and definitely worth the asking price.  \n\nNote: Global leaderboards seem to be down but hopefully this can be resolved by the dev.  Also a Tate mode and 1440p resolution option would be nice options as well.... possibly a future patch?", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197973172334", "last_played": 1498095233, "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 270, "playtime_forever": 211}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1483377750, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506904", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1483378142, "recommendationid": "28948689", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Valkyrius Prime is a cool shoot'em up with nice gameplay elements!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198294386087", "last_played": 1473185374, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 25}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1473187408, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497596", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1473271986, "recommendationid": "25384825", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A hidden gem.
