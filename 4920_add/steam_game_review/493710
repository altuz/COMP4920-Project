Laraan frames itself with a somewhat religious storyline at its opening, but it doesn't beat you over the head with that kind of content throughout the game itself.\n \nLaraan looks pretty good in motion and your character's main running animation is well-done, which you will see most often. The jump is also pretty well-animated but it does begin to look a bit strange seeing it repeated over and over. The same sound effect loops every time you use the jump, which you will be doing often, regarldess of whether you land early or not, you'll hear the same repetitive \"whoooooosh!\" to completion every time you jump. The music you hear throughout the levels are well done, however... and you see different environments often. \n\nThis game's biggest problems include the camera bugging the fuck out at times, warping super close to your character before dislodging from whatever terrain it's become stuck on temporarily (an example of how close the camera can suddenly jump, from the more pulled-back view is here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1123476606) and worse the game seeming to annoyingly (and almost game-breakingly in some ways...) gravitate you toward certain paths or anchor points as you're running or jumping.\n\nLet's say (hypothetically of course, not that I've been dying and restarting this same section over and over in the game partly due to its lame graivty-pulling during the platforming..) you are running down an area which has two parallels paths you can take, the path on the right has ceilings that drop and crush you that you have to time to run by or roll under, and on your left  are various cliffs and blades that pop out from the wall that might hit you as you're jumping. You may have your character lined up to jump forward, thinking to yourself to thread the gap between the blades on your left or land before running into the collapsing ceiling on your right, giving yourself a second to time when to move forward and risk being crushed, but then game will \"pull\" you toward a different spot as you're mid-sprint, or mid-jump in the air. It's not severe, but in certain sections (such as this 2 hallway section) it throws your character off just enough to fuck up your planned route and have you for instance drift into the blades because your character is too busy being pulled toward a spot other than where you had intended. I've seen other games do this as well, and to try to rationalize it I think it's just a way that mostly \"straight-ahead\" sequences can kind of funnel the player along the intended path to complete the level, but it's a crappy thing to encounter in other games and seeing it in Laraan is no different. \n\nIf I didn't enjoy this game's art style as much as I do, I would be less likely to recommend it for that reason. The platforming (when you aren't being affected by severe anchor points/player-funneling) can be immersive and fun. The game also strikes an interesting tone between shifting environments from feeling relaxing and open to close and menacing, which reflect its story of the afterlife well. \n\nLaraan is an interesting game with a cool concept and I love its minimalist visual style, but its technical faults can become bothersome.\n\nPS the speeder bike segment was pretty horrible.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "last_played": 1504990202, "num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 800, "playtime_forever": 74}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1504068880, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515673", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504068940, "recommendationid": "34597771", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
