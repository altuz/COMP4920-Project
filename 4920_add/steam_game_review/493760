Combats leave you very small margin of manoeuvre, no character customization, no choices in leveling up (your stats uniformly increase), no inventory (actually you can buy bonus cards at some point but frankly it is lame). You just clunkily move on a map until you encounter a foe, fight begins, tap tap tap tap, fight ends. Also it is horribly slow-paced and the most spend time that you will spend is waiting that the screen reacts to what's happening.
