This kind of quality, or lack thereof, doesn't deserve its own Steam page. This so-called game looks bad, plays bad, bad voice acting, bad mini-games that are too obtuse, difficult and lack checkpoints altogether. The sound design is inconsistent, as are the controls, interfaces, AI, pretty much everything. This game is downright broken, especially during the \"sneak\" section, where being caught once somehow removes ALL of the guards' visions - meaning you get to free roam without consequence.\n\nThis game is a horrible mess, it looks, plays and is worse than the screenshots and videos make it out to be. This game will infuriate you, disappoint you and make you question whether you should spend time playing this. This game advertises itself with a variety of mini-games and original OST, both of which are true, but the quality, the inconsistency and lack of care makes these redundant selling points as they don't fit the game and frankly are just outright terribly implemented.\n\nThough, if you're going into this expecting the game to pay some homage to actual mental patients, that's a no as well. Awakened plays on the stereotype bald-headed cellmate who has schizophrenia and the game doesn't really play on this characterisation anymore than it simply being there as a blank characteristic. 'Tis a shame, as very rarely do games explore female mental patients as the focus of narration, even on television. This game had an advantage - a way of telling a mildly interesting story, whether that be through cutscenes or something like exploration-based narration, but does neither, and nothing. Instead, it's randomly-thrown together, frankly, junk and lazy gameplay in the hopes that they all formulate together to piece together some coherent story and formula, recipe if you will, of a new breakthrough of storytelling. In plain English: just avoid this piece of shite.\n\nFor a game that looks this bad, as well, it performs just as bad. I'm using a GTX 1070, an i7 Intel quad processor and Windows 10 and this game often dips below 30fps, and rarely stabilises at 60fps. There's also NO graphical and display options - or options AT ALL - to adjust, so good luck if your monitor is too dark/bright, or if you're colourblind, or need reverse-axis on your mouse.\n\nAgain, the concept of this game initially sounds good. But that is literally as good as this gets. I'm incredibly disappointed that shite like this gets on Steam and that the developer thought this was acceptable to release. I wanted this to be some sleeper hit, or give me 90s FMV nostalgia, but instead it looks like someone threw together half-finished Unity models and made simply video recordings with terrible voice acting plastered over.\n\nAvoid. Get a refund like I did and move on, nothing to see here.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198031089250", "last_played": 1467267899, "num_reviews": 34, "num_games_owned": 1198, "playtime_forever": 68}, "votes_up": 49, "timestamp_created": 1467268666, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569057", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1467268666, "recommendationid": "23946801", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I made it like a minute into the game because it's complete trash.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198203659935", "last_played": 1467582649, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1469160729, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472511", "votes_down": 16, "timestamp_updated": 1469160729, "recommendationid": "24453393", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Played for a while now.
