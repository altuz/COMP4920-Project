The physics and controls are perfect, the design is colourful and fun as is the gameplay, offering a never seen before take on archery, with levels in which you can use your bow and arrow to do everyday tasks such as to make a pizza and deliver papers. Although it appears to be more of a game for casual gamers or those looking for a party game, it also offers competitive style gameplay to players with leader-boards, and levels such as the 'paperboy' level fall on the more challenging side of the VR archery games available. The game also has a lot of replay value, with a variety of archery levels, and there are also even more mini games hidden in the game for us to find. I have played a lot of VR archery games so far and this is one of the titles that I would recommend. The only thing it seems to be lacking is a fun soundtrack. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8Bidp-9Rok", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198334540513", "last_played": 1492623761, "num_reviews": 52, "num_games_owned": 349, "playtime_forever": 83}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499767474, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499767474, "recommendationid": "33452204", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
