I'm hoping the toons to come may help this situation.\n\nNo X-Men:\nYou can thank lawyers and licences for this. As long as Fox Entertainment holds the movie rights to the X-Men and Fantastic 4, don't expect Disney/Marvel to allow ANY kind of promotion of those characters on their part.\n\nWhat may have gone wrong?:\nDisney's true face is begining to show as they begin to push their greed and ideologies on us all.\nMy guess is Disney charged way too much to licence their characters.\n\n(Notice how Rocket Racoon and Groot are represented by their movie likeness because they aren't real people, whereas Gamora does not look like the actress who protrayed her...that would cost more than Capcom could afford.)\n\nMy guess is the game looks like this due to Capcom needing to reduce staff (animators are always first to go), probably demanding lots of unpaid overtime, all due to Disney's greedy prices for their licences, all resulting in the lack luster quality of this product.\n\nConclusion:\nI'll be keeping this game, but purley from a market research perspective.\nIf you want a good game, my suggestion, play Injustice 2.

I don't really feel satisfied with what I got and I've never played an MvC game. It's a hype game when getting into it but I don't feel attached to it in any way. \n\nI'd encourage a crack at it because it can genuinely be fun but holy hell I'm sad that I shelled 60 bucks for it. Even though I can make that 60 bucks back, it feels like I threw them into the void that was this game's complete lack of charm or memorability. \n\n\"Graphics aren't everythi--\" Yeah, let me stop you. They aren't everything but a game's aesthetics is one of the fundamental elements that emotionally affects a player during gameplay: a direct contributor to hype and replayability. When people say \"graphics aren't everything\", they usually use it to mean \"You can play P5 on PS3 and still have as much fun as on PS4\", because they're comparing straight up resolution in that case, not the fact that a game's fundamental style is bad. This game looks like crap at a lot of points in time and it ***genuinely*** takes away from the experience. \n\nAgain, I cannot stress how important aesthetics are, especially when there was already a precedent set by this series. Games are a form of art too, you know.\n\nOverall: I had a bit of fun actually playing but the presentation and asking price give this game an perpetually increasing sour taste in my mouth every waking second I'm not playing it. I feel like i could've done better with my money, but at the same time, the experience isn't exactly something I regret. Playing with a friend accounts for the hype that its presentation and policies killed off as well.\n\nI don't wish this unholy mish-mash clash of emotions on anyone.

This game has two of the same problems Amalgam had: D-Leaguer art design, and unapologetic cash-grab writing. The high point of the campaign is the bad acting. Yeah, it's bad and unnatural. Blame the writers for the bad lines. No good actor(And the cast of voice actors for this game is honestly quite stellar) could save this mess. Blame the voice director if you must. Definitely blame the accelerated development schedule that I think this game endured.\n\nOn to the gameplay. Auto-Freaking-Combos. Yes, you can input manual combos. But with the damage dropoff that's customary in fighting games with longer combo strings, there simply isn't much incentive to style the hell out of your combos when you can just spam \"X\"(assuming you're using an X-Box controller) and get the same result. It feels like a very bad decision, since the Marvel franchise is already traditionally Capcom's \"easy mode\" fight series. The one pleasant surprise is that the Infinity Stones don't feel as dopey as the gem system they experimented with in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\". At least you have to actively trigger them to get any results. The loss of the assist system turned out to be not-so-bad.\n\nI still ache for Rival Schools-style team combos for characters with a thematic synergy. Strider Hiryu and Gamora had a great cut scene stunt that should've been an in-game move. Hulk and Haggar could add some Indy-Wrestler tag team swagger to the mix. Imagine the demonic-fetishist torture move Ghost Rider and Morrigan could or would do on some hapless victim? Oh well.\n\nOn a scale of 5 tossed shuriken, this game only really hits 2 marks.

Please don't tell me I should beat the game with every character and that is worth 60$, we all know most if not all people buy fighting games to play them competitively vs other individuals. \n\nEnable cross-platform gameplay and I'll bump this review to a positive one like it should be.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 683, "steamid": "76561197981482673", "last_played": 1506959280, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 76, "playtime_forever": 683}, "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_created": 1506265437, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511630", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1506265437, "recommendationid": "35183250", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Oh my god, the roster is SO boring !!!
