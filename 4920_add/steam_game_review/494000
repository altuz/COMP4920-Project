You're on a fixed map that keeps getting filled with enemies and bonuses, and it's up to you to beat back the horde and collect as many points as you can.\n\nTo tell the truth, I bought this game because it only had on review, and it was negative. I had to give it a fair chance, and what do you know? It kicks ass. I put it right next to Agar.io, Slither.io, and Unpossible.
