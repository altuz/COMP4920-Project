After testing out all it's functionalities, I can tell you it is a bit rough around the edges and it's a game/app that is obviously in EA for a reason.  As always, when a game is is on EA, it's a risky proposition because one never knows how the game or app will grow and evolve, if it all, from its early access start.  I am reviewing this game as is, in its current state.\n\nThis game reminds me a lot of a less polished version of Mindshow, with some key differences.  I love Mindshow and it's super polished, amazing free app to make VR shows that you can upload to social media.  Unlike Mindshow, however, you cannot record your show and upload to social media and it's not as easy to use as mindshow or as polished (there's also no artificial time limit on your shows but that may not be all that good if you read on).  \n\nIn Puppets VR, you can make your own live puppet shows in VR (whether you ever will have an audience is a different question).  You can have a puppet in either hand and you can use your motion controllers to move it's mouth (open and shut), head (swivels around), and bring the puppets arms together or apart.  You will have to supply the voices and you can move the puppet around anywhere on stage.  You can customize your puppets.  There's 4 different looking puppets and you can change some features to make them more unique, such as adding a hat or eyebrows or buck teeth.  \n\nYou are behind a stage in a theatre with one or two puppets in each hand (but you can teleport out of there too).  If you only have one puppet then you can use your other hand to more easily control the stage lights, the stage curtains, get one of 4 props which you can give to your puppet and they can hold on to.  Note: I could only get the curtains to move in multiplayer and not singleplayer.  \n\nThere are two different modes, either single player or multiplayer.  In multiplayer you can create your own server where presumably people can come to watch your show.  There's a theatre full of seats where you can transport to.  Or I assume people can come and view your show from.  There's also a video recording camera which shows a vignette of your show as it is happening live.  However, I could not figure out if it records and don't know if this option exists or is planned.\n\nSo it seems that momentarily you can only create your own shows live.  And I'm not sure if anybody can actually view your show (including yourself).  However, all the mechanics are there for this to happen.\n\nObviously, more stuff is needed to make a really good puppet show.  Not only are more puppets needed (all 4 are currently humanoid).  But even more customizations are needed for each of those puppets.  There needs to be more backgrounds in your puppet stage, it's currently barren with only a curtain behind you with the logo for Puppets VR that you can open or close (you need a starry night, winter background, fall, school, etc.).  There needs to be a video recording option to your shows that you can upload to social media.  I think most people would want to do recorded puppet shows in VR versus doing live audience ones.  There needs to be more props than just the four current ones.  \n\nI'm not sure that there will ever be live audiences, other than if you can get your friends or family to come and for that to happen there does need to a free version as planned by the devs.  There also needs to be a tutorial to making your own puppet show.  Currently, you just have to figure it out for yourself.  Just do multiplayer, maybe somebody will pop in.\n\nDespite all its shortcomings, I do recommend this app/game.  Please keep in mind my criticisms.  But I actually had fun playing around with the puppets (and you will need your imagination to make it work).  I hope the devs work on making the record video option work asap.  Otherwise, we're just playing around the stage for fun.  \n\nRating 6/10 must buy if you have any interest in playing around with puppets or doing a puppet show", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1506561578, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1506563546, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512807", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506564398, "recommendationid": "35252810", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's basically your neighborhood puppet theater - in VR!\n\nThis is a really early version of the program, more features expected later.\n\nIt seems like fun, if you like puppets.  ; - )\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9etfcZFB1ew\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "steamid": "76561198264128255", "last_played": 1506561772, "num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506608701, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506608701, "recommendationid": "35263104", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
