In short, I was very impressed by just how incredible this visual novel is.\n\nI felt the visuals throughout the game were very nice. There were so many lovely CGs! And the backgrounds\u2026 I was quite impressed. They were absolutely stunning! The character designs were quite nice as well. I feel some visual novels go overboard on some of their designs, but ENIGMA seemed to have a perfect combination of unique, but still practical.\n\nThe music suited the story perfectly. It was so beautiful and haunting. In fact, when I was playing without my headphones, my roommates both commented on just how lovely the background music was. I\u2019m really glad the soundtrack is packaged in with the game, though I would have happily bought it separately if it were not.\n\nWhile these are all well and good, my biggest concern when reading a visual novel is its storytelling. And it just so happens that that category is one where ENIGMA really shines. While it\u2019s true the story starts out a little slow, it gradually introduces you to the cast and the culture of the island of Carlyle. As you complete each ending, you\u2019re given more clues and slowly you piece together the puzzle that is Enigma.\n\nThough I must admit, some of the characters are a bit flat, I felt the 'main' cast were all very well rounded. Chester in particular makes for a wonderful protagonist! I quite enjoyed getting to know more about the former soldier, and watching him interact with the rest of the cast was an incredibly fun experience.\n\nAll in all, this game had me laughing, smiling, uneasy, disturbed, and tearing up\u2014all more than once. It\u2019s such a beautiful, tragic story about hope and despair, life and death.
