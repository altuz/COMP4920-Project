Is this game perfect? No. Is it impressive? Yes. Is it worth $10? Duh. Hell, I'd happily pay $15, and reluctantly pay $20 for this. And I'm so freaking cheap it isn't funny.\n\nCome into this game knowing there's only like 5 fighters (I think. There may be more, I haven't even beat everyone yet). Don't expect there to be more. I'm not the developer, so who knows, there may be. What does matter is the fact that every fighter actually has a different feel. There could have just as easily been dozens of fighters with very slight differences, which is much lazier than what was done here and would appease anyone complaining about lack of content, but this developer decided on a quality product.\n\nThe punch force? Not perfect, but damn if it isn't still impressive that you can punch air and the game calculates something plausible, and it works pretty well. Improvements here would be awesome, but unreasonable to expect.\n\nThere are flaws of course. For starters, one of the first things I noticed is the fact that you don't really have a \"stance\". That said, these flaws are less \"the developer doesn't care\" and more \"these are the limitations with our current VR tech/dev budget/man hours\", and they are absolutely within reason and do not kill the experience.\n\nDon't go into this game thinking it's going to be a fun punching thing (like Punch-Out!!). Don't go in and expect this game to deliver the perfect fighting experience, THE definitive fighting experience for years to come (though it probably actually fits that description as of now). Go in expecting a fight simulation and a GREAT workout (seriously, my first time with this game beat my arms harder than actually punching a 100 lb bag repeatedly. This will EASILY not only replace, but kick the everloving s**t of of shadow boxing in your routine. At least, until you can honestly do 3x3 minutes rounds going all out with a minute break in between by yourself). This is a small game made by one dude or a small indie team or something, and it is impressive. Anyone who buys this game for $10 and decides that they haven't got their money's worth either came in with the wrong expectations or is just dumb. On top of that, the dev is very active still. I posted a suggestion on the forums at around midnight around here and got a reply within 5 minutes.\n\ntl;dr, Worth it. I'm excited to see where this game goes in it's early access state, but would still be happy if the dev came out tomorrow like \"Ok, it's done!\" and released it as is.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197999740790", "last_played": 1505547507, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 1539, "playtime_forever": 121}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505537394, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504505", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505548038, "recommendationid": "34987744", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Im fat...

NO PAIN NO GAIN Sorry, I got weak there for a second. Who would have thought that shadow boxing could be so much fun? I can hit him in the gut and watch him start dropping his hands a little as he tries to protect areas I'm wailing on. He goes for a left hook, I drop under and hit him with a right cross!
