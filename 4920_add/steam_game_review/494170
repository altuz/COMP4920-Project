In a somewhat typical visual novel from the get go, you play as Yasunari who is trapped in a school with your childhood friend Ayana, buddy Itsuki, and lower classman Sumika. An unknown silver haired female student seems to be connected, with the mysterious supernatural trapping and creeping memories that are best left forgotten in the past. If you can tell, it\u2019s left feeling rather lukewarm.\n\nI never found out why the school is called Miniature Garden (the theme song is called \u201cMiniature Garden of Paradise\u201d), but that\u2019s the only mystery I had to leave behind in this visual novel. Set in a secluded forest area, the school is known for its \u201cseven mysteries\u201d, and that also happens to be the number of endings to uncover. The mysteries provide fertile ground for letting the students\u2019 imagination run rampant, especially since the mysterious events usually entail an unnatural death occurring on the night of the triennial Miniature Garden festival.\n\nThis school event is keenly anticipated by all, and on this occasion we meet two close friends - Yasunari, who is like an older brother to Ayana, a sweet girl suffering from loss of memory ever since early childhood when her parents \u2018disappeared\u2019. The two clearly bonded at an early age because Yasunari happens to be in a similar position, with both parents absent from his life and his foster parents insisting on never mentioning them. Yes, it is that kind of story, and it helps if you simply suspend disbelief right from the start in order to enjoy what is an engaging, thoughtful story.\n\nInstead of scaring our group of teens, this is viewed as an exciting mystery. Well, that is, until the day of the festival arrives and each of them is knocked unconscious and locked within the school walls. Protagonist Yasunari wakes up with the memory of being hit in the back of the head but no real understanding of the situation. Where have all the other students (aside from his small group) gone? Why is it that even the windows cannot be broken to escape the school? Yasunari\u2019s friends Itsuki, Ayana and Sumika all share the same story. They know they were assaulted but can\u2019t figure out why. That\u2019s when a mysterious student named Rio reveals to them that this is absolutely related to the Miniature Festival rumors. She\u2019s somehow aware that if they do not escape the school by midnight that they will become the next group of murdered students.\n\nIt\u2019s a terrifying scenario for all involved which only becomes more dangerous as they explore. Something very odd seems to be going on within the group, and it appears that no one can be trusted. Uncovering the mystery reveals some quite odd things about the school and its history \u2013 if you can manage to finish all the endings. There are seven in all to complete (although more than half of them are considered bad endings). Bad endings primarily offer disturbing or otherwise unfortunate endings for Yasunari and company. The other three endings tend to peel back layers of the mystery to explain various facets of what\u2019s going on to players. Without finishing all endings, you\u2019ll be left hanging with many questions.\n\nSo finally we get to the most important aspect of any visual novel, the story itself and how it\u2019s delivered. There are some technical blips and drawbacks here. A consistent blip is the patchy translation. Regular grammar mistakes as well as infelicities of expression and phrasing occur throughout. While these did not amount to making the story points incomprehensible or misleading (although I had to re-read several dialogues carefully due to ambiguity), I felt that it hindered my complete immersion. The other narrative aspect that disrupted my immersion, at certain crucial points in the story, was the shifting of perspective away from the usual Yasunari first-person point of view. For example, when Rio is on her own, making a discovery, we are switched to her first-person POV. The first time this happened, I had to double-check, wondering whose voice I was reading. I think it is an ungainly, lumbering technique that breaks the flow of narrative experience, and the writers were obviously aware of this issue since these switched scenes are prominently marked in the top corner as, for example, \u201cFrom Rio\u2019s Side\u201d. Keeping a consistent third-person viewpoint (what\u2019s usually referred to as a \u2018close\u2019 or \u2018intimate\u2019 third-person POV in story-crafting terminology) would probably have worked very well for this story. The belief that first-person provides, in and of itself, a more direct and personal engagement is common, but certainly not the case when it leads to a choppy delivery at key moments. \n\nIt took me a while to get into the story properly, for the build-up is slow and you need some patience, despite the relatively short duration of a first playthrough (four hours, tops). But as the past unravels and complex relationships and events emerge, I could not help but be drawn towards the ending. There are certain elements propping up the story that will come as no surprise to readers and players of Japanese visual novels and anime, such as the ever popular nefarious organisation at highest echelons. You always get the problem that sometimes the story has to accommodate the plot devices in tales such as this one, where all the minutiae have to dovetail together and make sense, so I make allowance for that, as long as the details do all snap together satisfactorily in the end. And they do.\n\nStorywise, this isn\u2019t the worst VN I\u2019ve ever read. But it isn\u2019t the best, just okay. After playing through the game more than seven times to get the different endings, aspects of what lets the game\u2019s writing down can be boiled down to pacing and the main character.\n\nWhat makes it underwhelming is the way the main character Yasunari effectively downplays events and almost invalidates anything the other characters says and doesn't remain consistent enough for me know him as a person. Assuming he is a trouser\u2019s type of character, he\u2019s too inactive and indecisive that makes other Anime main characters who have been criticised as trouser characters rather colourful. When the story is given is prompts in making a decision, the way he acts is somewhat distracting with his reactions varying to the point it doesn\u2019t feel genuine. A let down when compared to the other characters that are genuinely interested when they\u2019re conversing together.\n\nThe seven endings are drawn out, with maybe two at most feeling genuinely good. If the game gets extra content, I would definitely revisit this again because it has the trappings and gems to make this better than mediocre at best. But when I compare this to other VNs I\u2019ve read which have dark, mystery and supernatural elements. This lacks things that\u2019d warrant a full hearted recommendation, Saya No Uta being one of the best with the above things. Maybe the art lets this down, because when I hear people die I expect to see full on massacre like images. Corpse Party, which I reviewed, really drove home the horror elements with its art. A few blood stains, but no real mid danse macabre. And just before the score, along with the final nail to the coffin is the price. I can\u2019t justify its (at time of writing) price of $14.99, when Steins;Gate and Higurashi are also available on Steam. They both offer a much longer read and better writing. Final thing to put this review to rest, that was originally going to be relatively positive. If you want a similar premise thing but with better overall content for its price, just get Danganronpa.\n\nVerdict 3/5\nIdeally, I\u2019d love to have a short visual novel like this available on my phone or other portable device; it would be perfect (with a total playtime of about eight-ten hours) for a long trip. Miniature Garden calls itself a \u201cmystery visual novel\u201d and that pinpoints exactly what it is.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198276383313", "last_played": 1496667954, "num_reviews": 164, "num_games_owned": 1974, "playtime_forever": 622}, "votes_up": 32, "timestamp_created": 1496668444, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558220", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1496668444, "recommendationid": "32198721", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's super cool.
