Here is the game in a nutshell:  it's a cute, fun, happy, sad, hilarious, tear jerking, oliver catching, heart warming, mushy moment game.

Basically Diner Dash meets Trauma Center. Definitely more challenging than Diner Dash series but less than that of Trauma Center. I picked up the game for it's promised original story that is well-written, and I wasn't disappointed. Sure, it's not as awesmazing as those story-rich games. But for a casual time management game? This is way above its peers as of now. So yes, I'm telling you, I love it.\n\nEasy to pick up mechanics and literally the same as all the other time management dash games if you've played before with the quicktime mini games add on, great audio and art, but I hated the fact the UI words don't appear properly on my screen. It's like looking at a vector image with outline but no fill colour and the outline is too thick to read. They don't have the same problem in the screenshots, so I would assume it's just me. Either way, I kind of guessed whatever was on screen. The story dialogue came out just fine so I'm alright.\n\nAnyway there's enough variety of stuff to do in each level so it's gonna keep you on your toes and eyes wide open. Not a gripping story, but strong enough to keep you intrigued, playing, and wanting to know the ending too. Just buy it, you review creeping-toms.\n\nP.S.

Personally I found it a little easier than both those games, especially Diner Dash, but it's the same general idea.  \n\nAdditionally there is a story involved in this game which gives it a little something extra.  This might annoy some people who don't want to click through dialogue, but it breaks up the motony of just plowing through timed challenge levels in my opinion.  \n\nOverall the game succeeds for me because it changes things up by offering different activities, settings, and challenges for each chapter of the game.  There are also challenge levels and a bonus goal per level that gives you something to strive for.  Another thing I appreciate is that you earn money that you can use to upgrade the items in the level to give you advantages when playing.\n\nIf you crave another Diner Dash, I highly recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024272611", "last_played": 1502325983, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 157, "playtime_forever": 796}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1502327385, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503418", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502327385, "recommendationid": "34136464", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A few weeks ago I was introduced to the Heart's Medicine sequel through a Youtuber's play through.  It reminded me of the Diner Dash games (and the likes) I enjoyed as a teenager in middle/high school.  Intrigued, I saw that the first game was on sale as part of the Summer Sale.  It was a quick buy and what a great buy it was!\n\nThe story is great and despite the dark turn some aspects take, there's a pleasant light-hearted feel you take away throughout.  Some might find it overly positive despite some subject matter, but to me personally, it never felt cheesy or over the top.  The characters are great, the dialogue is great and it gives the game a great flow.  The gameplay is great; addictive, fun and there's a decent amount of replayability, especially with regard to getting all those achievements.  \n\nMy qualms with the game are small, but they involve control on the mac.  Since I wasn't using a controller, the mousepad had some buggy moments.  I am resigned to the fact I'll never get some achievements because pulling out glass shards with a mac mousepad doesn't work.  \n\nVerdict:  A game I wholeheartedly recommend and have no shame admitting to playing over 30 hours on :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198165837142", "last_played": 1500428065, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_forever": 2185}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500507368, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500713", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500507368, "recommendationid": "33661650", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I adore this game.

I was looking forward to more of the DE addictive gameplay and ludicrous storylines. This game disappointed me.\n\n Instead of the insane sitcom plot of Delicious Emily, we get a semi-sane hospital-drama plot. A plus or a minus depending on how much you like helping your boyfriend / hospital director ditch his opioid habit via cutesy casual gameplay. Find all the pill bottles in time for a bonus!\n\nMore importantly - the gameplay is heavily loaded with minigames. Run the patient through the x-ray machine in under 5 seconds for a minor bonus! Set all the dislocated bones in 3 seconds, or the patient starts losing hearts!\n\nSo, if the Delicious Emily gameplay had a minor emphasis on reflexes, and a heavy emphasis on planning things out so that you take the optimal route and serve as many customers at once before they start losing patience, Heart's Medicine is the opposite of that. Most of the time, the optimal strategy is to serve each patient as quickly as possible when they come in, and pray you don't mess up the minigames. Do that, and the \"serve several patients in a row\" bonuses are mostly irrelevant (except for checkouts). \n\nSince my reflexes aren't exactly great, I found the gameplay to be pure torture. \n(Edit - you can pass each level and go on with the plot regardless of how well or poorly you've done. Getting three stars + bonus challenge + captured guinea pig [yes, really] per level is just a matter of earning trophies, which I usually don't care about. But... there's really no point in making any sort of effort to play the game if you're not going to ace every level, since that's the only challenge you'll find)\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197978806930", "last_played": 1498917690, "num_reviews": 95, "num_games_owned": 1143, "playtime_forever": 910}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499591033, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501980", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1499591033, "recommendationid": "33398419", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
