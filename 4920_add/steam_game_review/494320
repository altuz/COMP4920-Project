But I cannot recommend it to you as of the above date. A little ironic?\n\nLong story short, it is because of the bugs.\n\nShort story long...\n\nBug 1. After 100+ hours of game play. I have yet to find ONE single piece of equipment from monster/chest drops. Yup, you heard me right, absolutely no drops at all from all the dungeon crawling I've done so far (including dungeons with \"possible boss drop of equipment\" explanation on them). So I am still stuck with the equipment that the shop sells (and some equipment that the Rare and Super Rare adventurers start with).\n\nBug 2. After you class change, you will lose your already learned spells of the previous class. The best thing about the classic Wizardry was that you keep your old spells, so you can make a magic-using-fighter, a healer-thief, etc. But not until this is fixed.\n\nBug 3. All other class seems to be leveling up fine, but the Ninja class is gaining 1 HP (Hit Points) per level! My Mage could take more damage than my Ninja... not good.\n\nThe above bugs are my main concerns for those who want to play this game.\nAs mentioned, if the bugs were fixed, I would highly recommend this game to people who enjoy dungeon crawling RPGs.\n\n\n=== Personal likes/dislikes ===\n\nI recently bought this game WITH the above bugs and played it thus far. This is how enjoyable it is.\nThe below is a personal preference!\n\nLikes\n1. Very simple input. No difficult key memorization. Mouse only command.\n2. The old Wizardry classes\nFighter, Lord, Samurai, Mage, Priest, Bishop, Thief, Ninja\n3. Beautiful icon/figurine gives you the pen and paper, table top RPG, name it what you want, old school feeling.\nEach class has 4 tier upgrade system and each tier has a better looking figurine\nTier 1: max level ~15 (common)\nTier 2: max level ~30 (uncommon)\nTier 3: max level ~45 (rare)\nTier 4: max level ~99 (super rare)\n\nDislikes\n1. Too simple input. Mouse only command. Doing absolutely everything with a single mouse click will strain your finger.\n2. Only weapon equipment slot. Armor is pre-determined and upgrades when you 'tier up'. No trinket, rings, helmets, gloves, boots, pants, etc.\n3. You cannot create your own adventurers. They are random, although you may change the name, the race/class/alignment/portrait are all fixed. So if you want a certain race, a certain class, a certain alignment, with a certain protrait.... get ready to farm A LOT like I have. I still have yet the exact combination of party members I would like to have. ;)\n4. No C (common), UC (uncommon) female adventurers.\nFrom my experience so far, only Rare and Super Rare female adventurers are available.\nAnd they are very rarely available through Elite Currency (the very slow but farmable WizJewels) and further on in the scenario. And still there seems to be only a few, and all seems to have a fixed class at the time of this writing.\n5. The portrayal of some races\nHuman, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Porklu\nThe three races I play are Human, Dwarves, and some Elves. I sell the Gnomes and Porklu Adventurers on sight. More explanation later.\n6. The back-row of 3 adventurers have very limited actions.\nYou take a turn, enemy takes a turn, etc.\nOn your turn, you can chose to attack with the 3 front row adventurers (if in melee range) or use a single spell or let loose an arrow (melee or ranged). Almost all the time, it is difficult to over-damage your front row with a single spell.\n7. A lot of the spell names and description does not match each other. For example, in the classic Wizardry, a locate person spell would be useful to find your lost adventurers because if your party wiped out, you would need another party to look for them!, but Wizrogue is much more forgiving and don't need such a spell, but it exists and what it does is even more intriguing.... it 'Reveals enemies, chests, items, and stairs on the current floor.'. Some spell names need fixing.\n\nAgain, these are my personal thought...\nA picture is worth a thousand words.\nNow go and look at the screen shot #7 on this page.\nIt should be the last screenshot with the 10 adventurers on it.\n1st adventurer named Lythgoe. He is a Porklu male.\n4th adventurer named Lucraft is an Elven male.\n6th adventurer named Dunbar is an Elven male.\n10th adventurer named Condren is Lucrafts twin brother.\nThe 5th adventurer named Sandy is a Dwarven male.\nI had a Viviane(?), an Elf, who I used for quite some time until I realized it was a He.\nSo, if you like this kind of adventurers in your party, that's fine. But this is definetly not for me.\n\n[h1]=== conclusion ===[/h1]\n\nAlthough there are more dislikes than likes, I really like this game.\nThis is just to show you what kind of game to expect as I didn't know most of the things I wrote here until I actually bought and played a few hours. You will know what to expect. =)\n\nIf the bugs are fixed, I highly recommend this game for the dungeon crawlers like me, who likes farming and grinding, building their adventurers, class changing to increase their HP, then again for Priest spells, perhaps again for Mage spells, then finally changing to their desired final class.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198281568815", "last_played": 1497505378, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 8223}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1494164873, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522039", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499677345, "recommendationid": "31604577", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So far a really fun little dungeon crawler with a nice D&D tabletop feel.
