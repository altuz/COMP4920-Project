I can now say that I would recommend this game. Good job dev!\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nI really was looking forward to a VR bowling game, and this seem to fit the bill. Unfortunately, after trying it out, I can't say I'm satisfied with the experience. Here are my findings:\n\n- The sound of everything was just wrong. The ball rolling sound was just a very short ball roll sound on loop. The pin being hit sound activates regardless of if you hit the pins or not. \n- Menu was clunky. The slider mech just didn't work very well and entering your name is a nightmare. Perhaps a bigger keyboard or a pointer mech of some kind would be better.\n- Game placed the play area in a way where the room bound was the start of the lane. Although this make sense in practice to avoid people from walking up the lane, it doesn't feel very natural bowling-wise. It's more intuitive if the room bound was set a little into the lane so you can walk all the way up to the start of the lane and throw your ball without hitting the wall with your controller.\n- Player adding is not intuitive. You have to press the + button or else the player isn't added. If no player is added, you're still allowed to press the Bowl button that starts a game, but the game doesn't do anything. If the name field is not blank when you press Bowl, that name should just automatically be added, especially if it's just one player. Also, the Bowl button should be disabled if there is no one in the list.\n- Ball mechanic is buggy. The ball can potential be stuck in the middle of the lane if thrown too slow. I know there is a button to reset the ball, but the game should just do this automatically.\n\nI will change my review in the future when these issues are addressed. Although I fully support the developer in his effort and believe the game has potential, in it's current state, I can't say I can recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025009083", "last_played": 1466786341, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_forever": 9}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1466787830, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1466869899, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506173", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1466888275, "developer_response": "Thank you for the feedback. To adress some of the issues you had.\n\n- Sound: This is an area that needs work, we understand that, the issue with the pins sound playing when nothing is hit is a bug that happens when the ball nicks a pin, but does not fully collide. Otherwise, the criticism is well noted.\n\n-Menu: The slider mechanic was adjusted and the keyboard was made much larger. These should be much more functional now.\n\n-Play Area: The play area bounds were adjusted to better fit the minimum 2.5x1.5 room size and subsequently larger play areas should have more room going past the alley.\n\n- The plus button was removed for a more explicit add bowler. The bug that let you hit bowl before adding a player has been fixed as well.\n\n- Buggy Ball: This was partially a design choice, to allow the player as much flexibilty with where they throw it as possible, but the ball stopping entirely was a bug with how friction was applied and will be fixed soon.\n\nThank you for the feedback. It was a very solid criticism of the initial release and we will work hard to adress the other issues we haven't already.\n", "recommendationid": "23762375", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very fun game to stand up and play.
