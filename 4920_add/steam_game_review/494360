Loved it then, love it today.\n\nBarrow hill strikes a careful balance in all ways. It relies heavily upon the player reading and drawing conclusions, yet it never feels overwhelming. The playable area is large and a beast to navigate at first, but not too large and you quickly realize where to go.\n\nThe vast majority of puzzles are fair and interesting, some however.. let's just say I did not know hair tonic could be used that way. On top of that some items are hidden in almost cruel ways, if I hadn't stumbled across that matchbox I would likely still be tearing my hair out.\n\nAll this said, I would heartily recommend this to any adventure gamer that prefers to have a notepad handy. It's a most enjoyable ride.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197999246473", "last_played": 1499819824, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 264, "playtime_forever": 301}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1499819964, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503333", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499819964, "recommendationid": "33468575", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
