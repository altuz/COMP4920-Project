Lots of these will be mentioned below, but I need to be VERY CLEAR: These are not large or serious problems. Some impact the game, but don't stop it being good fun. Please please please don't let the negative comments here drive you away from the game - it is merely how I would like to see it improve and it's weaknesses, not to say the game isn't good.\n\nThe weapons are my least favourite part at the moment. I'm told new UK-based servers have been launched which I have yet to try, which is where I'm based so my ping should dramatically improve compared to the game's original US-only ones. This should hopefully help with some of the issues I've had as I'm sure some are due to the expected 170ms+ ping. However, the weapons sometimes seemed to not fire and provide an electrical blast instead. This was really frustrating as there were times this happened that I needed to shoot back and died as a result. This is the same that happens when the weapon has run out, but happened when it was fully green. The two overheat quickly and look very simple, while the grenade seems a bit awkward to throw. The developer has commented on reddit that this will be improved.\n\nThe gameplay is great. Teleporting around to dodge enemy shields and large groups of drones is just fun. I really don't like how you can't easily get close to walls; standing around a corner and poking your head out for a firefight is one of the best parts of VR FPS IMO. It simply isn't possible in this game unless you're willing to stand a metre away from the cover. However, the drones keep you on your toes when not engaging enemy players, the turrets are powerful and to be feared and players feel like a fair fight each time, though the shield is pretty tough. My main wish to improve the way it works is player buildable defences. Let us customise the map each time! Make every game a little different, let teams  pick where to invest their resources (upgrading turrets, walls, shields, repairs etc).\n\nThe game also lacks any sort of tutorial, so it's a bit of trial and error to understand the mechanics.\n\nRight now, I honestly feel this is one of the best FPS experiences in VR, period. It's got some serious flaws which I have no doubt will be addressed, but it feels polished, looks amazing and has a very active developer. I hope it will be expanded to offer larger teams, more to do in the maps etc to bring it up to some of the '2D' MOBAs out there, but the FPS element is fun enough to justify the price.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024077707", "last_played": 1469466825, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 187, "playtime_forever": 119}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1468361394, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507453", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1468361394, "recommendationid": "24283719", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Orbital Strike: Arena is a very solid fps experience. The servers felt like they had very low ping and the few weapons that are available right now are enjoyable to use.\n\nIf you like battledome this game is similar in that it is a multiplayer fps, HOWEVER at the moment it doesn't have the games that battledome does such as TDM, King of the Hill, ect. instead it has a game mode that I can only express as a fusion between a FPS and a MOBA such as League of Legends or DOTA.\n\nEach team has four primary turrets right on the inside of their wall and two stations that produce reinforcment drones. Once a team gets past those there is another bubble that contains two more turrets and the primary objective. You will need to work with your team to fight through the drones and take out these objectives in order to push into the enemies base.\n\nVery solid and fun experience and with it being a multiplayer FPS the replay value is amazing. I know that I will be spending a lot of time in this game between new releases.\n\n(Linked below is a gameplay commentary that I did for Orbital Strike: Arena so if you are interested in seeing what the gameplay is like then check it out and let me know what you think!)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=723390301", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043450023", "last_played": 1468372641, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 74}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1468366023, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507603", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1468366023, "recommendationid": "24284886", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Random painful deaths and I'm still not sure if I can shoot through the personal shield you can pick up.  The way you communicate needs to change, I kept hearing \"I need help\" or \"attacking to the right\".  And I kept thinking, what annoying bastard is doing that?  Turns out it was me, it is way way too easy to send messages because it is connected to the way you teleport around the map.  Suggestion to the developer - use the menu key or something.  It'd also be nice to know how much longer until I respawn when I die, maybe there is and I just haven't figured it out yet.\n\nOther than that, there seems to be only one map.  There are these permanent shields in certain places that you can't shoot through and that you can't be shot through, you seem to need to teleport through them in order to battle the things behind them.  \n\nThe outside of your base has 2 stationary guns per bot factory.  2 bot factories and 4 stationary guns total on the outside that you can destroy or have destroyed that don't end the game.  Then the main base (what you spawn behind) has three stationary guns and a main building that can't be destroyed.  The object of the game is to destroy that building on the other team's side before they destroy yours.\n\nThe bots seem to just be there to kill and annoy the players, I played at night with no one else on and they couldn't take down any of the stationary guns on their own or destroy the final base on their own even if the enemy bot factories were destroyed.  That's it, that's the game, 3 v 3 or 6 total vive users seems to be the max at one time on these maps.\n\nThere seem to be 4 total items you can use, and you can hold two extra of each of these items on your belt.  Grenades which I'm pretty sure you can kill yourself with (which annoyed me), a hand held shield, a single shot gun that seemed to be pretty powerful if you've got good aim and an automatic weapon that didn't seem to be as powerful but shot a lot more bullets.\n\nIt is a ton of fun, don't listen to the negative reviewers, it is worth it if you like battle dome or want to play a vive game in an online multiplayer kind of base defense game.  It may be a bit expensive at 15 bucks, but we are still at the beginning of VR multiplayer, and this is something that has been done right and I hope will grow in depth and the number of players that can be online in a single match.

There was a couple of times where I could connect to a server and for a few minutes things were good, but once more than two people were in the game, nothing was responding well.  I tried all the US servers (as I am in the US).  Not sure what the backend is here (Photon maybe?  I don't usually see problems with Photon servers though)\n\nFinally, while not as egregious as the above, I wasn't a fan of the gunplay mechanics.  I don't like not having control over when a reload happens - and in VR with tracked controllers, doing a 'manual' reload is much more fun than waiting for a timer to complete. The grenades never worked for me - but then again, I'm thinking this was because of the server performance issues I was having, they would fly out but not explode (at least, I never saw them explode on my client).\n\nThe amount of content that is here does not justify the price - yet.  The concept is solid but it still needs some work.  As with battledome, I'm not sure where I sit on the teleport mechanic in a VR shooter - waiting to teleport is really frustrating, and a huge part of '2D' shooters is fluidity of movement, teleporting makes the action feel stilted.\n\nIn its current state, and with the amount and quality of content that's available at this price, I can't recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198021404511", "last_played": 1468385004, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 199, "playtime_forever": 48}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1468386150, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498759", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1468386259, "recommendationid": "24289044", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A fantastic game.
