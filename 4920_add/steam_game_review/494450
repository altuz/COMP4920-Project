It's complete trash. It's not worth it even if it was free. This game promotes harassment and abuse. Whenever the mc says anything she is immediately shut done and told it's her fault. That is NOT ok! I've never been more angry at a game in my life. Some how I made it through all the routes and they all have some form of abuse, harassment, and/or even sexual assult. \n\nNot to mention the story is boring. There is no character depth at all. All this characters could pretty much be the same person with slight variations. There isn't any real character development or reason for playing. The art is alright but the cgs are pretty much all the same. The music was so annoying I shut it off because I couldn't listen any more. \n\nI highly suggest you save your money.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198251524140", "last_played": 1502135675, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_forever": 1132}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502206052, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502206052, "recommendationid": "34105800", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I didn't  plan to write anything after finishing the game 'cause I found it very much like other Dogenzaka games I bought in a bundle. But I found so many negative reviews so I couldn't leave it as it is. Really what's wrong with your attitude? Why do you think it so bad and full with harassment? I enjoyed the game! Even laughed sometimes. I personally find all characters cute,in different ways, but still very charming and all storylines were interesting. I agree that some guys were... let it call pushy, sometimes their behaviour irritated me a bit, I even got only one best ending choosing the options I felt were right to choose in those circumstances. And it's not a problem, all possible endings were quite interesting. \n\nAs for so many reproaches of harassment, men were never mean or cruel, too bossy sometimes but that was quite understandable remembering their position. I personally especially enjoyed Kaido route, and I guess he was the most sadistic type:) But it impressed me greatly when his sincere straightforward nature was compared to sweet and fake behaviour with everyone else. I'd really prefer frank even a bit rude attitude especially when he did so much for the protagonist's development. \n\nI can't help but gonna whine again about the same negative moments. 1. Full screen mode makes the picture blurred, well I mean the quality is so much worse that again I had to play it on a little screen(((( 2. A lot of mistakes in an English version\n\nBut thanks for one thing which was absent in Yoshiwara games: we got even three pages to save the progress. And it's really great! Thanks a lot! Because it's nice to compare the percentages of all possible endings of all characters! \n\nSo, thanks again for your game!
