Even Akira, the supposed \u201cgentleman\u201d, was very bland to me)[/spoiler]. The art is okay, but it gets rather annoying to see only CGs of the guys kissing the faceless MC. The BGM\u2026 Good god, it\u2019s so bad! It\u2019s only 1 or 2 songs looping forever and ever and making you want to rip off your ears. I had to mute the game in order to keep playing it. \n\nThe story is simple: the MC gets a job in the show business and she gets to know one of the guys better. That\u2019s it. In my opinion the problem with this game isn\u2019t how simple the plot is, it\u2019s how fast things happen; It takes only 1 or 2 chapters for the characters to fall in love and to act jealous around each other. There\u2019s no depth here, just the \u201cah I just met you and therefore I love you more than anything (and I might treat you like garbage because that\u2019s the way I express my affection)\u201d thing. Well, if you\u2019re really desperate to play a girl x boy VN and you don\u2019t mind all that, this game might be for you. But get it only on a sale, seriously. It\u2019s not worth paying the full price. I enjoyed Taiga\u2019s route a bit and I [b]hated[/b] Kei\u2019s route. [spoiler]That man is a f*cking psycho. And the MC is very annoying in his route\u2026 She literally faints during their sex scene because apparently it was \u201cvery intense\u201d. YEAH RIGHT[/spoiler]\n\n3/10. Boring story, shallow characters, terrible music\u2026 You can get better otome games than this one.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198120348301", "last_played": 1504264793, "num_reviews": 385, "num_games_owned": 791, "playtime_forever": 799}, "votes_up": 30, "timestamp_created": 1506119213, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560245", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506119213, "recommendationid": "35139017", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}]}
