The price point is fantastic and the graphics are amazing, but the sword combat is awful.

It seems like most places you can't travel to for no reason what-so-ever. \n\nOverall this game could be great, but needs a lot of polish.

I found myself getting extremely frustrated with the animations.  You can't tell if an enemy is blocking or vulnerable, and even if they are blocking on the left, a sword swing from the right often just does nothing, allowing the rest of the horde to close in while you're flailing at an enemy you're not sure will die.  Also, I died to being stabbed through my shield a few times by the bigger orcs.  \n\nIt could be that I'm just doing something wrong, but it'd be nice if the devs made the animations more clear so that i can be sure that dying was my fault and not a fault of the game.\n\nI would still recommend the game for now because it is reasonably priced and mostly fun (barring the bs deaths)  This game could be great, and it looks like the devs are hard at work towards getting it there.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198092633554", "last_played": 1482976318, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 148, "playtime_forever": 47}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1482977098, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497957", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1482977098, "recommendationid": "28774370", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Some things to note\n\n-Blocking the \"bigger orcs with HP numbers\" is hit or miss on my end even if my shield is up and am on flat ground against the enemy.
