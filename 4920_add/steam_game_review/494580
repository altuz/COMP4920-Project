What you see in the trailer is what you get.\n\nTo fully beat the game, you need to clear every level in two ways (separately or at the same time if you're a speed god): by collecting all gems and by going faster than a set time, which is usually very tight. \n\nThere's several semi-hidden mechanics that will help you go faster, but also make the levels more tricky to clear due to fast speeds.\n\nOverall a much more solid game from the dev of Barrier X, I got what I expected and it was a very sweet experience :^)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198055814197", "last_played": 1496450524, "num_reviews": 70, "num_games_owned": 532, "playtime_forever": 278}, "votes_up": 31, "timestamp_created": 1496574655, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564848", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1496574655, "recommendationid": "32173698", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a difficult but rewarding game.
