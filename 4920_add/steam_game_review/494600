Story is standard, if a little generic. Graphics are pretty, animations are stiff but get the job done. Gameplay is superb for beat-em up fans, lots of \"Get all the S ranks\" in this game.\n\nI recommend it to fans of 2D fighters, beat-em ups, platinum games as a company, and Ska Studios titles.\n\nIMPRESSIONS:\nThis game is fantastic. I'm a huge fan of sidescrolling beat'em ups. One of my all time favorite games is Dungeon Fighter Online, as well as Dragon's Crown on the Playstation 3. To give you a basic idea of what my taste is,\n\nMy top 5 games as of this review:\n\n1.Monster Hunter\n2.Dark Souls\n3.Dragon's Crown\n4.Dungeon Fighter Online\n5.Metal Gear Franchise\n\nWith that as a base line for what I like, here's my thoughts on the game.\n\nSTORY:\nNot much to say here, without any real spoilers, Aliens are a thing, they're bad, humans almost went extinct except they didn't because super tech happened based on aliens. Now mankind bounces back, with the help of YOU! Hijinks and planet eating aliens insue from this series of events.\n\nIt's a standard fare with an anime style Sci-Fi. Basic, to the point, mostly a setup for the game. No awards here.\n\nSOUND:\nSoundtrack is a standard deal here as well, mostly electric and synth, combat sounds good. Guns have decent bang and boom to their noise, blades feel nice, attacking gives you different sounds based on if you hit a CRITICAL or a back attack, or if you BREAK the opponent. Good feedback here, music is plain.\n\nGood job on the combat noise, not so much on the soundtrack.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nWhat you see is what you get, nice particles, good character sprites and the enemies all look cool. Despite their messy looking details, they stand out easily. The \"Trooper\" tyle enemies stand out amongst all the others, and you can tell them apart from the rest in a crowd. Explosions and bodyparts go flying, honestly if you like the look of the screenshots, you won't be disappointed. The whole game looks like that. \n\nI personally like it, so great work here.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe gameplay to me is pretty straight-forward, you have two buttons. One for each hand, then you can jump, boost, and use the \"EXCEED\" ability, which is a fancy name for rage mode. The fun comes when you learn how to start juggling enemies, chaining certain attacks with bullets, knocking an enemy in the air, striking them 5 or 6 times, then stopping just before your slam dunk attack, and shooting them with your gun to keep them floating in the air, boosting under them and repeating the process with any variation you choose. The combat is what I love this game for, it's really well done. Simple buttons, grand experience. \n\nThis is the meat of the game, and my favorite part of the whole product. (Perhaps, arguably the ONLY part of the product)\n\nHOW IT ALL COMES TOGETHER:\nThe way the game plays, you start in a menu of customize, craft, settins and missions. You always return to this menu after a mission, you only fight in missions. You can recieve items and rewards for your own use in crafting new gear, and since each and every enemy drops their own materials, this adds a nice level of learning \"Gotta kill this creature to get his claws\" in order to build new equipment. Each mission has it's own individual objective, ranging from \"RACE TO THIS SPOT\" to \"Kill everything ever\"\n\nYou can find these blue orbs in the stage similar to coins or rings in Mario or Sonic respectively, except in this game, they boost your maximum \"Skill Capacity.\" As you kill enemies, you get Experience points to level up, which boosts your characters stats over-all. However, you also get this blue substance that boosts your \"Skill Capacity\" Missions can rewards you with stat boosts that you spend this maximum capacity to activate on whatever loadout you are using. These abilities range from Stat boosts, resistances to certain ailments, bonuses based on situations and equipements, and brand new attacks and movement / combat options.\n\nThe other options on the menus is customization, which is where you use the money (energy is the currency) you've earned to upgrade your gear, or make entirely new gear. There are ways to customize their stats with elements and status debuffs. You can also unlock and craft new cosmetic items, although these are fairly limited. This is a fun feature, and I enjoy it's use in the game. \n\nSettings is standard, graphics options are limited, multi-language support, all voice acting is japanese only, resolution and effects changes are available. Nothing special here.\n\nOVERALL:\nI'm a fan of this game, and I wanted to buy it on Playstation 4 for a long while now, however the $30 price tag kept me from doing so. However, I never knew it came out on steam, and the moment I found it then saw the price at $15 on sale, I jumped on it.\n\nI am so glad I did. This game is so worth that price to me. If you're looking for a recommended price from someone who likes this game, I'd say it's worth around:\n\n$15 - $30\n\nThe game is priced JUST RIGHT for me to say it's worth the money.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198005774861", "last_played": 1499583338, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 379, "playtime_forever": 588}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1499422679, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517558", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499422679, "recommendationid": "33338633", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "modern style, moderate difficulty H&S. not bad.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049051844", "last_played": 1500787466, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 449, "playtime_forever": 70}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1500787584, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509230", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500787584, "recommendationid": "33736660", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I recommend this game, but not at 30 dollars. Get it on sale for at least 50% off.\n\nThe TLDR: This game is diet Monster hunter. It has all the concept sthat make the game fun, but none of the concepts that make the game great.\n\n\nStory: Nothing inspiring. Typical invasive alien/monster/demon/etc comign tod estory humanity, then we fight back and win. The game attempts to create a more serious in depth story with the commander or general's videos where he's slowly losing his mind. I'm sure translation is a factor here, but it jsut wasn't interesting and felt basic.\n\nVisuals: the visuals are solid. When it come sto platformers, visuals are very important to me. For the most part, I liked the visuals. The armors all look cool, the weapons look cool, the enemies have good detail. However, the female playable character is off. Where the males look like bad ass soldiers in armor, the females look dead or souless. Like their head was attached to an android body, or they're combat dolls or something. I played through as a male, then switched to female when the game ended and it asked me to choose a new body. Armor visuals are very different for males and female, down to there 3ven being gender based armors, which was kind of disappointing. Other than the females, though, I enjoyed the visuals.\n\nAudio: I don't know Japanese, so id idn't realyl lsiten tot he voice acting. The action sounds do their job, but nothing about them realyl stood out. The music isn't bad. Honestly, not the game's strongest point, but also one of the elast important aspects.\n\nGameplay/combat: This is realyl what saved the game. The game doesn't bring anything new to the table in terms of gameplay, but all of it's mechanics are implimented well. The game is fun, and if you're a monste rhunter fan waiting for the next one to come out, this can help fill that a little. lots of bonus missions for 100%ers, and plenty of reasons to need to do them (crafting). This genre likes grinding, a little, and the game does a good job of giving the player a reason to grind without creating a huge amount of grind time. \n\nThe Bosses are all fun to fight, and had different mechanics for each. Plus, there's an easy, normal, and hard version of every mission (including story missions.) with better rewards for higher difficulty. The different weapon styles all -felt- different int heir execution, and were introduced witht ime to let the player try out the weapona nd see if it fits them. The only weapon I didn't try was the bow. That said, the de3vs were lazy with basic enemies. Within the first few levels you've fought every non boss enemy in the game. fromt here on they just change their color and give them elements. A little disappointing, but the focus on this game is on the bosses, which are well done.\n\nVeterans of this genre will not find this game to be a challenge. There are a few places I had to do a couple times, but for the most part the game was more fun than challenging.\n\n\nRATING: 7/10\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988320497", "last_played": 1499595969, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_forever": 1004}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499720169, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499965", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499720169, "recommendationid": "33440629", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
