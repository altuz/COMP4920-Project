I also could not find any official website where I could learn more about them or where they showcase their talents, future projects etc.\n\nThe game is set in the year 2070 where apparently we will be testing artificial intelligence in nearly a Glados type of way, moving 'Android John' from one test chamber to another by getting him to walk up to a console, change certain inputs so that the environment changes and allows him a clear path to the 'winzone' (an exit portal).\n\n25 levels are available here with each one introducing a slightly different obstacle. While the first level is easy, the 2nd level and some others will have you perplexed as the inputs aren't always obvious. Many times there is no help as to what you should enter into the spots where you should. And once you are stuck there really is nothing else to do. Fortunately for you though, I have been through the entire game and have discovered which inputs are necessary. This means that people who purchase this game from now on can be assured that they should be able to reach the eventual end which unfortunately is rather lacklustre in comparison to some early levels.\n\nWhile the game claims that it will teach you programming, personally the little that it did teach me was  rather trivial and because the game set up is rather dictated in what it allows you to enter, you don't get to see the results of the variables which you do place into the programme, instead it will just state 'bad code logic', which is annoying as more often than not regardless of it being bad code logic it should still be demonstrated for your benefit in why it was bad coding. Alas it does not and your left with trivial lessons instead like writing 'true' instead of 'false' etc.\n\nStill I did enjoy what little was on offer here, but i do understand why people have been very negative about the game as it definitely could have been implemented a lot better. Still it's only their 3rd game and it was something that was refreshingly unique so for that reason alone I will give it a thumbs up.\n\nBelow is a sample for you. Hope it helps if you would enjoy this or not.\nhttps://youtu.be/fwdOts1adZY?list=PLGoldgfYpB4D3kBTIR1-3SA1jGKPFZcVC", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198112866114", "last_played": 1498539267, "num_reviews": 183, "num_games_owned": 2624, "playtime_forever": 737}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1498375846, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514265", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498375846, "recommendationid": "32760354", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
