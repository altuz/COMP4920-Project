Fast paced and really dynamic, Eliosi's hunt successfully preys the player's attention to explore good-looking maps while fighting off enemies. The visuals are as great as the soundtrack, which fit nicely to each stage design. The difficulty and enemies' reactions are at a good level and the search for collectibles is fair and fun. I haven't completed the character's upgrades, but they do add differences in the gameplay, which affects replayability, even more if you're a completionist or a speedrunner. About the controls, they're very responsive and the game feels both fluid and intuitive.\n\nDevs do support the players and are active on forums listening to the players. Price is great and very accessible. Cutscenes with eye-candy 3D models is a big plus in this game as well.

It can be hard sometimes, but it's almost always your fault when you die. I really liked the platform/action mix. I can't remember the last time I had this much fun with a top down shooter! It gets especially better after the first level.\n\nThe upgrading system after each level is simple and to the point. Boss fights are fun. \nThere're a few problems in my opinion but they're minor and doesn't spoil the overall experience. Such as some foregrounds scene object getting in the visual way too much in a few places. \n\nAnd the production values such as the cut scenes, the overall game polish and all are far better than expected for this price!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198073975602", "last_played": 1504724291, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 106, "playtime_forever": 269}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1502990331, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499429", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1502990331, "recommendationid": "34311408", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very diferent from the top down shooters, pretty cool and fun.
