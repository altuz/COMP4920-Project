It plays like some sort of calvinball-chess, each tile having its uses and drawbacks, and you need to use all of them as the insectoid enemies swarm the board and overwhelm you. I enjoy the strategic aspect as much as I enjoy its throwaway nature - if I'm not feeling particularly motivated I'll throw this on for a few minutes and play around, but when I really focus on it I'm pushing to try and get the highest score I can, working out the best combination of tiles and upgrades to keep the swarm at bay.
