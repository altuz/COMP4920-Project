I think it\u00b4s a nice concept and it makes fun so far. You can\u00b4t expect too much, but the dev is honest and wrote a good description what he is planing here on the store page. \nActual status: \"Early Access will allow players to hop into the MageWorks world in its current form as a magic playground to casually test spells and explore environments.\u201d \nIf he is honest with one year of development until leaving the Early Access status and if he is using this time good it could get a really great game I think. I liked it more than A Legend of Luca because the environment is really nice and it has some hard to describe fun factor for me. \nBut again, it\u00b4s Early Access, you can\u00b4t even fight atm with the enemies. The enemies direct outside of the castle are only targets for testing spells. The others in the first place also, in the second place they notice you but are shooting in a different direction and in the third one they come and beat you but they are not making damage. But the fight system is really nice and the spells are cool and well made. Made a lot of fun and I\u00b4m really looking forward to play the finished game.\n\nPro \n-nice environment \n-nice spells and good targeting \n-cool concept \n-it\u00b4s hard to descripe, I liked the way it is :-)\n\nContra \n-short and not much content atm \n\nPossible bugs \n-had some stuttering, but Steam VR was making problems half of the day, so maybe no problem for you \n-I fallen two times in the floor while teleporting back to castle\n\nI will keep it and hope that the dev is nobody that is making cash and then doesn\u00b4t deliver more content. If you want to play a game NOW don\u00b4t buy it. If you want to support the dev and giving him the possibility to hopefully put more time on it you can give it a try if you ask me.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009054216", "last_played": 1469210680, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 191, "playtime_forever": 48}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1469212768, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513872", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1469212768, "recommendationid": "24464445", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Good starting foundation.  Enough fun with the spells and limited exploration to warrant the 4.99 buy in and support development price.\n\nIn my limited playtime so far, I'm a bit put off by the cartoony alien looking monsters. The rest of the game has such a good basic feel I'm not sure why you went with that - I'd much rather see a variety of traditional advasaries.\n\nCombat has quite a bit of room to improve, everything is one shot dead - extremely basic combat mechanics.\n\nIf you are going to include the basic hunter/gatherer premise that would add some value, not sure what I'm supposed to be looking for beyond spells?\n\nOverall in July this is a game that I feel is good fun at this price.  By December it will need to be expanded on greatly or like many other of these recent early releases I fear it could be lost in the sea of developed upcoming games.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018503428", "last_played": 1498693500, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 76, "playtime_forever": 61}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1469209320, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508414", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1469209320, "recommendationid": "24463449", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is still too rough for me, so I can't recommend it.\n\nThe concept is nice, and the ideas presented by the developer sound fun\nbut until it gets more fleshed out I don't see myself playing this any more.\n\nIt's also riddled with bugs and glitches.\nHighlighted items staying highlighted forever, the pages of my book were\nstuck far outside of the bindings for a while, switching books didn't work half the time\nand the teleporting is very fiddly.\nI'm also floating 2ft off the ground, which could probably be solved by a room calibration, but is\ndefinetly a problem with the game itself since my floor is perfectly level in the SteamVR hub as\nwell as my other VR games.\n\nI also disliked the mana mechanic since 99% of the fun is to just mess around with the spells.\n\nGiven more time and work this can turn into a decent little game,\nand I'd be happy to come back to it if it does - but for now, it's a no.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198003292839", "last_played": 1469296603, "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 458, "playtime_forever": 14}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1469297320, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506143", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1469297320, "recommendationid": "24483872", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So I'm giving it a thumbs up, because I don't think it's fair to downvote a game that is open about its issues from the get go.  Pretty much I knew what to expect when I bought it.\n\nOverall in it's current state as of this review (8/5/2016) it's a neat little tech demo.  The spells load quickly and are kind of fun to play with.  \n\nThe graphics need some work.  Textures in specific. It's got a very colorful, cartoony, almost Fable look to it, but the textures are some of the lowest I've seen in VR so far.\n\nI wouldn't mind an alternate navigation system to the teleport since I don't get the motion sickness issue, but I realize that I'm probably in the minority of players who can wrap their brain and stomach around moving without actually moving.\n\nIf I could throw the developer some suggestions it would be:\n\n* In addition to the custom spellbook, it would be nice to have a carry slot to hold more than one spell book.  A belt slot for example like you can find in many other VR games.\n\n* In your more aggressive monster levels, work on the AI a bit.  I never once felt threatened or at risk of being killed by the orcs that were in the village. \n\n* Tighten up the environment textures a bit.  They are pretty grainy.\n\nOverall: This game was worth my $5 entry fee and I look forward to what the developer has coming next. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970746897", "last_played": 1488510521, "num_reviews": 66, "num_games_owned": 285, "playtime_forever": 42}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1470446896, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503031", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1470446896, "recommendationid": "24734556", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I found the lack of instructions frustrating when I first played this game a few days back.
