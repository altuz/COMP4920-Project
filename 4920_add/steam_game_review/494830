This game appeared out of nowhere to save the day and everybody said he was going to be good enough and nobody was butt hurt anymore. I don't know about KingSpray nor how it compares to this, but ViveSpray is very, very simple, and too expensive for the amount of work they put in, and the butt hurt now resumes.\n\nIf it only existed on its own, I could see giving it a positive review, but instead of improving on this title, the developer is now selling the updates you would normally be entitled to as a separate title 'ViveSpray 2' at nine dollars. You suck. There are countless art/drawing/modeling apps for the Vive, many of them free, don't pay for this tech demo, nor the 'sequal'. If you must draw graffiti in VR, there is a very nice free app on viveport.
