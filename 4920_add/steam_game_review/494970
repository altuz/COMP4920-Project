But, probably the suddenness of it all adds to the tragedy. I bought the \u201cHelp: The Game bundle \u201c specifically for this game, as well as for Malkia, and Emily: Displaced which I reviewed also. If you enjoyed playing This War of Mine, and/or you care about children\u2019s charities, then this game is something you can enjoy for ten minutes, with no replay value. The whole bundle is worth about $5.00, so you can consider the other ten dollars a donation. Malkia would not launch on any computer I tried. I felt like I got my money\u2019s worth with this game and Emily: Displaced, as well as the donation to a worthy cause. \n\n[b]Narrative:[/b] \nThe best quality of the game is the dialog and voice acting. It is presented by a child who sounds as if she could be the child in the story. Her spoken English is fairly good, and yet you can detect the natural way she speaks of her culture. It comes across as original and realistic. In that way, it reminds me of games like Firewatch, where you feel you are listening in on the lives of other people. The music is high quality and sounds authentic. I love the way this game shows that you can produce games with a very small budget and still make a great product if you put your heart into it.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nEach scene is a drawing that has anywhere from 1-3 clickable areas. You play with them for a bit until you are moved to the next scene. It seems pretty innocent at first. But, things move along quickly, and suddenly it\u2019s over. It comes across as very emotional and something you will be glad you played. I liked the savannah colors\u2026 it really is very colorful. The graphics are simple 2dimensional drawings.\n\n\n[b]Help: The Game[/b]\nThe title \u201cHelp: The Game\u201d is simply a sub-browser for launching each of the 12 games. You can simply launch them from within Steam, but the sub-browser gives a little more overview. Charities raise money for diverse causes every day and you are presented with many requests, even here where you are gaming. Ultimately, you have to ask yourself if, one, this charity is a cause you\u2019d like to help, and 2, if what you are getting in return is worth it to you. I feel it safe to say that most people want to help where they can, and it\u2019s great that in this case War Child (and 11 game studios) have teamed up to give us something in return for our donation, while also raising our awareness of the problems children face in war-torn countries. But, keep in mind that the entire project was completed in only 6 days, so it\u2019s a simple set of quickly developed, donated-time games. \n\n[h1] War is more than a game for those on the outside of the battle lines.
