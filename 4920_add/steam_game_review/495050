Still more of the same over priced garbage with a face lift..\n\nYou can technically emulate all of these games and could have for years but you know, give Crapcom more money so they can fund blockbuster failures like Resident Evil 7.\n\nI'm not even going to do a proper review on this one... \n\nIt's basically Mega Man 7, 8, 9 & 10 wrapped up in a neat little package. They didn't just use an emulator with a front end to run the games this time around like in the original MMC1, they did a properly coded .exe file... The game feels a lot more polished and seemless than the original.\n\nPeople say the only reason to buy this is for MM 9 & 10 but there IS a Wii Emulator that exists so I'm not quite sure what the hell these plebs are even prattling on about... probably their autism kicking in again? Who knows.\n\nEither way, not worth the price tag, get it on sale. They're all classic games and they haven't changed gameplay wise... the only thing that's changed is the resolution scaling... which is a welcome addition.\n\nThere's an added challenge mode that's a lot more managable this time around, unlike the ridiculous time requirements they had in the original MMC.... it's an easier game all around. The original MM9 & 10 challenges are still in the game as well so if you want to do those, you're more than welcome but there's no achievements tied to completing them all... only the new challenges.\n\nThe only game that you can't save progress on is MM7 because it was still using an archaic password system on the original SNES cartridge. All the passwords still work and are identical from when you jotted them down as a kid. So using that one code to start right at the final Wily fight still works and will net you an easy achievement.\n\nThe save structures of MM 8, 9 & 10 are still intact and allow you to hard save your progress. The game still has a save state feature but it's a bit more balanced. You can't just save a snapshot of the game any time you want and reload it, but you can infinitely respawn at check points in the game, so long as you choose \"replay from checkpoint\" . If you're about to run out of lives, just keep reloading your checkpoint for an infinite amount of tries.\n\nTL;DR: Same crap, different package, buy it on sale, it's coded better than MMC1.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063587281", "last_played": 1504408340, "num_reviews": 170, "num_games_owned": 417, "playtime_forever": 1281}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506893649, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487472", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1506893649, "recommendationid": "35397070", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
