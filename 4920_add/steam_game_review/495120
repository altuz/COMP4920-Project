I'd have to presume the game itself isn't finished from the description, otherwise it is lying, quite a lot actually.\n\nI enjoyed the songs that were in the background and the game play well enough. It was a fairly straight forward experience where I backtracked twice, once to open a door to a key I purchased, which lead to an irrelevent item since the game threw me a better bow like 5 minutes later. The other was getting a damage+ ring, which is well worth it, but with the money I would save getting the pointless key, it'd have been a straight through, no going back.\n\nI found the fire element, the only thing I found, so no multiple elements.\n\nThe game was actually really interesting. Paid attention to the dialog, fighting was good, though sometimes not being able to see leads to cheap hits, but didn't occur often. Then it just kinda ends, you read it, and that's about it :/\n\nWell, I'm being generous, so to get it out of the way. The combat is really simplistic, but it worked for what was around. If I were to have it adjusted, I'd remove the stun period on enemies so they don't simply get chain locked. The enemies tend to be really easy to deal with when they can't actually do anything to you. Would make for a better challenge if you had to hurt them while still avoiding attacks. \n\nUntil something is heard about it, I wouldn't really recommend at the moment. If it actually does add in the other things it mentions, well, that is something different.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197966489900", "last_played": 1501851483, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 1259, "playtime_forever": 70}, "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_created": 1501772546, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545686", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501777025, "recommendationid": "33994682", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a good, atmospheric game.
