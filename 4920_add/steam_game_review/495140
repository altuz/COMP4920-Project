I have played NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 FULL BURST, I played Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations, and lastly NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4. I never played Storm 2 neither Storm 1, I didn't have a PS3 at that time, I had a XBOX 360. I always heard people say that this is ''THE BEST STORM GAME'' I kept seeing that over and over the more I would look up Storm 1 stuff. Finally, from the power of Naruto Storm Legacy, I am able to finally test out ''The best Storm game''\nDid it suprised me? or did it dissapoint me? This game suprised me... This game is a really god damn good Storm game.\nThe game has a few things the future storm games removed: Jutsu Clashes, Wall Running, Longer Ultimate Jutsus, Button inputs for Ultimate Jutsus, and The super punch. In terms of the game port. It's amazing, It's an improved version from the PS3 version. Not only does it give the game 60FPS but some more graphics settings. Lets talk about the gameplay.\nI've seen alot of people in the Naruto Storm 1 and 2 Discussion forums say the games are ''slow'' The game doesn't have to be fast to have good gameplay mechanics, whenever I play this game, I get a feeling of thinking before acting. Which I mean.. that's essential for EVERY fighting game. The players that complain about Storm 1 being slow are probably players that just straight spam Chakra Dash in Storm 4. Just because the gameplay is slower than Storm 4 doesn't make the game bad. Character movesets are unique in this one, some of the characters don't have the same movesets in the future games. Not only that, but in this game, everyone has a side combo which the future games removed. The Ultimate Jutsus are amazing, they're cinematic, long, and really cool looking. I also love the way the Ultimate Jutsus work in this game, from my knowledge Storm 3, Generations, and Storm 4 whenever you would press Y Y B to do an ultimate jutsu it would make it so god damn obvious. What I mean by that is, for example if you do an Ultimate Jutsu in the newer Storm games, you see that the screen turns dark and freezes MAKING IT WAY TO OBVIOUS THAT AN ULTIMATE JUTSU IS COMING.\nIn Storm 1 however that's not the case all that happens is your character will get a blue flashing aura around them.\nI also love the way you use your ultimate jutsus, In the future storm games it's most either Spamming the Ultimate Jutsu and praying that it hits while your opponent's substitution is all used up, or combo cancel into an Ultimate Jutsu, However in Storm 1 landing them is pretty unique, I think a great example is Sasuke's Ultimate Jutsu, He appears behind you and kicks you, Ofc spamming it will make it obvious, However If someone is charging their chakra, casting a ninjutsu, trying to awaken, that opens a great oppurtunity to use it and deal some damage. Speaking of damage, the Ultimate Jutsus in this game do a SHIT TON of damage, I think it takes 2 or 3 Ultimate Jutsus to take your opponent out or get their health extremly low. Anothor thing with the Ultimate Jutsus is that there are button inputs, Theres a type of clash once your opponent gets you into a Ultimate Jutsu. Depending on how fast  you and your opponent are inputing the buttons correctly you will be able to dodge an Ultimate Jutsu. However, there is a catch. The person who catches you in the Ultimate Jutsu can mess up 2 or 3 buttons and still get you into a the Ultimate Jutsu, The person who got CAUGHT into the Ultimate Jutsu mess up even ONE button they won't be able to dodge it. So don't try rushing and mashing buttons randomly. In this game, you can still combo cancel, you can cancel into a jump dash for an air combo or a ninjutsu. Now for the big thing that bugs alot of players, the subsitution mechanic, oh boy... I'm saying this now the substitution mechanic is not broken, neither is it hard to do.\nThe way you do substitution in this game is once you get hit press the guard button. Alot of players always say to spam the guard button until you get out of a combo. That is SO NOT HOW IT WORKS. You learn the rhythm of a character's combo, the timing is pretty crucial but practice makes perfect. I found myself substituting way more often if i followed the characters combo rhythm rather than spamming the damn guard button. I know beginners will feel like it's crap and pretty much say the game is trash just because of this but it just requires some timing and practice, don't expect to master this mechanic in a simple day or two, it takes time and practice but trust me, you will get a feel for it. As for game content, there is a fair amount, the one thing people love to bring up about this game is the free roam.\nMy goodness is it amazing. Yeah sure, you can only move around in the village. But the stuff you can do is pretty cool\nI always do find myself going back into Ultimate Mission Mode just to mess around in the village.\n\nOverall, this game is definetly worth 20 dollars, atm I seriously can't put this game down, I'm playing it everyday at this point, I have Storm 4 in my library as well, but I sure am not having much fun with it as I am with Storm 1.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "steamid": "76561198129426526", "last_played": 1506878568, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 60, "playtime_forever": 1746}, "votes_up": 34, "timestamp_created": 1504993237, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563879", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504993659, "recommendationid": "34847340", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Such masterpieces will no longer be created.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "steamid": "76561198057115634", "last_played": 1505997181, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_forever": 495}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1505326336, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513903", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1505326336, "recommendationid": "34924528", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 1 is pretty good it has more \"mini-games\" i guess you could call them. some of them are hit and miss yet faithful to the show which is good remembering all the great moments from the early seasons of naruto is great fun. and the characters play like you'd think they would from the show the flow of the game is great and it has lots of content to explore. Each missions has bonus objectives for a bit of challenge if you're looking for that. some of them get a little annoying but for the most part those are finished within 2 or 3 tries. Each missions goes from D-S D being easy and S being very hard. those are balanced for there respective rankings. fun boss fights with fun scaling in terms of size which proves to make you feel like you're really fighting a big boss. these have been the first tailed beast to one of jiraiya's frog summons.  all and all i'd say thet improved over the games however the first one is worth playing if you're a real naruto fan.

Very authentic to the TV show. You get a Mortal Kombat style mode and an adventure mode in which you have a main city hub and then you can go on instance based missions for either grind or to advance plot. The animations are fluid and slick. Voice acting was well done. The user interface makes sense and provides a nice variety of pertinent information. Nice minimap. Combat itself felt pretty awesome although it seems to have some twists to how it functions.

Don't look at their face when they talk or it will either bother/amuse you. \n\nMechanically the game is fun, BUT there is a staggering issue with the AI. \n-Long story short, it's a bit fiddly and broken, but not in the sense of making the game easy. It's either a bit wussy, or beyond extreme with no gradient in between. With the Extreme AI being able to simultaneously use abilities, such as a block, a special power, and throwing shuriken, while dodging to the side. They can also use consumables while knocked down, and can simply ignore being struck by near any attack (Seemingly at random, even while recoiling from being struck) without any block animation. Even defense increasing items do not seem to mitigate losing nearly (80%-100%) an entire bar of health (1/3 of your total) from a single combo without being juggled. You can see it quickly getting frustrating and that retry button wearing out very quickly... Luckily so far the AI only seems to break on Side Missions with the exception of Orochimaru.\n\nProgression wise, there is an isn't much. \n-Progression feels... pretty weak, everything unlocked is more or less external to the main story or main mission mode. There is no way to make your character better or change their item loadout. Freeplay or at least the side missions allow you to select other unlocked characters, BUT they suffer from horribly from broken AI later one (About C rank or so) and you can't chance their loadouts either. So everything feels a little... dull. Especially if things are to change, you really aren't told much as to if you can or can't do something unless you pause the game and scroll through the list of your characters available powers and abilities. Some character on their time of use do not even have an ultimate ability, and your left to figure that out yourself. \n\nIf you are looking for a good anime fighter, this isn't reccomended. The AI is far to sketchy to make any gameplay better than obnoxious. It could be a quirk of my pc that raises difficulty subtly to maximum silliness, but I'm not willing to bet on it. \n\nAlso I saw there could be a whole host of bugs with the game that can cause it to no longer save, crash, run at weird frames... yeah you see where I'm going?
