I put a lot of hours into the original game back on the Xbox 360. (See my Borderlands 1 review for a Story.)\n\nWhen I heard that Borderlands is getting a sequel I was hyped as hell. I still remember the very day of how I heard that the sequel is happening. It was at my School Library. That was when back when I was new to High School. I read it from an article inside the Xbox Magazine. Yea, you have no idea how hyped I was that my favourite game of all time is getting a sequel. It was truly an amazing day.\n\nAnd when I say that this game is long then I mean it. It took me around 96 hours to finish the game + DLC and get to level 50. Now if you were to play this game 6 times each time with all of the characters that the game has to offer. You are looking at somewhere maybe around 500-600 hours of gameplay.\n\n[h1]The Story:[/h1]\nTaking place 5 years after Borderlands 1. The game opens with a cut scene of some new Vault Hunters arriving to Pandora in search of a new Vault. That is until you meet the main antagonist of the game, Handsome Jack. Yes. That is his actual name. You will see later why lul.\n\nAs you can guess. Handsome Jack tricks you and tries to kill you. Now you must find the new vault and defeat Handsome Jack who rules over the inhabitants of Pandora with an iron fist. Your story/adventure stars off from here.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\u25cf Improved Storyline from the first game\n\u25cf Bazillion of guns to find, loot and earn\n\u25cf Improved gameplay from the first game\n\u25cf New detailed locations\n\u25cf Returning Characters\n\u25cf CO-OP\n\u25cf Improved Gunplay\n\u25cf World/Landscape\n\u25cf Fantastic DLC\n\u25cf Excellent and addicting gameplay\n\u25cf Lots of new unique Characters to play as\n\u25cf Achievements\n\u25cf Steam Trading Cards\n\u25cf Great NPC's\n\u25cf Vastly improved Side missions from the first game\n\u25cf Audio\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\u25cf Nvidia Phys X is unwanted and nothing more than a performance killer. (You can't turn it off. You may only turn it down to low.)\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nBorderlands is my all-time favourite video game of all time. Borderlands 2 improved in terms of the weak points of the original game. It improved the Story which was one of the weak points of the first game. They improved the gameplay, the gunplay and just in general made a fantastic sequel to a already great game. I highly recommend Borderlands 2 to anyone who is looking for a great Singleplayer game or a great game to play together with friends.\n\n[h1]Overall rating 10/10[/h1]"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505869619, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534634", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "35075107", "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991553415", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506451138, "num_games_owned": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_forever": 5931}, "timestamp_updated": 1505869619, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Better then Destiny 2"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504617557, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522224", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 12, "recommendationid": "34756361", "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": "5", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282142758", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1506611132, "num_games_owned": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 104, "playtime_forever": 4493}, "timestamp_updated": 1504617557, "received_for_free": false, "review": "just one word to say.... awesome game"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505899846, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35080611", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198289884206", "num_reviews": 28, "last_played": 1505994994, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_forever": 875}, "timestamp_updated": 1505899846, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Bigger = Better \n\nMore humor and guns than the first Borderlands games.

The tutorial of the game pretty much explains every basic function within the first minutes of the game. Although the story will reference the first game, its still not necessary to have played it. If you, on the other hand already played the first one and have STILL not played this game theres a lot of stuff in this for you too.\n\nCharacters:\nThe first thing you might notice about this game might be the 4 playable characters (6 if you bought GOTY edition which i highly recommend). These characters are called \"Vault hunters\" and just as the name suggest, they hunt vaults. They were called to Pandora by the CEO of \"Hyperion\" and probably my favorite villan ever \"Handsome Jack\". An ironic self obsessed asshole who i would consider as the REAL comic relief (Except for Claptrap... FUCK CLAPTRAP). So the first vault hunter introduced is Axton: The commando, Axton uses sentries and grenades to his advantage. Next up is Maya as the siren who uses magical bullshit... ahem i ment siren powers to control the battlefield. Salvador the gunzerker = Dubble pow pow and Zero the edgy kid\n\nGameplay:\nThe game pretty much works as any other RPG shooter, you collect guns (there are over 1 BAZILLION) which u can find in containers, dead bodies and in quest rewards. the core gameplay alone is enough to keep a player that enjoys collecting stuff and grinding at least 30-40 hours. But if you do buy the GOTY edition (which i highly recommend) you will get 4 additional campaigns with their own special weapons and shields. You also get 2 amazing characters Krieg the psycho and Gaige the Mechromancer. That might last you another 40 hours ish if u don't feel like doing raid bosses or all the side quests.\n\n\nPROS AND CONS\nPros: \n- Long content full game with enjoyable characters (both playable and npc's).\n- story with a lot of bad puns and shitty jokes that are somewhat entertaining.\n- a fuck load of raid bosses and side quests to do after (or during) the story missions.\n- True (Ultimate dlc) vault hunter mode, which scales the enemies up to higher levels although you have to start from the beginning of the story mode.\n- almost every enemy is unique\n\nCons:\n- a lot of the \"OP\" weapons are dlc's and a lot of the fun story lines and characters.\n- The game can get repetitive if you're farming a certain item.\n- It might not appeal to the casual player that doesn\u2019t like the \u201dfarming\u201d concept.\n- jokes and voice lines might be considered \u201dcontroversial\u201d or \u201doffensive\u201d."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505959513, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35095581", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198072817671", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1507142516, "num_games_owned": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 882, "playtime_forever": 8584}, "timestamp_updated": 1505959513, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Borderlands 2 is awesome!

Why? Because the game is HUGE and incredibly fun.\n\nYou probably alreayd know that this is shooter with RPG elements - but reduced to minimum. Level up, pick loot, create craziest builds and go. There is no time for deep interaction or complex puzzles. Quest indicator shows you clearly where to go and what to pick, so you don't waste time looking for hidden stuff and can keep shooting.\n\nAll the quests are only a pretext to trigger dialogs full of GREAT humour. Pretty much everyone on Pandora is insane and, moreover, likes to record his delusions for you to find. Voice acting in pretty much the strongest part of the game and there's so much of it, so funny! Not only player characters and NPCs have lots to say, but also enemies. Oh, enemies - there's a great variety of them and they're just amusing. Nomands, Goliaths, Midgets, Rats have multiple voice lines and they're always funny to listen. I pretty much never stop smiling. While burning enemies to death, or blowing them up.\n\nAhh, it's a shooter after all. With DLCs you get 6 playable characters with multiple skill trees, all of which give you dozens of ways to build very different ways to kill enemies. On top of that you get hundreds of unique weapons and items, many veyr hard to find, with procedurally generated variants. Diversity of guns is astounding and scoped shotgun are nothing special after all. Thrown weapons, weird firing patterns, secret bonuses and odd gimmicks are all here. Everyone will find soomething suitable for himself, and something to explore over hundreds of hours.\n\nThe gear progression is good and fats, you often discard purples and legendaries to pick p better greens - this was solved perfectly. It cna become tiring in a fact, as quests won't levle up with you until you're level 50 after TWO playthroughts for eahc character, and then comes Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode - which is third playthrought where finally al enemies and rewards level up with you, but takes forever to reach max level 72. This is where the game starts for good and feels comfortable, which unfortunatelly takes  alot of time. A big drawback is that to fully enjoy the otential of Borderlands 2 and jump into DLCs you need to complete main storyline at least twice. And it's quite lengthy, with non-skippable cutscenes. I recommend to start play this game step by step and don't run for best and rarest rewards since beginning, as it might become tedious and unsatisfactory.\n\nAnd yes, it's great for coop. You can play solo and coop alike, no balance issues here.\n\nAll in all, Borderlands is a very polished game with tons of content, certainly one of best games ever made. Go get it and explore in your own pace."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505566155, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34996118", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323511853", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1502702773, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4802}, "timestamp_updated": 1505566155, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Absoluuuuuutely a funny game when you play it with a couple of friends.\n\nWeapons in the game is just shiny enough to shoot you down, the design of those weapons is incredible.\n\nMany interesting details in terms of famous movies, singers and so on.\n\nThe ecological environment is as creative as a science fiction, \n\nImpressive depiction of an uncharted planet, brutal, risky and hilarious.\n\nEach character has their own prominent unforgettable personalities.
