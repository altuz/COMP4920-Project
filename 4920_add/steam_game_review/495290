This sim is the best one for helicopters that I have ever used. Now the aiplanes on this sim could use a lot of work, so I do not recommend buying this flight sim if you only want to fly aiplanes (Realflight 7.5 is the best one for airplanes). If you are a helicopter pilot then I highly recommend this sim. It has the most realistic helicopter physics  which makes it fantastic for learning or practicing 3D maneuvers.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 226, "steamid": "76561198068204854", "last_played": 1507092048, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 900}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504566921, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504567064, "recommendationid": "34745852", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Straight out the box, One of the things you need to get right is controls. And you guys failed the games wizard isn`t setting up correctly using either an xbox controller or a real world Transmitter (Two makes) the game remains totally broken. \n\nAlso another thing is the horrible pixelation of the backgrounds, Running on a 6gb 1070 I7 32gb of ram I shouldn`t see a pixel let along a blurry mess of them. The physics engine is also very iffy DJI Phantoms do not snap roll a full 360 in less than a second, Showing a very arcade based flight model.\n\nThis is a very early access game that is being sold at full price while they can if it was perhaps \u00a35-10 ($10-15) then it could be forgiven but at \u00a339.99 ($50), Steer well clear and invest in IPAC`s RC sim instead at least that works fully, Controls map and work out of the box and the flying area`s are alot better. The only downside is the higher price but you get a quality simulation of RC flight over this which is at best meant for children and young adults.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198192716381", "last_played": 1499936359, "num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 122, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499937605, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491454", "votes_down": 14, "timestamp_updated": 1499937605, "recommendationid": "33499112", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I bought this RC sim expecting a relatively mediocre simulator, but still good enough to practice on. Sadly I was mistaken and this \"simulator\" is basically a collection of very low quality pictures scrolling (except for the 3d fields, tho they arent much better) by as you wonder how the rc airplanes and drones could possibly be modeled this bad. Now this sim is mostly geared towards helis and they are actually pretty good, if you want a heli simulator for $40, this ones alright.\n\nAnother major gripe I have is how awkward and difficult it is to get a transmitter to actually work correctly, I am using a rc simulator controller (Realflight's Interlink Elite) and it was bizarrely difficult to get it working, which I still didn't manage to get all the auxillary switches working as I want them to. I have a feeling this is due to the poorly laid out GUI.\n\nIt is also extremely poorly optimized, using between 50-80% CPU in task manager vs 10-15% for my RealFlight sim. So if you have a potato steer clear.\n\nThis sim did just launch few weeks ago so I am willing to cut the devs some slack, but especially at this price point steer clear of AccuRC. Hopefully a lot more devopement will go into this, otherwise it will be the worst rc related buy I ever made. I am confident that it will turn out to be a pretty good sim since the updates are coming almost daily.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198320848649", "last_played": 1500254480, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_forever": 69}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500251780, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487449", "votes_down": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1500254083, "recommendationid": "33597487", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
