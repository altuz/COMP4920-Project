When I first saw the title, I tried to figure out what the gimmick was. Surely, it must be something more than just arranging wodden blocks to build a tower? But no - that's what this game is. But with its relaxed atmosphere and the extra immersion of VR, this works pretty well. Visually, there is a nice contrast between the color intensity of the blocks and the almost monochrome environment, and the close light source gives some nice shadows.\n\nThe one negative point is that the rotation of the blocks are locked to the chair, not to your sight. This means that if you turn your head or move about, the function of the keys will change, since 'left rotation' isn't your left, but the 'left' of your chair. Not a total dealbreaker, since you most likely remains sitting in your chair. But it spoils to fun if you like to go roomscale.\n\nMore a toy than a game, and you will lightly grow tired of it. Still, its a worthwhile experience, and a perfect VR fit.\n\nEDIT: I wrote the above review before Oculus Touch launched. Now, the game is outdated, since it is xbox controller only, no Touch support. For this reason, I now gives it a thumb down.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071465469", "last_played": 1481240251, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 214, "playtime_forever": 131}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1475617839, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501298", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1482712204, "recommendationid": "25860205", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fun game overall.
