However the content is still lacking (I only went through the course once so I don't know if anything changes after the first time). I will NOT recommend this game until more content is added to it or the dev reduces the overall price of the game (however if you don't care about a lot of my concerns or simply want to support the Dev, which I believe is important at this stage in VR, then please go and buy it regardless of its hefty price tag!). Dev, if you simply add one more coaster and a menu to switch between the two coasters then I will recommend this game (unless the second coaster is shit, don't make it shit), that's all I ask for! Oh, and when I played the game (I was standing at the time so that may have caused the issue) I was standing above the coaster, hit my head against most of the ceilings throughout the ride (very dangerous in the real world! IF YOU MAKE A COASTER IRL PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT DO THAT!!!)\n\nTL;DR: Little to no headaches (YAY!) Still short ride. Add another coaster. Add menu. Or make cheaper. Standing may cause you to be located far above the coaster, or may just be me???\n\nNOTE: The review below is a finalized review for the game before the more recent updates to the game, as such some, if not all, of the content is irrelevant to the game as it is now. I chose not to delete it because I don't want my hard work to go unseen (I worked hard on it dammit!) So please either ignore it or read it for the shits and giggles (I don't know, your call on that part :D) (each time, from this point on, if I update this review after a major update is released this note will be moved above the previous updated review)\n\nThis game gave me a bit of a headache, most things don't do that to me. Although I should note that I set supersampling to 1.8 and that I have a GTX 1080.\n\nFound a fix to being forced to play this game in theater mode just disable it in settings (Thanks The57thGamer for tip :D).\n\nThis game is way too short to be worth 2.99, let alone 3.99. It may be worth 2.99 if they make it longer or added more rollercoasters, but with the way it is now it's worth no more than .99 if that. So I still do not recommend this game for those reasons.\n\nTL;DR: Headache. Disable theater mode. Really short, not worth sales price, let alone actual price.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057100534", "last_played": 1468451687, "num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 513, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 47, "timestamp_created": 1467676989, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559333", "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1469849352, "recommendationid": "24096594", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Too soon to give it a positive review.\n\n\u00a32 is a bit overpriced for what you get\n\nOnly one 2minute track.\n\nBad texture pop issues and seat position issues\n\nIve played better rollercoaster Sims on the Oculus DK1 for free.\n\nWill Redo my review if it gets any updates.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997401047", "last_played": 1468781103, "num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 252, "playtime_forever": 52}, "votes_up": 17, "timestamp_created": 1468084348, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516642", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1468084348, "recommendationid": "24211797", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very short, very little wow. Couldn't get the correct viewing position. Was either way above the seat or where your feet would be. People say it lasts 2 minutes? I timed it. From when you start moving to the end of the ride it's less than a minute. No track audio except the initial climb (then it's just the sound of wind?).\nI've yet to see one that compares to the Rilix Coaster on Samsung's Gear VR.\nIf this expands into something more, I'll gladly edit my review. Until then, I don't feel it's worth $3, even $1 is steep considering Rilix is free on Gear VR, and there's other Gear VR, Oculus and Android coasters out there for free.

I can't really see out of the cart very well, this kind of ruins even the 60 second ride.\n\nSo if they fix it, I would definitely pay a couple of bucks for it for a one/two time ride. Otherwise, if I had a really tall barstool I would bring it in here by the computer, but I don't.
