I have no problem with the game having you fight humans, after all, W.Y PMC have been around for a long time.

I love aliens, i love most of the ip games, but this one feels boring, uninspired, i tried to love the game, but when you play this (and i played both the ps3 and pc versions, and it's sad that the ps3 port plays better than the pc one), i just cant.

Then came the delays and the rumored cancellation... this made me seriously worry about the whole property. But then a few screenshots were released that did their best to calm those worries. Finally they started releasing supposedly real footage of the game and at that point i was sold. I purshased a physical copy of the game.\n\nSo I get into the game and realize I was sold a bill of goods. The game was nowhere near as polished as the trailers and demo I saw. The AI was laughably bad across the board, aliens would just run right at you to get mowed down and your AI teammates... oh god they either wouldnt engage with the aliens or would just shoot at walls. The graphics are meh at best, again the Demo and trailers looked far superior.\n\nLuckily thanks to dedicated fans creating mods the AI has been fixed a little bit but its still far from great.

Play through the first level and see why the game got the bad wrap that it did. Not that it was horrible, it was a mediocre experience for me (Aliens moving predictably and straight into my gunfire) however I have heard it only gets worse as the game advances. Then, install TemplarGFX's patch 4 & 4.5 and replay from the beginning. Completely changes the pace of play and sets the atmosphere of the Alien franchise.
