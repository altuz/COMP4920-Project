It was an okay game but I wouldn't buy it on it's own.\nIt's not a bad game but it's kinda simple and is over very quickly.\nI would change two other things about it. The game gives you an upgrade point every time that you beat a map. I wish it was only every time you beat a new map. To ofset this it would be nice to be able to rearange how your points are spent in case you needed to upgrade your helecopters to survive being the air attack things. Also once everything was unlocked it would be nice to not have any more points awarded because it's kinda anoying to have extra points that you can't spend.\nI spent my first points on improving my bases survivability/production which certainly seemed useful throughout the whole game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198092525732", "last_played": 1503974615, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 124, "playtime_forever": 190}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1503924637, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503924637, "recommendationid": "34552087", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
