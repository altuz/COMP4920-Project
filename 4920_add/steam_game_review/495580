Your strategy will change as your skill develop and this game strikes a good balance between skill and tactics. You cannot win by only mastering one aspect.\n\nThis game has a very unique grenade system, which have been called by many names in steam reviews. I must say, it is not one trying to simulate realism. Grenades only kill occasionally. For the most part they stun you, and when players clash they are all over the place. This may look weird and unbalanced to new players expecting a more strictly \u201ctactical\u201d game. However, this grenade system is what, in my opinion, makes the game. It makes the game intense, where skills matter as well. \n\n\nThey included AI bots in the release. However, I think the PvP part is where this game shine, and I would say bots are only for practicing controls (Have only tried a couple of games against the AI). Because of the high skill cap, out-multitasking is a valid strategy (albeit a risky one, as mistakes occur more frequently when you (I) try to), and this gets lost when playing the AI. \n\nA must buy if you like fast played multiplayer teamwork (PvP) and can handle a game that requires some skills besides your thinking.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 350, "steamid": "76561198029712262", "last_played": 1507142433, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 2582}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1507008471, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1507008471, "recommendationid": "35436271", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very fun and strategic game with a learning curve!
