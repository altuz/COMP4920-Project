I particularly like that there are no hp/mp recharge spots at every corner like in most other games.\nThere is a respectable amount of skills, items and equipment with good variation.\nA very nice touch is the work put into making exploration worthwhile and how it avoids being tedious.\n\nDespite its low production values, it is obvious that genuine effort was put into every aspect of the game and i have a lot of respect for that.\n\n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038892067", "last_played": 1487480900, "num_reviews": 43, "num_games_owned": 2217, "playtime_forever": 107}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1487482465, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517636", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1487482465, "recommendationid": "30026180", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
