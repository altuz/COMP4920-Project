But honestly its so much more. Has some pretty cool effects and play style features also. Its so western looking and feeling but still definitely being bullet hell. Its a very unique fun game. As a shmup fan, I wasn't expecting to not like it, but I definitely wasn't expecting to like it this much. There is a lot of content and variety here, color me very impressed. About the only thing missing is cute anime characters, its almost more of a cutesy World Ignition but not set in space, well at least not in the early stages. Also very good controller support, pretty much anything should work with this title, thats huge in my books, especially when it comes to arcade style games. Even at regular price you will not feel slighted, especially if you already own about every great shmup on steam already, I'm only saying this because if you are patient and unsure you can buy some great titles for only a couple dollars.. This is only if you don't already have them.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197987999692", "last_played": 1482956346, "num_reviews": 200, "num_games_owned": 1532, "playtime_forever": 152}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1482777975, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523417", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1482777975, "recommendationid": "28682194", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This indie game is really fun to play again and again. The gameplay is excellent and responsive, it's challenging at times but never punishing. Boss encounters are nice too. I'd like to play multiplayer, I'm sure this will be fun as well. \n\nThe gameplay combined with a great soundtrack and great graphics makes the game addictive. I would have liked a couple of extra levels in the story mode though. Besides story/arcade modes, extra challenges (color reflex, the line, challenges) are worth playing and I enjoyed completing them. So, replay value is good.\nI totally recommend this game!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197977800384", "last_played": 1487880434, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_forever": 489}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1476990856, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1476990856, "recommendationid": "26134145", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Something is missing here.\nThe game is too boring IMO and I can't say exactly why... feels empty.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019576097", "last_played": 1497924965, "num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 151, "playtime_forever": 39}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1497926115, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497926115, "recommendationid": "32581754", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Super fun 4-player co-op shooter.
