Sierra is pretty well-known for their moon logic puzzles like those in the king's quest games which is why I was surprised to find that the puzzles in this game had a lot of thought put into them and that there were hints for every single puzzle though some may be subtle (not that I don't like king's quest but man, some of their puzzles are just so unpredictable that u can get into an unwinnable state if u miss sone minor detail. This game is much more lenient in my opinion but still challenging in the right ways). I got a sense of satifaction from uncovering the mystery alongside solving the puzzles akin to that of playing the ace attorney trilogy (not a big fan of the 2nd tho =p) and the characters are just so lovable.\n\nEven the protagonist is shown to have obvious flaws in his personailty but I find certain traits of his charming n he sorta changes over the course of the whole story to become a  better person. The lore behind voodooism and the way they portrayed New Orleans were also very intriguing aspects of the game. I can't stress how much enjoyment I got out of this game and is officially one of my favourite point-and-click games of all time (next to grim fandango). Definitely go play it if you're into the mystery or thriller genre XD", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198352577071", "last_played": 1499583996, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_forever": 729}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499582425, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499583078, "recommendationid": "33395974", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
