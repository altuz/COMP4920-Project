Growing up with rides at amusement parks which had puppets, animatronics and in some cases live actors, this gave me that feeling that I was on one of these \"funhouse\" rides.\n\nFirst, I was really taken aback by one of my controllers (specifically my left hand) being rendered as a right hand the other controller rendered normally.  I thought it was just off until I thought (and this could be a stretch) that maybe I was supposed to be holding a severed hand (benefit of the doubt here).\n\nSecond, I don't like the supposed train (which you never see) mechanics, at times it travels wildly fast or strangely slow and at weird angles trains would usually never traverse.  More realistic track layout and train would be nice.\n\nThird, OK, making some odd mythical monster appear out of thin air was kind of cute, but not realistic on a ride one is trying to simulate.  There should be several decoys around, maybe moving artificially to hold one's attention, while another swings from the trees, or pops out from a more realistic position or have something the player sees only activate when they go by and when they're looking at them.\n\nThis could be like a \"Monster Plantation\" or \"Haunted House\" type of ride, if the ride were a little shorter, the mechanics cleaned up, more props and animated creatures and more realistic surprises from beings that are hiding, not out of thin air.\n\nAnd here's something to consider that would be cool too, when the 'train' (and do render one) stops at a checkpoint or two, allow the player to disembark and look around their surroundings.  Let them look at the trees, add things like holes in the trees where eyes might appear and look around, let them look at other various props like a small graveyard and add tiny animations and effects.\n\nI see where the developer was going with this title, but it could have been so, soooo much better.
