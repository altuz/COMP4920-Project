[/b]\n\u201cRandom Journey is on pre-alpha test stage now.\u201d. \n\nEarly access should be used for working games that need more polishing. This game for all intensive purposes is broken and lacks gameplay depth completely .I do not think it is ethical to sell it ( especially when you are aware that game has nothing to offer to a player) Upon reading user's comments some of the promises do not add up. The whole thing starting to look kinda shady.\n\nIn other words, you paying to look at game assets .Damn. This game actually makes Bloody Boobs look playable .\n\nThe first thing you will notice is that soundtrack is reused from another game by this developer. Gameplay right now is literally clicking on a box with random win-loss ( no matter what you get the game will bounce you to the main menu ) Most of the stages and features do not work.\n\nI honestly can't tell if this meant to be a joke. A game where you win and loose randomly with no strategy? It can't be true. I hope this game is just not finished.\n\nNova Dimension has made few decent games so maybe there is still hope. I like some of the 3D models and maybe it could be a decent game if the gameplay was expanded beyond what it is now -nothing. If they had any credibility I think it is all gone now. I hope that $1 was worth it .", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995669628", "last_played": 1492139050, "num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 597, "playtime_forever": 9}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1492445171, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503215", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1492446880, "recommendationid": "31202236", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game is thoroughly broken.
