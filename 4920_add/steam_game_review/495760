It looks busy at times, yet the gameplay is very zen. It has an 80s/early 90s design aesthetic, yet it's unmistakably modern, in no small part due to its abstract and mysterious cyberpunk-occultish setting, top-notch graphics and audio work, and the total confusion you experience every second you're playing it.\n\nAlthough the game is certainly confusing, it's not particularly difficult. Obstacles include puzzles where you spam jump, move a ball or turn knobs, and gates which you unlock using currency (DeityCoin) that you find in the world or gain from the incremental mini-game. You can try cheesing your way through obstacles with the game corrupter, but it by no means gives you a significant advantage, as you have limited control over the effects, remaining airborne for 2 seconds respawns you, and you can't move if you're stuck in something.\n\n+ Super interesting lore\n+ Fantastic art style\n+ Incredible sound design\n~ Really floaty horizontal controls, although this is somewhat offset by the game corrupter\n- A bit on the short side\n- Incremental game seems to be more of a novelty than anything else (although maybe BARCHboi is trying to make a statement?)\n- Going into fullscreen (which really improves the immersion imo) messes up the cursor and opening the console to do so takes a screenshot since it's bound to F12\n\nBuy it if you want to feel like the apes in 2001: A Space Odyssey when they first saw the monolith.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025266594", "last_played": 1497852103, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 457, "playtime_forever": 141}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1497852091, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498995", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1497852091, "recommendationid": "32558223", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Unique and mysterious.
