Hexoscope is a hard tile swichting and connection riddle game with an variating interasting gameplay mechanic. The Game itself contain a few worlds with a few riddles. Each riddle has a different layout and different rules to solve it. But here comes there first problem. The tiles you need to moved a randomly generated everytime you start a level or it has been restart. This lead us to the problem that everytime it is to hard you can recreate the so called Chaos to hope for an easier one until you solved it. This makes the level design somehow useless. The next useless thing on the list are the points you earn for completing a level. The amount of points you earn is exactly the same in each worlds and there is no use for them. \n\nI recommend this game not because of the hard behaviour more because the mechanics are quite cool to play with and i had my fun with it. But it should not be the best game out there of this genre. So stoppong on this page looking for a really good riddle game you may haven\u00b4t found the right one over here.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198113388537", "last_played": 1494932766, "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 1051, "playtime_forever": 343}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1494933251, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505929", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1494933251, "recommendationid": "31785069", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
