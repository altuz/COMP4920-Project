It's not so much a game as a stress reliever.  You walk around an endless maze that can change at will (meaning if you try to backtrack to go back to an earlier spot you may find it's different).  As you walk around the maze, you will spot various crystals of various shapes and sizes (up to 400 different ones) and the object is to collect them all. (Gotta catch em all!)\n\nOccasionally as you wander around you'll find a special altar where you can place a gem of a specific color to make all nearby gems change to that color, OR occasionally it's an altar where you can place a gem to change the shape of all nearby gems to that shape.\n\nAlso, there are hidden gems, and no I don't mean they're merely hidden behind stuff (though some are)...I mean until you shine your \"light\" directly on it, it will be invisible.  Most gems are on the ground but some are on statues, or in cracks on the walls.  You should look everywhere.\n\nThere's 400 different gems to find with 10 different shapes, 8 different colors and 5 different sizes (10x8x5) and you can bring up your collection to look at any time you like so that you can see which ones you are missing.  Also, on the pedestal of gems that you summoned, you have a button to allow you to return to the menu room and change some settings or exit the game.\n\nThings I like\n[list]\n [*] No stress\n [*] Occasionally interesting scenery\n [*] The background changes based on the time of day\n [*] It's got lots of locomotion options including moving with the touchpad instead of teleporting everywhere.\n [*] Picking up gems changes the color of your flashlight to match the gem color\n [*] it's like a really chill easter egg hunt, only with gems instead of eggs, and you're the only participant\n[/list]\n\nThings I'm not too fond of\n[list]\n [*] Some of that scenery is kinda bland\n [*] The sound effects are kinda loud and obnoxious.  They're also a bit overdone.  If I heard a bird chirping a few times in 10 minutes I'd think \"Yeah that sounds about right\" but these birds are like on a loop and will pretty much chirp with very few breaks.  \n[*] By the same token, at night the crickets seem pretty loud...if I was walking through the woods I might expect it but this maze doesn't have the thick foliage I'd expect for that level of cricket noise.\n[*] Oh and night time comes pretty suddenly.  I believe right at the stroke of 7pm it goes from dusk to night.  A smoother transition would be cool\n[*] I'm not sure what I'm gonna do once I collect all 400 gems.  It might be nice if there was something to do with all of them...like maybe use the gems as keys to open special doors to areas with a slightly different theme or something.\n[/list]\n\nOverall though, the game is simple, relaxing, and you can still satisfy your need to get all 400 of something.  If you're looking for an actual game, you'd be out of luck though.  \n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969913402", "last_played": 1498958958, "num_reviews": 149, "num_games_owned": 1966, "playtime_forever": 179}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1487543326, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510561", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1487543326, "recommendationid": "30045956", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's a relaxing experience but not much of a game.
