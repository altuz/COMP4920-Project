The colours are warm and friendly, there are a variety of different characters (though we can all agree that the chickens are the best) and the costumes are adorable. I will probably play this game for the next 10 years and still enjoy it. There are no microtransactions, it's play to win, which I love. With that in mind, I would have paid \u00a35 at the most for this game without any complaints, so the price is a pleasant surprise too. While the replay value is great because it's a simple and enjoyable concept, I would like to have seen some more game modes added. Maybe a clich\u00e9 fantasy platform mode with parody, floor-is-lava-esque gameplay, or maybe a Super Montaro Brothers title in the future? I need more of this beauty.\n9/10 will play again.
