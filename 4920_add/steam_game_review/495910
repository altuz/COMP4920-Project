Launcher doesn't show any info since all info is picture-based and you NEED ADMINISTRATOR rights for IE (in other words you'll need to actualy be under Administrator profile to read the news from Launcher).\n\nThe funniest thing that I found out by readind Discussion threads is that you can't buy premium cash because of some kind of restriction which is not written anywhere on STORE PAGE.
