The game plays alot like QuiVR.\n\nThe graphics are good, the shooting perspectives are also good.  \n\nThere are three difficulty settings, easy starts off pretty slow and enemies die with one hit.\n\nWhile the hard difficulty requires you to hit heach enemy twice to kill them. \n\nAs you beat waves enemies get faster, and at level 10 another archer shows up and starts shooting at you which you have to dodge, block with your magic shield, or shoot the shooter...\n\nThe bow is pretty good... better than some vr bows, but not the best either... its not as good as the labs bow... but does feel pretty good.\n\nMy main complaint is the sound the enemies make when they die...  They let out a really cheesy death scream. Lol  \n\nAlso I dont think there is any points or leaderboard to be found..\n\nOtherwise a pretty good game...\nI only made it to about wave 20 or so...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198091573845", "last_played": 1475484211, "num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 929, "playtime_forever": 47}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1475488735, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507211", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1475488735, "recommendationid": "25835973", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I love this game but it doesn't run well on oculus", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198320832922", "last_played": 1483887474, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 51, "playtime_forever": 92}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1481466215, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496829", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1481466215, "recommendationid": "28310421", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A little bit too simplistic for my taste.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063799018", "last_played": 1480160689, "num_reviews": 129, "num_games_owned": 375, "playtime_forever": 14}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506808999, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506808999, "recommendationid": "35355677", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
