Onward is one of the few that stands out.\n\nOnward sets the bar for VR realistic shooters, as its mechanics force you into the difficult tasks of combat, without having overtly complicated mechanics. If you are new to VR, keep in mind this may be a little offputting initially due to moving with an analog stick or pad and motion sickness may set in. But its executed well enough to not be too overwhelming and with consistent sessions you can easily find yourself not even feeling off in the slightest.\n\nWhat makes this game fantastic is the literal responsibilty for everything you have to do. If you run out of bullets in the mag, you have to change mags yourself. You throw the grenades, you are the one holding your breath to take the critical shot on the target. Everything in this game comes down to you, and to see a game so involivng is fantastic, especially without over complicated in game menus and options to choose from. thats the power of VR. I still struggle to realise I have to pull the pin out of the grenade before I use it!\n\nWhat is not so great is probably the current lack of content and other similar things. Of course, it is still an early access game so its less the fact of criticism and more the issue of when will more content arrive, rather than what. Guns are good but need more variety of sound and polish. More maps, and maybe slightly more detail on said maps would go a long way. AI can either be too stupid or too accurate on the difficulties available and maybe need a bit of an overhaul from 2 states (alert and hunting) to a variety and more objective based singleplayer/coop would bring it out of the ground. Multiplayer is good but requires maybe more players, roles, support methods like mortars (vehicles maybe??) and so on. Glitches, bugs and other issues will surely be ironed out over time.\n\nMost of what is stated above is far from being added to the game, but with further development this could be the greatest VR realistic shooter on the market.\n\nArguably, early access games are a gamble. But considering the lack of substantial product available on the VR market this is definitely and excellent choice for those who are willing to push their VR capacity, or those who are interested in MilSims. Either way, you will enjoy this game with all it has to offer at such an early stage let alone see what is yet to come!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041715709", "last_played": 1505528190, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 73, "playtime_forever": 321}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1505376981, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506332", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505376981, "recommendationid": "34944364", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Best VR game I've played, period.

VR has done something amazing and, instead of looking in from the outside, has placed us INSIDE THE GAME! Onward does an amazing job of making me feel immersed in a military combat situation. The ambient sounds and effects are subtle but effective and realistic.  The implementation of the inventory system is as real as it gets.  Your magazines, smoke grenades, flashbangs, side arm etc are placed specifically on your virtual body.  Look down and you see your equiptment right where you'd expect in real life. Reloading requires you to drop the magazine from your gun, reach over and grab a new magazine, insert it into your gun and operate the loading mechanism. Going from pressing a single button in traditional games to actually interacting with your inventory ads a level of immersion that just has to be experienced to understand. \n\nIf you want to imagine what it's like playing this game, just imagine what it's like in real life to engage in combat. The game modes are what you'd expect. There is an objective game mode which requires one team to arrive at an \"uplink\" destination and send a code.  Another game mode requires a single, randomly selected player, to arrive at an extraction point marked by smoke without being eliminated by the other team. The \"VIP\" in this escort game mode has only a pistol and the support of the remaining members of the team to get to the extraction point. \n\nThis game is a work in progress but make no mistake about it, this game is easily a stand-alone game in it's current form and will only get better as time goes on.  I love playing this game and can't wait to see what lies in store for us next.\n\nEDIT: I'm playing this game on the Rift with two cameras.  I have the game settings to allow for room scale.  This means that to turn around I need to turn my whole body around.  I also have my cable suspended above me, works great BTW. I was concerned with turning around so much that I would twist the cable up.  Luckily, I came across a program created by a user called TurnSignal.\nThis program displays an image on the ground below you that twists up as you turn so you can keep your cable from becoming twisted up.
