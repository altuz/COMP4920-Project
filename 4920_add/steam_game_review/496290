Rogue-like dungeon crawler, maps are laid out differently every time.  You mash one button as like a hack-n-slash, but it does a combo of hits which sometimes locks you into an animation of swinging.  Some enemies seem to have an enormous amount of health or defense (especially bosses) and it can take awhile to whittle them down.  I did like the fact that killing things filled a meter (the crystal in the top right of the screen) and this is your life counter/continues.  If you or your group perish, you can easily continue that map with a full set of lives and what you had when you entered the floor. At least you don't have to start completely over every time!  Would definitely recommend this game!  I was worried about friendly fire, but thankfully that isn't activated.  Still in Early Access, so hopefully more content will be added!\n\nPros:\n-Great looking pixel graphics\n-Weapon variety keeps attacks/moves fresh\n-Lots of items/powerups can be bought at the store, weapons upgraded\n-Can gain more lives based off killing mobs\n\nCons:\n-Some enemies/bosses have enormous health pools, you will be sitting there attacking for awhile\n-Spawners for enemies take forever to take down, with each one you will also be killing roughly 10-15 mobs that spawn (the guys with bombs ended several of our games, they do way too much damage)\n-Evade function seems to work most of the time, but other times you dodge but are still hit by the attack\n\nFor the price and multiplayer functionality, it's a decent buy.  Looking forward to more content!

But you need some updates for this to be in my favorites list. I know you are still working on the key bindings feature, but it would be great if you could add mouse key bindings to it. Also, this may be harder, but my friend and I have gotten this game, and we want to play multiplayer. We are not sure if it is possible in this development stage though. I don't mean local multiplayer, I want to play from different houses! I like this game alot so far and I havn't even played much.
