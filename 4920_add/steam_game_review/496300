It is WORTH your attention.\nI even persuaded one of my friends to buy a copy and bought a gift copy for another.\nAfter feeling the atmosphere of this game I really want others to have such a great experience as well.\n\n10/10\n\nBut let's talk about the reasons which made me love this game:\n\n- Art\nAll art elements of the game including animations and effects are awesome. Thanks to the tons of little pleasant animations the game world feels really alive.\n\n- Music and sounds\nSoundtacks are so beautiful and restful that you will never get bored of them during the game. Even when I played for 10+ hours I enjoyed the soundtracks.\nMemories about the atmosphere of this game makes me really love the soundtracks and I continue listening them even after I completed every single achievement.\n\n- Gameplay\nGameplay based on a pretty simple mechanic from the first glance. But a great balance of this game and a deep game world make this mechanic feels awesome all together.\n\"Easy to play, hard to master.\" This game also follows this golden rule.\n\nI love that the game not push me into the information how should I do something. To discover sense of any action I need to try it and check the results. No tutorials, it is fantastic.\nI recommend you to not read anything about the game on web and fully discover it by yourself. Study of the game world is a part of it's gameplay and atmosphere. \n\n- Atmosphere\nGreat art, music and gameplay all together form unforgettable atmosphere of this game. This game gives you feeling of the game world and a feeling of responsibility for your actions like a governor.\n\n\nTo summarize - \n\nNot every little thing in this game done perfect.
