You cant look back at previous areas that I could find.  The doors from the rooms arent marked.  Items you can collect arent marked.  There is no mini map.\n\nThe stamina melee based combat isnt fun.  I realize this is a subjective opinion.  However, when fighting more than one enemy it doesnt feel \"difficult\" it feels unfair.\n\nYour character moves really slowly (perhaps this upgrades later, I dont know)\n\nSave points can be a little far apart\n\nThere is forced fall damage.  It is a very small amount of damage but there were several places at the beginning of the game you are forced to jump down and take fall damage.\n\nPros:\n\nIf you are into the pixel art style it is well done.\n\nI still love metroidvanias!\n\n\nPerhaps I will give it more of a try later but at this point I cant recommend it.
