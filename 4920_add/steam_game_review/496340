This book ties in 3 of the first 4 fantasy game books from the early 1980's into one long quest quite well.  It is an amazing buy for 10$ and I am left hoping that they will quickly add other books to the existing system.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007102534", "last_played": 1505699845, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 236, "playtime_forever": 708}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1505079931, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505079931, "recommendationid": "34871881", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
