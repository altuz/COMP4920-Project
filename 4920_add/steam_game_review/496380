After a few in-game days, my shovel glitched out and now I can't use it because it is 'locked', so I can't clear the whole lot, but I was able to work around it. Like I said, though, the game is still pretty fun so I'd say if you are looking for a way to spend some spare time why not check this out?", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198180063413", "last_played": 1474736593, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 53}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1469665926, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502157", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1469665926, "recommendationid": "24565950", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "https://youtu.be/m__enEPnklc\n\nThe game is a very simple farm sim. That doesn't mean its bad and in fact it is quite good for passing time. For that main reason I am going to give it a thumbs up. I always worry when buying a compilation that most of the games will take 15 minutes to tire out. This is not one of those games for me. Is there much in the way of skill? No, but thats also not the point of the game.\n\nThe game does have some oddities. The first thing I do not like is the walking movements. Pathing is not very good and you can't change direction mid movement. The day also passes faster than I would like. I also had a not so fun bug in which when I got a reward from a neighbor, the screen would not close. No matter what. The only way to fix this was to start a new game.\n\nOtherwise I would give it a 5/10 which for me is a small thumbs up.", "received_for_free": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198101867598", "last_played": 1469934586, "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 1305, "playtime_forever": 494}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1470009515, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500727", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1470009515, "recommendationid": "24643628", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game was on my recommended list. I wouldn't have paid the money for it, but it came in a package with like 6 other games or something. I thought maybe I would like at least one of them. I was disappointed after three of the games, Verdan Hue, octo-something and Rise. Each of these games, I think, is trying to make a 'message' about the environment which that's fine. I think whatever 'message' they were trying to make about the state of humanity/world issues/environment is horribly lost by the terrible gameplay and frustrating controls/bad UI. The games that I played had little game interface. There was no menu to save, to change the window size, to change the music volume. The game package said that some of the procedes go to help {insert something} and so I at least can pretend to feel like I have made a small impact instead of wasting money. But if I'm being honest still doesn't appease my frustration with this purchase. \n\nI'll focus on this game now Verdant Hue. There is no menu area. There is no exit button. The save mechanics are terrible. If you have 'unlocked' a tool the next time you play that tool may or may not be unlocked. The only way that I can see to 'grow' food is to stay in the game for over 6+ in game nights which is an eternity in real life. Your character does not run. He meanders about his deceased parents farm, possibly from his injuries or from his crippling depression. I don't care. Also if you click on a square accidentally across the field you might as well get up and use the bathroom because he's going to go there 8 hours later (okay, that's excessive) because there is no way to cancel the queue. He will go to that selected square no matter how many times you click or yell otherwise. So you can only get a few things done as the day races on. There are some 'objectives' you can get in game they are requests you get from letters being stuck in your mailbox. I don't think there is a mail service running, I think you're neighbors are just sticking notes in your mailbox asking for items that will take real life years to make. There is a story in this game, this poor child had his family destroyed by rebels/enemies/whatever and now has to make life happen on his own. Is that story sad, yeah, do I feel anything for this character, sure... anger. Move faster, remember the items you had in your inventory and freaking don't take the longest route possible to that stupid square. Again, if there is a 'message' in this game it's lost. I have no compassion for this PSone sprite that moves like a slug. His story is sad, but so under developed and rushed. I would rather sit in a cubicle with the lights off than play this game that has no game play. At least in the cubicle I could use my imagination.\n\nI have never felt so duped by a recommended game. I've never written a review before, but I feel so compelled to. The only thing that isn't making me feel so horribly bad is again, that idea that maybe .04 of my money that I spent goes to charity of some kind. Really though if you want to help a cause give money straight to them and skip this game. At least you'll feel like your money went to something.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198059326550", "last_played": 1471117548, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 71, "playtime_forever": 32}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1471118633, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501427", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1471118633, "recommendationid": "24894199", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
