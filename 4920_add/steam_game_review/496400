Winterbottom. The puzzle mechanic relies on recording actions for a level specific set of ghosts  which in turn have to help navigate the protagonist through deadly sources of light and around obstacles. While sounding basic at first, the game requires both planning, timing as well as some thinking around the corner.\n\nThe art design and soundtrack are amazing, the puzzles themselves ore both intuitive as well as creative. Only the story is mildly on the light side, but considering all the other outstanding features, Renoir is a bonafide puzzle game and ranges among the better half of them.\n\nWith about 7 hours of playtime for one playthrough it also has more than enough depth to justify its asking price.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969749884", "last_played": 1504850290, "num_reviews": 753, "num_games_owned": 1384, "playtime_forever": 1182}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1504850656, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508419", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504850656, "recommendationid": "34808749", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
