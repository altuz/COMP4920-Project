In many ways this game reflects what a Banished sequel could have looked like and the devs were obviously inspired by Banished to begin with. However despite all of its potential, this game falls flat for a number of reasons. The biggest of which is the fact that even though the game has left early access, it hardly resembles a finished product. There are buildings that serve no purpose, some game mechanics are clunky and need to be reworked, and even on my more or less up to date PC it suffers from harsh lagging when my village gets too big.\n\nPros:\n-Relaxing, polished visuals\n-Very nice soundtrack\n-Lots to do early game and tons of options for how to tackle expansion\n-Challenging as hell, but rewarding when you manage to make it to the next year\n-Steam Workshop support\n\nCons:\n-Limited, repetitive soundtrack (still sounds great however)\n-Lack of functional late game structures\n-Odd terrain that makes it difficult to gauge where you can and cannot build\n-Tricky terraforming tools, though this was slightly improved with the latest update\n-The first person mode is sort of pointless. The controls feel awkward and severely dated. I actually haven't even used this feature once in my last couple of villages\n-Substantial lag and performance declines when the village grows to a certain size\n-Villagers sometimes take dumb, unpredictable routes to get to their jobs, making it difficult to efficiently plan the village's layout\n-Late game expeditions yield little to no reward despite the immense time and resources that go into making them happen\n\nLike I said, I will update my review if any of this changes in future updates, but I want to stress that this is not a complete game. I cannot tell the difference between the game as it is now versus when it was in early access.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034355853", "last_played": 1500416360, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 351, "playtime_forever": 2048}, "votes_up": 42, "timestamp_created": 1504638287, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562034", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504638287, "recommendationid": "34762705", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I have been eyeing this game for the best part of a year.
