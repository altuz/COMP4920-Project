I tested the game out, writing notes about the Pros And Cons of the game..\n\nSo let's start with the Pros:\n\n- Simple Menu Layout\n\n- Nice background Music\n\n- Good Graphics\n\n- Has a tutorial\n\n- Simple controls\n\n- Gave me a Portal Gun.. Best game of the Year...\n\n\nAnd now The Cons...\n\n- Told me to Install a custom font...\n\n- English isn't the best\n\n- Cannot Change controls\n\n- I Found Myself Doing Nothing...\n\n- Its... Empty...\n\n- Space econmy system... How does that even apply...\n\n- I sold resources that I didn't have\n\n- Building anything is just... boring...\n\n- No Sense of achievement.\n\n- Basically, BORING!\n\n\nSo with the Pros and Cons said, these are the stats to Summarize the Game:\n\n- Story = 3/10\n\n- Graphics = 5/10\n\n- Cinematics = 2/10 (Only landing cinematic)\n\n- Music = 4/10\n\n- Content = 4/10\n\n- Controls = 6/10\n\n- Gameplay = 4/10\n\n- Price - 6/10\n\nAll out of 80 = 34/80. Summarize = 4/10\n\n\nSo to anyone who intends on buying it, don't, unless you want to spend $1.98 on a game that has nothing, boring and bland, it might be worth getting it if it becomes a full game, but for now, it's not worth the money, so overall, this is a Bad Game...\n\nHere is the Review Video = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4c7BvYmnyU", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198131884884", "last_played": 1468076957, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 68, "timestamp_created": 1468079850, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568075", "votes_down": 18, "timestamp_updated": 1468079850, "recommendationid": "24210211", "votes_funny": 6, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I like indie games, but that's the first game I've asked for a refund.
