So far it fast paced and has great potential for more active tactics. A split second mistake, or choosing the wrong move at the wrong time will cost you. But at the same time it slows the action at key moments, with great visual cues to help you get timing down. For example, a circle appears under the monster showing how long until the move triggers, this combined with a slight slowed time effect creates great tension. Will you get the move off before your opponent, did you tell your monster to move/block in time?\n\nBattles are already fun. Not alot of people to battle at the moment. But theres plenty of AI to hone your skills. \n\nThe monsters are a good base, and the two main dinos are definitly in the right direction. But I feel like the place this game lacks a bit is the look of the monsters. They arent bad, but i feel like they need more tweaking. Unfortunatly with the custom stlyes temporarly disabled I cannot say if that changes my opinion. They almost remind me of spore, kinda too round, not enought detail here and there. But I refuse to judge early on this matter. I imagine they will be designed and redisigned before they are thru. As of now one monster already got a major overhaul. I never saw the original, but I think the purple cat looks promising.\n\nI feel like the player is a placeholder a bit. He looks, well, kinda goofy. I imagine going with the spirit of monsters visual customization, that the player will be similairly done at some point. \n\nThis is in its early stages so I dont expect the visual aspects to be set in stone, so this commentary could quickly be irrelevant.\n\nlevel 1-10 is kinda fast, I hope level cap will be higher in the future. But the blancing of levels in arena is a good choice. One that simailarly worked for pokemon. \n\nIn conclusion, right direction, keep going. I recommend!\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198205753280", "last_played": 1504586952, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 85, "playtime_forever": 906}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1502439416, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502841", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502439416, "recommendationid": "34163562", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a game with great potential, it has a ways to go at the point of writing this review however it is chugging along rather nicely with newer features popping up relatively quickly and being worked on in good time. I've enjoyed what fights I have had so far and found them to be very exciting when fighting other people, sometimes lasting a little while from intensity of back and forth. \n\nAs far as how the game runs I've had no issues with that, it feels very smooth, I have basically no FPS drops whatsoever and haven't crashed as far as this point, the game is rather well versed in those regards most definitely. \n\nI can't say much about single player content yet as it is being worked on in due time but I have great interest in seeing where the game will flow out in terms of single player content in the future.

Not much going on, but there's a handful of monsters to pick from, and you can still fight players (When there's any online), or party up to go venturing through the wilds together. \n\nIt's a work-in-progress, clearly, but I gladly threw some money at this to help the developer, this game deserves support. \n\nIf you want to help a developer make a good game, go ahead and buy this, enjoy it for a bit, maybe take it for a spin with your friends and mess around for a bit. \nIf you want a full game, with no flaws or bugs, or not ready to commit?
