I started from the beginning at YOLO mode. I got a couple lines of dialogue like \"wake up. The clown guy is coming\" and then people walked across a bridge toward me forever. Literally forever. I thought, \"well damn, if I keep hitting them up to 10,000, surely the game will progress.\" Then I thought, \"Well, surely 20,000 would be enough.\" Nope. I just kept typing the words until I decided to unistall this POS. Loved the ideas. Love typing games. This isn't a game. It is a really boring version of typershark. Why would I need endless mode? This game is already endless.
