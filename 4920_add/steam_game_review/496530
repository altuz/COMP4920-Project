Guessing and memorisation, thats about it. \nThere is no puzzle in this puzzle game, but I put it on to keep my hands busy while watching more entertaining things. That is until the levels became almost impossible due to bugs where prisms dont split colours correctly. (Or at all, but I think thats deliberate. Its genuinely hard to tell.)\n\nYou can try wrestle round them by switching off one colour then returning it to reset how the prism splits. Though making certain patterns in the process of doing this will, despite the very simplistic graphics, make things stutter and struggle. \n\nThis is ignoring such tedious mechanics as parts that only show up when you sweep a beam over them for... apparently no reason at all, it adds nothing but one more item to memorise if you ever want to torture yourself with completing the time challenges, which are also largely pointless. \n\nOh, and I nearly forgot that some of the colours are almost identical and many of them, because of the unintuitive way they mix, and total lack of any real logic or suggestion by design require multiple tiers of guessing as you mix the main colours, that may or may not have to be mixed again to get the right hue.\n\nIn short, this is a terrible 'game'. If its on sale you might pick it up as I did, as something to mess with. Though, the fact it ended up failing at that much makes me suspect youd have a much better time hurling a pack of cards on the floor and trying to guess which number and suit the face down ones are.
