This essentially copies Dream Quest--not just concepts, but many specific abilities and cards--but Dream Quest is a good game to copy.  I feel Monster Slayers does some stuff better but other stuff worse.\n\n[b]UI: Prettier but less functional.[/b]  Monster Slayers employed an actual artist! But Dream Quest does a great job of making info on keywords, stats, cooldowns, etc. all available when you want it, while Monster Slayers does a pretty poor job of this.\n\n[b]More emphasis on grind.[/b]  Both games require you to spend several runs unlocking advantages before you have a serious shot at winning, but Dream Quest's are achievement-based, whereas Monster Hunter focuses more on just playing a long time.  Monster Hunter also seems to have more vertical power growth, which made the first dungeon of future runs start to feel trivial after only a few runs.  And when you beat Monster Hunter, you lose the items you used to do it, so it requires ongoing grinding to replace them (whereas in Dream Quest, once everything is unlocked, it's unlocked).\n\n[b]Earlier diversity.[/b]  Dream Quest classes grow differently but start pretty similar.  Monster Hunters classes seem to start with more differences and acquire unique cards faster.  Also, Monster Hunters has several cards that can be used in multiple ways.\n\n[b]Easier.[/b]  Some days, I felt like I had to make 5 runs on Dream Quest before one of them got good enough card options to make a viable deck.  Monster Hunters seems more consistent and overall easier.  (Note:  This may not be apples-to-apples, since I started playing Dream Quest before they added easier difficulty settings, and I have not unlocked Monster Slayer's \"legendary mode\".)\n\n[b]Balance seems more erratic.[/b]  Just a gut feel, but Dream Quest strikes me as more finely-tuned, whereas Monster Slayers feels like it lets you get into degenerate cases (such as playing your whole deck every turn, or killing the final boss in one round) more easily and with greater impact.\n\n(Note:  I played Dream Quest on iOS, and most of my play with it was a long time ago.)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197987014920", "last_played": 1500765578, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 277, "playtime_forever": 1289}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1499496975, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506857", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499496975, "recommendationid": "33365581", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Each time you select a hero, then you get 3 \"runs\" through different areas.\n\nRun 1: Easy.
