It\u2019s \u201chorror\u201d. It\u2019s made in Unity Personal. This is generally a hat trick of crap for a LOT of horror games. I\u2019ll give you a minute. (Skip to after the overview if you want a video)\n\n[b]UPDATE: After running the game for about nine hours, not a single trading card dropped. Surprising absolutely nobody, it's safe to assume even that is broken with this garbage. Strike that from the pros list.[/b]\n\n[i]Welcome to intermission. Do do do do do do do do do do do.\nYeahhhh intermission.\nDo do do do do do do do do. Do do do do do do do do do.\nDo do do do do do do do do do do. Ahhhhhh.\nDo do do do do do do. (Ahhhhhh) Do do do do do do do.\nDo do do do do do do do do do do.[/i]\n\nStill here? Alright.\n\n[i]Antihorror[/i] is a terrible game. It seems to be humorous that pokes fun at itself, and possibly horror game tropes, but is just terrible in how it goes about that.\n\nYou begin the game on a poorly animated bus as a passenger, when suddenly a picture of a bladder appears on the screen and says URINE! Turns out you need to pee. So you ask the bus driver to pull over so you can go pee in the bushes, yet there happens to be a toilet right where he drops you off. Because that\u2019s video game logic.\n\nAnyway, something happens, the bus pops a wheelie and takes off, while rocks that appear from nowhere come crashing down, forcing you to turn around and head to the town. Because of course.\n\nIt seems to be a type of Slenderman game. I found a musical score, picked it up, and it told me I collected one of seven. I then turned around and some random shadowy figure started playing the piano. My character, in obvious fashion, tells the \u201cragamuffin\u201d to get out. I then found four more notes, each one also accompanied with a jump scare that wasn\u2019t really scary. All the time, it sounds like I was being followed by a mosquito? There\u2019s a really annoying buzz that seems to close in then back off. I found what appeared to be a motel, walked into the only lit room, my footsteps suddenly disappeared, then the game crashed.\n\nSpeaking of lit rooms, the game is exceptionally dark. I understand that horror games are best played in the dark, and I love playing them in the dark, but this is just extreme. The video and screenshots on the store page are what it actually looks like. I had to crank up the brightness on my monitor. I would\u2019ve changed the gamma in-game, but there\u2019s no option. In fact, you can only Play and Exit. Can\u2019t do anything else.\n\nControls are atrocious. Often times you\u2019ll go to enter a door, but can\u2019t for whatever reason, so you need to jump to get through it. Same goes for stairs.\n\nI\u2026can\u2019t really go on much more, as I\u2019m struggling to find anything worthwhile about [i]Antihorror[/i].\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SDzreL0RQQ\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list][*]Cheap\n[*][strike]Trading cards[/strike] (these are broken and not dropping)\n[/list]\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list][*]Extremely dark, and not in an immersive way\n[*]Vague gameplay\n[*]Subpar graphics and sound effects\n[*]Jump scares that are neither scary nor shocking\n[*]Mundane environment\n[/list]\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nIf this is some sort of statement, or art project that I don\u2019t understand, then I will fully admit that I am far too stupid to \u201cunderstand\u201d it.

Obwohl, eigentlich ist es kein Horror Spiel sondern eher Comedy. Sinn ergibt das ganze gar nicht, aber es hat doch einige wirklich gute Lacher drin. Alles ist sehr skuril und absurd. Insgesamt ist es recht kurz, man kann es unter einer Stunde durchspielen. Grafisch sieht es akzeptabel aus, ist aber sehr dunkel. Leider benutzt es viele Unity Assets, die aus anderen Games bekannt sind.. Das Spiel hat nur eine russische Sprachausgabe, aber die Texte sind englisch. Der Sound ist okay. Die Steuerung ist auch gut. Im ersten Teil des Spiels muss man 7 Notizen finden, danach gibt es auch einige kleine R\u00e4tsel zu l\u00f6sen. Alles eher unkompliziert. Mir hat es Spa\u00df gemacht, aber man muss schon den spezellen Humor m\u00f6gen. F\u00fcr den kleinen Preis empfehle ich es. \n\nPro:\n\n- Witzig\n- Preisniveau\n- Macht Spa\u00df\n\nContra:\n\n- Besteht nur aus Unity Assets\n- Insgesamt wirkt es sehr billig\n- Spiel ist sehr dunkel\n\n\n\nHier ist ein Video der ersten Minuten, einen kompletten Walkthough von mir findet ihr in den Guides:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPdiaPk8IAA\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197981111953", "last_played": 1490620886, "num_reviews": 62, "num_games_owned": 8882, "playtime_forever": 232}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1470310530, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476913", "votes_down": 26, "timestamp_updated": 1470310530, "recommendationid": "24706356", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
