One of them gets a 50% boost to production!   Another has a spell to create a random item, usually a potion.\n- Your rivals can build cities anywhere WITHOUT clearing out the enemy camps!\n- The rivals fill up the entire map with cities in about 10 turns, long before you can get any pioneers out\n- Why can I equip a sword on a wolf?  Lots of examples of this.\n- Because leveling your characters is pretty critical to success in this game, it feels really terrible that the tactical AI always targets your character with the weakest defense, making it very difficult to keep them alive\n- Spells are very unbalanced.

Really nice gameplay and graphics are pretty on par for a game of it's kind.\n\nHowever, after about 30-40 minutes of play I cannot open any menus in the game without it crashing.
