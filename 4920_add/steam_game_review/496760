Technically, it's out of time...the actors look different, the colors are washed out, the sound is plastic, the movement is clumsy. But still, you like it because of what it is at its core... now, imagine  you played this one game when it camed out, when technically it was something else, and when, besides the thecnical distractions of the time,  you stood there, watching, an amazing story, with interesting and engaging characters, and you watched until the very end when you didn't have any more words, you just stood there in silence, thinking of what you have just watched. You were amazed at what video games may become, one day, some day, but today, today you are just sixteen years old and you feel lucky , because you travelled the world, across the ocean onto far away lands, places you never been (and probably you'll never be, but you never know) you travelled to europe, you don't speak german, (And you barely speak english, wich you are just learning ) and travelling (for real) is so impossible, so expensive for someone of your class, so out of reach for you,  and still, you have travelled the world, you felt in love with the romantic, the wild, the unknown. And you are just sixteen and you are so far away from all of it, but life is just beginning.... and you've already experienced something special.\n\nThat's how it felt when i first played Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast within and it still does, but in a different a way, today.\n\nYears have passed, and of course, technically, the game is very old, it would be impossible not to note that this game is from another era, before high definition, 1080p, streaming, online movies, even before dvds, this game was on 6 cds at the time, a time when vhs analog tapes were the way to watch a movie at home, and also a time of full screens (wide screen didn't exist), and dolby digital was just something for the theaters. Sound was in mono... Its' impossible not to note that because it will be a distraction first, the same way it was a distraction at the time how good it was technicallly (during the 90s) but once you look behind all the thecnicallities (even if you played it many years before like i did you will get distracted by thecnical stuff) you will still find (hopefully) the amazing story, that is the beast within.\n\nWhen the main character of this story, who is a sort of detective of \"special\" cases, is hired by a group of people of a small german town to investigate the dissapereance of one child, that they believe was killed by a werewolf... (yeah, of course it sounds cliche i know) you will start an expansive investigation across time and history, mixing real places with real storic characters, with some fiction. An investigation that would make you learm a little of european history, about king Ludwig II , some of his castles (that still exist to this day) the story behind them and his friendship with composer Richard Wagner, a supposedly lost wagner opera (oh yes, theres and opera somewhere, there) and all this mixed with some part fiction and lots and lots of historical research.\n\nJane Jensen, the writer and designer of this game is at her best here, creating a story that even played today, still resonates with all the right notes, mixing history and fiction , with the romantic, the poetic and the grotesque (and a little ghotic, allthough historically is more romance than anything else)\nThe final confrontation of the last act, when all present and past stories and characters come to an excruciating and devastating end, reaching from the late 1800s to the (at that time present) 1990s was something so well done, so emotional, that even today makes you stop and take notice. \n\nWhats even more incredible, is that, many of this places exist in real life, (specially the castles) and is amazing to look and see them after playing the game for real (in youtube, or in person if you can) and how jane jensen creates a story of her own based on real characters. What's best is that it makes you wanna learn more about it, and that i can appreciate it a lot.\n\nFinally, the music is something special in this game, made by Robert Holmes, is one of the main things that gives character to this game, the music is not only great, but it is so unique and original. Really timeless i would say. Compression wise, the music and sound in game is not very high quality. But if you are lucky enough, you may found one special CD edition that camed out many years ago wich featured all GK2 music in cd quality. The soundtrack is haunting and dark, it's like travelling to the past, walking beside kings and reaching to classic composers, all at once, is like that. \n\nThe acting and the actors in this game are at times good, and other times.. not so much, it is a mixed bag of quality, thats what it is, but still in general is good, some characters like the main villain are really great (very well acted) wich makes a difference, and the main character(s) have their moments too, for sure.\n\nThe game itself is pretty good and straightforward for the most part, excep certain parts during the final chapter wich to be honest are not very intuitive (specially by today standards of gaming) so it might be difficult there, but nothing that can't be solved with a walkthrough.\n\nWith all its negatives and many many many positives, this is the best game in the Gabriel Knight Saga, and quite possible one of the best games by Jane Jensen.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198023019965", "last_played": 1493599570, "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 1085}, "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_created": 1492484122, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534802", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492752135, "recommendationid": "31211336", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
