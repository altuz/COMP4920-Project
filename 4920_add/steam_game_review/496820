(I have tried to make games in the past and this is really impressive since it takes so much work to create a game.)  \n\nThe basic game play is run around and discover people and items to do quests.  The scenery is beautiful and fairly smooth.  Maybe adjust some of the rigid body for objects to prevent the camera view going inside of objects.   From playing around this game is more of an approach to explore, its not a game that hand feeds you the guild to play which I find fun.   It makes me actually explore.   \n\nFinal thoughts, Great for early release and make sure you make adjustments from the community.   \n\nI watched the youtube video and they make some good points on things to fix which i Hope this is changed for final release.

After I think the area is just jungle, I see new stuff like caves and underground areas and other stuff.  I'll have to suggest the dev to show some of these areas in the screen shots.  Anyway, at first he quests are basic, but then they turn more interesting as the game progresses.  You climb more stuff and have to figure out where things are.  I think the dev did a good job since the game gets better the longer I played.
