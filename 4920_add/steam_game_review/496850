It reminds me a little of Dr. Mario meets Columns. Instead of just clearing gems off of your own screen, your successful combinations (chains) directly trigger attacks on your opponent's ships, in the form of debris. This debris is randomly placed on top of your opponent's gems, typically blocking their ability to create matches. The only way to clear the debris is to make a gem match next to the debris, which will destory it along with the gems. The larger the combinations of gem matches, the larger the attack on your opponents (and subsequent debris field dropped upon them). Of course, the whole time you are wreaking havoc on your opponents, they are also attempting to wreak havoc upon you.\n\n\nPros:\n\n+ Online Multiplayer that supports up to 8 players in various combinations of humans, AI Bots, Teams\n+ Plenty of customization options\n+ Addictive when playing against friends - always looking to create a huge chain attack by planning ahead\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Currently low playerbase - Likely need to get friends to buy it as well (it's worth it IMO)\n\n\nWhile I don't think it would be fair to call it a \"Con\", due to the fact that it doesn't impact the gameplay, I would say that the graphics are only adequate. The particle effects and sounds are nice, but I feel like the menus and color scheme are a bit dreary/dated. While this doesn't hamper gameplay in the least, I do wish there was a bit more polish and shine to the overall aesthetics. Certainly not a deal-breaker, however. Just something that would help being a bit more character to the game.\n\nThe only other thing I would like to see is an alternate rotation of the gems provided. Those of you who have played games like Dr. Mario will be well aware of the way the gems rotated. While it might seem like a small thing, it really makes a big difference (especially when the game picks up speed and you have very little time to think). I routinely end up misplacing a gem, because its horizontal position moves one column over while being rotated, due to the way the gems rotate arond the right-side \"block\". The dev has said this alternative rotation scheme might be offered in an update, which would be outstanding and certainly make this the complete package in my mind.\n\nAll things considered, I find this game to be a fun game to play with friends. It has that \"one more match\" appeal that is exactly what you are typically looking for in a game like this. Rarely do you see games in this genre that also offer online multiplayer (up to 8 players!). Not only can you play online with your friends (or strangers), but you can even play cooperatively (teams) in any combination of humans vs AI bots. There is even the ability to spectate a match once you are knocked out (or even for the whole match, if you choose to do so). It's really nice to see so much customization offered.\n\nIf you like this genre of game, I don' think you can go wrong with your $10.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197973935979", "last_played": 1480872398, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 369, "playtime_forever": 1510}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1472611726, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510022", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1472611726, "recommendationid": "25261257", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pretty fun game.
