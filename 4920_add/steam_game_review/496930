The idea of Crayon Physics meets platforming intrigued me. The puzzles are pretty good, and the devs are generous (maybe a little too much) to provide the solutions to each puzzle in the form of a jigsaw puzzle in-game. But often, I'll have a solution in mind but not be able to execute it, and I can't tell whether the fault is with my solution or with the pixels not being aligned just right. To get a piece of a solution to work usually takes a dozen tries. This isn't helped by the fact that the character can't seem to swim in shallow waters or hop over an obstacle that's just a little too high.\n\nA good concept, but I'd only recommend it when it's on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024982599", "last_played": 1499644261, "num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 218, "playtime_forever": 158}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499575480, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504774", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499575480, "recommendationid": "33394005", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I really wanted to like this, and at first all was well, but the issues just mounted up and it cant scrape by with a recommend.\n\nSome of the problems: \n-The hint system isnt a hint system, it just tells you the solution. (Though some of the levels are so obscure in their contraptions perhaps thats not all bad.)\n-The game is minimal to the point of irritation and lacks basic options or any meaningful story, this is most annoying with controls that overlap character movement with line positioning meaning you can accidentally screw up with a miss click.\n-The last levels in particular seemed to be bugged, slowing down time when they shouldnt and actually allowing me to do things that I wasnt meant to be able to. \n-It looks fine with nice stylised art, but the pseudo 3D compounds issues with drawing precisely. \n-The sound isnt great even as little of it as there is, it mostly just played an ambient loop that varied in volume for no reason and you could hear it glitch whenever it looped round.\n\nbut all of this is minor compared to the biggest problem. This isnt so much a puzzle game, youll spend far more time implementing the answers, and implementing them with an incredibly imprecise and consequently intensly frustrating game system. \n\n-The lines you draw are fat, cant be drawn in areas they appear they should be able to be drawn. \n-They have attrocious collision detection so no matter how much you try to get pixel perfect drawings when the line is produced it will still settle, sometimes up to millimetres in to place. \n-The line doesnt follow edges, itll just stop drawing when you get too near and as mentioned above, too near is impossible to tell with its terrible collisions. \n-Lines will sometimes be produced with the end missing if the game deems it to have moved in to a collision at some point (Even on screens that appear static.) \n-Sometimes they dissapear on a hazard that they are clearly not touching. \n\nThere were a half dozen times I checked the solution to find out what I was doing wrong, and it turned out, nothing. I was doing nothing wrong, I just needed to try over, and over, and over again until it happens to all fall in to place just right and work.\n\nWith the vast majority of my time spent wrestling with the system, it makes a promising game tedious and whenever progress can be significantly lost, very frustrating.\n\n\nIve been pretty harsh here, it can be clever at times, and there are a couple of mini-games that are quite fun. There is enough interesting about it to take a look when its cheap so consider it in a good sale, but ultimately it just wasnt all that fun.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197996964816", "last_played": 1504460687, "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 1496, "playtime_forever": 358}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504462864, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505330", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504462864, "recommendationid": "34718416", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
