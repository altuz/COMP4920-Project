Dont expect it to be great.\" Well I was wrong. This game is amazing so far! Granite I have not put an entirely long amount of time into this game. Although I plan to! This game has so many skills I could not decide on what to upgrade. Which I like about games. Always making me think before I choose something. Great crafting, a lot of that, Exploring is fun. The combat I have never seen before, so when I first saw I was a little nervous, but it is really fun. It is like a combination of Fruit Ninja and Child of Light. Which might sound weird but it works really well.  Really cool amazing game. Being $3. Definitely worth it! This is exactly what I have been looking for. Anyone who is looking for an rpg survival game with story and lots of content, You have found it. I know this game just came out, but do you have any ideas for maybe adding DLC into the game? Or just adding more? I know there is a lot now, but I already want more :) 10/10 from me. Keep it up!        EDIT: DEVELOPERS! I FOUND A BUG WHERE SOMETIMES WHEN A BATTLE LOADS IT GOES FOR A SECOND THEN THE BATTLE FREEZES, NOT THE GAME AS I CAN STILL PAUSE THE BATTLE BUT IT DOESNT RESTART IVE LOST LOTS OF PROGRESS PLEASE FIX! :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198272564033", "last_played": 1472762957, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_forever": 256}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1471672216, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488445", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1471839534, "recommendationid": "25026560", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}]}
