It provides a virtual reality experience of the Slingshot ride you might see at some amusement parks. I have 2 gripes with it though. The minor problem is I got dizzy very quickly after trying it out. And I know, you're in a simulated ride that's supposed to make you dizzy. But it wasn't that kind of dizzy, it was like reading a book in a car kind of dizzy. Just got a head ache and felt nautious. But I could deal with that except for the price. $7.99 is a really steep price for this game. I honestly think it should be free to play when you have cheaper options that provide much more content, like the light saber VR game, and even that doesn't have much content. I know this game isn't supposed to have bunches of content, but the price does not reflect that, and that's why I wouldn't recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025312934", "last_played": 1468205734, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 141, "playtime_forever": 787}, "votes_up": 75, "timestamp_created": 1467838933, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613739", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1467838933, "recommendationid": "24143226", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "took me a min to figure out the space bar is to start the ride.... u will feel a lil nautious as u keep flippin up there but not bad expierence but 7.99 is too steep for this quick ride should of been 3.00... so cuz of price i gotta do thumbs down...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198087268445", "last_played": 1483137078, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 216, "playtime_forever": 32}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1467867876, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511207", "votes_down": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1467867876, "recommendationid": "24150108", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "this game is poorly designed and will not work with htc vive", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198347667631", "last_played": 1495942157, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 39, "playtime_forever": 147}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1483854102, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498970", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1483854102, "recommendationid": "29107803", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Picked this up on sale and is well worth the price of admission imo, dont know why people give a negative review because they cant handle the motion sickness of vr.

If you can handle this kind of ride in real life and have your \"vr legs\" you will be fine, but of course if you would sh*t yourself on this ride in real life and/or you dont have your \"vr legs\" yet you probably dont want to try this out unless you lay out a tarp under you and around you.
