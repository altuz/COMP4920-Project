No jitteriness issues which is great to see. Bright and colourful world so the kids can join in, but in survival mode it's still stressful enough. Cartoon or not, seeing a cartoon zombie up close is intense. Perfect balance\n\n\nPlayed survival mode surrounded by zombies - I screamed like a baby when my kid pushed me......fun for the whole family!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969703418", "last_played": 1498354270, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 1715, "playtime_forever": 663}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1487477043, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1487489878, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496230", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1487578196, "developer_response": "We are glad that you liked the game.

It's worth it if it's on sale. The kids like it too. \n\nPROS:\nIt's fun, at least for a little while.\nDecent graphics.\nCatchy tune.\nProbably get about 10 hours out of it if you got a lot of people who don't mind playing it.\n\nCONS:\nBUGS\nNo way to aim. Just point and hope for the best.\nCan't fire during rifle reloads.\nYou can only have one weapon out at a time.\nPoints are useless as there is no Leaderboard. \nYou can only max out on 100ish credits at a time, so if you want to unlock anything you need to get real good on Hard mode at the farm, survival. \nMy personal opinion is that the cost for new guns is way to damn high. \nOnline Store is a joke. I bought the shotgun for $2 and it's suppose to automatically consume it and give me the shotgun when I launch the game. Instead, I didn't get the shotgun AND lost 1000 credits.  So don't buy anything from their store. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 484, "steamid": "76561198006057736", "last_played": 1507129494, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 412, "playtime_forever": 484}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506872742, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506872742, "recommendationid": "35386525", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
