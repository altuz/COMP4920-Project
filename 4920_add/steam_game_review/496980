It is however historically interesting and lovingly ported/updated. The game is only similar to Dig Dug on a surface level as it's more of a base defense situation that needs to be approached with a unique strategy.\n\nAs a museum piece it'd be nice if there were some more supplemental materials (interviews, original source code, translated articles) either in-game or as an external download. Either way, I'd love to see more of this kind of update on steam instead of barebones roms running on bad emulators.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197980658013", "last_played": 1474315831, "num_reviews": 57, "num_games_owned": 377, "playtime_forever": 209}, "votes_up": 41, "timestamp_created": 1468522553, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568832", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1468522553, "recommendationid": "24320003", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Movie buffs sometimes refer to silent cinema being \"pure film\" untouched by anything other than a visual. Some game buffs consider classic games to be \"pure games\" with nary a trace of overt narrative etc. to get in the way of sheer gameplay. Cosmic Cavern 3671 is decidedly classic, a reverent update of a Japanese computer game that likely predates most of Steam's users.\n\n(As for \"purity\" itself, there's really no such thing. While antiquarian video games had \"extra-game-ic\" sound effects, narrative settings, screen overlays, decorated cabinets etc., silent movies in the early twentieth century had live sound effects and soundtracking etc.)\n\nJust like silent movies, Cosmic Cavern isn't for everyone (though some curmudgeons like myself  will claim that it really would be if gamers truly gave it a chance and appreciated it for what it is). Still, faulting a game like this for being \"simplistic\" is akin to faulting hockey for having ice and skates.\n\nThere's elegance in simplicity, as evincid by CC3671, and that simplicity is also part of its charm. Within seconds of starting up you can be playing it competently and having a blast--no load screens, cutscenes, or tutorials necessary. Games of this vintage tend to emphasize concept over other concerns. This one in particular allows for the sort of free-form experimentation that in many modern \"AAA\" games results in hitting \"invisible walls.\" Still, just as many people refuse to watch old films as therir cinematic menus are full of contemporary movies, I can appreciate that some peoplle won't have the time or care to develop a palette for Cosmic Cavern, fair enough. Life is short. Play what you like.

It's a great port, and unlike a lot of other, lazier ports, doesn't run in an emulator. You can get the full, original, cosmic cavern experience. Which you may not know you want, but actually, you do. Many people, like myself, would never get the opportunity to play this game otherwise, which is a shame, because it's awesome. There are some difficulties, the game has its refresh rate, and thus its game speed, tied to your monitors, so if you're running at anything beyond 60hz, it's difficult to play. You can manually set the framerate using 3rd party software, so that's not much of a problem, but still, something to note. \n\nIn any case, the dev is excellent at responding to posts on the community forum, and did say that a patch is in the works. Something like that. Beyond that, which, hey, may be a bit annoying, this is a hearty recommendation.
