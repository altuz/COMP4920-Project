I normally enjoy hidden object and puzzle games but this game didn't keep my interest throughout the 2.5 hours it took to complete the game to 100%. It's just the same thing through 11 levels. The puzzles really aren't difficult and there are no penalties for over clicking when trying to find objects. Towards the end of the game I found myself just clicking quickly anywhere just so I could get the objects and get to the end of the game. The story is very weak. I couldn't have cared less if he he found his brother or not. There was just no excitement to the storyline. Just a number of pictures. No animation. \nIt's not a bad game at all. The illustrations are fine and the puzzles are fine if not a bit too easy. Perhaps this would suit younger gamers who like this genre.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017076824", "last_played": 1489429318, "num_reviews": 53, "num_games_owned": 6276, "playtime_forever": 158}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1487974814, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511721", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487974814, "recommendationid": "30151949", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Well I've played a lot of hidden object games and this one reminds me on of those oldschool classic hog.\nOn the other side this game is \"indie\" hog, there's something that you won't see in other similar games. \nGraphics is quite good, but the most important thing is storyline and atmosphere.\nI really like the world and characters presented in this game.
