But I gathered you collect crystals and go higher in 'Asend mode' and leap was self explanatory.\n\nDepth perception and perspective are things this game does not do well. \nDangerous obstacles like spinning blades and lasers are extremely difficult to know how close they are to your hitbox and the player feels unreasonable punished when hit. But there doesn't seem to be any set of rules set to understand how to handle them. (especially if its random rotation and position) a few times the blade is right over the crystal. (how am I meant to get that?) so depth perception makes it difficult to judge distances. \n\nPerspective is also something else that makes it difficult to judge distances and how your shift boost works. Due to the angle you are ascending and the stairs been sharp right angles. alot of obstcales are not seen until the very last second. Most of this comes down to the first person perspective. The camera postion makes it difficult in many situations. \n\nOverall for the price its pretty cool. But its the kind of game you play once and not really after that. This is really becasue the two major things I mentioned above  Depth perception and prespective.  Other than that I can see someone getting enjoyment out of it.

The controls are a bit wonky but I feel it is designed that way on purpose, once I got used to the controls the game became a lot more fun. The obstacles get very difficult (at least in the case of the leap course), after the first few missions. The only complaint that I have is the lack of explanation once you start the game but with some trial and error I was able to figure it out.  overall for $1.60 I'd reccomend this game to anyone who might be curious, or into first person platforming. 7/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041439891", "last_played": 1472609686, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 254, "playtime_forever": 150}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1468189540, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491094", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1468189540, "recommendationid": "24241659", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "In leap the 6th level is amost impossible atleast ad a skip level", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198217684805", "last_played": 1473174191, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 33, "playtime_forever": 36}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1468161551, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488453", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1468161551, "recommendationid": "24232704", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
