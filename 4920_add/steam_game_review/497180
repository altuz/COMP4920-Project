Yes, it does have quite a few bugs. Yes, the graphics are not amazing. Yes, it can lag at times. But this game has an amazing community, providing numerous patches to help said bugs, graphics and lag. Oh, and not to mention the metric-F**KLOAD of content available through mods. No other game is quite like this one, and I have personally never even started a campaign. Just the building and testing cars is a game on its own.\n\nAlso, while there is occasional lag, I am running this on a laptop with a 5400 rpm drive and 2.7 ghz cpu, integrated graphics and rarely experience any serious lag during gameplay, only while loading (Due to the drive speed).\n\nPros:\n+Devoted Developement that takes community feedback,\n+Incredible car building and customization options, both performance and appearance related.\n+Near endless replayability with mods.\n+Multiple Gamemodes.\n+A good amount of cars and parts.\n\nCons:\n-Bugs\n-General Performance issues.\n-Somewhat dated graphics.\n\nTLDR: Good game if you dont mind occasional bugs.
