I'm enjoying where the story is going so far but I have a complaint. I think it's actually keeping me from progressing in the story. So, where the first gunshop is, in the section below that there is a room that when  I enter I get stuck in place. I can't mov about, I'm just stuck in place everytime I enter that room. I'm not exactly not recommending this but could I get some help? Thanks.\n\nBugs have been fixed, feeling a lot better about this game :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198347029606", "last_played": 1481468567, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_forever": 111}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1481323826, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488686", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1481468541, "recommendationid": "28278400", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
