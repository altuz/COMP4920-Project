I started playing, got 3 levels in, no more customers were showing up. The game then tells you to try the bell for free, it will help bring in customers! So sure I tried it (I thought it would be sold with game money) Nope. Next level customers stopped showing up again, with 45 sec. left on the level. The game then prompts me to buy the bell, then procedes to tell me I don't have enough gold bars, and I should buy some. Mind you, you get coins, not gold bars from playing. Well I ignored that, and chose to play on.  That remaining play time was 45 seconds of watching the clock tick by. Not ONE more customer came over. It is a rip off plain and simple. Even with the low price, the game will cost you a fortune to play.
