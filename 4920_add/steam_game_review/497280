From the screenshots, description, and video, this game seemed like a unique and challenging take on the platforming genre. Unfortunatly, what hampers this game are the things that should have made it great. This game has no instructions on what each obect represents and how anything interacts. Some things are done well, like how you can't see verticality, so you must learn to think like that and memorize how jumping works, which is both intuitive and unique in a way that greatly benefits the game as an experience. Even now when I understand the game, it still isn't fun. The puzzle mechanic of switching lights from blue to yellow in order to activate a door was cryptic and confusing. Also, the music (besides the menu music) was absolutely horrid, and is the reason I had to quit to the menu even 5-10 minutes or so as I just couldn't bear it. The sound design is also harsh on the ears, as the noises made by the enemy is really unpleasent, which is why I had to turn off everything and go silent. This allowed me to see the visual and mechanical problems with this game, which are abundant. The color choices for certain objects was distracting, since many \"things\" look similar, and the colors overall left a lot to be desired. The gameplay is bland, and the game itself it absurdly difficult, as enemies have so much health that you might as well avoid them, and they are place in really inconvenient positions. The AI seems to be horribly put together, and the mix of fighting this \"things\" while also trying to solve puzzles button puzzles never meshed well. This game is stupidly difficult due to the problems I have already stated, but also because of the extremely long levels, that makes memorization of enemies and the puzzles mechanics a must, and turns the game into annoying and tedious trial and error. As well as all this, it seems as if the game only has 9 or so levels, which is certainly not worth the $3 price tag. Honestly, and regrettably, I feel that this is an exercise in what not to do with a great, innovative, and unique idea.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198169175832", "last_played": 1474254619, "num_reviews": 37, "num_games_owned": 196, "playtime_forever": 24}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1474253888, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519411", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1474329306, "recommendationid": "25581661", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is far from developed, but this game is hard, annoying, but is a new vision into the platformer genre. the puzzles will take a little bit of time and learning how to use the items will take a few moments to get familliar to them from different games, but it is fun", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198127441691", "last_played": 1474341050, "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 137, "playtime_forever": 184}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1474341293, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498571", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1474341293, "recommendationid": "25597538", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is interesting, it is a strangely addicting, not in a good way.
