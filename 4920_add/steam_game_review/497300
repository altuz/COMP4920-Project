I have about one hour gameplay by now, but considering this game is flying deep under the radar due to the same-day release of a similar but much more hyped VR game I decided to write a review.\n\nIn Always Higher, you start at the bottom of a cylindrical structure, and must get to the top. along the whole height of the structure are plaforms with inbuilt teleporter which must be activated to move forward. Along the way you meet enemies and turrets, you find new weapons and energy cubes, and from time to time you find a teleporter which sends you somewhere else. So the flow is : shoot enemies, active teleporter through a (so far) easy reaction mini-game, teleport to the next highest platform, repeat.\n\nAt its most basic, Always Higher is a room scale, 360 degrees wave shooter. Where it differs from any other VR wave shooter I've tried so far is that it includes (if the first, not mandatory, one is representative of something players meet later on, then NON-trivial) puzzles. Also, despite involving teleporting, it makes actual sense and doesn't feel like a cop-out. There is a story, but how much or how well this story develops  I can not tell yet.\nThe environment (so far) is basic but works and fits the theme very well, the enemies are not particularly tough, but takes strangely human tactics at times (extending their arm past the shield and shooting while staying hidden ... the typical SPT n00b tactic;). Graphically the game is everything but ugly too. The humanoid animation is slightly awkward sometimes, but I've seen way worse.\n\nThe weapons are the only slight negative I can find: I have two so far, plus a shield, and everything feels ~wimpy~. The weapon noise is a literal \"pew pew\" without any bass or power to it, and nothing seems to register when the shield is hit. Also, both seems to have a wild spreading pattern making it sometimes a bit hard to correctly aim (or maybe it's my tracking that is off? but I don't have this problem in other games). \nOh .. and the music .. big negative point! There is only one single track, and it is awesome! The game needs more of those! :)\n\nAll in all, if you would like to try a different kind of (story) shooter, that isn't all hectic and chaos, and even presents you with puzzles, AND YOU HAVE THE SPACE(!) then get this. It is still a bit raw around the edges, but it is somehow more intriguing and feels more interesting than its competitors.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197973389596", "last_played": 1491683562, "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 279, "playtime_forever": 72}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1469283763, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502274", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1469283763, "recommendationid": "24480267", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "THIS GAME WILL REQUIRE YOUR PATIENCE.  IT is absolutely fantastic for $1 but you may not understand what to do at the start.  Luckly there is a \"walk through\" in the \n\nI wouldn't recommend this game were it even $5 but  at $1 (not even on sale)  it's well worth it.  Develpers please heed some advice:\nPEOPLE PLAY VR TO FEEL CONNECTED TO THE  GAME WORLD:  THIS GAME DOES NOT FEEL GOOD TO PLAY WHEN YOU PICK IT UP.  \n\nCONS\n1. The gun is the wimpiest gun I've played in a game.  Please fix it.  Doesn't have to be a cannon but this is ridiculous.\n2. There is almost no reaction when you do hit an enemy.  Many laser bolts hit the enemy and you have no idea until he doubles over if your actually landing shots.  Even if you don't have the budget for animations add ragdoll or even just a burst of sparks when the laser hits the enemy to acknowledge hit detection.\n3. Create a better reload animation (rather than just charging battery bars) and perhaps shorten the reload time.  It's hard to anticipate how long your gun will be down for while it recharges and a reload animation would tip that off while you wait helplessly.\n4. I found it hard to know when I was getting shot and why I wasn't shielded/ behind cover properly.\n5. Some enemies are invulnerable to lasers but you have no idea because your lasers don' t show notable hit detection on vulnerable enemies anyway.\n\n6. Item interaction/ activation of consoles is way too counterintuitive.  At least put a memo or actual demo video right above the items explaining exactly how to activate them.  For much of the first half of the game It's hartd to tell if controls or glitchy or if your just doing it wrong (they are glitchy but also hard to figure out).\n7. There should be a way to go back down again (at least a short distance) to look for hidden areas and such. THere is plenty of instruction on going up, you dont need to force the player up every single step.\n8. Narrator voices are great but enemy voice acting is horrendous almost \"jill sandwich\" bad.\n\nPROS: \n1. This game has a great concept and great asthetic.\n2. Vertical height really brings out the scope of VR\n3. Very good use of room scale with dodging and ducking for cover and the teleport mechanic doesn't feel artificial.\n4. Pretty decent enemy AI in shootouts, enemis use over sheilds and cover well.\n5. Great ragdoll physics/ fall deaths when enemies do go down instead of retreating though the teleport.\n6. Destroyed / gritty world creates great atmosphere\n\nThis game has really great potential to be a very solid $5-$7 value if things were just a little smoother and intuitive.  THe asthetics and level designs are all there.  Many people will quit this before really giving it a chance due to frustration which is a real shame.  It is fantastic for its current price of $1,  but I would gladly pay five times that amount to see the issues improved.  It doens't appear to be early access and the devolopers havn't made it cledar what work, if any, is still planned.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198059829020", "last_played": 1483078742, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 360, "playtime_forever": 193}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1483083466, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503380", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1483083466, "recommendationid": "28819691", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I think this game is very good for the price tag.
