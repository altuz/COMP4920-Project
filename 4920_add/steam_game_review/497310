Compared to most digital painting software, it has a truckload of tools.  'run as administrator' mode may be required.  All tool grouping and keyboard shortcuts are non-standard and will make sense after a while.\n\nMy 4 year old loves to use this program as of recent to paint.  My wife also enjoys using this program to paint.  It's a lot more than people think it is.  It's too bad people aren't playing with it more to see that\n\nUpdate: While the content in buffers appears to not save while in buffers, I've found that the Swap buffer will save when using the lyr save option.  The brush buffer(store brush) saves out and imports separately.\n\nUpdate: As of more recent testing, I'd say DCI 2K Native(2048 x 1080) is as large as you should go if you're planning to use the various plugins(k), like starfield.\n\nUpdate: As of most recent testing, PD Particles seems to handle A4 720ppi on my computer. (It does not handle A4 1200ppi on my computer.)  To put this into numbers, normal HD is 1280 x 720, nice HD is 1920 x 1080, yet A4 720ppi is 5953 x 8419.  [i]However, PD Particles does not handle 9921 x 14032 (A4 1200ppi) on my computer.[/i]\n\nThere are no negatives at this price.  \n\nIn what ways is Particles unequal to Howler?\n\nParticles lacks a great many filters which Howler has and the depth of many filters that are available when compared to Howler's version of those filters.  Animation Cells(animation cells inside of custom brushes are in Particles) and Video Editing are not present in Particles, but are present in Howler.  Creating mountains and clouds through generated 3d extrusion/beveling and effects in Howler using the 3d designer is not present in Particles.  3d extrusion for graphs, walls, and roughed out cities is in Howler through Puppy Ray, but is not in Particles.  It seems to me that Howler 10 has more processor available to it for functions, perhaps it is better at utilizing the GPU when it needs to or perhaps it is better at utilizing the CPU more fully when it needs to.  There are more menu options for the various buffers in Howler 10, you can simply do more with various buffers in Howler 10 than in Particles 9 because the menu options are there to select.\n\nIn what ways is Particles equal to Howler?\n\nThe brushes.  Particles has the particles, bristles, orbicles, foliage brush types, and the fx buffer brush styles, the animated custom brushes, and the detailed customization of the brushes.  Saving custom brushes as images so the transparency works in the png file format is present too.  If you focus on painting and appreciate the unique benefits that digital brushes can offer, then Particles is as good as Howler in many ways.  If you live in the highway lane of digital shortcuts, then Particles isn't a good fit for you.\n\nIn what ways is Particles unequal to natural painting?\n\nIf you're used to the brush... digital is... never perfect, but it has it's advantages that are worth experiencing.  \nHowever, if you do chinese/japanese painting with multi color loading, direction and pressure and rotation determining your gradients on the fly, use speed to create effects of hardness, and do everything in one stroke watching the watercolor lighten slightly each stroke till gone, and only loading the tip when desired to keep a thin dark for a leaf or part of a flower petal ...then there is nothing out there that does this.  Maybe someday, but for now, the emulation just doesn't exist.  The speed emulation exists on Fresh Paint by Microsoft and there are other attempts to create this... but if you do this style of painting, don't expect a digital equivalent, because there isn't one available.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053438603", "last_played": 1496103938, "num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 180, "playtime_forever": 5963}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1475546222, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518373", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1493754863, "recommendationid": "25847824", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "not the best app ive ever used. but not the worst. alot of bugs. but nothing game breaking. i really wish i could give a nutral rateing. but since there are more good parts than bad im give it an upper", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198254684894", "last_played": 1484772966, "num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 59, "playtime_forever": 6429}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1484008979, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501281", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1484008979, "recommendationid": "29152728", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "PD Particles 9 is a cheap  painting program.
