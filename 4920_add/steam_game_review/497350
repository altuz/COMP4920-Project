It's a very short game. I played it twice and took my time through both of them and in total I played only about 30 minutes. I liked the graphics even though they were nothing amazing. I always enjoy walking simulator games, because I find them relaxing. I still can't recommend this game, because it just wasn't a good game. It's just a weird little game. I would only recommend this game to achievement hunters when it's on sale.\n\n[/b] This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: [/b]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\n\nThis review is just my opinion.
