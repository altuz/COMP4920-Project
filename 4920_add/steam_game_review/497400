Get ready for your final stop.\nTo get out, we must make a lot of efforts: to look for useful items, collect all kinds of objects, repair mechanisms and solve puzzles.\nIn all such games, the main difference is usually the plot, but here the plot is not bad and makes you penetrate the story so much that you want to go through the game to the end.\nTHE NOTE! If you plan to collect achievements here, that is, notes:\n-Approach for passing through both difficulties is a mistake. Consequently, it can take more than two passes. It is recommended to pass first with a high degree of complexity, and then to a simple one. This is due to the fact that when you pass, on the contrary, in the game you can reset the achievements of the game. BUT achievement is given if you pass through the lung after a heavy one.\n-Video recordings can be considered a skip of the mini-game, because of which, as a result, do not achieve achievements for the passage \"without prompts and omissions.\"\nDue to the very low price this game is available for everyone, with whom you can get acquainted.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198054560875", "last_played": 1497293769, "num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 205, "playtime_forever": 730}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1497220097, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512071", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1497220097, "recommendationid": "32353439", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I'll start by admitting at first that I was not overly impressed with the game and I shall explain why.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was the NPC's dialogue were static cut-scenes based on hand drawn images with voiceovers and completely avoid of any animation. The next thing I noticed were the voiceover's were clearly the same person throughout with no change of pitch or any attempt to sound different from one NPC to the next. Also the game was completely devoid of any animation whatsoever through all the locations[except for some within the HOG scene itself]. (Though to be honest, these are minor gripes on my perspective and is a does not affect the gameplay whatsoever.)\n\nThen I found some issues that could effect gameplay unless you utilised the \"Hint System\" (Which I usually avoid). Some of the object's required to progress either within a HOG scene or not were displaced towards the bottom of the viewable area and almost completely obscured below the games UI and without precise hovering almost onto the UI did you realise there was an selectable item. Finally was the constant issue with attempting to leave a scene with the selectable arrow not responding and sometimes having to resort to the MAP to get around. (These issues do effect the gameplay and could effect progression for the (achievements/completionist) unless you are aware of such prior.)\n\nThe reason I recommend this game was marginal to be honest as I did actually enjoy the playthrough once I accepted the aforementioned issues.\n\nThe story was \"forgettable\", the graphics and music were just above average and the HOG scenes were mostly combine various objects than your usual single selectable item lists. The puzzles were easy to complete, varied and some were actually quite interesting and extended throughout the story/plot. Expect around 3-4 hours playthrough time on average.\n\nBased on the current price tag, including achievments and cards, I would just marginally recommend this.
