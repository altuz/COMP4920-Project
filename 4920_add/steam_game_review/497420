Even if I have successfully saved the same file multiple times before.\n\nIt has done this 3 times now. The first time I had been building a reef for almost 4 hours straight. I tried everything to recover the file but it seems to have been corrupted in the saving process.\n\nSince you have to write over the same file every time you save there is no way to save copies of a W.I.P. into any of your other 11 slots, so once it is glitched all that you have created is lost FOREVER.\n\nI was ... well ... EXTREMELY UPSET!\n\nI then calmed down and continued to try and give it a chance 2 more times and it did the SAME THING. I really like the concept of the game, but I am very offended that it has corrupted my save files multiple times and lost everything I worked to build. \n\nSadly, I don't trust this game to do what it was designed to do.\n\nI am likely not eligible for a refund according to Steam because I played the game for too long so I won't even try...\n\nUnfortunately, I have NOTHING to show for the large chunk of my time wasted and nothing to remedy the frustration that the issue has caused me..\n\nBuyer Beware!\n\nIf losing all of your progress after working hard on something with no chance of recovery doesn't bother you, then you might enjoy this game...\n\n\nI may give this game a chance again in the future if I am feeling especially masochistic.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI uploaded the corrupted save file to the Steam Workshop here...\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=972176548", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198056256586", "last_played": 1499672935, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 484, "playtime_forever": 363}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1499671564, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1500427996, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519223", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499673023, "developer_response": "Hey, I am so sorry for your troubles with the game.  Haven't had any problems like this mentioned to me that I have seen.  I will take a look into things and see if I can find the root cause, but as a note you can \"export\" any number of versions of a file as you work on it, to an external save point, and then import them back in at any time over any slot.  Hope that helps if you choose to give the game another chance.", "recommendationid": "33424483", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
