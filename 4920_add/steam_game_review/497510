It's a faithful reproduction of Crystal Quest (Crystal Raider for those who only had the shareware version) which I used to play on a black-and-white Macintosh Classic when I was a kid.

If you're REALLY lucky you might get a huge crystal and loads of points and feel like an 11-year-old again* (*last part probably exclusive to me).\n\n'Hash Monsters', 'Sandbags' and the 'Blim Thingies' - might not be their real names - will spawn from both ends to try to stop you, and stop you they will unless you use a lot of bombs to clear them out.\n\nIt gets very difficult, very quickly in a very entertaining way - you'll be yelling at the screen with a smile on your face.
