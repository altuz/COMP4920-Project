There are no options for moving in combat, it is a turn based game with no influence on positioning. If you lose, you can just refight until you win with little to no penalty. Why they used great games like FE or Langrisser to compare their product is beyond me. Guess i wasted the 1.49 it cost me for the game. Don't buy it if you're expecting it to be as good as Langrisser/ Warsong or Fire Emblem. Cheap immatation with half the challenge/mechanics rooted out. Sorry I couldnt rate your game higher, I really wanted to like it but you put it in the same catagory as two of my favorite games. I'm sure the story is good, but for the life of me I couldnt suffer through the combat.
