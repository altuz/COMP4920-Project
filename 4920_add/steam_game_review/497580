It takes a lot of the classic Artifex Mundi puzzles and techniques and uses them so sloppily that you really have to wonder if they put any thought into it at all, or just tossed them in there because, hey, that's what these games do, right?

Agent Walker is sent to destroy it after it was localized in France. However, once there, she fell in a trap...\n\nThe Spear of Destiny... it's not the first time that I've heard about it: another casual adventure game has the same object in a similar setting and I still remember that a similar artifact was one of the objectives of Lara Croft in Chronicles.\n\nAgent Walker is another twist: while the Spear is found early, Nazis managed to retrieve it as she fell into a trap. The result is the chase through a village and underground temples. However, the Spear of Destiny isn't the only thing: there is a colossus you need to finish as it's protecting the Spear and the machine that can destroy it is situated elsewhere. Some twists are also present, though I would have preferrd more interaction with enemies and more explanations on the twist.\n\nHowever, Agent Walker is pretty standard on the gameplay: hidden objects scenes to clear (relatively easy, though some items are changing appearance), puzzles (also easy), find items, combine them, use them to advance. Some of the scenes are also with silhouettes to find and to use (without forgetting the only puzzle thrown into the scene).\n\nThe graphics are good, but I would have preferred more World War II-related things: I could imagine Agent Walker captured or travelling across Europe or even more confrontation with the real enemy. The soundtrack is good too.\n\nAgent Walker: Secret Journey is an average game, not really the best in Artifex Mundi's catalogue (if they developed it, it would have been better) but not the worst, far from it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "last_played": 1473534373, "num_reviews": 352, "num_games_owned": 2214, "playtime_forever": 348}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1473767172, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523690", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1473767172, "recommendationid": "25492600", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I really like Artifex Mundi games, but this one is upseting.

Compared to the other games this one also seemed pretty short (and yet somehow drawn out) and didnt even have a little extra unlocked episode after completing the main story like most of the games have. I'm a big fan of these games but this one was a big dissapointment and frankly a waste of money even at the 40% off sale price I paid.
