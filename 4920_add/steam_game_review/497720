Instead, this is a moderately accurate simulation game which puts you in control of the rides.\n\nPros:\n- Decent graphics (in regards to how the rides and environments looked).\n- Can be quite interesting and addicting.\n- Realistic physics.\n- Works smoothly (30fps+) on many high end and low end laptops/PCs.\n\nCons:\n- There are no clear instructions or guidelines on how to control the rides (had to use 'Trial & Error' to figure out how everything worked).\n- Badly optimized controls for laptops/PCs (this is an Android/iOS port).\n- Badly rendered people and terrible AI (in regards to how the people are animated and how they move).\n- Too much DLC which is very overpriced (there are ONLY THREE RIDES to operate when you buy the base game; the DLC adds more rides but is very expensive for what you actually get).\n- Can get boring over long periods of time.\n\nOther notes: I recommend getting this if you really enjoy simulation games. Otherwise, I would stay away. The game does take some getting used to, as there are no instructons at all to show you what to do.\n\nRECOMMENDED :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198274017845", "last_played": 1504385497, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_forever": 157}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1498253363, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498253363, "recommendationid": "32698844", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
