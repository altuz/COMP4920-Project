Here's why:\n\n- Simple, clever and fun mechanisms, introduced gradually\n- You can tell a lot of thought and effort went into the design of each level\n- Levels never feel too big or overwhelming, while being very challenging at times\n- Levels never feel repetitive\n- The game mechanisms are fully exploited, making you really learn its world and rules\n- It has secrets\n- Nice, challenging ending\n- Nice, relaxing music\n- Adequate graphics (2D with a mixture of 3D in some places, and some cute animations), though graphics are not the main goal of the game\n- Comes with an extra set of levels that introduce a new concept\n- You can create (and find) custom levels, which means that if you really liked it you can continue playing it even after you finish the main story\n\nI had so much fun playing this game! I consider it at the level of other puzzle games like Braid, Snakebird, Portal, Antichamber, The Talos Principle and The Witness. I know these other games might have better graphics, but in this kind of games what I look for is a well thought, fun and challenging puzzle game (though I can tell graphics and music in Recursed have soul and love put in them). So if you liked any or all of the above games then this game might be for you.\n\nThe fact that there are no negative reviews of this game up to this point is also a very good sign.\n\nOh, and if you like recursion, you'll like it even more.\n\nThis review continues here: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071809634/recommended/497780", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "steamid": "76561198071809634", "last_played": 1506990966, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_forever": 1256}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1501863593, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505327", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501863825, "recommendationid": "34019150", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A mind-boggling brain workout.  From the trailer I thought it would be simply messing with the chest rooms like a straightforward puzzle game, but the mechanics are far more complex.\n\nThe chest rooms are all temporary.  You can take items out and then when you go back in the state of the room will reset.  When you're going into a chest that's in another chest (layering instances) the rooms previous to the one you're in will keep their items.  You can move chests around, take them out of the rooms they're in, put them into new rooms to create different paths through the room layouts... duplicate chests... put chests inside of the rooms they lead to...  The game quickly makes it clear that the chest-room structure does not work at all in any real world sense.  The chests are not like doors.  The rooms are not quite \"rooms\" either.\n\nOtherwise it follows the standard theme of puzzle games where additional mechanics are introduced gradually so you learn at a steady pace.  Eventually you'll have to learn to cause paradoxes!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197967608196", "last_played": 1500772358, "num_reviews": 82, "num_games_owned": 434, "playtime_forever": 1049}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500418513, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500418513, "recommendationid": "33639927", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Recursed is a game about what Recursed is a game about.\n\nAhem, sorry, I'm thinking of INF (Ludum Dare 37 entry). Lemme try again.\n\nRecursed is a puzzle-platformer. The goal of the game is to get to the goal (a giant floating purple crystal) by solving puzzles. As in a standard platformer, you can move around and jump (three blocks high, in fact). But if you're holding an item, you can only jump two blocks high (you can however throw items horizontally). Already this is a pretty novel mechanic I've not seen in any other game; there *might* be a game I've played where you merely can't jump when you're holding an item, but that's just not the same. Point is, Recursed does some neat stuff with this mechanic, as it's the focus of a fair few puzzles in the game.\n\nBut of course, that's not actually what Recursed is about. No, Recursed is a game about what Recursed is a game about.\n\nAhem, sorry, I'm thinking of INF (Ludum Dare 37 entry). Lemme try again.\n\nThere are three types of item you can pick up: keys, which open doors; blocks, which you can stand on; and chests, which are rooms which you can bring items into and pick them out of. The first two are standard puzzle fare, but it is the third that's where the game is.\n\n\"But,\" I hear you cry, \"Isn't that just the same as rooms being linked to one another? I can't [i]possibly[/i] see how that would give deep gameplay!\"\n\nAnd here lie two subtleties. The first one is that since chests are items, you can also pick up chests and bring them into other chests. This changes which rooms are connected.\n\nBut that still doesn't get at what Recursed is about. No, Recursed is a game about what Recursed is a game about.\n\nAhem, sorry, I'm thinking of INF (Ludum Dare 37 entry). Lemme try again.\n\nThe second subtlety is this: Entering a chest does not actually move you to another room; it instead creates an *instance* of a room, which is destroyed when you leave the room. So what's the difference? When you re-enter the room, it re-creates the *original* instance of the room. So, for example, you can take an item out of the room, then enter it again and find that the item's respawned. And it is *this* subtlety that creates the puzzles in the game.\n\nUsing this, you can, for instance, pull chest A out of chest B, then put chest B in chest A. Then pull another copy of chest A out of chest B, and put it back into chest B, into a third copy of chest A. Be careful, of course, because if you leave the first copy of chest A now, chest B will vanish into the aether, and cannot be gotten back (which probably means you've borked the puzzle).\n\nThis unique sort of action in a game could only ever be dreamt up by a madman. Truly, Recursed is a game about what Recursed is a game about. And yes, this time I [i]am[/i] thinking of Recursed, not INF (Ludum Dare 37 entry).\n\nUnfortunately, at some points, you have to think like a madman to solve the puzzles. That's not to say the puzzles are *unfair*; rather that they require such a weird modus of thinking that I've yet to wrap my head around the game. Contrast this with Stephen's Sausage Roll, the Best Puzzle Game Ever\u2122, where the levels themselves usually tend to guide you towards what to do; the levels here are either doing so in a really arcane manner, or not at all. That's not always a bad thing, though, but it does mean that you'll have to experiment a lot more than most (and often don't really get as much feedback when you've done something right or wrong).\n\nComplementing the game quite nicely is a rather catchy soundtrack (unfortunately not a fractal one, but either way it's been stuck in my head the past few days), and some nice humour (\"This green stuff smells terrible! I hope it's not poisonous. *deep sniff*\").\n\nDespite its lack of level signposting, Recursed is a game about what Recursed is a game about. It is unique in terms of mechanics and brings a lot to the table in terms of that. [strike]While it's not as good as Stephen's Sausage Roll (because it's still the best puzzle game ever by a long shot)[/strike] (SEE EDIT), I still recommend it highly, with the caveat that you'll need some patience to get through it.\n\nAlso, screw Rolling Shapes and Soko Match (formerly known as Flow Match). Those two games can chuck themselves into a chest which I'll happily remove from existence for them, because they're that bad and I've mentioned in my previous reviews that I would slag them off from time to time.\n\nEDIT 17/09/2017: Having finished the game now, I can definitively say that it's somehow [b]BETTER[/b] than Stephen's Sausage Roll! If you are a fan of puzzle games, you DEFINITELY do not want to miss this. The main mechanic is just so rich and the secondary introduced mechanics complement it so damn nicely. And unlike SSR, chances are that this game is of complexity class Undecideable, not just in PSPACE!\n\nAlso it has a level editor, so there's that too. And the free in-game expansion is pretty sweet too.
