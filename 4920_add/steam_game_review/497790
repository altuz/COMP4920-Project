[/u]\n\n[h1]Ayumi: Enhanced Edition[/h1]\n\nIs a Survival-Horror game developed with RPG Maker, building up a pure Sci-fi background. I'm not eager of these games usually, but sometimes one of these catch my eyes, Ayumi is a good one. Firstly because it's not a RPG and secondly it gets some influences from H.P Lovecraft universe.\n\nSo, what's about it? You're Ayumi, a young girl who actually lives into a big spaceship with the goal of mining materials on planets around (I still don't know where exactly we are). At the begining, everything seems ok, you can talk with a lot of people then you'll learn about some backstory on characters. Ayumi is cute and has the typical behavior of a young girl.\n\nFinally night comes (A way to speak as we're in space), bringing litteraly the darkness with it... creepy atmosphere and sounds are surrounding you and you'll try to escape that evil... And find what's going on there... If you're gonna make it... alive!\n\nAyumi isn't a big game, now that is said, i still have good feelings on it. The story is entairtening, the game isn't too spooky but still has its scary moments like the times being in the dark, with only the flashlight, surrounding by things... The graphics are quite poor but i'm still hanged by the art choice and it feels ok for me (As a retro gamer). Sounds are correct.\n\nStill a cheap game though it worth the money for me. I'm going to finish it now. I hope it has help to give you a \"little\" idea of that game.\n\nThank you for reading :)\n\nP.S: Many secrets and references there... Want to know one?

I'll edit it in future if I ever feel like trying out 'nightmare' for the different ending.\n\nI really wish Steam allowed us to rate more flexibly than simple positive/negative. For the moment I'm going to go with my gut instinct and say that no, I wouldn't suggest the full price for this game. I give it roughly a 4/10 for now. \n\n'Ayumi' isn't a [i]bad[/i] game. In fact, there's a lot of potential which I am hoping is tapped in the 'nightmare' difficulty. However, I don't particularly feel drawn to dive right back in to find out. \n\nWhile it is certainly creepy wandering around the blood-splattered spaceship, catching twisted hints to Lovecraftian themes, I can't say that a 'normal' playthrough provides you with enough meat as I would have hoped. I've read/viewed some Lovecraft but not much of Hastur. This perhaps stifled my enjoyment. \n\nUnless you are completely dense, you'll almost immediately work out that [spoiler]Ayumi's parents are dead and she must have been deeply affected by it[/spoiler]. You do have a sense of pity for the little scamp. \n\nThe story did appear to be going somewhere dark and intriguing. You simply wind up walking into a [spoiler]\"fluffy kittens here's big bro and it was all a nightmare!\"[/spoiler] ending far too easily in the 'normal' mode. I even went back the first time to try to make sure I cleared an area. Still not much more to add to the story. \n\nIt's possible I missed something because although I tried to be thorough, there are portions of the spaceship which are frustratingly labyrinthine. If I could have bought a map from the small stores you find throughout, I feel this would have gone a long way to easing my frustration. \n\n[b][Conclusion][/b] \n\nI think that if you buy this, perhaps skip to 'nightmare' mode? I'm not sure you'd actually miss much from the 'normal' setting and you'd probably find a satisfying conclusion. There are plenty of free RPGMaker games out there with quite a bit of content (go look up the sites) so it's hard for me to justify one with what feels like a demo as it's 'normal' playthrough. \n\nThis has promise. Maybe I'd find it in the other mode.

I purchased this in January shortly after the 2.55 update, and was pleasantly surprised at how well this title is put together.  The game makes heavy use of pre-made assets, but it does so in a way that builds an atmosphere of horror and suspence.  The scares are spaced out in such a way that the game builds up a sense of dread, and then does something shocking, which made me jump more than a couple of times.  As far as content, there's a lot of game here.  You can finish this title in about an hour or so, but there's so many little things to find, as well as alternate endings.  The game's story is interesting, and is sprinkled with bits of Lovecraftian mythos, which really helps to set the stage.  This product is well worth the asking price, and the creator Lord Rutsah has put a lot of love into this title, and it shows.\n\nTL;DR: Crazy space Cthulhu horror game with Yellow Mythos, and lots of scares!
