Having played and beaten Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup and NetHack multiple times, I can recommend this game to anyone who wants a streamlined and fast roguelike experience (plays faster and features much less tedium than other roguelikes) that goes beyond the offerings of a standard roguelike. The game, albeit shorter than other roguelikes, features very fleshed out mechanics regarding the different forms your character can take (human, vampire, and werewolf if you play its respective role). Each form plays differently and is required to be used to win the game (there are parts of the game where being a vampire is the best choice and where being a human is the best choice), resulting in an interesting, varied, and fun gameplay experience. If you are considering buying the game, do so: it is a coffee-break roguelike and you will be able to tell whether or not you like it before the 2 hour refund period is over.\n\nTo me, a game review on Steam honestly isn't complete until you mention the game developer and their practices as this is a major factor of how a game will perform in the future. Fortunately, I only have good things to say, further cementing the positive review that I feel so obligated to leave. A mere 4 days ago, I reported 2 bugs (key rebinding causing the game to refuse to load and diagonal ice sliding not functioning properly) via email and I find that this morning's patch not only featured fixes to my bugs, but a new difficulty, new music, and more. To conclude this review, I can leave one guarantee. You won't be disappointed by this game or its developer.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1090, "steamid": "76561198079217776", "last_played": 1506995729, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 185, "playtime_forever": 1174}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506313141, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505314", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506313141, "recommendationid": "35196102", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
