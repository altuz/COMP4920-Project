My talent at drawing sucked, but that added to the fun. Will definitely play this and stream it again. The only downside to the game is the amount of options. I found that quite often I would be stuck with 3 words options I have had before especially in the country section. I think more modes would do well for the game so it can be streamed for longer periods of time. Currently after playing each mode once all the available options were used. The food mode seemed to have the most options, but even that ran into occasions with multiple repeat words. Other than that which I would easily assume is just a new release issue (with more words and content to come) the game is beyond great for any streamer.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198135958587", "last_played": 1471033754, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 113, "playtime_forever": 175}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1470948855, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497993", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1470948855, "recommendationid": "24832315", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
