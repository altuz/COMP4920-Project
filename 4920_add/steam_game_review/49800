You have to man the guns, fend off the pirates, and carry out repairs as needed. In between missions you can change your ship's loadout. You can earn better guns based on how well you did on the previous mission. \n\nYou can sometimes choose which mission to take (some missions are identified as being more difficult than others), but overall the game is short. I beat every mission in about three hours. \n\nAlso, the game does not have a definite ending, it just thrusts you into a Survival mode at the end of the campaign where you try and live as long as possible against the pirates. I like my games to have a definite ending, so that was pretty disappointing.\n\nI ran the game on Windows 7 64 bit and encountered no bugs. Graphics were probably good when the game first came out but by 2017's standards they're just passable. The music track was short but synced well with the idea of fighting across a post-apocalyptic wasteland. \n\nThis is not the best game ever, but it regularly goes on sale for 50 cents, and that's not bad for 3 hours worth of entertainment."}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1496768587, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485011", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "32223625", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971778807", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 99}, "timestamp_updated": 1496768587, "received_for_free": false, "review": "crap"}, {"votes_down": 10, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1492954542, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484431", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31320112", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993699474", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 113}, "timestamp_updated": 1492954542, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Dont know why anyone even supported the MMO they made after they did such a bad job on this one.
