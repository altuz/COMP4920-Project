I don't like how pushing up on the d-pad/analog stick makes you go diagonally northeast/west. I think making it so that you can press the d-pad/analog stick in that diagonal direction would make a lot more sense, and contribute to smoother controls. \n\nAs of right now, I seem to be constantly fighting the controls in order to move in the direction that I want to go. They're not very intuitive at all.\n\nEdit: They tweaked the controls so that on controller, you have diagonal movement, and on keyboard/mouse you can click where you want to move and look where the mouse is. Great fixes so far and I'm very happy with how fast these updates have been rolling out!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040622293", "last_played": 1477067656, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 167, "playtime_forever": 40}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1475869599, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503512", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1477068871, "recommendationid": "25910490", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "What a nice little game this is, i bought it for the art style and the graphics and end loving the game mechanics and challenge of the levels. \nThis game is a mix between action and puzzle, where you complete levels and challenges and get power unlocks in return.\nThe enemy variety is good, the levels are well tought and the challenge is good.\nAnother thing to notice is that the game feels finished. \nVery good game more than worth the asking price.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002789672", "last_played": 1477441459, "num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 7094, "playtime_forever": 232}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1475873736, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498339", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1475873736, "recommendationid": "25911720", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
