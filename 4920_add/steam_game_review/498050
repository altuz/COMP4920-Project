I know what happened.  \nIs that happening to everyone who is playing?  \nOr, are players thinking the game's over at that point, and not playing more?  I thought it was over until I realized I hadn't used inventory yet.  \"Continue\" just repeated the ending, so I used the back button to continue playing.  \nIf that hadn't happened, I was having a lot of fun. I am not big on point and click adventure games, most of them make me sick with movement, but this one was not like that.  I like having to take notes, no hints, etc.  \nSo, I recommend the game if the events play in the right order, but I don't recommend it because the end was ruined for me, and it may be ruined for you. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067096600", "last_played": 1469990779, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1469989695, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526893", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1469989695, "recommendationid": "24638712", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Neat little game.

Originally this was selling for 5.00 and is now discounted to 2.00 until Nov 28th.  It should really be selling for .99 cents.  The entire game was completed (all puzzles, everything) in as little as 39 minutes.  In a previous discussion question this was posted directly from the developer  in response about the game - \"It is possible to finish the game without solving all of the puzzles. Some players take 2 hours to finish the game. Some 4 or 6 hours. Some less.\"  I feel this is very deceptive as this game is very short and quick frankly dishonest.  It is not worth a 5.00 or even 2.00 price point because the length is so short.  This is the type of casual game you'd find on your tablet or phone selling for .99 cents.  If the game were much longer I could see it selling for more.  There's some good stuff here.  The dev did a good job.
