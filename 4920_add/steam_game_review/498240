Telltale games are so great because the fact that the choices you make can change the story line. The story is about the life as Bruce Wayne and as Batman in Gotham City. It has a lot of good content that you should try! If you love telltale games and batman i don't see any reason not to buy it! All the episodes are great as well! I finished it once and i would like to finish it  twice because it will never get bored! If you also like this type of game you should get this one! It's so well-structured and with a story that makes sense during all the game! I totally recommend you this game! I can't say anymore about this game, it's just perfect. I promise you it will be a good purchase! I beated this game in 8 hours without stopping and i can relate that it was awesome! I  haven't played Batman: The Enemy Within but i watched a little bit of gameplays and it's just perfect as this one! This franchise got only two games but it's better than some others! These  are great as well! Just buy it! And if you can, try to get this game on sales! You can get more information about the story on Wikipedia! Hope i helped you and good luck, gamer! *This review doesn't talk so much about the story it's just me recommending and telling you my experinece with it*", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198100152205", "last_played": 1483228402, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 118, "playtime_forever": 498}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505012055, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505013267, "recommendationid": "34851794", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game is running but nothing shows up!\nThough the game itself is good.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 299, "steamid": "76561198072508113", "last_played": 1506264492, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 101, "playtime_forever": 631}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505140445, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504384", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505140445, "recommendationid": "34883893", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Another solid Telltale game.

It is a Batman game, but it isn't set in any well-known Batman universe (Nolan-verse, Arkham-verse, DC comics, DC movies, etc...). Simply put this Batman game set in an alternate universe (similar to the Elseworld series) \n\nThe game is mainly based on quick time events which i think doesn't suit well to a Batman game, especially after seeing possibly the best Batman series so far, the Arkham series. Besides, the plot changes a VERY CRITICAL part of Batman's backstory which doesn't go well with the classical motivation of Bruce Wayne/Batman. I think this change didn't work at all and made Batman much, much less than who he is in more classical incarnations. Also, the plotline is extremely convoluted. The game tries to put as many Batman characters to a single game most of them lack depth. The game is much more about Bruce Wayne than Batman, which might have been an interesting idea but I believe the personification of Bruce Wayne is not done quite good so this focus on Bruce Wayne doesn't seem to work in the context of this game.\n\nAlso, technically there are many choices you, as the player, can take. However, 99% of these choices do not affect the main storyline at all instead only affect very simple things which makes this \"Story tailors itself based on your choices\" focus of the game completely moot. Action sequences are extremely simple. So, the game is not challenging at all (which maybe a good thing depending on you preferences.)\n\nPros:\n- Polished game with very good voice acting.\n- If you like interactive movies, then it is an enjoyable game.\n\nCons:\n- The game is basically an interactive movie instead of an actual game. Most choices you take have little to no effect on the actual story. You can practically choose whatever you want in any dialog option and beside simple things the outcome of the game will always be the same.\n- Depiction of Batman here is a huge let down. Batman is generally not in control in many situation and doesn't have the iconic grimness and stoicness of the character. \n- The story is very convoluted and the change in the back story of Batman doesn't work at all.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972710279", "last_played": 1504459872, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 394, "playtime_forever": 812}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504703453, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497830", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504703453, "recommendationid": "34775249", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game is Great but im in the middle of episode 2 and all the sudden it just stops working. i try to open it but it dosnt work.
