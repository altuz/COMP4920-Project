If you just play you will get overwhelmed will walls of text, wave after wave of them, with the chance to make a choice usually about three times per chapter or so. The U.S. civil war setting is not one I have a peculiar fondness for. The writing seemed to be respectful of the time period but at the same time it lacked a certain authenticity and it feels fairly obvious that the rendition of the author suffers from neocentric influences. I managed to reach the end without running into any scripting issues or design problems like game overs. The experience was bland and felt drawn out with too little interactivity. The romance and military developments of the protag as well as his relationship to his family were all secondary concerns to me as I found little reason to care for the protag to begin with. Interface was just black text on white background and simple buttons. Even though reading this is dry and boring, the actual playtime can be quite fast if you read in diagonal.
