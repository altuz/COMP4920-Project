I cannot recommend it in its current state.\n\n1. The movement and combat are both extremely awkward and not fluid. There were many times when I would struggle with simple tasks like opening and closing doors because it was implemented so poorly.\n2. The lighting system is actually really annoying the way it is constantly shadowing things in an unrealistic way when you move around. \n3. There were attempts by the devs at making classes, but you can just pick all of them and have every ability which makes it overpowered and boring. I was able to beat multiple bosses with no gear upgrades at all because the abilities are overpowered and allow infinite kiting. This also discouraged me from wanting better gear because it was not needed.\n4. There is no multiplayer in the current build, although devs say it is being worked on. \n5. The building system is not impressive, it is the same as every other game - build a house, build a workbench, build other utilities which then build more boring sets of armor and weapons that you don't even need to progress in the game.\n6. Quests and game progress are also just plain weird. After you beat the first wave of quests, you are told to dig through a mountain that takes a while just to dig through. There seems to be no real reason to be digging through said mountain other than to waste your time. Sure you can collect some ore and kill some NPCs while you do it, but overall it feels like a task designed to waste time and is very unrewarding, much like the rest of the game.\n7. The NPCs are completely cookie cutter RPG characters and the storyline is non existent, you just wake up in a mystery land and don't know where you are and are told to go start killing things, building things, and doing quests for said cookie cutter NPCs.\n\nIt feels like a mashup of diablo and minecraft, but fails pretty badly by having an awkward movement, lighting, and combat system.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198045477362", "last_played": 1503254916, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 325, "playtime_forever": 557}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1503254690, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510584", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1503255018, "recommendationid": "34379875", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you're expecting this to be something that rivals some of those other craft and build games like 'Minecraft' or 'Terraria', it isn't.

That said like many reviews that start with \"This game has potential\" the game needs ALOT of work.\nI recognize it is in alpha but I have played this game several times over the past few months and not much has changed yet. \n It is not very intuitive. There are multiple funtions that do not quite feel right when being used. For example if you get within one tile of a wall the screen gets really dark. This does not make alot of sense in many situations and internal lighting on buildings is something much more suited to cavernous dungeon crawling. The game needs distinction. The in game terrain also does not become transparent when you walk behind it. This causes you to be unable to see enemies or even items around you. \n\nSpeaking of items you cannot pickup things individually. You just hit a button and everything in the vicinity sort of floats towards you. This is frustrating when you do not want all the random stuff around. Combat is also not very smooth the attacking and facing system is once again just not quite polished enough to be fun or functional.\n\nAll in all the game is alright and I feel like it would be very fun if it fixed alot of its rough edges.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038063063", "last_played": 1500335990, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 269, "playtime_forever": 62}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500336341, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500336341, "recommendationid": "33619037", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Clunky controls.
