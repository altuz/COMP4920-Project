I only tested the shooting mechanics in practice mode by the way.\n\n[b]The shooting mechanic as of now is unplayable[/b]. You start a normal shooting motion (not chest, underhand etc) and the game seems to be trying to detect when you bend your wrist, but does it with a huge delay, resulting - in my case at least - in the ball being thrown violently downwards (for reference, like angrily throwing a beer bottle on the floor).\n\nIMHO the dev should either try holding the ball with a button and then letting the player release said button to release the ball (the easy / quick method), or let the ball go whenever the rate of acceleration starts decreasing. Better yet, offer both. The direction/line of hand movement before the release should ofcourse determine the direction and power the ball is being thrown with, but the followthrough movement (i.e. right after the point of max acceleration) should be used for finetuning the direction and power of a shot.\n\nThere are lots of other improvements and fixes that are necessary (like proper oculus support - my right shooting hand had a thumb on its right side), but the mechanics are where the work should go, so i'll leave it at that. Before purchasing, i'd suggest to potential buyers to look if a relevant update has been released after my review.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198081159072", "last_played": 1496556545, "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 265, "playtime_forever": 31}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1496556569, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496556569, "recommendationid": "32168932", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
