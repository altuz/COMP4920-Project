With you running around the house while you must keep the clock wound up it does create tension. The only problem is that I don't know how each toy works and It does get kinda confusing going from one room to the other even with the map.

Link is at the bottom of this review. For those of you who don't want to watch it, here is my opinion on the game. It is a fun game, the idea of having to go around the house and finding/interacting with the objects in the house or something will happen is a fun idea especially when you have to find out what to do with the stuff in the house. I can feel a little annoying sometimes when you don't know what to do but overall the end result is still entertaining. One of my issues with the game is that the jumpscares are anything but scary. The first one actually made me jump, anything after that is nothing but an anticlimactic way of the game telling you that it is game over. I think that the game is worth it, but I can totally understand if someone else didn't feel the same, so I recommend you look into the game a little more before purchasing it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hNy4rRlOMY", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198289256719", "last_played": 1480179419, "num_reviews": 32, "num_games_owned": 71, "playtime_forever": 398}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1470678704, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462711", "votes_down": 28, "timestamp_updated": 1470756503, "recommendationid": "24780703", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": true}]}
