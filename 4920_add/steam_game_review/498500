Amazing!\nFirst, I extremely attracted by the style of art of the game.\nI really love the pixel style. The number of pixels to form an character in this game is ... suitable. It won't make me fell it is too large or small. Just perfect for me.\nThe background is quite special. It is tilted. I can clearly feel that I am moving. I have never seen this before. However, I won't feel dizzy while I'm playing this game.\nHow should I talk about the combo? It won't too limited. You can explore your own combo or simply follow the instruction. I like it very much.\nThere is still some funny stuff. The name of the shop on the street. The attack of enemies. The dialog.There are many interesting things in this game.\nSo, what is my rating? 8.5/10.\nhighly recommend.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "steamid": "76561198125113321", "last_played": 1505998920, "num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 1225, "playtime_forever": 789}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505831464, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505831464, "recommendationid": "35065515", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very short, but pretty sweet! You'll only get around 2 to 3 hours out of the story, but there are other game modes available to add a tiny bit of variety. I got it on sale.
