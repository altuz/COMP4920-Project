You can recruit up to a party of 5 (building a party completely of your choosing), using gold acquired from killing monsters in a 15 floor dungeon.\nBelow is a brief game review, and the pros and cons of why it may, or may not appeal to you.\n\nStory: \nThere isn\u2019t one, typical dungeon crawler.\nHere are the keys to my dungeon, level up, kill monsters, save the day.\n\nGraphics:\nMinimal. Copy and paste images with no imagination, the graphics closely resemble the story. \nThe scenery and backgrounds are not interesting, no atmosphere, and nothing to get excited about here.\n\nSound: I didn\u2019t have any problem with the sound, or music. No doubt it will get repetitive and grind on you after a while, but you can say the same for any game with minimal variation of tunes.\n\nGameplay: It does the job, half the job. It has almost everything I would want from building a party. If you enjoy the grind, party building and the occasional challenging encounter then this would have been so close to what you were looking for. But the game constantly stutters on the random encounter screens and takes too long to load for just the reshuffle of the same screens.\n\nLongevity: It\u2019s hard to say a life span isn\u2019t there. \nThere are plenty of class combinations to try out, a lot of different gear and socketing combos to try, and of course each dungeon room changes every time you enter / re-enter it. But will you still be playing this after 20 hours of gameplay, probably not. I\u2019d be surprised if many players amounted to over 10 hours of play.\n\nPros\n- Create your own party. \n- Can change class of any character to fit circumstance at no cost.\n- Socketing, adding reusable gems to gear is great\n- Lots of equipment, common, epic and even legendary, spot on here.  \n- 12 different classes, lots of combo's to play with\n- The dungeon is constantly changing, not the layout but with different traps or treasures or merchants will appear or disappear, every time you enter/ leave a room.\n- Simple to navigate, I found the party / equipment screens very easy to use.\n- Bulletin board is a nice touch, quests for rewards.\n- Honest game tittle\n- Classes familiar to the genre\n- If you can persevere, the battles become really fun, much later in the game\n\nCons\n- Loading between screens, that inevitably just all look the same only reshuffled, takes the flow out of the game, and is something that should be seamless. As it stands, you spend more time waiting between screens loading than you do on the dungeon screens themselves.\n- It\u2019s a dungeon crawler, so you spend a lot of time in a dungeon with random encounters. Sadly this is ruined by constantly skipping, which again takes any real flow out of the game and frustratingly hinders progression.\n- Plenty of glitches and bugs. \n- Repetitive battles for the first 1/8 floors.\n- May have benefitted from a talent system for your party members, just something to feel like you have some kind of input into their growth as they level.\n- The dungeon levels changing every time you change screen, some may consider it to be a pro, but not for me. Enter/exit room, until treasure shows, not a productive use of time. For me, open a treasure once, then the box should be empty, unless you reset the instance or something or exit the dungeon entirely perhaps. (This particular con would be a matter of opinion, I feel)\n- The sprites don\u2019t move, the copied images just float about, bobbing up and down.\n- No map / no minimap \n- Bulletin board, quest objections often don\u2019t work first time\n- Very few boss battles.\n\n\nSummery \n\nYou can\u2019t help but feel slightly wronged or ripped off by this game. On paper it truly ticks a lot of boxes, 12 classes, plenty of gear and gem customisation, managing your gold to fill that last party slot and a changing dungeon. But a little extra care would have gone a long, long way.\n\nOne little patch to make the player feel like they can play through the dungeon without the game constantly stuttering, would make the world of difference. As it stands, I can\u2019t recommend this game, sorry. There is so much potential here, but it\u2019s completely squandered by things that could be so easily remedied. If they update it quickly, fix a few simple things then it has the potential to become an enjoyable game, and maybe a recommendation.\n\nMy final verdict is that here is another game added to the steam vault that lacks soul and any credibility or creativity, and once again seems completely rushed at the prospect of a quick sell. It\u2019s quite simply not worth you're time.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a new dungeon crawler, look away, look far away, for now. If they update the game I will be sure to update my review, and if it runs seemlessly then it could change my opinion.\nCurrenlty it seems that half a job was done, and perhaps they never tested the game. I cant recommened something that at present feels rushed over the finish line, tarnishing the end product and making it unworthy of being sellable goods.

I think this game might have got a bad rep because people didn't know it was rpgmaker.\n\nIt's a nicely done dungeon crawler in my opinion so far. I haven't encountered stuttering anywhere near what other people have..i play on fullscreen with autodash off on an old rig. Game runs fairly smootly, grind and loot is decent.\n\nI'd say pick it up since it is on sale atm. At full price it is asking a bit much for rpgmaker game but I'm quite enjoying it.\n\nScratching the dungeon grind itch that many games have failed to do. Game provides a challenge if you try to progress too early.\n\n12 classes to choose from, you pick your first start off with rnough money to recruit one more As you progress (at your time of choosing), you can recruit more for an increasingly steep price up to a maximum of 5 in the party total. I like the freedom in this. There are front row/back row mechanics to keep squishy classes form dying too easily and the skills seem decent and balanced so far. \n\nEdit: Only real gripe is multiclassing. It seems heavily encouraged as the game will keep track of how many levels each character has in any class and it can be changed at any time however...\nThere is only one sprite per class (some classes are males and others are females) so your level 10 fighter \"Dave\" that multiclasses into an archer is suddenly a woman. \nI currently have 4 in my party now and I have no desire to multiclass with this system. If I do another playthrough I will try other classes then. At level 11 my fighter has several active abilities he can use, and i feel no need to \"add\" to him. \nCurrent verdict on this: Game would have been better without multiclassing imo.\n\nI got this game for just over $2.
