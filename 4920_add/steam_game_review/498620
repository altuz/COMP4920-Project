Everything that can kill you is quick and thereby you have to be quick to avoid them and it's trial and error. But if you have to die a lot, why is there a death counter? It's bad enough knowing you keep dying but seeing the number feels like it's shaming you for your incompetence. It really irks me and just makes me want to quit tbh.\n\nThere's no story or element of world building at all in the game. Your character is a cute little grim reaper type being but for some reason, when you die you explode in an ungodly cloud of blood. It's just an odd choice. I want more of a narrative with my games, whether they are simple or not.\n\nI don't have any issues with the graphics overall. The controls are simple. It's a fine game and I probably would complete it if it weren't so frustrating how often you die and have a death counter to remind you of that fact. For the price, it wasn't a major loss or anything.

The gameplay is I wouldn't say hard, but it seems the controls are a bit sluggish. The ugly part of this game is that the only options for the game are at the start. Changing from windowed to full screen, animation quality and resolution. They're no options at all for anything else like insanely loud music, so headphone users beware.
