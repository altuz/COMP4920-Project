I've played for.. A couple hours now apparently. The game is poor in my opinion, sadly as I wanted to give it a fair go. The puzzles are obscure, with no real hints as to where you are supposed to look for information, I solved the second one completely on accident, the third I literally started spam clicking after wasting half of my battery, and the fourth one took most of an hour wandering around to get. \nThe puzzles require somewhat random trivia know,  and only for the first do you get any aid as to the solution. \nLanguage wise, it is clear that the developer doesn't speak English primarily, but also clear that they didn't have the help of an English speaker to translate, but instead seemed to rely on dictionary translations. \nThe enemy I encountered in my time playing was also very poor. There is a somewhat jarring cut scene, which leads to you being attacked by a random guy for no discernable reason. However, it is -very- easy to hang the AI up on pathing issues, and I eventually got fed up with trying to solve the puzzle with him chasing me so I stuck him on the swings in the playground and left him to rot. \nThe game has promise, but it definitely needs help and polish.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041760018", "last_played": 1477803538, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 303, "playtime_forever": 178}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1476845945, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514835", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1476846215, "recommendationid": "26109762", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Updated\nOkay i just finished the game in 30 minutes.

I am downvoting the game mainly due to the lack of instructions and the fact it is only in a foreign language. Game is probably worth one dollar.
