When you can easily just run past most enemies and combat encounters, instead opting to just dodge out of the way of huge enemy swarms only for them to hit and attack one another (ala old Doom, i.e. when an enemy's attack hits another enemy on accident, they fight each other until one of them is dead)  while you breeze by toward the next computer to unlock a door or the exit itself, it makes the game feel rather pointless. The music and pixel art isn't bad by any means, and there are a variety of enemies you encounter, but the base gameplay feels pretty bland with very inaccurate and unamusing guns and sword swings at your disposal. You're also given a dodge roll, but you're almost better off just trying to utilize the regular run and go around the enemy's attack range since using the dodge causes your character to temporarily stop. Reloading your guns also causes your character to stop dead in his tracks, allowing enemies to close the distance.\n\nWhile this makes for some tension, most all of it is robbed when you realize you're better off just running around the enemies and avoiding the combat altogether. If the combat had some kind of reward system beyond the enemies dropping health or ammo (neither of which you will be expending much of if you just run around them..) such as a monetary or credit system to buy upgrades with then maybe the gameplay would be more complex or rewarding. \n\nAs-is it's a pretty average game with the benefit of an 8-bit aesthetic if you're into that retro / genre look, which I am hence being interested in this game from the start, but for me the gameplay is pretty lame and lacks much incentive to bother with.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "last_played": 1500105566, "num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 799, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500105989, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500106113, "recommendationid": "33553962", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
