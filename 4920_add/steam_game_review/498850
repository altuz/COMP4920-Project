It is symmetric, turn based, non-random, relatively complex, and as far as I can tell, it lends itself to quite a few different play styles.  My favorite part is the intricate dance between expending energy on conquest versus reserving it for defense, and the orgy of destruction that ensues once one of the players decides it is time to attack.  \n\nThe only problem with the game is that there are not enough players on-line, and the matchmaking interface is basic.  The AI is barely adequate, but does its job in helping you learn the rules and some basic strategies.  \n\nIt has been a long time since I have been so eager to play a game while having trouble finding any opposition. \n\nSo, buy the game, learn to play, and come play on-line!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001563465", "last_played": 1483945236, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 117, "playtime_forever": 701}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1475295126, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482611", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1475295126, "recommendationid": "25793042", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Played it for a couple of hours, still doing the campaign missions.

The master version is really interesting, as even an apparently already-won match can be in fact re-balanced in 1/2 turns.\nGraphics is not super fancy but quite cool, and does a good job of not distracting the players. Music is very good.\nThe campaign teaches you pretty well how to play.\nThe current biggest problem is that it lacks both players playing online and a challenging AI to play against.
