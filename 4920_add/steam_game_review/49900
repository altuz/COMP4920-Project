And it was a blast.\n\nIt takes a while to get behind this silly looking little thing and to understand the (3 times changes) mechanics. It looks sooooo simple but theres a lot more to it then just running around and hitting each other with a sword before comitting suicide in an esplosion to get the points. Its really fast, you need to get the timings right, know your movements to get rid of lock-ons, know how to repel, use the perks wisely ... Its really easy to just play but hard to master.\n\nIt had one of the most friendly comunity i\u00b4ve ever met in an online game with almonst no toxic players like we used to have today. A lot of the guys in my friendlist i\u00b4ve met through this game.\n\nBut ... it died after one and a half year. Then the master server died so nobody could login anyway ...\nSo now the masterserver is back, but no servers to find wich is really really sad for such a fun and exceptionally good designed take on a multiplayer title.\n\nTo the devs, if they read this. You have added joypad-support which is good for a third-person-title like this. You should consider adding a 4-player-splitscreen to this. It would really help to keep the game alive.\nEverybody loves to get some friends on a couch, grab some beer and shout at each other while playing games. And this would fit perfekt. I\u00b4ve read something bout plainsight 2 which is great to hear, but don\u00b4t let this little gem die again.\nAnd by the way the leaderboards died even earlier then the game itself ;) (not counting anymore)\n\nSo, now i have to activate some buddies to play this (after hosting a server ^^). In fact this is the only game that has me more addicted then rocket-league, which means A LOT!!\n\ntldr: get it, lose a lot of matches while learning, love it, have fun\n\nsorry for my bad english - but i think everybody gets the point\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1387927766, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510403", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8262929", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198001027617", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1392756589, "num_games_owned": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 201}, "timestamp_updated": 1387927766, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's a great game if you can gather up some friends, almost guranteed to piss a few of them off :P\n\nIt has a great \"Gravity\" sort of mechanic that really makes the game its own.\n\nId gladly pay upward of ~20$ for this game, and at a dollar (At the time of writing this :P) its a steal.\n\nI'll give it a 5/5 any day."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1419313076, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504793", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13539172", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197970379064", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1426215913, "num_games_owned": 791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1248}, "timestamp_updated": 1419313076, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is absolutely fantastic and it makes me very sad that it didn't get what it deserved.
