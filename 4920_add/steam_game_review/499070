This is a $5 mobile game at best, that somehow made it onto Steam. This is the not a football manager simulation, unless you classify zero front office work as a manager sim. I highly reccommend you PASS on this game.\n\nPros:\n- Nostalgia of 16bit football \n- Play creator (although extremely shallow)\n- Team/Player Editor (so you can recreate NFL teams without having to pay for licensing, yet they charge you like a licensed titles price.)\n\nCons: \n- There is basically zero depth.\n- There are minimal management tasks/duties.\n- Gameplay is as shallow as the rest of the game.\n- It's made for mobile... \n- It's $38CAD... \n\nDo youself a favor, and if you REALLY need to get a sports manager fix in and it HAS to be football, then go buy Front Office Football Seven. At least that game is ACTUALLY a manager sim, it's about $15 cheaper and it has a ton of depth. That being said, it's still a pretty poor game itself.\n\nThis is the second refund request I will be placing on Steam. If you look at my library you will see there is a number of subpar games, that I chose not to refund as I managed to find some value (whether I actually liked the game or not, if there's value the devs can keep my money).

This isn't it.\n\nWhile the store page doesn't deceive, they don't tell the entire story, either.  The program has potential but it seems more like it's in early release status than a finished product.\n\nWhile the game does include animated acdtion of the plays as they unfold, the graphics are cartoonish and doin't show much real detail.\n\nWhile you CAN (as they tell you) trade draft picks before each year's draft, you can NOT trade players.\n\nWhile you can train specific players in camp - you can only train 3 (wth?) and you can't pick the area they in which they train.  Why in the world can you only train 3 players?   Yes, a few stats on some players change each year, the fact you can only train 3 during off season is bewildering.  \"Hey John, Dawayne, and Ken - go workout.  The rest of y'all, take camp off.\"\n\nSo far (after about 9 seasons played), I have yet to see anything improve in team drills if I spend average time for an area.  Worse, in order tro improve one team attribute I have to shorty change - and decrease a team stat elsewhere.   PFS appears full of coaches who are no good because it seems you can't bump up one area without suffering a decrease in another.\n\nCompounding the problems, you must set your starting lineup for the next season before you conduct camp!  So, you set your starters - THEN you train.  This is completely backwards and baffles the heck out of me.  How do I know who I want to start before we train?\n\nWhile you CAN design your own plays, you only have limited ability to do so.  Forget drawing your own routes, blockling schemes, defining zones to cover, etc.  you can't do that.  You get to pick from a small set of options for SOME posiitons, not all.  They state zone blitzes will come later but , as of now, you can only select someone to blitz if you are in man coverage.\n\nSalaries, free agency, etc are not paret of the career mode.   Young players improve, old players lose skills, but contracts aren't part of the picture.\n\nYou can not start witih a draft.   You pick a team and take the players on it, even in career mode.\n\n\nFront Page Sports: Football was WAY more complete than this with vastly better graphics and it was produced bakc in the late 1990s.\n\nThis game is entertaining, but for $35?   Nah - there isn't enough there to wearrant buying it.\n\nAs is, its like they took 50% of a good football manager text simulator and added mimialist graphics, thne weant ytou to buiy it for $35.  Not worth it.\n\nFor $10, it is fine - for $35?   Way overpriced for what you get.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030766887", "last_played": 1473306753, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 117, "playtime_forever": 675}, "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_created": 1473282746, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531385", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1473282746, "recommendationid": "25402515", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game needs to be at least $25 cheaper to be worth it.

I first became aware of, and started playing the game, on iOs in its 2013 iteration.  I have bought the game each year since for play on my iPad. Over the course of the last three-plus years, I have certainly played the game for **thousands** of hours, and my opinion of its core game remains unchanged after all this time. \nThe game is, IMHO, the best football game ever created. I am 54 years old, and have been playing football games my whole life----electric football games, board games (e.g. All-Pro Football, Tudor's Football Strategy, Scrimmage, etc), computer-based (MSFL, Playmaker on the Mac, Quarterback Club, NCAA Football, the 'NFL series,' Axis, Madden x 20+ years), etc, etc, etc.\nWhere the game knocks it out of the park is in its coaching sim and mechanics----NO game has ever done it better. It dances on that razor's edge between complexity and playabilty.   Within a few hours you can learn (but hardly master) the UI so that you can choose a huge variety of offensive and defensive assignments on the fly  in between every play without getting overwhelmed by the details.  Not even flashy AAA titles like the latest Madden does this as adeptly as PSF.  The flexibility of the play-calling interface allows for an amazing variety in play outcomes.  When you come down to it, it is the turn-based, chess-like nature of football that separates it from all other sports, and PSF captures the coach-vs-coach mind game *incredibly*  well. \nNotice I have not said anything about the front office aspects of the game, nor do I intend to. I have not played the game long enough with those features to reliably comment on them.\nThe graphics are simplistic, but servicable.   If you are looking for graphics, or in-play twitch control, just get Madden 20XX.   \nMy only current request for the game, a feature which has also  been missing from the last couple of iOS versions, is online MP, which is a real hoot with a fellow football fanatic. Hopefully the dev. will address this with a future update.\nIs the game worth $35?  Well, it is to me.... as I said, I have played this game's earlier incarnations for literally thousands of hours over the last three years, so based merely on an analysis of cost vs. hours played, this game's value is waaay up there in among my all-time favorite games....Civ II, HOMM2/3, Disciples series, Diablo series, Mafia I/II, the Souls' series,  etc. etc.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013227280", "last_played": 1474366030, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 133, "playtime_forever": 246}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1473718062, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508600", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1473718062, "recommendationid": "25485565", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's a wonderful coaching strategy game.

I've just begun with PSF 2016, currently in the middle of the first season vs the pesky AI. However, I have played the developer's precursor, Tom Landry Strategy Football, for years, having recreated 22 NFL seasons with the TLSF editor using real team and player names and values. Being a stat junkie, I've compiled full team stats for every offensive and defensive category after each season. The results have surely demonstrated what I had expected from a game in which coach Tom Landry had a hand in developing: the game play was accurate in every statistical category.  PSF has the same workings as TLSF, with a smoother visual component and more play options.\n     The visual component has been criticized for its old \"arcade\" quality. I've seen others, like Front Page and Madden, and do not prefer their clip-clop-oof-arf graphics. To me, it seems like CGI in movies: the more they try to make it look real the more fake it looks. PSF graphics give me a good enough representation of the play results. That is what I care about: the relationship between the Xs and Os.\n     I have tried Front Page Sports 95 once and while I found it high quality, I did not care for all the off-season prep and GM concerns. (Of course, by recreating seasons I had no need for off-season management as each team's roster was updated by the NFL teams' own draft and trades each year.)\n     Also, I prefer TLSF/PSF because there is no twitching: you simply prepare your team and either sim or coach the game. Part of the game's realism is, say, watching your game plan work against 2 tough opponents followed by a disappointing performance against a poor team. The AI can get on your nerves. This is not a game for those who expect win all the time.\n     Whether it's coaching or career you want, the developer, Kerry Batts, has shown to be more than willing to engage gamers (on the Steam site) and accept their suggestions, comments and wishlists, to include several of my own.\n     From here I can only see a great game get better.  \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2369, "steamid": "76561198389752237", "last_played": 1507138941, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 3231}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1507145387, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507145387, "recommendationid": "35478973", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
