I found the story (and where to go) a little more intuitive and the HOGs more attractive and more clever.  The art for the game is lovely (as it is for the whole series). This chapter is one of my favourites so far - the premise is so interesting!\n\nNeutral:\n- all the Hidden Object scenes are finding pieces to creat an object that you need\n- there are no HO scenese where you need to find separate items (like a hammer, or an apple) from a semi-random list\n- depends how you feel about this; I don't mind it\n\nPros:\n- art\n- relaxing music\n- nice colours in Hidden Object Scenes\n- puzzles aren't too hard but provide some challenge\n- interesting and interconnected underlying stories in these games (this is a selling point for me, which is why I like the series, despite some less polished aspects)\n\nCons:\n- no fast travel using the map (need to walk through each location)\n- the map isn't completely intuitive (not terrible, but could be better)\n- occasionally not clear where to go (but the full guide is available in-game and extremely easy to use - I was impressed with how well it worked)\n\nOverall:  If you enjoy HOGs generally, especially those with a genuine story, you'll probably enjoy this one and the others.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198033388937", "last_played": 1502058162, "num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 370, "playtime_forever": 835}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502879856, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502879972, "recommendationid": "34273652", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
