Although you couldn't change the resolution, you were able to use the Steam Overlay and also got Trading Cards now.\n\nI loved how you can collect during the Game pieces which will, once all of them are collected, give you a little background Story which is read to you buy a guy with a very soothing and calm voice. You can of course turn it off but you dont have to.\n\nThe Hidden Object Scenes were rather well hidden and the Puzzles were challenging. I personally did like them alot and was surprised how well you can hide something in this game.\n\nThe Story was absolutely lovely and reminded me a little bit on my Childhood just in a more Grimm way.\n\nAll in all this Game is fantastic, however due to the fact that is rather short I do recommend getting it on Sale rather then for its base price of 10\u20ac.\n\nHere are my other Reviews for the Dark Parables Series:\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/KurukiiKaesekuchen/recommended/524600/]Dark Parables: Curse of Briar Rose[/url] (Number 1)\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/KurukiiKaesekuchen/recommended/499100/]Dark Parables: The Exiled Prince[/url] (Number 2)\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/KurukiiKaesekuchen/recommended/499110]Dark Parables: Rise of the Snow Queen Collector's Edition[/url] (Number 3)\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/KurukiiKaesekuchen/recommended/465890]Dark Parables: The Final Cinderella[/url] (Number 5)\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/KurukiiKaesekuchen/recommended/578320]Dark Parables: Jack and the Sky Kingdom Collector's Edition[/url] (Number 6)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198062558470", "last_played": 1498058338, "num_reviews": 154, "num_games_owned": 638, "playtime_forever": 250}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1498058833, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513266", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499538235, "recommendationid": "32620329", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
