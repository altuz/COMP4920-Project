The graphics are nice, the gameplay is very well balaced and fun, and the music is great. This game has a great proper and dapper feel to it, which I find very charming. As of the time of writing this review I have played the game for literally 20 minutes and I'm already hooked. The best part is that it's only 2 bucks! That's the same price as a bag of chips, and if this game were a bag of chips, it would be Pringles. I enjoy this game and plan on playing it in the future, and I'm honored to be the first person to review this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198196622793", "last_played": 1477532936, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 76, "playtime_forever": 202}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1469157197, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518507", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1469239579, "recommendationid": "24452830", "votes_funny": 11, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Its literally $2 for a fun and very strategic game! This game has unique gameplay mechanics with buildings helping either population, food, happiness, prosperity, and culture. Each building also hurts one of the 3 stats  happiness, prosperity, and culture, but it hurts on stat less than it helps the other, making it possible to balance. There is an annoying bug where you dont actually have to win correctly, whenevery your stats are going up or down, if they happen to line up like you are supposed to even though they are still going down past what you need you still win. Making possible to cheat. I do love this game, dont let my game time fool you as I have played much longer offline. Very fun and for the price its 100% worth it! If you like the strategy genre its a must-have and if you dont try it anyways, you may be suprised! 9.4/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198205022953", "last_played": 1469805958, "num_reviews": 53, "num_games_owned": 99, "playtime_forever": 65}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1469328881, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1469328881, "recommendationid": "24491346", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very simple game.
