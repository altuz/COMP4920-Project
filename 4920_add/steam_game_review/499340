Although it isn't a terribly long game, it does feature challenge versions of every level once you complete the game.

Turner does a great job at leading the player level to level, slowly teaching them how to play.  By the end of the game you will find yourself using every ability and skill you have learned along the way, none of which become obsolete.  \n\nThis game is fun, challenging, and intriguing, but there are a few features I would have liked to see. I really would have loved to see a \"Reset Level\" feature, as I had to go back to the main menu on level 182(?) as it is possible to get stuck. Also, since this game is ripe for speedrunning, in-game timers would have been nice. Or at least an individual level mode to try to get the best IL times.   \n\nFor the ridiculously low price tag, you really can't go wrong. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043030865", "last_played": 1468629241, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 124, "playtime_forever": 100}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1468630226, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1468630675, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521875", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1468630226, "developer_response": "Thanks so much for the positive feedback!

[/u]\nTurner is a 2D platformer with a lot to offer. You play as a character named 'Turner'. Your goal is to get out of the asylum and find out why you were put there in the first place. You also need to collect pages in the game and tackle extreme obstacles by rotating, jumping and sliding in order to succeed.\n\nI have played this game for nearly 10 hours and I must say, i've enjoyed every second of it.There are some things that i would tweak, but overall, this is a true masterpiece. In this review, it clearly is my opinion. You may disagree with some of my points, but i feel as if i need to show a review of what i like and don't like to give you, the reader, a rough idea of what the game is about.\n\n[u] Pros! [/u]\n- [b] Amazing soundtrack!: [/b] Throughout the game, there are some amazing pieces of music which are played and I think they suit the game pretty well. Right now, i'm listening to 'Dark Corridors' because it's very mystical, i love it!. To give you an idea of what the soundtracks are like in the game, lets take the first sound track for the first half of the game, 'Asylum'.I think gives a creepy and surreal introduction to the game. However, there is one soundtrack which i do not like, as i will list in the cons.\n\n- [b] Challenging stages!: [/b] Progressing through the game, the stages have got a lot more harder as you play. It is tough getting past a few (in my opinion), but once you pass the level you've been stuck at for around 10 minutes, you can feel pretty proud of yourself and be ready for the next level.\n\n- [b] Nice achievements!: [/b] Most of the achievements in turner are mainly scored by passing a chapter, but there are some which are secret. I have only unlocked one of the secrets which leaves a hilarious outcome, but im daring to find the others. I also like the way there are only 13 achievements. This is because they are extremely easy to get if you're good at the game and it won't take so long to get them, like other games.\n\n- [b] Interesting story!: [/b] In turner, you don't really know much when you first play the game, but once you get to the cutscenes, it all unravels. I find this very interesting and draws gamers in to find out more about turner..\n\n- [b] Friendly staff!: [/b] Yesterday, i got friended by one of the developers, he is a extremely nice guy! Eventhough i have not met all of the staff, i am pretty sure that they are nice people. If you have a query, they are happy to help! They do enjoy a lot of support from the fans, so be sure to give them some love!\n\n- [b] Extremely cheap!: [/b] My final pro for this game is that eventhough it is on a sale right now for \u00a30.49, Originally it costs \u00a31.99. That is very low in price, concidering most games up the stakes with money. My only question is, why aren't people buying it? Get it now! You're missing out!\n\n[u] Cons! [/u]\n- [b] 'The Night Sky' soundtrack!: [/b] Eventhough i said the music was excellent, i do find that this soundtrack is rather irritating. I know you'll say: \"Why don't you mute the game so you don't hear it?\" Well, i did, but i didn't really want to. The track sounded like it was rushed and it's extremely loud. It honestly makes no sense. It doesn't give the real vibe to the game.. Sorry..\n\nThat's really it. I cannot fault make up lies for such a superb game. \n\n[u] Conclusion [/u]\n I really recommend everyone who reads this to buy it, it's thrilling and exciting. I have never had this much fun in a game since a few other games I like. I have played this game for hours and i have not got bored of it. 10/10 from me!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198127134253", "last_played": 1499370109, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 89, "playtime_forever": 462}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1483214508, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505935", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1483214535, "recommendationid": "28880366", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "neat game", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198329870420", "last_played": 1473575045, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1473575303, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501838", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1473575303, "recommendationid": "25456911", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Full disclosure: I know those who make the game and took part in early beta testing.\n\nTurner is an interesting little puzzle platformer in which you utilize a power of turning the world around you to reach a goal. As the game progresses, you unlock new abilities in order to reach the end of the level.\n\nI enjoyed my time playing, and recommend it, especially at this low pricetag.\n\nHowever, here are my pros and cons for this game:\n\nPROS:\n- Art style. The hand drawn aesthetic works well with the theme of the asylum.\n- Soundtrack is decent.\n- Good General puzzle design (for the most part)\n- To add, the best puzzle are the slower-paced ones, in which the rotating mechanic is at the forefront\n- Some of the puzzles utilize the rotating mechanic in a really interesting manner.\n- Fun to play for most levels\n- Game introduces mechanics, old mechanics are not made obsolete.\n\nCONS:\n- Control. Note that this is for keyboard, have not tested with a gamepad. There is a slight delay from pressing the keys to the actual movement of the character, which can make for some frustrating moments. In addition, the jump feels slightly floaty. You won't find the crispness of platforming found in games such as Super Meat Boy and Spelunky.\n- The wall jump mechanic is simply not satisfying to play. The levels that focus on the double jump are some of the least fun.\n- Some levels are simply not fun. There is a series of levels early on in which the worlds moves automatically, and you have to traverse the whole circle to reach the exit. Due to the nature of the controls, the precise timings lead to a very frustrating experience.\n- Very limited options menu.\n- No sound effects besides the soundtrack\n\nWhile not without its problems, I recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun little puzzle game for a low price.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042819305", "last_played": 1468792813, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_forever": 90}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1468789272, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498486", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1468789272, "recommendationid": "24379124", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "disclaimer: i know the people who made the game.\n\nv entertaining. overall good game. music and art are well done. i rlly dig all the concepts. it's p difficult and the controls take some getting used to, but i keep coming back to it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198310557653", "last_played": 1502744602, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 212}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1475289882, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1475289882, "recommendationid": "25792243", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I'll admit, I bought this game because it's got the same name as my favourite tutor x) \n\nI've only played twenty minutes so far (and I'll admit, most of that was stuck on a tutorial level because I'm REALLY good at puzzles) but I can definatley say I'd recommend this to my friends, and I will definately be slogging my way ungracefully through this game until the end, \"eerk!\"ing and \"argh!\"ing the whole time. It's addictive. I want those notes.\n\nTurner is adorable and unsettling all at once. I love the leaning dynamic they worked into his movements, it really adds weight to the dizziness of tumbling rooms around. His shuffle makes me laugh everytime I nudge along to the edge of a platform, and it's simply and elegantly animated. I don't think I've ever got to use the word 'elegant' in a review before. +rep for Turner's design crew. And they have trading cards! Yay! Another good reason to play (not to mention it's decently priced). \n\nI normally hate puzzle games and I know I will only be able to play this in 10 minute blocks without screaming, but it's already one of my favourite games.

I'll make this quick, I'll just do some pro's and cons of this game, but I'll start with cons because I have a lot\n\nCons:\n-Diffuculty increases WAY too fast, if the first 50 levels were difficult, I can't imagine the rest of the game. I've played loads of platformers and the difficulty gradually increased, whereas in this game they throw one easy level at you and then a stupidly hard one the next\n-The physics in this game are appaling. When you're on a rotating platform, you're not supposed to slide off immediately, it should be sticky. Also, when you're in the air and you input a direction, you fly a million feet in that direction. In normal games, when you're in the air and you directionally input, you start slow and then gain speed, but it happens in this game all at once. Jumping is stupid too, the amount of horizontal distance you gain from a jump is unjustifiably broken, and the amount of vertical distance is too low for the amount of horizontal dist. you gain. \n-Most of the time when you die, it's the game's fault. The game doesn't prepare you for it's bullshit platforming, so when you are presented to it for the first time you're gonna get pissed. In Super Meat Boy for example, the game prepares you for it's difficulty, however here it doesn't, it throws you to the dogs\n-Glitches. This game is glitchy. I hit a box and I fell through the map multiple times. \n-Hit detection is fucking broken, it can't even recognize when you land on an object. If you land on a super thin platform, good luck because if you land near the front edge you're probably going to land, but then fall through anyway\n-The floors are made of fucking soap. It's like you're melee luigi in this game but your wavedash is always active. Everytime I land on a platform, I slide like 3 miles away from where I'm supposed to land\n-The most vital flaw of this game, IT DOESN'T LET YOU UTILIZE THE CORE MECHANIC OF THE GAME. The game is supposed to be about manipulating your enviroment to your advantage, but instead of following this simple rule, they throw stupid platforming in your face that really doesn't utilize the turning at all and that really made me the most pissed\n\nPros:\n-If you want to get pissed off, here's your game\n\nThat's all I could think of\n\nI barely played an hour of this and it was too ridiculous. I've never played a game this bad. I'm getting a refund and hopefully steam accepts it. This game really had a lot of potential, and they fucked it up. \n\nNow I'm not saying don't buy the game, some people may enjoy it, but I'm just giving you a heads up.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198072483333", "last_played": 1482532368, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 95, "playtime_forever": 30}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1482533267, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509226", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1482533267, "recommendationid": "28572953", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "SO your game was pretty finger lickin good and the soundtrack is lit would recommend to my boys out in the asylum so they to can  escape.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198161330307", "last_played": 1486431719, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 23}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1485219921, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488736", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1485219921, "recommendationid": "29452940", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
