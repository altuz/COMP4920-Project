And in some ways, it delivered. In others, it didnt.\n\nMy main complaint about the game is how little of the game I can see.\nI really wish that the game didnt put huge black lines on the screen, there's no reason for them, and they make it extremely hard to see.\nI wish the game didnt go black and white every 30 seconds\nI wish my half-visible screen didnt go completely red (Except for a tiny space in the middle) Everytime i get hit, making it nearly impossible to see anything.\n\nIt would also be great if everything wasnt so tiny, but I wouldn't mind that if I had more screen real estate.\n\nAside from that, the game is pretty fun.\nThe upgrades are simple, weapons are diverse enough, there are a few different enemies, and the music, although there isn't much of it. is plesant to listen too.\n\nI would recommend this game, if the dev decides to change the game so the player can see what they are doing.\n\nI'd give it a 4.5/10, just below average.
