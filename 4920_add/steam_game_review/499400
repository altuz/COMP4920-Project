How can you beat that price?! I spend that on so many useless things that I never even use besides maybe once. \n\nAnyways to the review :)\n\nThis game has quite a bit going for it. It's a rail style shooter in which you are placed in a mine cart of sorts and have to defend yourself against the robots that are coming at you. I died several times on normal mode so I can only imagine how challenging hard mode can be. This is something that I really enjoy in games in general not just vr games, a challenge. \n\n\nThe developer has also added in an optional locomotion system that you can try out whether it be to work out some or just mess around with you can change your players movement from automatic where you are just riding in the cart to being moved by jogging in place. This does a couple things.\n\n   Give you a pretty decent workout if you play for prolonged periods of time - Check\n   Make the game more challenging if you find yourself too boss at the regular missions - CHEck\n   Make you look like a fool  -   CHECK!!\n\nIn all seriousness the shooting feels very solid in this game and for only $3 you can't go wrong!\n\nDefinitely worth picking up.\n\n(Below is a link to a gameplay commentary I made of this game, so if you are curious of how the game plays then check it out!)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=723389977", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043450023", "last_played": 1468371104, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 27}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1468365594, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516122", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1468365594, "recommendationid": "24284761", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I tried my best to like this one - about 3 sessions of 15 minutes each on  3 separate days - but I simply couldn't endure it anymore. Although the game has a really good soundtrack (it was very nostalgic of a Final Fantasy 3 castle tune), it was too random and largely uninspiring to continue playing.\n\nThe gun doesn't shoot particularly straight, and the enemies are very far away, which gives the game a very random feel as opposed to any sort of skill or improvement in shooting. Also, enemies shoot from far away and their bolts are very fast, making it almost impossible to dodge. The lack of feedback after being hit didn't give me much desire to even try to dodge, really, and I found myself 'wild-wild-west'ing most of the time on the same dreary path.\n\nWhile everyone seems to be heralding this for its super cheap price, I would argue that there are MUCH better shooters out there for the same or less (or free) right now on the vive.
