It takes about a millisecond to load, and another 2 for an unskippable logo. Next thing that happens is that the menu loads up and you start hearing some low quality music, like a youtube video locked at 144p, but for sound, or something like that\n\nFrom here, there are a few buttons to select..\n \"Play\" \"Choose MP3\" \"Options\" \"Leaderboard\" \"Help\"\nFirst let's go into the options menu...\n (Music volume) (SFX Volume) (Fullscreen)\nOnly 3 options, and there isn't one for resolution? But oh well, I guess that's fine, there shouldn't be too much to this game. And there really isn't. But what really bugs me is that the SFX slider doesn't actually decrease the sound effects, and the music volume probably doesn't change a thing either, I haven't bothered to try that one. You might think this one isn't very important, but there is an annoying sound effect for shooting and hitting rings.. and those can very easiely destroy whatever music you chose to play.\n\nThe Mp3 button works just fine. \"Thank god\" I thought to myself, not having realised that this wasn't a rythm game by now. So basically, this button only changes the music in the background, and it doesn't seem to affect gameplay in any way. Kinda sad. But I guess it's finally time to move on and play this game...\n\nThe game seems to be playing alright, and since I am too lazy to describe the gameplay myself, you can check the description of it yourself from one of the [url=http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/499420/ss_6eb6df5012b8c0498dfa7157e713d4defd2bd8dd.jpg?t=1470512879]store screenshots[/url]. Well, there are also red Xs which take some score if you shoot, but it's pretty much impossible to lose anyways if you hit a few circles. You also get introduced to a new \"level\" every minute or so, but I haven't gone past the first bit of level 2 because it all seemed exactly the same.
