It is entirely soothing while actually providing quite a challenge. The game features several different puzzle mechanics which also get woven into another and it is a joy to behold to solve smaller parts of the bigger puzzles and then watching them all come together.\n\nDidn't expect anything and got this solely due to the overwhelming positive reviews and because it was just one buck.\n\nGot completely blown away by the sheer amount of amazingness this little gem holds.
