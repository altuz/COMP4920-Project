If you haven't, you should play them instead of The Turing Test.\n\nSince it is a completely linear puzzle game, there are only really three elements which matter:\n- The puzzles\n- The story\n- The environment/atmosphere\n\nThe puzzles are mediocre. There are quite a few mechanics here, many more than you would need for a 4-5 hours game. The problem is that they never amount to a challenge. Passed the first 20 minutes trying to figure the basics, you will never encounter a puzzle that will even pretend to resist you. In fact, quite often, you might even complete puzzles without using all the tools at your disposal, because you do not need them.\n\nThe story is ok. You can basically guess where it is going 30 minutes in. There are \"shocking revelations\" throughout the game, but they don't really impact the story overall, instead acting as little nuggets of life to make the characters feel a bit more relatable. The moral/ethical dillema presented is never really explored. And yes, you get to choose your ending, but it's really just a \"press the button or don't\" deal.\n\nThe atmosphere is ok. Nothing to write home about. Atmospheric music, servicable visuals, just enough lore to not put you to sleep, pretty good voice acting. You'll most likely forget about it and never come back to it.\n\nThe Turing Test is not a bad game. It's just your average space meal. If you are starving, you will push it down your gob, and it will keep you satiated for a few hours. But if you're not on the verge of death, you have no reason to want to ingest the tasteless, joyless mixture.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994259403", "last_played": 1505062568, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 185, "playtime_forever": 325}, "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_created": 1505063405, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526763", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1505063595, "recommendationid": "34866767", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fantastic.

The puzzles are pretty easy, even the optionals, though they get more interesting towards the end when you have to switch between viewpoints. I was never stuck for more than a minute though.\n\nThe story is not exactly what I was expecting given the obvious title, but it's a neat idea. The interaction with levers is annoying - you have to hold E and move the mouse, and I found I sometimes accidentally moved the lever up and then immediately back down. I don't know why it wasn't just a toggle with E.\n\nI would recommend getting it in a sale.

I found it to be quite easy to complete, and is absolutely nowhere near the level of challenge offered by the Talos Principle (by far the most challenging puzzle-platformer I've played so far). This game has lots of polish - a great deal of work has been invested in refining this title's look, feel and sound. The voiceover by T.O.M. is absolutely delicious, the plot is surprisingly smart, and the gameplay is fun and varied...

Still if you are going to play this game for the story wich I must say is very good, you are going to have a good time. My 6/7 hour playtrough actually excisted more about exploring the world and enjoying the story than actually figuring out the puzzles so that is saying enough. If you would actually would rush trough the content I would say the game is easly finishable in 4 hours if its even going to take that long.\n\nThis is why I ll put this game on reccomended but advising to get this game on a sale, the content of the game is good, but the puzzles are quite simple if you are used to 'the talos principle'.
