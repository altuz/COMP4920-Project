I knew very little going into it, but was blown away by the attention to detail on historical accuracy. It is not often you see this in modern games.\nThe world is immersive and huge. Whether I am viewing the regional map or down in the combat, it just feels as though the land and sea stretches out in all directions for miles. The amount of detail brings the world to life, even with all of the dying going on... City building only adds to the sheer size of it all!\nThe combat is balanced, but challenging! Many past strategy games I've played never fulfilled a challenge once the game mechanics and AI capabilities were figured out, but MKW has challenged me to stay focused, otherwise it is easy to have victory slip away from you. It has supplied me with a challenge I find myself needing to attack a little more fiercely in my next session of play.\nThe art is fantastic, no matter where it is placed in the game. The loading screens are very detailed, depicting scenes of battle or beautiful scenery, and the overall graphic design of the gameplay world is beautiful, even in the darkest, bloodiest trenches of war-torn lands.\nI've noticed a large amount of updates from the Devs, which is a great sign for any early release project! It means they really care about this project, and are improving this Early Access frequently! I'm excited to see what comes of it.\n\nAlso... Is that a map editor I see? Now THAT I will be having a lot of fun with. When I was a kid, I used to purposely seek out games that had map editors so I could create my own worlds and scenarios.

I'd like more options (and extra options too) e.g. choosing what settlements I own at start, what enemies and what they have.  Naming characters and settlements and not just my own) maybe other religion options.  Treasures to hunt that offer trade, morale, wealth, espionage, unit experience boosts etc which all in game characters search for.
