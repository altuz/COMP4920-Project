The art in Shinrai is actually drawn by its main writer and developer and is probably not what you would call professional. However after finishing the game I think the art feels just right in context, and it doesn't hurt the joy of the story even a little bit. There are lots of sprites, lots of expressions and outfits, and a lot of characters including extras. All of them may not be AAA quality, but in this game, they definitely don't need to be. It does what it has to - you grow to like the characters and their funny quirks.\n\nNow, onto the story. What surprised and pleased me the most is that SHINRAI is an actual fair play mystery. Which is something incredibly rare in our age of detective fiction's decline. The main \"case\" is not something the writer made up in three minutes and then explained with five deus ex machinaes, it's an actual well constructed fair mystery that you are challenged to solve. If you're a fan of Agatha Christie, you know what a joy this can be. There are hints, red herrings, timelines, clues, diary to keep track, suspect interviews, everything you need for your grumpy little detective kit. A must have for any serious mystery fan.\nYou may say that the story is nothing new and you'll be probably right. But it's an old story told in a pleasing new way, with a cast of lovely characters.\n\nThe characters are mostly well developed and written well enough to gain your sympathy and empathy. Generally I would describe them as \"very cute but quite realistic\". You won't hear any NYAAAA or see over the top stuff - they behave as normal people would and talk like real people do, which is something that usually separates english VNs from japanese ones. There is quite enough of good humour too.\n\nOverall, if I had to describe the game in three words, I'd say Shinrai is: Indie, Cute, Smart.\n\nLast of all, frankly I don't write reviews often, but in this case I believe it's justified, because Shinrai is very promising and deserves more public recognition - and the public deserves more fair play mystery VNs!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197996101648", "last_played": 1504386094, "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 545, "playtime_forever": 1288}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504811350, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498921", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504811350, "recommendationid": "34800686", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
