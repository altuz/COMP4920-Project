I can clearly see the potential, but there is more to gaming that powerful enemies and poor starts. Unfortunately, after 4 deaths and no progress, I gave it up in disgust. \n\nThe enemies are too powerful for the start of the game. Even with the dog, you will only die painfully. hunger and thirst are so poorly balanced that you can die of dehydration in less than a day of doing nothing. \n\nLoot is almost non-existant. In 3 of my four runs, I got only one ranged weapon and ammo for it at the same time. most of the containers were empty, and the only food item I found was meat. No water means that you will not stand a chance.\n\nThis is not a complete game. It should have gone on early access instead of being put out at full price. I hope the developers learn from their mistakes and make this game playable, because as it is I cannot enjoy it.

Andi expect that you, as the developer keep updating and developing it whenever you can. I see (in the future if you keep developing it) A massive randomly generated world with multiplayer, physics, and destruction. I see that if you get this game on the right path, this game will be Terraria and Rust combined, which would make a great game! :D I support you with buying this game and i expect good out of it! keep it out and don't quit!

I dont really see a point rather then playing this and messing around in it to waste time. Rather when it gets updated and the developer/s stay on top of it i have a good feeling about this game and may be fairly fun and unique, plus its $1.99 so like why not lol, i was gonna get a refund but then i was like  \"It's only $1.99 so it cant really hurt to keep it\" and that's where making this review came from ;w; But i think this game has alot of potential and keep up the work developer/s :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198124895605", "last_played": 1468953750, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 59, "playtime_forever": 49}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1468466032, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482003", "votes_down": 21, "timestamp_updated": 1468466032, "recommendationid": "24307685", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
