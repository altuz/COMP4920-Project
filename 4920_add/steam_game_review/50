For half life this is not the case, the mainstream Half Life story following Gordon Freeman (HL, HL2 and the episodes) can be played by itself and satisyingly goes in its own path no DLC's needed. Opposing Force is a optional story in a different perspective of the Black Mesa incident, including extremely cool easter eggs which link up with the original Half Life and are extremely satisfying. The story is nothing special but it is not bad you follow the perspective of Corporal Adrian Shepard in the military. This is one of the best things about the game, in Half Life you see the military as just souless sponges which soak up all your bullets. But in this game you see this from the militaries perspective and you get some interesting banter with your military allies and the game explains who the black ops soldiers are which make a appearance in Half Life. The game brings a few new guns which are very fun to play with but for some reason there is a very big lack of ammo and near the end the difficulty becomes super hard and I have been playing half life for a really long time on hardest difficulty, the enemies become annoying. This game is very good I reccomend playing it and its cheap I give it a 8/10"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506130456, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35141473", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198137644838", "num_reviews": 28, "last_played": 1506221567, "num_games_owned": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "playtime_forever": 238}, "timestamp_updated": 1506130456, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Just as good as the first Half life game and it is very fun to play the online is dead but there's boy commands you can use but it's better to play the main game because it has a good story and there's lots of hidden features throughout the game....."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505351477, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "34940024", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198007188969", "num_reviews": 42, "last_played": 1480736221, "num_games_owned": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 365}, "timestamp_updated": 1505351477, "received_for_free": false, "review": "What call of duty should of been..."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506589560, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504523", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35257750", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198320910504", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1503720039, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 744}, "timestamp_updated": 1506589635, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1] Nice expansion to a fantastic game.
