I have always loved flying games, especially gliding ones, but this one makes you feel like you're actually on the mountain!  The complaint of 2 of the 3 negative reviews was that the movement was controlled by the head.  This was changed months ago, and you now control it by moving your hands, just like on a real hang glider.  This is more natural, and lets you look around at the scenery.  Several of my friends and family and tried it, and they have all enjoyed it.\n\nThe graphics are clean and polished, and it's well worth the $10.  I'll never forget the first time I stepped off the ramp at the top of Glider Island and dove down the mountain.  It was such a rush!\n\nMost or all of the other glider-like flying VR games are arcade style, and just move you at a constant speed. This one feels like the real thing.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034933581", "last_played": 1492135636, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 87, "playtime_forever": 214}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1492136624, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1492136792, "recommendationid": "31127644", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
