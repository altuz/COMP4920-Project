The 'phoenix' type weapon that 1 shots some enemies, doesn't do it for bonuses & the weapons don't seem to upgrade in any visually satisfying way.\n\nThe first boss doesn't have a health bar, you just hit it aimlessly until you win.\nThe second level seemed more interesting from a layout perspective with environmental traps & such, but the scroll speed. boring weapons/upgrades & necessity of spamming keys to get a usable fire rate did me in by the middle of the second stage.\n\nIt's cheap, hope it improves because it's visually appealing & the music was fine; but it feels too oddly paced & unpleasant to play for me.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198086542708", "last_played": 1468721081, "num_reviews": 77, "num_games_owned": 3590, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1468722002, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516561", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1468722002, "recommendationid": "24364398", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a 2016 of MSX's Knightmare or SNES Pocky and Rocky.
