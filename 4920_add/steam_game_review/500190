This game only resembles Close Combat but it barely plays like it. The units don't listen well and it's very difficult to place them where you want them. In the mean time they get themselves killed. Very clunky. I've bought quite a few games from steam and this is the first review I've ever written here. This game stinks and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035776696", "last_played": 1499171968, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 26, "playtime_forever": 113}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499606464, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499606464, "recommendationid": "33403937", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
