No voiceovers and lots of dialogue.  I loved the main characters, Terry and Heimlich, and their interactions between themselves and others.  The story was great and I wanted to play it out to find out what happens.  It definitely kept my interest.\n\nMost of the puzzles were adventure game logical so it might be a little more challenging for beginning adventure gamers.  But the game has an in-game walkthrough that will get you unstuck from any situation you might find youself in.  There are a couple minigames which require some reflex clicking (e.g., clicking when the cursor hits a spot on a bar) but I made it through pretty easily and I don't have the best speed reflexes in the world so I think most people can handle it without too much trouble.\n\nManual saves and so you can save as often and never have to wait for a save point.  You don't die in the game so the save is mostly for safe progress keeping rather than making sure you don't have to replay hours because your character fell off a cliff or something. :)\n\nSomeone mentioned 104 dialogue choice clicking in Act II.  Seriously, you would only click that many times if you were forcing the result and not trying to solve the riddles.  Once you see that you need words of wisdom from all the NPCs, you just go and collect them all.  Once that is done, you can solve the riddles by careful choices.  There are some of these kinds of puzzles in this game and I did have to get some actual paper and take notes - especially in Act III.  Old school adventure.  Doing that on occasion is fine by me and makes me smile more than irritates me.\n\nI had a lot of fun playing this blast from the past game that was clever, charming and funny.  I highly recommend it to people that like the old style point and click adventures.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198011515841", "last_played": 1505061881, "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 199, "playtime_forever": 1168}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1505063285, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514244", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505063285, "recommendationid": "34866719", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
