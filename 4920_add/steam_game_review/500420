They also go through the comments of the game in order to find bugs people are experiencing.

Upon entering the options for creating a game, I find that the \"Start\" option is not functioning correctly. When searching for a game, it continuously says no one in my region is playing. The game looked like it could have been neat but don't give these people money. What a waste of time. Requesting a refund.\n\n[Edit 1] I purchased the game again based on the feedback from the developer and I am pleased to say the game functions correctly! It's everything I expected the game to be and more. The only thing I advise upon getting this game is to either have plenty of friends get the game alongside you... Or join the discord server set up for this game. It makes for a much better playing experience! Thanks Taibi7 and Winter Studios!

(If someone inhabited a broom per se, then used the 'ragdoll' to make it fall over. This ability would then make them stand up rigid. You can also make all the props bounce around, combining this with your other skill you can quickly find yourself a brand new soul.\n\nThe Reaper can go invisible and see the trail left by souls for a short period. So if you hunt down a Soul, then it tries to do a runner and looses you, you can go invisible, follow his trail. Then jump out of the shadows to claim your newest soul.\n\nThe Robot can create an anti-gravity bubble that will cause all props in its vicinity to slowly rise. Good way to catch souls who are trying to run.. + It looks really awesome. You also have a beacon ability that I -think- detects souls within x radius. Need to try this one more to find out!\n\nJust needs a bigger playerbase.\n\nHighly recommend.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971495486", "last_played": 1494539372, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 406, "playtime_forever": 567}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1494229976, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1494229976, "recommendationid": "31620574", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Excellent game if you have friends to play with!\n\nNot many people online and still more to do (maps, skins and game modes needed) but absolutely hilarious to play with friends - especially if you're on team speak / skype!\n\nI played the alpha version from the website for many games before this was released on steam and the different hunter abilities, haunt ability of the hiders and the new maps are great additions.
