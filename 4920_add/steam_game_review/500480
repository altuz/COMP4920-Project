The models and art style looks great.\n\nThe 3 bot types present adequate and different, escalating challenge.\n\nThe 1 arena is nice, and littered with a variety of objects to pull up and throw and use as clubs.\n\nThe physics is actually pretty good. Not perfect, but more than serviceable, and great for punching and clubbing the bots.\n\nLocomotion comes with arm swinger (and a monkey panic mode where you swing it above your head to run backwards) and teleportation modes.\n\nPlayed with monkey move mode (as I'll be calling all arm swinger locomotion games from now), and had a blast using boxing tactics on the bots; getting in close as an in boxer, or staying further out as an out boxer. Something that can't be said for Thrill of the Fight in my modestly scaled room.\n\nPromising game and a good demo of what can be achieved in a melee fighting game when locomotion is added.\n\n\nWhat I'd like to see more of:\n\nMore bots, more levels, more objects to pick up and hurl. More dynamics (there was a car driving around in the level - maybe we'd get to see cops and military roll up and ineffectually blast us and allow us to use it as fodder for throwing stuff at the opposing robots).\n\nMaybe more customization system for your bot - pick the arms/weapons, pick the chassis (heavier/more damage/lighter/faster), some progression stuff to make the pull through the game more compelling... so basically your normal game like features.\n\nBetter damage response to the player. Right now it blurs out the screen when you get hit... but it's not that meaningful - hard to tell how much damage you're taking, and easy to confuse it for - they're just too close to you kinda blur.\n\nThe opposite - damage response to the enemy is quite good. They get knocked around a bit and they turn red, making it obvious you've struck a blow.\n\n\nTL:DR\nIf you're looking an innovative melee 1v1 fighting game that looks and plays in a fun way, that allows for movement and zoning - Fist of Physics is a great title at a reasonable price.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197968496198", "last_played": 1485795055, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 419, "playtime_forever": 78}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1481910419, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512431", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1481910419, "recommendationid": "28409031", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If no further developments to this game in its current early access state, then it's still a good choice at it's (current as of this writing) $9.99USD price.
