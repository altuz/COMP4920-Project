I'm still gonna leave a positive review because it did what it claimed to do on the tin during the early days of VR when there was a massive lack of similar apps. Kudos to the devs for filling the gap, and shame on HTC/Valve for not including a video viewer with a device that cost me \u00a3769 (that was the price of the vive when I bought it.
