If you have ever liked Total Carnage, Geometry Wars, Smash TV, or really any other top down omnidirectional shooter, you owe it to yourself to give this a try. It even has local coop, for those of you always searching for new couch multiplayer games.\n\nTormentor X Punisher is a score attack and leaderboard centric arena shooter focused on nonstop action, (you reload your machinegun by shooting your shotgun) where everything dies in one hit including all bosses, and yourself. It's great for the \"just one more round!\" effect because matches will last at most 5 minutes, and it takes about 7 seconds to go from dead, to being in a new round.\n\nThe 7 bosses are all unique, die in one hit, (yes, even priestess if you play your cards right) and actually modify the map in interesting and mostly permanent ways. Killing Gutshank will summon a giant spinning sawblade that will go around the perimeter of the level. Carrion will build walls and rooms throughout the arena as long as it lives.\n\nMy absolute favorite mechanic in the game is the experience of discovering unexpected projectile/enemy/boss interactions. As you play, you'll go from hating and not understanding specific bosses and enemies, to intentionally letting them live and baiting out their attacks, so you can turn them against their friends. Snitch will go from \"ugh, this boss is pathetic.\" to \"Finally! An opportunity to clean up my wall infested arena!\" Gutshank will go from \"Why the hell does this guy keep building robot versions of himself!? This is impossible to deal with!\" to \"I haven't seen a gutbot in 6 hours of playtime.\" This gradual transition induced by your growing mastery applies to normal enemies too. You will go from hating wizards, to wishing more of them appeared later in the game for that sweet, sweet weapon upgrade.\n\nThe amount of tiny details and careful thought put into every game mechanic, visual effect, and \"gamefeel\" trick is honestly rather staggering, and I could write an essay on those aspects alone. Every summoning circle pulses to the base drum of the music. The circles summon demons ALSO to the base drum rhythm. The UI pulses to it. Enemy projectiles slow slightly when right next to you, to allow for an extra fraction of a second to nullify them with your shotgun. Shooting a fireball with a shotgun will turn it against your enemies. Every single shell casing, shotgun shell, gib, summoning circle scorch mark, bloodsplattter, and corpse stays on the map forever, showing you the absolute carnage you've wrought. A little twerp of a demon runs up and brags about causing your death, despite never even daring to come into the arena until you've died SOLELY to induce in the player a personal vendetta against him. Each time a boss or hazard is introduced the camera highlights them, and all demons take a moment to cheer and bow before them. The survival timer will count up to 6 minutes and 66 seconds before correcting itself to 7:07, just so it can display a time of 6:66. It's the little things, you know?\n\n\n\nAll in all, I have had an absolute blast with this game so far, and will be playing, and recommending it for months, or maybe even years to come. I've still got personal challenges to complete on video. Daehkcuf won't summon himself, and there's 7 bosses that are overdue for a single run, barehanded only killing.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 410, "steamid": "76561198006889794", "last_played": 1507174825, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 504, "playtime_forever": 2673}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1502141795, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509358", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505175780, "recommendationid": "34090137", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Torementor X Punisher is a meat tenderizer to the face. It's a band of feral children chasing you through the woods, pelting you with acid gumballs. It's a genetically modified giraffe/hyena hybrid crunching on your bones under the glow of an alien sun. Devil Daggers is an obvious influence; they're both arena shooters that last as long as you can survive (not long), they both come at you as hard and fast as a rabid bear, and they both dare you with a manic glint in their eyes to play just one more game. There's a splash of Hotline Miami in the movement, and a streak of DOOM's garish neon hellscape in the aesthetics. The common thread between them all is the frantic, brutal combat. Initially it overloads your system and rockets past you, leaving you trying to make sense of it all while a demon casually caves your skull in for the nth time; \u00a0but then something clicks, the seconds start to stretch themselves thinner, pathways through the hordes of enemies begin to reveal themselves, and moments of clarity where your reticule and target align present themselves.\n\nThese games all have a rhythm: Hotline Miami came in attenuated seconds of mapping out rough pathways through the carnage, instinctively anticipating the ebb and flow of combat, punctuated by staccato bursts of hyperviolence. DOOM is a screeching engine barely holding onto it's frame as you flay enemies and run circles around them, knowing you're fine as long as you're meting out more punishment than you're taking. Devil Daggers is maybe the most intricate of them all, the bursts of your weapon and careful weaving around and under enemies forming a sort of hellish ballet. Tormentor X Punisher is more brutish than any of them, and more unforgiving; it relies on randomization more then the others; enemies spawn in different places and bosses appear in different orders. In this way, it's more like roguelites like The Binding of Isaac and Enter the Gungeon.\n\nYou quickly lose a sense of what to expect from each new round, making each one truly chaotic in ways that more closely curated games can't be. This works both for and against the game. Because you never know exactly what to expect, you never feel entirely prepared, and death is just as likely to come from a boss ability you don't understand as it is from a legitimate mistake. Tormentor X Punisher is a chaotic game to begin with, with enemies swarming you from every side and projectiles flying in from offscreen, and when it introduces a new hazard or boss it borders on unmanageable. As bracing as it is to lose yourself in the moment-to-moment carnage and rely purely on twitch reflexes, that's not enough to get you very far on the leaderboards. For that, you'll need to learn earn upgrades for \"creative kills\" (think trick shots like bouncing bullets off walls) and memorize boss patterns. The problem is that you're provided very little space to figure any of this out; normal enemies are invariably crawling down your throat by the time bosses spawn, leaving you with scant seconds to decipher how to eliminate them, all while fending off attacks on all fronts. The same goes for the special moves, many of which are well-hidden and, aside from a few, difficult to pull off with any regularity. In ways, feels like the game is intentionally hiding parts of itself from you. Though the mechanics do allow for a certain level of strategy, many of them are buried under a layer of unrelenting difficulty that most players will struggle to overcome.\n\nThe presentation, meanwhile, is fantastic throughout. For all its bluster and gore and profanity (you'll hear \"fuck\" approximately 3-4 four times a second), it's about as offensive as an 8-year-old who just learned to swear. I don't mean that as a criticism - if anything, it's endearing, and reveals a canny intelligence you might not expect from a game like Tormentor X Punisher. The voice acting is excellent, too; the demons snivel and whine and gloat over your corpse with all the bile you'd expect, and the heroine sounds positively unhinged - you can basically hear the chords in her neck standing out with every line, and see her bloodshot eyes bulging. It's in these smaller touches that you start to appreciate the care that went into Tormentor X Punisher. It's not an ambitious game, and it never reaches the virtuosic heights of it's inspirations, but the limited scope allowed its team to hone in on a something specific and execute it with precision.\u00a0Tormentor X Punisher is brutal, chaotic, too difficult for it's own good, and hard to put down.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025034579", "last_played": 1499727407, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 533, "playtime_forever": 440}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1499719317, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506184", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499719317, "recommendationid": "33440307", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[b]Overview:[/b]\n\nTormentor X Punisher is a fast paced one hit kill arena massacre.
