There is some action with the racing, and a lot of strategy. You try and pick the best horses to ride out of the entries you're offered in a race. Are they bred for the distance? Well bred with a graded winner in their pedigree? Compare their stats and consider their running style. Then try for the best finish possible when you ride in the race, and the strategy continues based on your running style, how the pace unfolds, getting the right position, and timing your moves right.\n\nLike in the same dev's Starters Orders 6, the racing is pretty good for a game. It comes down to the horse, and they all have their own running styles, pace, and stamina; the right position, and the right timing can help; and you can't really do stupid things you could do in old riding games like hard blocking and checking your way to an easy win.\n\nAlso like SO6, there are tracks similar to real life tracks around the world like Meydan in Dubai.\n\n[url=https://youtu.be/bhohlZC3m-8]https://youtu.be/bhohlZC3m-8[/url]\n\nIt doesn't have a lot in presentation. There are no frills, not even background music. Even in auto racing games, I like a lot of visual and audio feedback, and a decent soundtrack. So, points off for that. But it is what it is. Personally I used it to pass time between races and some handicapping on opening day at Del Mar, and was looking forward to riding some winners in Jockey Rush. There is also a Battle Mode where jockeys freely kick and punch eachother. Stewards inquiry!
