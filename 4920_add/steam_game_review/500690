Why he has to sneak like that? Why not just boldly step into their homes and be warmly welcomed? Well, that's just the weird Finnish way.\n\nAnyhow, this becomes the idea behind [i]Secret Santa[/i]. Children and sometimes adults are on the look out to catch [i]Santa[/i] while he sneaks to the Christmas tree, leaves his gifts and sneaks back to the chimney.\n\n[h1]Mission Christmas tree[/h1]\n\nEach level starts and ends at the chimney. Santa has to find his way to the Christmas tree while avoiding any \"guards\" like children, gun-wielding elderly and dogs, and traps like bear traps and effing mines and lasers. Santa gets three doses of sleep powder to take out guards to add some tactics to the party.\n\nBonus points (and an achievement) can be got by also feasting on all the cookies and eggnog you can find, usually hiding behind an additional set of traps and guards.\n\nAs a funny detail, the levels are children on \"Nice lists\" and \"Naughty lists\" etc. Nice people's houses are (quite logically) the easy levels and the naughtier they get, the more traps and guards there are. Also, as a nice detail the naughty children surely don't get presents. Finally, you even get to play as Krampus, with his own powers!\n\nIn a way the easy and medium levels act as organic tutorials, introducing new mechanics and traps. The level design is good and diverse. Everything is deterministic, if not always synchronized, rendering the levels into kind of stealth puzzles, especially once the freaking murderers appear.\n\n[h1]Technically simplistic[/h1]\n\nWhile the game is good, its options are limited. The controls are arrow keys and space (for action) but they cannot be changed. There appears to be no controller support currently. Aspect ratio can be changed conveniently at any time but otherwise there are no resolution options or option to go windowed mode or adjust volume settings.\n\nAs for gameplay, my only qualm are the clumsy, unreliable hitboxes. The game appears to use two different kinds of hitboxes, ones for stationary traps and ones for guards with sight. The stationary traps were okay: you hit the trap if your shadow directly under you hits it so that's logical.\n\nHowever the guards, with their various lines of sight, would sometimes notice Santa even just seeing a tip of his hat. I felt it didn't make sense much as it surely looked like they wouldn't notice him. It could be even rage-inducing at times to lose a level repeatedly through such shenanigans.\n\nA word on the music, I'm sure you are not surprised that it's a bunch of remixed Christmas tunes. A pleasant soundtrack, it's not fancy but it works.\n\n[h1]Merry Gear Solid vs. Secret Santa[/h1]\n\nThere was a short-lived controversy in the discussions about the similarities between Merry Gear Solid (MGS) and this title (SS). Having checked some videos of that game, they share the idea but MGS is a full-blown puzzle game with a story, while this is more like a casual arcade stealth game.\n\nGameplay is quite different between the titles, MGS having and using special items in a single house while SS having individual houses with the idea \"get in, do the thing, get out\".\n\nBesides, the devs of [i]Secret Santa[/i] even credit MGS devs, so I think they are alright.\n\n[h1]Conclusions[/h1]\n\nI beat the whole game in 1.5 hours. Was it worth it? I think it has just enough content for the full (anyway cheap) price. It's fun though not exactly relaxing (considering the annoying hitboxes). Also, for once I completed a seasonally fitting game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001046455", "last_played": 1483277733, "num_reviews": 135, "num_games_owned": 7088, "playtime_forever": 96}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1480794939, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522530", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1480794964, "recommendationid": "28168706", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game will make you jump!
