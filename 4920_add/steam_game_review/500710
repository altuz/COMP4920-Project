As much I want to say that this is 100% great there are some flaws. I researched for about 10 mins when I bought it and while playing it there is very little info about the game. Most of the forums barely say anything and most of the wiki is brand spanking new. This is hardcore at best. Think of Force of Nature mixed with Rust.  Ive played this since saturday evening, changed servers twice. The first 3 hours I was aimlessly trying to gather stuff. I stared to build the first tier structures to enclose my base. Not knowing that I had to do the second tier because the first tier other players can easly get your gear. Think of thatch foundations for Ark. I notice that the spawn rates are very scarce. I had to look for coal, trees, and clay when I need to look for them and little to find but when i didnt i could find them everywhere. \n\nEarly Access 9/27/17 Flaws - May change \n1. Browser based game. (I dont hate browser based games but when I have played this for at least three minutes the borders of the game would flicker and cover the moniter. OCD makes me twitch a little. If I catch up to the black parts the game seems to lag and force me to stop.  \n\n2. Spawn Rates to need to be increase. Not saying from 1.0 to 5.0% just add a comfortable amount. Not sure the issue of whether the game is about player economy where you have to plant trees. If thats true, make saplings more accessible. \n\n3. Players in Survival Games - Only games I have ever had issues with people being rude and not friendly were Rust, and Reign of Kings. This game \"WTO\" noone talks and they wait for you to log off for the night or work the next day and they raid your base. Literally, inches away from other nodes to gather, they rather steal from you. Im really not sure about this game and the toxicity of the player base. This even happened on a pve server in the safer zones. To gain more playerbase make offline raiding harder like adding turrets or let your mounts be about to attack players. I could make more design for this if needed. (Email me Devs)\n\n4. Combat - Very little - For the week I have played, I had full bronze gear and have died to everything from a young fox to Big Bear. I understand this game is based on \"skill\" leveling and not more of a \"stat\" leveling like Diablo. You can have 1 mil strength and not be any stronger from the beginning. Ive checked all the updates from the devs and nothing about this system give any clarity. \n\n5. (a) GodSend / (b) Fragments/ (c) Items from the Cashshops - This game is not pay to win - now the game is still being developed and has a year or two of implementing new concepts and twinking to making the game more polish, not sure how big the dev team is but need to make your road map more clear. We the players need more incentive to play the game not saying to give us things but allow us to know what you are working on. You dont have to have big milestones but let us know whats coming to game and what bugs you guys need us to report. \n\n(a). GodSend's (c) CashShop - This feature has saved me from death and helped me gear my character. The game doesnt really give much description on what workstation does. Ive spent alot of time trying to learn how to make an effective bronze ingot. This should be easy to learn. I understand you guys are making dungeons and caves in the near futures so I cant complain much about the loot system.  I love it. Keep making more items to do this. This also allows players to gain items from the cash shop without paying. Ive gotten Premiums twice, and got 1 bronze key with two Bronze chests and Iron chest. Its accessible. This should be mention in any debate that the cash shop is pay 2 conveince. You can pay to get something now and not have to play the game or play and not pay and learn to get those items for free from money but pay in time. \n\n(b) Fragments - This is cool system, but where does it tell you how many you collect makes it to become a reciepe nothing online tells me that theres a hotkey to find the list of fragments youve encounter and click on the reciepe to learn known receipe. Or does it automatically implement in the crafting/building skill. \n\nOkay guys this is the flaws I love to hate. Please read to the end to get my final opinon of the game. With all these flaws the game seems pretty complete. It really just needs the player population to increase and polish, polish, polish. I rather play it through unity or udk, but from my experiences of making games myself you build your game on what you can do. Keep up the good work Devs and Ill be patient to see whats to come. The game is more about hardcore patience.

But its also playable as it is now. Yes, the graphic might be a bit rough around the edges, but the gameplay is very promising.\n\nI like that you can build your own castle (Eventually), and that its not just something you do in a day. You can do it on your own, but i guess it will help to have friends on the server. \n\nThere is no in-game map, but you will eventually now your way around, even though the map is huge.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 233, "steamid": "76561197996984386", "last_played": 1506932039, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_forever": 1316}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506023015, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506023015, "recommendationid": "35112384", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
