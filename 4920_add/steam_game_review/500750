I can definitely say that GI Racing 2.0 has many improvemnets, the controls seem very fluid and the core game mechanics are in place. The GUI is very user friendly and has a great UX for the players. I will enjoy playing this game the more it grows and look forward to see what the future holds for it. Great Work Guys. I highly recommend this game if you fancy burning some rubber around some visually stunning tracks to satisfy your urge for speeding around the raceway at almost 200mph.. NICE!\n\nKeep up the good work.

The actual sound from the Holden exhaust is really bad and that needs fixing, also the game is not smooth to play, i would like to see better sponsor names on the cars and billboards, your main sponsor is Supercheap Auto so just rename that to Specialcheap auto and it will look better then Maxvalue auto, and do the same with the sponsorship names on the cars as they look odd, also you need to allow players to do car setups in the garage, and what about pit stops they are a major part in V8 Supercars racing, and the other thing is the crowd especially on the top of Mount Panorama (Bathurst) you must show the crowd and certain areas on the top of the mountain is Holden fans and other areas have Ford fans and they show their Flags with the Holden and Ford emblems. The graphics in this game is very poor for even early access stage, I think that you need to really improve the graphics asap, because you don\u2019t show any high quality anywhere in the game. If these things can be fixed, edited and added what I mentioned above I think you will start getting a lot more people buying early access and the word of mouth will be positive reaction about this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027649302", "last_played": 1503741099, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 182, "playtime_forever": 571}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1483336467, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501217", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1483336467, "recommendationid": "28929280", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I like it quite a lot, it's a bit more simulation than the Forza's while still being quite fun with a controller.\n\nIt has its issues like my i5 6400 w/rx480 has some stuttering in the highest graphics setting while at the beautiful setting it runs almost as well on my Phenom II 955 w/R9 285...which makes no sense at all but it is Unity based so I guess it may have something to do with that....maybe.... (or Win X vs. Win 7...)\n\nIt sometimes seem to go a tad berserk with sensitivity but that may be me not used to the game and therefore flooring it a tad too much, not sure it's just something I've noticed occassionally but it has always happened by making you over compensate after a straight and not while in/entering it so it may be me doing something wrong due to not being used to the game.\n\nPhysics when hitting the wall may have the car leaning against in on two wheels, very far from actual physics as you'd either flip the car or drive it down again....\n\nSo far it may seem like I'm only complaining but those are my complaintzs and one may be me, one's easily fixed by lowering graphics and you can't reaally tell the difference TBH and the last can easily be fixed by a patch...and (again) TBH, if it happens it's really due to the gamer screwing up the corner...\n\nIt is a nice racing game I'm quite a big fan of the Flatout's and Rally trophy (both made by Bugbear) but I'd say this is better than Wreckfest, it's a more complete game, it has a lot better interface and if you were to ask me which to buy I'd tell you to go for this one unless your desire is to go off the course and smash things this is the better game ass it stands. (and I do hope they'll keep on developing it, it's not that it absolutely craves an update but I did have to lower my sensitivity to 10-15% which means the base setting's waaaay too high)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198138101163", "last_played": 1491240023, "num_reviews": 81, "num_games_owned": 150, "playtime_forever": 156}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1488567363, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491769", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1488567363, "recommendationid": "30299891", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Old school racing aesthetics with modern graphics appeal.\n\nI had trouble with the joystick control at first due to the sensitivity of the sticks, but that was fixed in the patch.\n\nReally like the feel of driving the cars and the immersive feeling I got when driving in the rain.\n\nI think the development team is 'spot on' with responding to feedback and addressing the early access issues as they come up.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992914349", "last_played": 1470074922, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 45}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1473001489, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1473001522, "recommendationid": "25347430", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
