I've played a bunch of hidden object games, some have excellent voice acting and somewhat interesting and immersive stories.  Riddles of the Past is not one of these games.  The voice acting and syncing is bizarre and offputting, but thankfully it's all over in easily under 2 hours.  The puzzles were 95% insultingly simple and 5% tedious and/or difficult to understand.  There is a lot of moving around in this game, moving from one scene to another, which I don't mind but others may find irritating.  The most annoying thing of all is that they refer to American football as soccer, when clearly the images are of a football player.  If the game is on a sale, it's not a bad way to kill two hours, but there are definitely better games in the genre out there.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 113, "steamid": "76561198084995982", "last_played": 1506527534, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 362, "playtime_forever": 113}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506527779, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506527779, "recommendationid": "35244331", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
