To my surprise I got a response in a couple hours which was around 5 or 6 am PST. The devs fixed the problem right away and thats a really good sign in of itself.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nThis game is an absolute blast. The obvious influence being \"Snake\" (although the real OG's remember nibbles) which we all know to be an addicting and sometimes maddeningly frustrating experience of \"gotta get the highscore.. one more time.. DAMMIT... ok last one...\"\n\nTails does this ^. And it does it well. \n\nMy 1.1 hours of play was supposed to be 5 minutes to check if the update worked to fix the launch problem... its approaching 3am now and I've been at work in a hot kitchen for 9 hours before coming home.. The last thing I wanted to do was stand and move around... Now i'm sweating profusly and this water bottle doesn't hold enough water. So why didn't I just see it worked and then stop?\n\nBecause Tails is extremely satisfying. It's like a snickers bar it's so satisfying.\n\nThe movement is so smooth. It just feels right. Its kinda hard to explain how it feels so here's some video of me playing to make things a little more clear.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/W8OpvZb2Al4?t=2m43s\n\n\nIt's not perfect. The sound needs a little work here and there. The first \"main menu\" with the tutorial and start game options scared me for a second because it was pretty blurry and not so great - but the actual graphics in game are very nice and crisp. The \"powerup\" needs to be reworked graphically imo. Small things that NO DOUBT will be addressed quickly if they continue to have a dialogue with players. \n\nSuper stoked to add it to my collection. I'll be playing alot I can tell.\n\n\nedit: \n\ntldr: The game is great, much fun, absolutely worth $7.99, devs seem invested and I should probably be in Rio right now.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197967050137", "last_played": 1475541771, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 193, "playtime_forever": 112}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1470823727, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514039", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1470825444, "recommendationid": "24807650", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Really enjoying this game so far!  I haven't played much yet, but I can see myself getting way into this game.  It's a very simple game but it's super addictive.  It also makes full use of room scale.  Plus it looks great in VR!  Very pretty setting and the dragon looks awesome.\n\nOne thing I would like to see is a global leaderboard (I don't think this exists in the game yet?).  Also a daily global leaderboard would be really cool, similar to what ZenBlade does.  Other than that, I really don't have any suggestions!\n\nMy other favorite games for the Vive right now are ZenBlade and QuiVR, also the Lab.
