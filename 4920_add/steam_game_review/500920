Some times the screen just goes black because you\n\"skated\" across some glitch-wall or something in the middle of a room.\n\nAs for the purpose of the game?\nWell, you walk around said apartment.\nIt has a kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom and a small sideroom - all connected by a tiny corridor.\nWithin that space there are a bunch of rabbits. Some are out in plain sight, others are tiny and hidden so you\ncan't really see them unless you shrink yourself first. To do that, just pick up one of the dozen small dices littered across\nthe place.\n\nThen you just get close to a bunny and click on it to make it vanish.\nWhich is also the only sound you'll ever hear in the game besides the monotone music\nand a narrator that pops in with a small line here and there as you collect\nmore bunnies.\nThrowing furniture, dishes and other objects around does not make any sound at all.\n\nAll in all, it just feels glitchy and amateurish.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198003292839", "last_played": 1468314817, "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 458, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 35, "timestamp_created": 1468321549, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567636", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1468321549, "recommendationid": "24272240", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Beautiful visuals.
