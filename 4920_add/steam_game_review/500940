This game will offer you extreme satisfaction when you get past those little hurdles that have killed you and made you start the level over.. but it will also cause you to wanna smack yourself in the head when you goof up and get \"kilt\" (killed), especially when you almost had that darn level beat!  You'll find yourself wanting to keep playing it over and over and over because it does have that addictive quality because no death feels \"cheap\" and you know that there's always a way to get past every hurdle.\n\nHere is my livestream gameplay and review video...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PJpcosLhl8\n\nI scored this game at an impressive 88% score using my unique indie game scoring system I always use when I review this games with my first impressions reviews.

It pretty much looks like a old School Boulder Dash and is also that kind of \"hard\" in the difficult.\n\nThe problem i had with it are mostly 2 which makes it kinda not enjoyable, for me at least...\n\nI am a very big fan from the \"original\" Boulder Desh series beginning on the C64 back at 1984 and played a lot remakes, clones and like (look for my steam review here for the Boulder Dash Steam version if you dont trust me in that case...). This game here tried \"hard\" to come \"as close as it could be\" to the original Boulder Dash. The problem is that the controls are very very clunky.\n\nI know, a lot people would complain now and say \"BUT BOULDER DASH WAS CLUNKY AND HAD A GRID MOVEMENT!\".\n1. I know that.\n2. I mean not \"clunky\" by Boulder Dash standarts, this game has controls were the character dont act right. I often pressed ctrl + any movement button (the character should stay still and i only should be able to dig one gird next to me by doing this) to dig only a bit forward but the character still moved forward, i holded my ctrl button already so deep on my keyboard, [b]I nearly destroyed my left ctrl button.[/b]\n\nNext to this it feels not only very clunky, the character self is just...a...\"blob\"? I guess? I mean i like kinda everything from the \"artstyle\" of this game but why is the character you play a blob? I mean, come on, a little figur or something \"like\" Rockford would at least be nice but a simple blob?\n\n[h1]So is it worth it?[/h1]\nI hardly say, NO, for now. Its not like its to hard or to difficult (hey its old school hard and thats nice.) but if i srs nearly destroyed my left ctrl button only that the character does not react in the right way and i still move forward and normaly shouldnt, i can hardly recomment it. The controls should be more \"fluent\" to be honest, even for a simple Boulder Dash clone /- Standart. It gives a lot free Boulder Dash Clones out there which did it right with the controls, maybe you should take a look around.\n\nEDIT: Just to add this part, for me its not important how a game looks at least if i can see the effort or it doesnt hurt in the eyes or something like but it should have good controls which are in this case very very clunky.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038310096", "last_played": 1489444297, "num_reviews": 158, "num_games_owned": 612, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1489445107, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1489699659, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498187", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1489445556, "developer_response": "W.A. the Anum,\n\nThank you for your review and your extensive feedback!\n\n\n[h1] CTRL key issue [/h1]\n\nWhile the left or the right CTRL key is pressed, it is impossible for the character to move, unless your keyboard is broken :D\n\nHowever, depending on your frame rate and the exact moment you press/release the CTRL key, it is possible that the keyboard buffer isn't empty at the moment you release the CTRL key, which results in the game processing the remaining buffer entries and making the character move.\nYou can easily reproduce this issue by holding down the CTRL key and release it while hammering on all four arrow keys simultaneously.\n\nI fixed the bug by flushing the keyboard buffer every time you press a valid key, and uploaded a new version. Enjoy, and thank you again for reporting this bug!\n\n\n[h1] Character [/h1]\nWe feel sorry that you don't like the blob, which is actually a little slime ball, but there is a story behind this blob, which is revealed after solving the final cave.\nIf you don't like the blob, feel free to replace it with any 32x32 tile you like. The tile graphics file is not encrypted and can be modified as you please. You can also modify all other tiles like rocks, gems, monsters, soil, walls etc.\n\n\nHave fun,\nPSY\nPSY LABS", "recommendationid": "30498489", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "i brought this game - soo far excellent but the line that sold this game \"must be OLD to enjoy this\"\n\nwell you dont have to be old but if you are old enough to remember boulderdash and rockford then you will love this - this is a pretty good homage to this classic genre and so far it hasnt disappointed", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "steamid": "76561198326023938", "last_played": 1506634533, "num_reviews": 77, "num_games_owned": 192, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506416487, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506416594, "recommendationid": "35218276", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
