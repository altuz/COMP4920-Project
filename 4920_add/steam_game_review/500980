Still found a couple of bugs? \n\nBuying this for Multiplayer, WAIT! Don't buy this unless you have friends to play with. If you want a single player game where you can just mindless shoot at things after learning the map and icons go for it. It's not that bad single player wise and I can actually say I was having fun in it as apposed to last time when NOTHING happened now things are happening. \n\nSeeing as its selling both Single and Multi for full price I'm going to say No still because you're paying full price and only getting Single unless as I said above, friends. If they take out Multi-player and work on that out of  the game and lower the price by 1-2 USD I would say yes to this game.\n\nTLDR; Unless you have friends don't buy for multi no one, not enough playing. Single player can be fun. No Options menu in game but has small window one prior to game booting. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI hope the dev(s) listen to people.\n\nI bought this game because it was an FPS and well I suck at FPS but I like to mess with them from time to time. When you load you have it windowed to your set specs or fullscreened. When you get into the game you're greeted by a 4 button menu (Single Player, Multiplayer, Options and Exit) now only two work can you guess which two? \n\nFirst thing I noticed in the game is yes I got a great FPS count (60+) but the second I swung my mouse to look about I felt like my mouse had become a snail. Moving around was smooth and quick but rotating your character was annoying unless you were away from the buildings and moving. For some reason when I wasn't near the buildings and/or sprinting my mouse was bland to rotating and looking behind me. (If you guessed the Option menu was working you'd be wrong) The mouse sensitivity needs addressing, I'm in the states and I've played with people in Europe and Asia before on their servers. Yes ping can cause LAG but it has nothing to do with the sensitivity of the mouse. \n\n\"Realistic setting\" doesn't have invisible walls, ladders you cannot climb, and fences higher than you that you can jump with one jump. \n\nWhat you should have done is give away about 50-100 keys to people who wanted to alpha/Beta test this game that live all over the world with all different computer specs. Then make a closed group here on steam for people to be invited to that get a key and they post their feedback on what needs to be taken out or put into the game, bugs they find and how they feel it runs. I've done this for a number of games, I browse the upcoming and sim the discussions to see if the dev is looking for testers. 50/50 do I see an indie dev doing this. \n\nYes it was 3:30a and I was the only person playing so I have no idea if my FPS would drop under 60 if there were more people actually playing and shooting all around. \n\nAlso PLEASE do not ask people for their areas to put them into the game before there is even an Option section working in game. I know a lot of left handers have gotten used to gaming like a right hander but key binds need to be something in the game as does FOV and Mouse sensitivity.\n\n\nTL;DR - If you want to check this game out buy it play it and thank god for steam refunds if things dont get sorted.\n---Reviewed on Aug 14--- (Putting date in on chance of updates and I don't get around to updating this in a timely manner if I still own the game)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198055755751", "last_played": 1477999005, "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 1676, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1471168598, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519172", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1477999588, "recommendationid": "24907771", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The fact that the servers work is the only Positive thing.

If you take a look on their Greenlight page, you can see footage of a lot more assets than what is actually in the program. The bottom line: this should not be in Early Access at this stage. \n\nThe only available option right now is a multiplayer function with four maps. I could not locate any rooms, but I could create a room. Each map is populated with buildings and invisible walls. Four characters are present with their own weapon. This is pretty much it. \n\nThis is another example of releasing sooner than recommended. It is a proof of concept in the most lenient form of the definition. The only options are defaulted into the the engine launcher (my guess is it is using Unity 5) and the in-game menu only allows you to select a new character. You basically have to use Z to close back to the main menu, which is not even explained in the post made by the developer to explain the controls (not mentioned or listed in-game). This is not ready for Early Access or even Greenlight for that matter. I am saying this not only as a consumer, but also as a reviewer: avoid this. \n\nThis has been another EAW PSA.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000561257", "last_played": 1477513973, "num_reviews": 87, "num_games_owned": 2901, "playtime_forever": 143}, "votes_up": 17, "timestamp_created": 1471230325, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512069", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1471230471, "recommendationid": "24925831", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "An online multiplayer game with no players...\n\nAbsolute trash 0/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063048114", "last_played": 1480548198, "num_reviews": 540, "num_games_owned": 2799, "playtime_forever": 160}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1480548546, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480047", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1480548546, "recommendationid": "28109036", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "is ok for them to copy cs go \n1. the graphic of this game suck\n2. you cannot even join single player\n3. multiplayer do not have any match, so u buy this game standing there just daydreaming\ni prefer you to buy cs go more than this fking ass game\nhttps://youtu.be/yQ0RJHK_vl0", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198276850477", "last_played": 1471181562, "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1471183097, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450139", "votes_down": 27, "timestamp_updated": 1471183097, "recommendationid": "24911822", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "this game is dead theres no work being done and no proof that there is work being done there are no players on any of the servers so go spend your money somwhere on something you will enjoy", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198144448736", "last_played": 1497295854, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1501105689, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501105689, "recommendationid": "33818532", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
