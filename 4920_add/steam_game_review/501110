Honestly, this is a fun and challenging game.  And there's a surprising amount of content here, believe it or not.  There's several drop points, each with different paths, which means there's many jumps/vistas to do and scores to chase.  Granted, I haven't been able to get past the second drop point after playing for 30 minutes.\n\nThe main things I don't like about this game are the controls and the lack of a good tutorial.  Also, the difficulty spike is quite large between the first drop zone and the second drop zone.  The graphics are good, but not great.  And for whatever reason, I didn' feel fully immersed when flying.  \n\nI think part of the reason is because you have to look down or up to control your flight up and down horizontally, meanwhile you're standing up vertically (you can also do seated, but bleh on that).  Also you neck will start feeling some strain after a while with the current setup.  Why couldn't gliding up or down have been controlled using the motion controllers?  Easy solution is to make a slight twist of the wrists for up or down (like an eagle would use it wings or plane using its flaps).  That way you can look around wherever you want free from the motion.  You're already using your arms to control side movements.\n\nStill, I enjoyed playing this game.  I think it's fun if you can ignore the above issues.  Just wish the above issues were fixed so that more time could be spent enjoying the game versus being frustrated.  Also it would be nice if there was a relaxed, \"guided\" option, meaning much easier jumps to just enjoy the views and feeling of flight with no score.\n\nRating 7/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1503767767, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 30}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503768750, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503768889, "recommendationid": "34510264", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pretty cool Vive controller implementation where you actually feel like you're flying the wingsuit, but it takes a while to figure out how to gain control.

This is everything I wanted in a VR simulation. I set a fan in front of me and I'm good to go. Plenty of things to do, lots to exp[lore, and upgraded wing suits to unlock.  Great sounds, look and feel to the game playing on HTC Vive and standing, I have my VR legs and love scary rides in RL so this didn't bother me one bit, what a great feeling of flight. Didn't take long for me to get control, but is challenging enough with gaps and tunnels, etc. to aim/search for. I can see many hours of gameplay with this title, I've had it on my wish list for a little while and was able to grab it on sale for there 1 year anniversary and I am not dissapointed, would have easily paid full price earlier if I had known it was really this much fun, 2D Youtube videos of most VR games never really do them too much justice because it is hard to try and picture what it is like in VR  until you try it. Just get this game if you ever wanted to soar like a flying squirel down some mountainside cliffs and such, and you have the stomach for it :P Get this game now!\nPS. to the developers: It would be cool to be able to change the color of your smoke, just a thought, or perhaps even different types of \"trails\", like fire, or snow, etc. :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "steamid": "76561198348017757", "last_played": 1506002422, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 67, "playtime_forever": 636}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503757623, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503758251, "recommendationid": "34506112", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I am having an incredibly fun time with this game.
