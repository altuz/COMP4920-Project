That's what makes this a positive review. After some work, I could see this being expanded into a good full game.\n\nI spend most of the time playing either fighting skeletons or teleporting around, looking for gems. I liked how the gems were hidden about, so exploration was needed if you wanted to collect everything. \n\nThe combat system was fun. Admittedly the 'blocked' and 'great' signs broke immersion a bit. Maybe it could be done by sound effects instead. A loud clunk on the shield or the sound of a sword cutting through the air quickly. Strong vibration when blocking perhaps. Something more immersive. \n\nI did run into a few issues. I once teleported, looked back and found what looked like a cave exit to the blue sky approximately where the door I entered was. It should've been another cave. \n\nSword tracking is iffy at times. Sometimes it wandered off course because it should have - it was colliding with my shield, the ground, etc. Sometimes it just did for no reason.\n\nWhen changing areas, I went back to my 'home' screen for a couple of seconds. I'm told this happens when the game can't run smoothly enough to stop motion sickness. I have an i7 5280K and a GTX 1080. It shouldn't be happening from an area change.\n\nOverall, I recommend it as a fun diversion that has potential. I wouldn't pay money for it as it stands, but perhaps if the issues are all fixed and it's expanded into a several hour experience.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025804303", "last_played": 1485079770, "num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 1051, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1485025045, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504164", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485025045, "recommendationid": "29404805", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[h1]Poor performance, poor collision, dull combat... but shows promise.[/h1]\n\nOkay, so the game is short.  It took me two tries because the game has some glitches, but in one go, I managed to escape the dungeon in under 50 minutes.  For a free game, this isn't really bad at all.  However, it's episodic, and it's not done.  If you play this, be aware of the fact that all you're doing is getting from point a to point b in a dungeon environment.  At the very end, the game teases you with an outside level only to tell you how long you played and say it's to be continued later.\n\nThe gem collectibles are a nice touch.  I like those.  I also like the water effects and sound effects.  Good work there.  The game's environments and character/weapon models are very realistic and believable for the most part.  I hope the dev continues making such beautiful experiences.\n\nThe visuals are stunning, but you may not appreciate them since the game is too demanding for a decent framerate.  That said, I'm not on the most awesome gaming computer I could want, and this game may run better on Intel processors or something with a higher clock speed.  Regardless, I think it could be optimized a lot more.\n\nThe physics are weird in the sense that they sometimes exist but other times... not so much.  After playing for just 8 minutes, I fell through the ground upon teleporting 3 feet.  That was after experiencing a skeleton running through walls and a rock wall needing a key (like a door but not a door) but not being able to pick up the key until I had a sword.  You pick up items with the tip of your sword by the way. That makes you wonder why we don't start with the sword and shield already equipped.\n\nCombat is boring and sometimes frustrating. I can wave my sword inside a skeleton all I want and it won't register as a hit half the time.  I can just block forever with the shield and wave the sword back and forth and I can beat the skeletons without thinking.  The only headache is waiting for the sword collision to happen.  That and I need a much larger space to be able to lunge my sword forward.  The Steam page says it supports \"Standing\" mode, so perhaps the dev could implement an extra movement method?  I didn't find anything other than the teleport option, and when I teleport, it lets the skeletons hit me through the shield.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997801929", "last_played": 1486687006, "num_reviews": 246, "num_games_owned": 1030, "playtime_forever": 63}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1486680767, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490196", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1486687259, "recommendationid": "29811821", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I like the concept of the game so far but here are my pros and cons of my experience with it.\n\nPros:\n-Enviorenment Looks very good and polished\n-I like the enemies so far and that they have a very large and visible health bar.\n-sound effects are great\n\nCons: \n-Combat feels floaty, it doesnt feel natural.
