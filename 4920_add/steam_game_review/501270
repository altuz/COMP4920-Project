So nice I bought it twice.\n\nThis is a unique puzzle game combining a mutated form of Tetris with tower defense.  It has a great personality that will make you smile, and it's $10 right now.  If you're one of those unfortunate souls that paid $60 to preorder No Man's Sky, here's your chance to redeem yourself.  \n\nGameplay:  Here we have Tetris with enemies, a story, and more freedom.  The game eases you into the concept and mechanics without coddling you.  The controls are easy and intuitive enough, freeing you up to master the game.  Once you are confident that your base can handle the waves of monsters, you can fast forward which is a nice feature.  The developer obviously took great care to test the game before releasing it on Steam.  All I've found so far is a typo and that you can't change your screen resolution in the settings.  Whoopdie Doo. \n\nGraphics:  Simple but fun.  The visuals are very colorful and almost childlike, but in a good way.  The monsters are very original.  They made me laugh.  \n\nSound:  For me the sound was the most redeeming quality.  The music is great and a perfect fit for this game.  The sound effects seem to be vocal, as in someone made them with their mouth a la Michael Winslow from Police Academy and ran them through effects.  They're awesome.  The menu item select sound effect will take you back to your childhood.  The developer clearly played a lot of console in the 90's.\n\nContent:  The dialogue is funny and well written.  Menubot is adorable.  The story is silly.  The number of planets is limited but will increase.  In our current age of early access where we are getting used to buying games and watching them grow I have no problem with the current level of content.  The game is hard enough as it is with what it has.   \n\nI can drink $10 worth of booze in seconds.  Throw down and support this game.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198075158513", "last_played": 1488764592, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_forever": 51}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1488470912, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1488470912, "recommendationid": "30279974", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "First off - this game is hilarious. All of the little sound effects, and the way that the robots in the intro talk, help give this game a light-hearted, approachable feel right off the bat.\n\nBut man, after the tutorial level, and subsequent first/second planets, this game can get difficult in a hurry. After having played through the first set of 4 planets, I would love to go back and play through in a different order to find an easier path. It kind of reminds me of playing any of the MegaMan games on NES -- the order of which you choose to play the levels is not set, and you could easily debate which path to take for sake of ease or challenge. To help explain this: for each planet you beat, you are then expected to survive 1 night longer on the next planet. So if you survuved 1 night on planet A, you now need to spend 2 nights on planet B. You get to choose the order of A, B, C, and D, but no matter which path you take, the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th nights become more difficult to survive. I barely beat the 4th night.\n\nI enjoyed having to consider the unique obsticles present on each planet, and expirimenting with my base to best suit what was being thrown at me. It could sometimes be a bit overwhelming to search for the proper piece, create stacks of discarded pieces, work to build new bots, and maintain units to fight off the monsters - but that said, it can also be very satisfying to complete a robot's build at the last second, and send the little yellow dudes in to power your stuff and save you from certain death.\n\n\nHonestly, for an Early Access game, this is really fun. I'm interested to see where the developers take this game in the future. I would say money well spent, especially if you like tower defense or puzzle games.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042064499", "last_played": 1487738296, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_forever": 24}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487738310, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496689", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1487738310, "recommendationid": "30092800", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
