In fact it focuses more on the storyline and character development as opposed to an open world sandbox game. The gameplay is still good though. The guns feel fantastic to use and the movement feels smooth and unrestricted. \n\nThe cover system works well, driving takes some getting used to if you're on realistic mode, but it can be a lot more fun that way (snow doriftuuuuuuu lol).\n\nIf you've played shooters before, I recommend starting on the hardest difficulty level available since the easier modes might not be challenging enough. I did experience a few bugs where I got permanently stuck in the slow motion mode, but that is fixed with a restart. Otherwise the game is near flawless and a lot of fun."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505525380, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502577", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34985101", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198328741608", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1505529410, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1277}, "timestamp_updated": 1505525380, "received_for_free": false, "review": "My favorite game"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505632667, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495318", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35016489", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198212696123", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1505632682, "num_games_owned": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 942}, "timestamp_updated": 1505632667, "received_for_free": false, "review": "One of the best games i have ever played,Try this game out you won't be disappointed.\n10/10 would play this again.Very story rich and will give you hell of an experience."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505246529, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495318", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34907687", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214674201", "num_reviews": 52, "last_played": 1483184784, "num_games_owned": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 785}, "timestamp_updated": 1505246529, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I just love old school stuff \n\nplayed through this game twice and I'd say both times were equally as fun.\n\ngameplay is fun but I'm sooo sad that there was no free roam after the last mission.
