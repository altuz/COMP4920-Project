It's got an extreme Zelda/Dark Cloud-like spelunking charm that will transport you to your formulative gaming years as a young child; that excitement you felt the first time you played as Link, broke a boulder and found a loot chest hidden behind it... such a satisfying experience. \n\nVenture Forth is like that same experience, except it's been emboldened. There's a strange, satisfying lull to the depths of the lava cave: hidden nooks and crannies promise ph4t lewtz as a reward should you have the will to fully explore and search all the waters, cracks, and air vents the game lays sprawled out before you, and the upgrade mechanics and the way said mechanics tie into exploration in Venture Forth keeps you constantly wanting to move forward. \n\nEvery upgrade is extremely tangible and the build variety means that there's no real wrong/right/FotM spin-to-win way to win this game--if you want to be an Archer, you can. If you want to be a flame sword-wielding knight, you can. Claymore/Zweihander for cleaving foes in two more your fancy? Venture Forth can scratch that itch as well. And the best thing about the build variety? [b]Each build is completely viable[/b]. You won't be pigeonholed into a sword-and-board or op-as-balls-glass-cannon build in Venture Forth, and in this sandbox-esque class construction is where I draw and give much praise to the game's (re)playability. \n\nAnother mechanic I appreciated was the mapping system. VF uses a mapping system reminiscent of Metal Gear Solid or Rainbow Six. It's a globular, 3d representation of the space you're in and can effectively be brought forth like a hologram at any time. It's slightly confusing for the first 15-30 seconds but once you discern your character's orientation in relation to the rest of the map, you'll have no problem directing your path in no time.\n\nMy only complaint so far is with some hitboxes, especially during enemy skills that involve mobility (like their yellow dash attacks). On some smaller animals like Widowlings and Toothies, it can be incredibly hard to hit them with -anything-, especially if they start chain dashing. The best way to deal with these mobs (that I've found) is to just kite them until they reset, and then come back and rain a few Dragon Arrows on them from any one of your trusty bows.\n\nVenture Forth gets a solid B from me. If it can iron out its hit animations/registry and improve some of the textures and models, I would think it near-flawless and probably toss it an A+. This is one of the better exploration-based ARPGs I've played in a while. \n\n[h1]You won't regret spending 10$ on this if you're a fan of Sandbox RPGs.[/h1]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976104660", "last_played": 1501680329, "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 528, "playtime_forever": 501}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500897025, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499747", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500897111, "recommendationid": "33764155", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
