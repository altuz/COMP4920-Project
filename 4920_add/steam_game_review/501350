{"success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 25, "total_negative": 6, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 19, "review_score": 6}, "reviews": [{"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is almost two different games in one.  There's the free locomotion (joystick or trackpad) experience and there's the on rails experience.  They are obviously, both very different.  With free locomotion, you're able to dodge bullets and get in and out of cover really quickly.  With the on rails experience, I died very fast.  So yeah, I can't say more on the on rails experience :D\n\nEach level is well done.  There's not much of a story that I can tell (except in the store description ... lol nice job dev).  But you have a robot assistant giving you directions on what to do and when powerups are ready and color commentary at times.  You have two almost identical  handguns on each arm and each gun usually has a special ability that you can use.  You have the gravity gun which can grab some objects and then it can be used as a shield or as a deadly weapon when thrown at your enemies.  You also have several other powerups  to your other handgun, including a powershot or chainsaw throw, etc.  You also have a \"bullet time\" ability based on a long timer to help you out in tight situations.  You can also shoot health targets along the way to regain health, although they can be very rare at times.\n\nAt the end of each level, there is a boss fight.  The frustrating thing is that each time you die, you will be starting at the very start of each level.  That frustration is mitigated in part by the fact that the levels are not very long.  And the boss fights usually have a trick to them to beat the boss.  Besides different bosses, each level has a different look and feel with different enemies, terrain, and/or gun abilities.  And as far as the comic book, sin city inspired, art style, you'll either like or not (I liked it myself, made the game stand out).  The guns seemed pretty accurate and on target with me, although since I'm right handed, I found it much easier on my right but you will have to shoot with both hands as accurately as possible.\n\nYou can switch the in-game music between Dance, Alternative, Rock, Epic, or 8-bit (arcade).  You can also set many options on your controls and turning and movement speed.  You can start easy, normal, hard, or nightmare.  I played this is on normal and I am finding it quite the challenge, even with free locomotion.   \n\nFor the current sale price of $11.39, I easily recommend this game.  It's a lot of fun to play.  This \"VR shooter\" definitely has a lot more character than most others.  So you're getting a good value for your money.\n\nRating 7/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 166, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1506738121, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 166}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1506480919, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506481354, "recommendationid": "35234341", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you liked RecRoom's quests, you gonna like this game.

First, this is not an easy game and that's a good thing. \n\nIt's obvious this game was meant to be a rail shooter, so the default locomotion option is the best to go with. They do include other locomotion options but they didn't feel right for the way the levels are implemented. This game is more tactical than your typical point an shoot rail shooter so you have to play smart - dodging shots, using cover, juggling weapons, timing those weapon switches & reloads, learning your enemies attack styles. You start with 2 basic pistols for each hand, and a gravity gun/slow-mo gun on the left hand and as you progress, you unlock alternate weapons that are specific for certain levels and there is a boss battle at the end of each level.\n\nI used the \"traditional\" on rails movement style, on slow (trust me, start slow and get used to the gameplay before speeding up for a greater challenge). It took me a few deaths, to realize that I had to think about my shots and use the environment when possible to my advantage (cover, exploding barrels, making use of the alternate weapons, etc). Also, the guns are not designed to be used in a realistic, down-the-sights way. That was one of my 3 complaints. I like to be really accurate, go for head shots and weak points with my aim, but I found the guns are really bad when using it in a realistic way. What works best, is using the bullet trails as a guide to your aim.  Use both guns for double-damage and align the bullet trails to your target. Reloading also takes a bit of time, so you have to be smart about when to reload. Your guns touch pad area will turn red when it is out of ammo...which reminds me, turn off all the HUD and text in front of your face. There are great audio cues, vibration, and an in-game assistant that all work great at keeping you up to date with health status, reload time, when alternate guns are ready.  Turning off all the HUD stuff, also lets you appreciate the great comic book art style, especially some of the later scenic levels. \n\nMy second complaint, is I would find myself needing to switch to the gravity gun or alternate gun, but there was a delay because you cannot do so, until after the reload transition occurs, which leaves the player very vulnerable. It happened a lot and became a bit annoying (although it did force me to be more tactical and my timing/reloading periods). I do hope, this can be changed, so you can weapon switch mid-reloading (this would cancel, your reload obviously)\n\nMy last complaint, is allowing the user to choose a certain level without having to go through the campaign from the beginning. Level select is something that the devs have stated they are working on. To share with friends and family, this option would be great for the Halloween Season we are in right now.\n\nOverall, I give the game a high recommendation for it's challenging gameplay, art style, & music (which you can change, the thematic style of for each level). It took me about 1 1/2 - 2 hours to beat the game on the easiest setting my first play through. My few minor issues, I hope get addressed with an update soon. If you're up for a challenging, tactical style rail shooter that will keep you busy for a few hours, then get this game!

It\u2019s fun for about an hour, but then you realize that it is the exact same thing over and over again. Every level is get from point A to point B and shoot the same exact enemies. If the enemies have a gun, they stand in place. If they are melee enemies they run at you in a straight line. The guns also have a laser on them so you don\u2019t have to look down the sights at all. You could keep the controller at your hip and still get headshots for days. One thing that really bugged me was the audio. The music was good, but if there was any dialogue the music would fade out almost completely. And noises like guns right next to you or a roaring T-Rex, you would expect a loud noise with deep rumbling bass. Neither of those were present. And when the T-Rex would roar, all other audio would dim way down so all you would hear is this quiet, flat roar. Honestly sounded like the alligator from \u201cRainforest caf\u00e9\u201d if you\u2019ve ever been there back in the day. So, I would only buy it if it were on sale for $5.
