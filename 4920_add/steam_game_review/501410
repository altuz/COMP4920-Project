If S.O.S. had a spirit animal it would be a well hung Rhinocerus. Nothing will prepare you for getting repeatedly impaled by its mighty horn. If you're into this kind of thing then keep reading.\n\nS.O.S. is a callback to the coin op arcade style games of the 80\u2019s, when games were less forgiving and designed by super nerds out to take your lunch money.\n\nThe game's narrative, driven by the stories of a lonely old man kept me feeling like sh*t was about to hit the fan. And ohhhh boy did fans get hit. So just about right for being a secret agent. That being said you will reach save points after each completed mission.\n\nI got vibes of the original Metal Gear and Spy Hunter. The atmosphere, script and gameplay made me feel like I was in an 80\u2019s spy movie and I felt like a secret agent. I did my best to sneak by enemy guard patrols and I killed/subdued enemies when needed. I found it cool how guards patrol their bases with a mix of predetermined and random paths and will react to any suspicious activity. Even when nothing is happening, I felt like the situation could get real bad real quick.\n\nThis game had me on the edge. So get ready player one, because you\u2019re in for a helluva ride.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009897623", "last_played": 1487569262, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 95, "playtime_forever": 338}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1488563011, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515745", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1488563011, "recommendationid": "30298671", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Holy Crap....
