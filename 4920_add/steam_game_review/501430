Tho I was expecting more, for this price, you just can't ask for too much. I will list some Pros and Cons:\nPros:\n*Fun, has a unique style as a space simulation/adventure game.\n*good amoun of replay value, all maps are generated randomly\n*Relaxing & Classic music\n*Multi Language (The Translations are pretty accurate, I am impressed by this since this is a indie game)\nCons/Needs improvements:\n***After playing about 2 hours of this game, I have reached a point where I cannot progress much more (no new stuff)\n*AI not smart enough (especially the setup of the AIs, how come all the AIs have full modification? That makes no sense! Plus why would a trading vessel ai have weapon modification? That makes no sense neither since they don't have weapons anyways)\n***More variation on modifications and ships (Maybe capital ships? more modifications?)\n*Need clear guides, I mean you can either add guides/highlight important guides in game or make a wiki website\n\nLastly, I suggest you do some advertisement ...\nI hope I can see some improvements in the future !\nGood luck!\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198133107890", "last_played": 1469821748, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 20, "playtime_forever": 457}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1469666704, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506698", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1469666704, "recommendationid": "24566137", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I decided to trust this game, and oh boy i'm not disapointed.

If you've played any of those before, expect more of the same but without as much meat as most of them have. The only really notable thing about this game is that it just dumps you straight in front of a planet in your ship with absolutely no background or explanation of anything. If you have played others of this type of trade/fight in space game you'll already know what to do. The problem is that if you have played such a game, it was likely better. If you have not, you'll be dropped straight into the game not knowing what to do. The first screen when you start is literally your ship in front of a planet with panels and buttons for going to the tavern or market and such.

So after being absolutely ruined on my first play through i started again working for the pang gu or whatever they're called. All i can say is this game is definitely worth double what it's currently selling at.\n\nPros: \n-music and sound is really damn nice\n-gameplay is slow paced and relatively easy to learn\n- graphics are cute and suitable for the game\n- i would say 5 hours of gameplay but technically endless due to each game being unique\n\nCons:\n-my only issue with the game is lack of content, so much more could be added but the game is still decent for the price.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to chill and blow stuff up.
