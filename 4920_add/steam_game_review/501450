I love Picross/Nonograms. Workshop support out of the box is incredible, though it will be nice if/when you add more included puzzles.\n\nCouple other bits of feedback: I keep accidentally hitting pieces, usually when they first spawn. Maybe they should be \"invincible\" for a couple seconds? Or maybe only count a hit when hammer velocity is over some threshold? Also I personally would prefer if the switch between hammer and highlight were a toggle instead of holding the trigger, and on that note would be cool if the when highlighting the hammer changed to a marker or something.

I know how much work it takes to create software, even simple things, so don't want to say 'it's not worth that' - but IMO the price is a little high for where this is compared to other VR entries - at this stage. Which isn't to say I didn't find it fun, but I think it needs more fleshing out still. If the price makes you cringe, come back later and see what's changed. If you like Nonograms, and can afford the price then go ahead and check it out, remembering this is early access still.\n\nOne important note is that at this stage, this is more of a community nonogram tool, and less of a premade game. It doesn't currently come with a lot of puzzles - indeed, you get the alphabet. Everything else is from the workshop, of various qualiy. When you finish a set of puzzles, it appears to just start generating random ones. I got one puzzle that I couldn't mark or break the blocks on (but could pick it up); switching which set of puzzles I was doing and coming back didn't fix it.\n\nSome things I think should be fixed in future updates:\n[list]\n    [*] When holding the puzzle, it drifted a little relative to where my (rendered) hand was.\n    [*] Very easy to accidentally hit the puzzle. In a few cases it popped in, and tumbled straight into my hammer.\n    [*] The hammer is too big relative to the blocks - I was finding it too easy to hit ones nearby.\n    [*] There should be a good collection of stock puzzles.\n    [*] I found moving the puzzle around to get to different sides to be awkward, frequently involving me either putting it on the ground to grab it again, or tossing it and grabbing it while it was in the air. I'd much prefer a no-gravity option for unsolved puzzles so I can just let go and it stays where I let go of it.\n    [*] The summon puzzle ability was a little quirky to use, and would get the puzzle stuck to my rendered hand until I grabbed and released it.\n[/list]\n\nAnyways, these are all things that will likely be resolved as the game matures - perhaps not how I envision it, but in some manner.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025082190", "last_played": 1486114512, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 84, "playtime_forever": 85}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1469783145, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.987121", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1469783425, "recommendationid": "24592148", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "lel", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198121307766", "last_played": 1505178716, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 64, "playtime_forever": 211}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1496875549, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1496875549, "recommendationid": "32247574", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
