As an RTS / tactical combat game I'd give it only about 6/10 , gamesplays not bad, but not smooth and not quite tripled A production values.\n\nThe outstanding qualities of this game are the old fashioned story telling, great music and voice acting, about half an hour of excellent in game movies. The setting is medieval / high fantassy and you have one faction that seems to be perfectly pure and good which makes a change from the shades of grey you get in most story telling these days.\n\nWould buy and not be able to play again!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198167667963", "last_played": 1492291291, "num_reviews": 34, "num_games_owned": 154, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 34, "timestamp_created": 1472199835, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559770", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1472199835, "recommendationid": "25157573", "votes_funny": 7, "voted_up": true}]}
