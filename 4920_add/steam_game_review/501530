Fantastic action; satisfying despite the simplicity too (especially the flesh ripper blade gun). The graphics actually fit perfectly with the heavy metal style and general aesthetic as well, rather than seeming contrived. Difficulty (while playing normal) is at a nice level - even trickier levels might take 4/5 attempts and then you can just blow through them, as you would like to with this type of game. One of few games that I can easily see myself returning to play through again and again at the higher difficulties. As a fan of twin-stick shooters (though I use the mouse personally to aim for this game) and action filled FPS games like Doom, Shadow Warrior, Serious Sam, I can very enthusiastically recommend this game. While I don't have too much time put into the game yet, I know I will soon - I really enjoying playing it.\n\nOnly one or two issues with this game for me; the first being very minor: \n1. Some of the less satisfying guns crop up a bit too often for my liking. While a rocket launcher seems fun at first, they end up being somewhat useless due to their only having 10 shots and the first enemies you'll encounter always after acquiring one are a decent handful of things that can be killed with one shot by your basic weapon. Not even really enough of them concentrated together to make that satisfying. But you blow through the 10 rockets so quickly, you can get back to your basic gun and back to normal. Or you could push through those enemies with the flame thrower and get to the tougher enemies with the rocket launcher. I would have liked to have seen them placed in different locations though, or have more of the other guns available.\n\n2. The bosses are far too easy. Their patterns don't get progressively more difficult as you knock their health down (in fact some get easier) and you can wipe their whole health bar within 10 seconds in a lot of cases. Generally though, the level leading up to the boss fight is really enjoyable. In a way that makes up for it, but it also does make the fight itself very disappointing.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198106572812", "last_played": 1503007524, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 441, "playtime_forever": 83}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1503008678, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506763", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503008781, "recommendationid": "34316364", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Awesome sense of humor, Metal as Fvck, and a great arcade game with AWESOME ART!\n\nIf you could find some way to send the protagonist to Sweden, that'd be greaat....", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006517443", "last_played": 1503161319, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 136, "playtime_forever": 10992}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1502502038, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505560", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1502502086, "recommendationid": "34181025", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I love this \"cobblers\" alien invasion and big space marines blasting the crap out of monsters just brilliant!! for \u00a35 brilliant buy to be honest spend more on a \"Sasuage and egg sandwich\" with tomato sauce!! cheers lads and lasses:)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197962397576", "last_played": 1502551201, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 737, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1502480687, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505478", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1502480687, "recommendationid": "34175563", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ikari Warriors + Black Metal + Contra = The Relentless Non-Stop Blood-fueled Psychopathic Fever Dream called SturmFront - The Mutant War: \u00dcbel Edition. \n\nAny attempt to describe it will come out sounding like a word salad drenched in a dressing of gore and gasoline.
