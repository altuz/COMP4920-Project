Very intuitive and feature rich linear video editor. I transitioned from Filmora and Kdenlive and I must say I am pleasantly suprised in every aspect. It has some stability issues, but PROS far outweight the CONS.\n\nPROS:\n+ New user friendly - the program is easy to learn / intuitive and tutorials are easy to find online.\n+ All the features I need for making YouTube videos - as an advanced user I couldn't find anything missing.\n+ Nice integration of AudioDirector (for editing audio) and ColorDirector (filter effects) for perfect workflow (if you bought the bundle).\n+ Good Screen Recording program included with the software (but maximum 30 fps). \n+ Integrated WEBCAM video capture in the program. \n+ There are COUNTLESS usefull video effects, filters, titles, transitions and frames available to freely download from their site and use (many made and shared by the community).\n+ VERY fast rendering compared to other programs.\n+ AFFORDABLE professional editing software (in time of writing this review, the only software on Steam that could compare in quality is VEGAS Pro 14 Edit Steam Edition, but it's much more expensive).\n+ Unlike Adobe Premiere where they rent you the software by monthly subscribtion, here you pay once and is yours - permanently.\n+ Software on Steam is the same as games, so a perpetual license like this means you can redownload and reinstall at any time, while if you buy it on their site, you can redownload only for a year).\n+ If you're like me and have a PC and a laptop, this software can be installed on multiple computers, but you have to have Steam installed and be logged in to use (you also can't use it on both computers at the same time).\n\nCONS:\n- Stability. Here and there the software crashed, but after that it allways perfectly restored the project, so no harm done.\n- Rarely when it crashed, I would get ''Concurrent user sessions are not supported'' error when trying to restart the software, so I had to restart Windows to be able to continue with work (I couldn't find any running process in the task manager, still the program was saying it's allready running) - but even after system restart the project was perfectly restored and I could continue with work normally after that.\n- For some reason videos that are only 1 second long or less are not accepted by the program (not important for most people, but might be if you use it to make gifs and memes).\n- This version doesn't run without Steam (but this is not a big minus for me and is to be expected).\n\nIf you want to see some samples of what can be done with the program, you can check out my YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiv6C6QcOWg&list=PL2akaVJxyy9pMMO1A12otXVe8s9DofStt", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198311055381", "last_played": 1503003170, "num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 1132, "playtime_forever": 19976}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1502742878, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507263", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502784245, "recommendationid": "34243011", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
