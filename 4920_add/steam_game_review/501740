I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any other way to put it. It\u2019s not a bad game, but In its current form, Dropship Down does not do anything worthy of note. It\u2019s a straight-forward wave-based twin-stick shooter and not much more. It's in early access, but from what I\u2019ve played it\u2019s an overall shallow and very narrow experience that holds little promise of becoming more.

I've done one play through, read the tutorial before hand, and pretty much died due to the weapon I bought slowing me down without informing me that was the penalty with using it. It does work on Vista for anyone concerned with having an older OS. It has some fundamental flaws as a twin stick shooter and plays almost identical to classic games of the genre. So much so, I'm requesting a refund because it doesn't have anything new for me to want to try. With that said, the game as a whole is alright and I would cautiously recommend as a weekend timesink with friends. Nothing remarkable, but not horrible. 5/10\n\nIt very badly needs more info. The weapons give no information that it will be useful except the standard assumption of more money spent equals a better gun. Perks reset each game and only 3 out of the 10 are useful and they are shield & health increase along with regeneration (I started a second game to confirm they reset before ending the match). Every few waves a boss will show up and cause unlimited monster spawns until it dies. I never checked to see how many could show up on screen, but I saw about 60 with the boss after a few seconds of purposefully not shooting to see.\n\nThere is no sprinting in this game, which causes the game to revert to the standard method of combat for Twin-Stick Shooters: Blast your way forward to safety. If you've mastered that in previous Twin-Stick style games, it becomes too easy. The game focuses it's skill reward through the use of consumable power-ups. I noticed 8 different consumable objects and only 4 unique consumables can be picked up at a time. There isn't much for me to mention here since it is the bread and butter of extra shielding, a sentry gun, a speed boost, .etc. I wish more was done through the interactive portion of the game because I feel it's too little to enjoy for more than 3-4 games unless you are an Achievement Hunter which sadly, the achievements aren't that challenging to brag about for your time.\n\nThe most critical problems I have with the game is the need to be online to play and monsters don't need to attack to hurt a player. Always online can be a problem for those with unstable internet, so it must be known on the store page instead of just here. For monsters, I noticed often the majority of the creatures never used an attack animation when I was dealt damage. It removes the skill learned in a game like this where one could dodge attacks and survive longer.\n\nIt is pretty, but looks can only intice me so much. Hopefully they improve the actual game portion more during the Early Access period because it doesn't need more content. It needs refined content.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009596311", "last_played": 1475525086, "num_reviews": 109, "num_games_owned": 4134, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1475526303, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1475526303, "recommendationid": "25844452", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
