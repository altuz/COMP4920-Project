Then it went on sale for $9 and I bought it.  I didn't like it very much, mostly for the reasons listed in other reviews (Does the stealth even work?  The spawning).  After an hour of playing, I decided it wasn't worth a $9 bitching from the wife and I refunded it.  I've never refunded a Steam game before, and I think I've been on Steam for around 15 years.\n\nI wrote \"The game is a hot mess\" in the refund reason box.\n\nBut there was something about the game that kept my mind coming back to  it.  I really wished that I could play it a couple more times and at least look over some of the proceedural generation stuff that made me interested in the game in the first place.\n\nI decided to play some Eldritch (by same developer) to sort of scratch the itch for Slayer Shock, which I had just refunded.   I played a few minutes of Eldritch, and it reminded me that I initially didn't like Eldritch that much.  It took Eldritch a little while to grow on me, but I eventually became very fond of it.\n\nThen I ended up reading a Dev-blog by the Developer of Slayer Shock.  The developer explained a lot of his design decisions and philosophies behind Slayer Shock, and it started to make more sense to me.  I hadn't taken enough time to learn or adjust to the gameplay or understand exactly how this game works.\n\nSo I decided to give it another try.  I bought it again and dived in.  I burned through ten hours like it was nothing and am now a big fan of the game. \n\nAllow me to address some of the issues that came up in negative reviews and gave me an initial bad impression:\n\nStealth:  It actually does work.  The foliage does hide you, and vampires do respond to noise.  When I first re-bought the game, I decided to focus on observing Vampire behavior more than actually winning the game.  I learned that Stealth works fine.  Sometimes you get spotted, but mostly, hiding in bushes and tall grass does work.   And the Vampires aren't as brain dead as I initially thought.  For awhile, I was busting doors down to save time.  I didn't think the vampies were responding to the noise.  But then after doing it one time, I happened to be watching out a second story window, and I actually saw a couple of vampires walk over to the door I busted and check it out.  They actually looked at it for a few moments and then came in the house looking for me.  I have since observed this behavior several times.    When you are spotted, they will come after you and look for you after loosing line of sight.  They often end up finding me eventually.  They seem to also notice vampire dust laying on the ground.\n\nSpawning:  A lot of complaints about enemy spawning, and that was what really put me off on the game at first too.   Most of the Vampires are spawned at level start and go about their business until they spot you, but the game also periodically spawns in new enemies.  It works a lot like \"The Director\" in Left For Dead--periodically it will spawn in  a few minions--sometimes a swarms of them might come running from around a corner and you suddenly find yourself in a brawl.\n\nIt can be a little clumsy, sometimes.  I have seen them just appear out of nowhere, but usually they come out of a room or from behind a corner exactly like the zombies do in Left For Dead.  Despite being a little immersion breaking when the occasional clumsy respawn happens, it actually keeps the levels fresh, unpredictable, and challenging.   Its not a stealth game, its an action/stealth game.  I do a lot of sneaking around, but every now and then shit just hits the fan because of the re-spawns--and the game is better for it.\n\nFurthermore, after observing the Vampires in detail--I realized a lot of the \"spawning\" I was complaining about wasn't spawning at all.   Sometimes you clear a house, go to the second floor, and when you come back downstairs, there are a bunch of vampires hainging out in the living room.--and youre pissed because the game cheesed you with a respawn.  But I observed that some groups of vampires take really long patrols, and more often than not, those vampires actually came from down the street.  There's a pretty good chance they're all down there because you made a bunch of noise and they came to see what was going on.  \n\nIve witnessed this behavior on several occasions.\n\nThe proceedural generation of levels and enemy vampires is really good.  I would have liked to see a little more variety in some of the level lay-outs, but overall its pretty solid.   The Master Vampire is proceedurally generated, and it comes up with a unique, fun bad guy that has quite a bit of character.  Again, I wish the Dev would continue to take it further, but its very solid as is.  Random events between levels are also interesting.  Sometimes a vital team-mate is absent or gone for good, and it really puts you in a pinch.  Sometimes a postive event happens that saves your bacon, and you are so glad.\n\nIts a great game.  I'm ten hours in and its still the game im currently playing the most.  If you are really into procedural generations, rogue-likes, random plot points and events, and horror, you will probably enjoy the game once you give it a little time and effort.\n\nI will say this though--$20 is madness.  Its got a lot of content, but it need more content and more polish if its going to be $20.  I think $10-$12 is about right for this title in its current state-- Not because there is anything wrong with Slayer Shock--but because there is a lot of competition out there for your $20 bucks.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 250, "steamid": "76561197987872190", "last_played": 1507187317, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 218, "playtime_forever": 1222}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505066283, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505066401, "recommendationid": "34867764", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
