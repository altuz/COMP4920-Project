It looks very polished for a pixelart title. Simplistic yet challenging for the few bits of content it offers. Using a 2 death till endgame mechanic and a mana bar with regeneration (only for the mana mind you) you control a little person who is skilled in maces, bows and wands. Using various weapons you must destroy enemy spawn generators and collect loot for better items. It comes with 1 major boss which is rather early-game and a couple areas to complete.\n\nIll be honest, the look and feel is what got me, the all-russian achievements required me to google translate, the dev has left this title long ago. It has badge support as well. With the gameplay being as decent as it is, it is a cluster to understand what it is I am doing and what needs to be done. NPC's exist but dont converse. Loot and weapons have no stats or a stat page so I dont know what piece is better than the next. (IMO if it looks gnarly and wild, its probably better)\n\nId play it again, and Id want more of it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044229474", "last_played": 1499058593, "num_reviews": 161, "num_games_owned": 1376, "playtime_forever": 637}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1499058878, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518310", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1499058878, "recommendationid": "33168248", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
