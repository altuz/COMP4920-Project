I just couldn't continue.\nAlso, this game was mad so sloppily, I could walk out of bounds, up a misaligned wall. In a super obvious spot. That was not the dev missing a spot, it was the dev not caring about it. Paid half a buck, not worth it. Gonna refund now. I recommend buying this game when it's on a 200% sale, but just buy it, don't bother installing.\n\n@dev: calling your player (who paid you money) a sh*thead doesn't help.\n@translator: please don't accept job offers as a translator, hiring underage people is weird. seriously, that was non native elementary school level english.
