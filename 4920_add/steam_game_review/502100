You simply click objects and try to create the right chain reactions to see a funny(?) death sequence.\n\nPros:\n+ Some death scenes are funny\n+ I somewhat found the music charming\n\nCons:\n- Forced jokes\n- Short (it will take you an hour max. to complete) and you need to idle the game for several hours to get cards after completion.\n- Bad gfx, ui and animation (it looks uglier and uglier on higher res, this looks like a ported game but as the developer warned me, it is not.)\n\n3/10 A below mediocre game. Gameplay is pure trial and error. Short and doesnt worth its full price. Its a pity on developers part, if they invested more time to develop it, and get some help on gfx/animation part, it could have been a much much better and enjoyable game. Idea was cool. In this state, its more like a free game... If you are still curious try it on sale (-75% min) or get it from a bundle.\n\nP.S.: this review is updated after developer kindly warned me that this game is not a port and intended for pc. A bummer for me to think it should be a port.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009654132", "last_played": 1495695323, "num_reviews": 76, "num_games_owned": 1632, "playtime_forever": 217}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1495692042, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501589", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1496382800, "recommendationid": "31946349", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
