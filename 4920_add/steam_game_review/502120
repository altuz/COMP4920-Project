I have finally finished the game and am so happy it twas not lame bunny! (MY awful attempt at Bunny humor lol! :D Most games I won't even bother going through again for other endings and extras but with this game it was worth it! Lot's of hidden gems in this game (literally!) lol! The Side Story and Epilogue had me rolling on the floor laughing! I just really love these characters so much!!! ^.^ I got about 6hrs of play from doing basically everything (besides a achievement or two) and for me it was definitely worth the money! Can't wait for the next Route to come out! <3 <3 <3\n\nThe story is predictable, but i really enjoyed how fluffy and sweet it was. I usually enjoy really complicated visual novels with lots of twist and turns and extremely deep storylines. This though was a very simple story which was actually a nice break. I was able to just relax and laugh at all the silly characters and their antics. All the characters are a lot of fun and I've really been enjoying my time in their lively circus world. Also adding to the enjoyment:\n\n  -The art is so bright and lovely to look at. There is a lot of attention to detail with all the cute little cat items throughout the game. I also liked the changes to the circus throughout the seasons.\n   \n  -The characters have their own little quirks and personalities which makes it a lot of fun getting to know them and \nI can't wait till i can get the chance to romance them all! \n\n  -The music is really pleasant as well. My favorite was the acoustic song \"under the stars\" it is such a nice relaxing song.\n\n  -The expressions on the characters are super cute, funny and change quite a bit as they talk.\n\n  -The character designs are really incredible too! The characters are adorable in their animal forms and the ones i got the chance to see in their human forms were super hot! Clena has a very unique look to her too and everyone had awesome clothing designs and hair ect. Just really nice details and outfits in general, especially owl! I LOVE his outfit, that hat!! :D\n\n  -CGs are beautiful! So much colors and detail i've been trying to figure out how to do a screenshot because I want to use them for my computer's wallpaper backgrounds! \n\n  -The dialogue is absolutely hilarious. I smiled throughout this whole game. It's cheesy in the best way possible and i really enjoyed reading this as a way to relax and laugh after a long day.\n\nAll in all this game was even better than i imagined and I am so glad I gave it a chance. \n\nP.S. Kad is just the most lovable cat character ever! I want a plushie of him (in cat form....well maybe human form too lol!) I wasn't sure about him in the beginning but as he opened up his character became a lot more interesting and so sweet. I couldn't stop blushing! <3 <3 <3", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198263787643", "last_played": 1487472745, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_forever": 456}, "votes_up": 24, "timestamp_created": 1470324133, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530994", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1470697261, "recommendationid": "24709425", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It was very cute. I like the art style and the characters' personality through out the rather short tale. However, I feel as though there could have been more added to it, instead of just fastforwarding through the months. It honestly felt like I was just watching an episode of an anime. There was little interactions between the heroine and her forced love. There was a strong lack of any connection you feel between the characters.

In this path, the story is focused on the cat, Kad. He\u2019s a super shy cat who transforms into his human form quickly due to feeling embarrassed by Clena\u2019s actions. \n\nI\u2019ve been waiting for the release of this game for a while now. I\u2019ve been looking forward to Zeiva\u2019s Dragon Essence for years now, but this game was announced and I thought it sounded like something I\u2019d love to play in the meantime.  When I first heard about, I thought it sounded cute and fun. And that is what this is. A cute, fun, lighthearted game. It doesn\u2019t have a deep story or anything of the sort. Clena has one mission set by a character and the rest of the story is just moments that happened throughout the year. It felt very episodic in that way. Still, it was funny and an enjoyable read. The artwork was gorgeous as well.\n\nI\u2019ve been playing Zeiva\u2019s games for years now since they released their older flash games on deviantart and I\u2019ve always thought they were enjoyable and quirky. This one\u2019s no exception. I do, however, have a recommendation for them\u2014switch the engine from flash. Flash is kind of a dying breed nowadays and it\u2019s not very secure. I recommend switching to a VN engine like Renpy or Tyrano Builder or if they don\u2019t want to go for those, HTML5 is a choice. It\u2019ll also make implementing Steam features more easily, since the game doesn\u2019t have Steam overlay which sucks because I would have loved to share some funny screenshots I took of my favorite character\u2014the snail. It would have been nice to have the in-game achievements implemented onto steam as well. It\u2019s those extra things that make everything even nicer. I also would have liked the game to have a widescreen option. I couldn\u2019t play it on full screen on my PC. When I tried, the screen would go completely black. It never showed up properly, so I had to play it windowed the entire time.\n\nLeaving those things aside, I do recommend the game. I think it\u2019s cute, fun and perfect to play when you want a shorter game that doesn\u2019t get exhausting. I\u2019m looking forward to more paths, and I would really love a snail path!\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198016427463", "last_played": 1472265207, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 410, "playtime_forever": 409}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1472266579, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505716", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1472266579, "recommendationid": "25173577", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Absolutely adorable and funny.\n\nI really wish that there was more interaction with the characters.

(Let's face it the plot is definitely a bit ridiculous) The protagonist is introduced as your average girl, however, I doubt that. She is extremely ditzy and pretty much a solid idiot.
