It's ugly as sin, has very slow gameplay. Audio assets are horrbile. But at least it's playable and seems to have a complete campaign and there are no obvious game breaking bugs.\n\nIt desperately needs a speed-up button and the missing keyboard shortcuts for spawning units (1-6) is an obvious miss as well.\n\nNot the worst game, but at the current state I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Perhaps at half price, if you have the flu and are listening to some audio book and you desperately need some mind numbing, soul draining, slow paced click action. \n\nOr maybe it's just me having a really bad day.
