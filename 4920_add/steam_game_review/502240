It should read...\n\n'You Deserve The Steam Bin'.\n\nThe game was constructed by this company http://www.tgacompany.com/ basically a bunch of single game developers from around the world (mainly Mexico and Spain) who collaborate on various projects. The main stated expertise of the company is in gamification (adding gaming elements into a non-gaming context for example educational and commercial properties and tools). Further the company's main stated mission is to primarily create 'a unique and unforgettable experience by adding real issues and secondarily help young people to strive and beat different social difficulties' through the playing of their games.\n\nHence this game is all about a poltergeist who is seeking vengeance because you bullied them in the school until they committed suicide. So as you dream in your bed about dark caves, darker parks and a house with an electricity problem her job is to constantly jump out of nowhere and scream like some sort of spoilt brat wanting a pony. At the end of the game your informed you need to do some sort of 'Satanic' ritual in order to get rid of her. Seriously developers did you even take time to think this one out? How a \u2018Satanic\u2019 ritual is even supposed to get rid of a BAD spirit? Hence it should come to no surprise that it doesn't work and she eats you in the end or something. \n\nSeriously the game is so badly perceived that it relatively easy to break the mechanics (for example walk down the mountain after making the ritual), several achievements are constantly reported to be severely bugged and the developers tries to cover this programming incompetence and poorly storyboarded concept by over relying on silly childish jump scare antics. Hence any noble 'Anti-bullying' statements to be made in the game are immediately thwarted by over the top Spiritism. How the developers ever thought this was tackling 'REAL' issues and wholesome entertainment to help children deal with 'Social Difficulties' is beyond me. I think the company needs to go back to drawing board and analyse what they really stand for. Because at the moment it seriously just looks like they are content making unoriginal childish jump scare games with a crudely slapped on gimmick about handling bullying issues which they target to a severely limited audience thanks to adult and Spiritistic themes.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an adult game with a noble message and has the occasional jump scare then YOU DESERVE 'Among the Sleep' a game which this game tried to jump on the bandwagon of, but was severely run over by.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198112866114", "last_played": 1502853788, "num_reviews": 183, "num_games_owned": 2624, "playtime_forever": 505}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1503052769, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511092", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1503052769, "recommendationid": "34325644", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "No. Nobody deserves this buggy and just garbage gameplay.
