Even some other \"Boulder Dash\" games which came out over the years were nice and you actually could enjoy them very much.\n\n\nBut THIS version (The Steam version)...\n\nIs a joke, like quite literally.\n\n[h1]Boulder Dash! Well...kinda[/h1]\nFirst of all, and this might be the main part of my review, this version is nothing more then the mobile version which came out some years ago. Now people might say \"well then its just bad coz its a bad port\" or maybe they will say \"its just a ripoff\" or stuff like.\n\nTo be honest, it indeed -is- a very very bad port from the mobile version, here the facts why:\n\n- It has no ingame store. This might be good for one reason but you might will see later why i count this up.\n\n- Normaly, there was a Extra wheel you could spin every 2 hours for free stuff you could get. in this version, its gone.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=763478753\n- On the mobile version, the DLCs are only half the price (around 1\u20ac). Next to this, i think they \"over did\" it a bit with the Retro DLC at least, i mean, honestly, i know the old levels from 1984 originals Boulder Dash but why they even putted the ORIGINAL BONUS LEVELS as OWN LEVELS in there? I mean those Levels were not even BIG or something (look screenshot if you dont belive me, srs.)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=763479255\n- You still have to farm a lot stuff for characters and you really need, N-E-E-D a lot stuff for characters. the first one might be quick to get but others, i mean the first needs 5 special stones but the next needs already 50 OTHER special stones small spoiler: [spoiler]EACH character needs special \"stones\" or stuff to get them. and if the last one needs 500 of its own special stones and you get those ONLY if you find chests and the regular game has \"only\" 220 stages, happy farming![/spoiler]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=763478428\n- the pricetag. If you look for your mobile for this Boulder Dash version you might find it very quickly - for[b] F-R-E-E [/b]. Exactly. This version is just a PORT from a FREE TO PLAY game. They didnt changed ANYTHING. The only thing is, in the steam version, you can build your own Levels, no extra wheel and the lack of the Ingame store. NO extra start money, youre NOT able to even buy more gold coz there is no store, NO extra wheel you could spin, not even other characters OR more stages, nothing more.\n\nFact\nI dont recomment this to people who actually have a mobile phone and have the opinion to get the same game for FULL FREE. Its \"easier\" since you just can \"buy\" stuff if you want, have the free extra wheel every 2 hours and the dlcs are cheaper. 15\u20ac for such bad port is a exorbitant price if the only thing you get is a Editor, 5\u20ac or maybe 7\u20ac could be worth it but since you only lose a lot stuff and only get a editor, its really not worth such high pricetag if you still remember you could get the full game F-R-E-E...\n\nIt gives a lot other free Boulder Dash clones which are, already said, FREE to get with Editors and like. So for real, better get the mobile version, there at least you have the opinion to buy the stuff you need to farm for each characters faster and every 2 hours even a \"bit\" free. I dont recomment it, not even hardcore fans only if they really really want or dont have a mobile phone in their pockets...\n\n----------\n\nADD EDIT: I posted also my review in the discussion before i was able (coz steam~) to write it here as a real one (you can read the full thread here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/502320/discussions/0/343786650655117122/ ).\nOne user thought this version is better then the mobile version but i just quote myself here and you see:\n\n\"...no. this version is not better:\n\n- you have the same levels.\n- you still have to buy DLCS which are cheaper on the mobile version.\n- you dont have the free extra wheel where you get free stuff you need to farm normaly every 2 hours\n- you might dont have a ingame store (\"mirco transactions\") but you still were ABLE to buy stuff you need. the only, ONLY way in this game version is to farm like hell. And trust me, you would like to buy at least some stuff (you dont \"need\" too but some stuff needs long as sample the 500-item character or the one you can only get viva collecting gold~)\n- the pricetag is way to high for that \"mobile port\". srs.\n\nthe only \"pros\" this version has is\n- You have a editor.\n- you get 2 (? i guess) DLCs which you normaly should buy on the mobile instand locked free (still remember the other DLCs cost more on the steam version here) with the normal steam version.\n- you can play it on keyboard.\n\nSo is it worth for you 15 bucks just you can play on keyboard? Its a ripoff and even a bad excuse to mark the price that high if you say like \"people perfer to play it on PC\".\n\nthat sure might be true but still remember, BOTH version are from the core the exactly SAME GAME. one you get for FREE, the other you have to pay for just youre able to play it on keyboard. You still can play even the mobile version on a XBOX controller at least. So i dont see why the price is set that high. even every freeware boulder dash clone has a editor inside and plays more like a \"real\" boulder dash. i know the real boulder dash and i even PREFER the original version, so far, than this version.\"", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038310096", "last_played": 1482344435, "num_reviews": 158, "num_games_owned": 612, "playtime_forever": 454}, "votes_up": 68, "timestamp_created": 1473890415, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551345", "votes_down": 36, "timestamp_updated": 1474149732, "recommendationid": "25502120", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The original Boulder Dash was an amazing puzzle game with action gameplay.
