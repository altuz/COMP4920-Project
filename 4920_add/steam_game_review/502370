Units can level up, but you have no say in what bonuses they get for doing so, and there are no wargear options. It's easy to pick up and play, the mechanics are simple, and it's fairly entertaining. However, there are no RPG elements to this game. It plays more like a board game than anything resembling the tabletop game or a turn-based RPG like those previously mentioned.

On the other hand, I will write why I hesitate, since it shocked me:\n\n1 This game has most sloppy and boring campaign in all campaigns I played for very long time. One of the reasons is it's briefing before the battle is so poorly and carelessly presented that I couldn't think of anything worse than that. I can understand not all the projects have so many resources that people can make high quality cinametic in campaign to make the story so alive (such as Starcraft 2), but seriously guys? Two sentences telling me where my troops are and where orcs troops are are what we can call briefing in a campaign? I see only slopiness.\n\n2 Very boring victory condition in the campaign. I've only played 4 battles until now. All the goals are seeing who have most victory points. I did check on youtube of more battles and what I saw was it seems the only goal in the game. I could be wrong, since I haven't check each of every battle or stage. Campaign is nothing in this game. It's just a serie of random maps combining together for whatever reason and pretend it will work like a campaign and deliver the experience. \nEdit: I'm wrong, see one stage that needs to protect a unit. OK, it feels better now.\n\n3 I don't feel the difference between Space Marine and Orc. I jumped to this game after Armargeddon, so it may affect my judgement. However, what I feel in the game is I'm fighing against a Space Marine army who for whatever reason has orc skin. Enemies look like orc, but each individual squad is equally strong as Space Marine counterpart. Is it my impression of orc is wrong, or game desginers don't care of creating any difference? I don't know.\n\nWell, those are what shocked me when I started to play. Those shocked me to the point that I asked for refund, but too bad, I played for too long at the point already. Then, I guess I will keep playing it just as a casual whatsoever game, since at least the turn-based mechanism is enjoyable to me and no buggs is seen yet, both of which are values quite hard to find nowadays and the reason at end of the day I choose to recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044621252", "last_played": 1501843506, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_forever": 3986}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1499602160, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499690", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1499607140, "recommendationid": "33402402", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Lacking polish in a few places, but more than makes up for it in being genuinly fun and enjoyable.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197966747293", "last_played": 1505825811, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 191, "playtime_forever": 3284}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1502610627, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502610627, "recommendationid": "34208441", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I am really liking this game a lot.
