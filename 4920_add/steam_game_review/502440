Yes it's not a AAA game but it's not a bad game. The graphics are older so they're not great but it's still fun in it's own way. I like how interactive the vehicles are in the fact you have to wash and repair them from time to time as well as some of the features on the 6 and 7 engines (that's as far I got so far). If you're looking for a high end game this is not it but if you're looking for a cheap (I got it for $10.00 on sale) entertaining game it's not a bad game. I wouldn't spend any more than that on this game as it's not worth it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198059666042", "last_played": 1477107063, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 604}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1472666583, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503435", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1472666583, "recommendationid": "25272679", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Do not buy its a copy from the rondomedia and its very poor in compare to the original", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198113408182", "last_played": 1473965718, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_forever": 35}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1473966011, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498757", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1473966011, "recommendationid": "25515705", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}]}
