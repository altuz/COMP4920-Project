Challenging battles, innovative controls and a number of different resources like available manpower, military finances and weaponry all made the campaign fun through historical and minor battles. \n\nIt gets very repetitive however. As much as I enjoyed getting intercepted Confederate letters warning about my General's current position and achievements, they were really the same after every battle.

The elements of design are excellent, especially in terms of sound and graphics. Building divisions and brigades, arming them with quintesential weapons of the era, and assigning leadership is engaging and interesting. Getting into a nasty exchange of musketry and cannon fire is a gleeful pleasure to watch and winning said fights is rewarding. But where things begin to fall apart for me is when the game starts to get bigger. \n\n\nWhen I say bigger, I mean that in terms of the size of your army. Very rapidly, you will find yourself on titanically big maps, attempting to control dozens of units in an army that must be well over 70,000 men strong. You will also be forced to control that army in 1500-3000 man clumps, and organize them in a manner which will allow you to carry the day in battle. This is not easy. \n\nThis game is, quite frankly, not meant for people like me who simply do not have the headspace to manage such a colossal endeavor.\n\n\nThe game really shines when you are on the defensive. The nature of commanding such a vast array of troops lends itself to defensive fighting in almost every way. Reaction times are not as readily punished on the defensive, and understanding where the enemy will likely move towards and planning ahead for that assault is incredibly rewarding. Going on offensives, however, is a different animal entirely. \n\n\nI truly believe that this game would beneift hugely from the inclusion of a cooperative game mode, wherein a friend could be given command of parts of your army. Being able to split the effort of commanding massive armies over multiple people (just like command structures in real life) would, in my very humble opinion, make this game one of the top 3 in my library today if not the very best.\n\n\nToday, I can hardly stomach the idea of playing any of the battles past the second or third year of this epic American conflict.

Lots more of hitting the pause button during battle to make sure your units are positioned properly.  Once one of your units gets routed things can snowball quickly, so I find that hitting the pause button frequently, especially for larger battles, is a great benefit.  The downside, especially for those who favor point, click and let 'em fight style of play, is that it can get a little tedious to constantly pause the game.  I enjoy it, as it really lets you put your tactical skills to the test. But I can see how the frequent pausing can annoy some (or if they don't make adjustments, how they'll get frustrated with the AI's very competent moves).\n\nThe most challenging level leaves you with less money and manpower, plus the AI is quite challenging.  You really need to make smart decisions in camp, where you decide on the weapons to supply your army, and again, on the battlefield you'll need to really, really pay attention to how the battle is playing out.  Right now I've got my hands full on the regular difficulty level. Those who master this level have my full respect.\n\nThis is so much more than just a series of battles though.  As I touched on above, you'll have the option to choose the weapons (at a cost) to supply your infantry, cav, arty, and skirmishers.  And as you earn career points for victories you can use those points to improve things like politics, economy, medicine, etc.  Bottom line, you've got lots of options and how you prepare for upcoming battles does have a large impact on how those battles play out.\n\nI do wish that things were not quite so \"scripted\" as some others have mentioned.  It would be nice if there was a way to re-write history based on the outcome of the battles, or for us to split our armies up, and navigate in various directions(and have the AI have that same freedom, choosing where we want to attack next, or move to defend.  Also, the constant pausing on the more difficult settings in order to make sure your units are properly positioned may be a grind for some people, though I don't mind personally. Regardless, there is still a lot of replay value, as you learn, tweak your strategy and tactics, move up in difficulty level, or switch sides.\n\nOverall, I find this to be an outstanding, and after a few weeks, still very addictive game.
