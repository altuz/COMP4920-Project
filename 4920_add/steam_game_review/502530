They can be fun and scary as hell. Unforntunately this game was none of those things. It's just boring and repetitive. It's not even worth the sale price. It's over priced at any anything above 25 cents. \n\nDon't bother playing this game. It's not the least bit fun. They took interesting source material and made it boring as hell. Just go watch some videos on Youtube about aliens and abductions.
