Sadly, after that, things got worse. Moments of good humor and interesting story-telling were drowned by frustration and disappointment, that comes not from writing, nor the plot, but game mechanics and the way they are used within the story. This is early access game, obviously, so there may be some changes until final version, but I will judge it for what it is right now.\n\n[h1]Let me start, with few good things:[/h1]\n\n[b]Unique.[/b]  It has interesting concept and it isn't overflowing with cliches, which is great.\n\n[b]Humor.[/b]  Especially during Tymo's route. There are few moments when it feels like creators tried a little too hard (especially with multiple narrators - it wears off really quickly and becomes annoying), but overall, I had a few good laughs, and that's great.\n\n[b]Einar & Tymoteusz.[/b]  Original, surprisingly likable, cute and funny. What's not to like?\n\n[b]One payment.[/b]  I don't like this \"trend\" that started on app stores and slowly shows up up on Steam, with visual novels cut into pieces and sell separately as episodes or routes. I prefer this \"early access\" approach much more. That being said...\n\n[h1]Bad things: [/h1]\n\n[b]... price is way too high.[/b]  This is a 23\u20ac game, with five (currently four) routes. From what I've seen (I've played three so far, some few times), you can complete single route in about an hour, sometimes even less, if you get bad ending. That gives us about 5 hour of gameplay, not counting the time that you will spend replaying the game, frustrated, trying to get the right combination of choices to get good ending or at least to not die. Oh, and time you'll spend gaining achievements, since most of them seem literally impossible to get (and I'm not referring to those from missing route). There is only one CG per route, so 5 CGs total. Plus, given the fact, that I know most of in-game music, it's probably royalty-free, although I'm not certain on that one. Either way, it's really hard to see how is it worth 23\u20ac.\n\n[b]Guide needed.[/b]  Desperately, I may add. I think this game was intended to be replayed a lot, in order to unlock certain endings, but the problem is, it's getting very frustrating, especially considering that skipping isn't always working as intended and some (most?) outcomes are based on invisible love-meter. For example, on Tymo's route I found myself in a situation, where all of three available choices led to my death. I couldn't do anything about it, so I looked for help. Only thing I gathered from some older discussion, was \"Tymo need to love you more\". Uh-huh. So you're telling me, I need to replay the whole game, and then out of at least 10 choices or so, pick this right configuration that let me get through, but I don't have any indicator, which choice do what and I can only guess. Okay. If someone is patient enough to do that (or lucky to get it during first try), they will probably move pass this obstacle, but after that, I've decided to give up on playing further until there's some sort of guide or in-game indicator of this mysterious \"love-meter\". It just seems like massive waste of time.\n\n[b]Dying is not fun.[/b]  Which isn't really surprising, but some games can pull this off well. Here, dying is neither dramatic, nor shocking, nor funny, nor in any way useful, it's a silly way of punishing you for choices that you had no idea could let to this outcome [spoiler] for example, telling Hana's creepy ex-boyfriend to leave, resulted in him killing her. Inviting him in and trying to explain the situation, resulted in r*pe attempt, and then either death or... well... death [/spoiler]. Death counter seems almost like a mockery. This is a visual novel and not \"Dark Souls\", seriously.\n\n[b]Skipping.[/b]  Isn't working right. Sometimes I wasn't able to skip seen text after reloading a file - I needed to wait for another choice. It's also slow.\n\n[b]No text speed regulation. [/b] Seriously?\n\n[b]Achievements aren't working as intended.[/b] \n\n[b]Blanche & Furio.[/b] Both of these routes were rushed and bland. There is some nice humor here and there, but not much emotional impact. Furio, with his \"I loved you and you have not loved me back, so now that you love me, I don't love you anymore, because reasons\" is particularly unlikable and I'm not sure if that was creators intention. Jan's route isn't out yet, but I'm not looking forward to that one.\n\n\nI still have Einar's route to play, but I will wait with that one till the final version. For now, I cannot recommend this game, not only because of price, but also because of lacking content and frustrating game mechanics.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198158309410", "last_played": 1498411146, "num_reviews": 101, "num_games_owned": 957, "playtime_forever": 317}, "votes_up": 23, "timestamp_created": 1498388954, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552914", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498389201, "recommendationid": "32767209", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
