To hit the golf ball you either have to move the camera with the cursor to find the right \"power\" you want to hit the ball at. However left shift is useful if you do not want to move the first person camera whilst aiming. This is a useful feature as many times the ball will be behind an object and as without using the left shift feature you cannot look straight down , using left shift to use the cursor without moving the first person camera can really help.\n\nThe graphics are decent however there is very little difference between the highest and lowest graphical settings. The lighting could be improved however in many spots as well as a possible indication to where the hole it. In many occasions the hole itself is barely visible due to it blending in with the shading on the map. This could easily be fixed with a small indication to where the hole for better visibility of where your aiming for.\n\nThe music at times can be extremely obnoxious especially when you are trying to concentrate.
