The movement is a bit odd, you press left/right to go clockwise/counterclockwise and up/down to go out/in. You get used to it eventually, but it can be hard to use at first. You've got three different attacks based on whether you are moving in, out, or standing still. Moving in is a strong attack that makes the ball much faster, standing is a regular attack that only increases the speed slightly, and moving outwards is a stall attack that stall the ball momentarily in place before sending it back. All these add some nice depth to the game to allow for mixups and mindgames.\n\nWhile the gameplay is definitely fun, what surprised me the most was how good the aesthetic is. The animations are amazing, the music is great, and the sound effects of the crowd roaring, the ball being hit, and player impacts are excellent. They all mesh with the gameplay to enhance it and make it more satisfying.\n\nThe game is local multiplayer only, and the computer player is decent to play against. Even without another person to play with I would recommend this, but WITH a friend this is a must-buy, especially at $4. No huge flaws, and some excellent gameplay and amazing aesthetic.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013257090", "last_played": 1497670895, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 432, "playtime_forever": 215}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1497924549, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497924549, "recommendationid": "32581366", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Game is broken.
