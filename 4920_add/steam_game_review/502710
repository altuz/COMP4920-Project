There's only about an hour of content, but the scene where you have to jump out of a plane into anti-aircraft flak shocks the conscience when you know 13,000 people actually did that. Then there's the beach at Normandy, too. It fulfilled the developer's stated description of wanting to take you there. Making the player play the axis side at Normandy was an interesting choice, I wonder why we aren't playing both sides of Normandy and the paradrop. On one level, wielding dual SMGs is fun a fun break from the historical accuracy.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197978406355", "last_played": 1501334573, "num_reviews": 49, "num_games_owned": 243, "playtime_forever": 63}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1501421721, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506948", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501421721, "recommendationid": "33904954", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Cool concept, but falls short.    There's too little content - I've played the entire game through with my meagre playtime, including 10 minutes or so of getting the game to work correctly (This was my fault, I'm still new to VR stuff and hadn't set my SteamVR up correctly).     Handling the sniper rifle is awkward and unrealistic, and several weapons have rate of fire bugs, such as the MG42 and the suppressed pistol used in the final level, that prevent you from firing as fast as you should be able to.    Additionally it's possible to \"jam\" the sniper rifle and shotgun where it looks like it's been bolted/pumped but requires pumping or bolting it again for it to function.   \n\nEnemy AI is very basic, and seems to follow pre-set paths and makes little opportunity to flank you beyond their scripted paths.  Enemy variety is also lacking,  either you run into enemy soldiers using SMGs (or MG42s in the last level) or riflemen who act as rapid-fire snipers. Additionally, the enemy does not attempt more \"complex\" behavior such as closing the distance to melee you, or throwing grenades.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears the game is dead as the developer is working on Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator.
