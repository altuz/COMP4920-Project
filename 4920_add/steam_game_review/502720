During my explorations, I've come across alien temples lurking on foggy green worlds inhabited by hostile entities made of steam. I've stumbled through barren, pitted deserts marked with the occasional lake of frozen sulphuric acid. I've seen lush jungles where bipedal, flat-headed aliens bathe in pools of mercury.\n\nI've also died a lot.\n\nSee, the galaxy Schmidt has created here isn't cruel. \"Cruel\" implies that it cares. And this galaxy is terribly, terribly uncaring. Finding a planet with usable resources requires you to sift through a tremendous amount of data. When you find a planet worth exploring, it's likely this world is inimical to life -- too hot, too cold, seething with radiation -- and, as you try to find a cave that may contain the fuel crystals you need to sustain your interstellar voyage, your explorer's suit condition and air tank tick down with terrifying speed.\n\nRight now, as I'm typing this, I have Star Explorers open. I'm orbiting a red giant. I risked it all to come here, hoping against hope that one of its nine planets would contain fuel crystals. I found a planet with the right composition to grow these crystals. When I touched down and found a cave, I discovered that it was full of crystals -- but not the right sort. Just worthless emeralds. I don't have enough fuel to return to the mothership or travel to another star system. I'm trapped.\n\nWait, though. There's another planet orbiting this star I haven't seen yet -- it must've been on the opposite side of the red giant. It's the right variety, too. I hop out of my landing craft and, after a few minutes of searching, find a cave. THIS one has fuel crystals! What's more, at the end of a corridor, I find a chest with an improved space suit, allowing me to survive even more dangerous worlds.\n\nI'll put off dying for the moment. I've got some more stars to explore.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197999376568", "last_played": 1505151369, "num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 7779, "playtime_forever": 237}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1505150060, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505150111, "recommendationid": "34886784", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
