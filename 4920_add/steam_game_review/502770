Several are quite tedious.  Many cannot be achieved by idling and require quite a bit of attentive clicking.  \n\nPros/Cons:\n+ Cute art\n+ Nice music/sound effects\n+ Upgrade system/unlockables\n+ Decent time killer\n+ It's cheap\n\n- There's not much in terms of a tutorial.  While there was some tool tips every so often, it would've been nice to have been given a little more info on what to do in the beginning.\n- Gold/XP can only be earned while the game is running.\n- Unlike many clickers, not every process can be automated.  The player must remain active to collect many of the game's ingredients.  \n- Gets quite boring after awhile-- while new plants/upgrades are gradually added, none of them really add anything interesting.\n\nOverall: \nIt's hard to say quite how I feel about Voodoo Garden.  While I was charmed by its aesthetics, the whole experience was ultimately lackluster.  To me, the best part of a clicker(especially a more creative clicker like this) is getting more and more efficient to the point where all processes are automatic except for overall management.  I found Voodoo Garden disappointing in the fact that the user's job never really gets much easier.  From the beginning to the end, the player is madly clicking the screen to collect ingredients that their helpers cannot collect.  It gets to be a tedious process.  \nUltimately, unless you're a huge fan of mindless clickers, I'd pass this game up.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043642717", "last_played": 1501397604, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 743, "playtime_forever": 888}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1501399884, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510669", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1501399884, "recommendationid": "33898965", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Cute and calming.

I absolutely love Idle games. At least 50% of the games I play on other websites like Kongregate are at least half an idle game. So, being that, I give it a 9/10 rating. Why 9/10? Well, it's a great game and it's actually pretty fun. Now, it's missing a 1 because it can be a little annoying. I left it on for about 4-5 hours while I went somewhere. Now, by that time I had the 7th potion and was level 12-13. Only problem is I could only have two made because of two things. The spirits can't pluck grass or get animals. Now, I would love if the ability that lets spirits pick mushrooms let them pluck grass, and if there was an ability that let them get animals. Or even if just the pig spirit could pluck grass and mushrooms. Next to that, as I've said many times, overall a great game with a nice little voodoo twist that I got for under a dollar during the Summer Sale.\nSee you all, in other reviews, because I do those suddenly for some reason.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198133839604", "last_played": 1504055021, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 33, "playtime_forever": 952}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503974808, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503974808, "recommendationid": "34567138", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "pretty clicker game. imo negative reviews are very harsh.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198234889828", "last_played": 1504922739, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_forever": 262}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500639062, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500826", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500639062, "recommendationid": "33695075", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not enough to stimulate ongoing interest... interesting art and animation.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198205967249", "last_played": 1499070336, "num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 571, "playtime_forever": 45}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499942163, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497439", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1499942163, "recommendationid": "33500308", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Cute and calming.
