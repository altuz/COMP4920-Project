I am having more fun with this than No Man's Sky, don't say I said that ha ha. Space games are my thing and what I like is how the game is so randomized. So I played through about 7 games and each one was nothing like the last. In one game I jumped through 8 sectors, yes 8 without finding a single planet! It's pretty much an open ended experience and you can play it how you want without following some sort of storyline. There is so much to do here in this game I am still learning but I am catching on. It still feels like an early access title especially in some areas but I seen the game has had many updates since it was released. It is a little difficult at times but I like a good challenge anyway. I am hoping to see more of everything in this game as it progresses towards release. I would like to know when they plan on doing a final release. Right now I really like it and was surprised.
