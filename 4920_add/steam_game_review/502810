I am glad to finally see a seated vehicle piloting game using the Vive controllers. Both controllers have a point of reference set and where you move the controllers in relation to this point of reference controls tank movement and the turret. The left controller controls tank movement but the tank wont move unless you hold the trigger. Holding the trigger while moving it forward past the PoR on the left controller moves the tank forward, trigger plus moving it to the right turns the tank etc. etc. You aim the turret with the right controller in relation to it's PoR. The PoR can be centered on the controllers' current position by pressing the grip buttons on the one you want to reset, allowing you to set a PoR that's comfortable for you. This works really well and tank control is incredibly responsive.\n\nUnfortunately there is almost no content in the game. Two stages which are really short and repetitive. The one problem that made me quit was that my tank had the nasty tendancy to slide to the left or right when not holding the left trigger at all which really messed up my aim. Sometimes it would slide to the left causing my aim to go left so I'm trying to pull hard to the right to correct the tank body so it kind of just sits in place and spins around. It's really weird and immersion-breaking and I can't stand it.\n\nAt the moment the game isn't worth $10. An extremely lacking in content and the weird slidey bug are massive issues to me. If these get corrected then go ahead and pick it up but for right now, give this game a pass.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983367080", "last_played": 1476129799, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 326, "playtime_forever": 19}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1476130572, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518883", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1476130572, "recommendationid": "25972159", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "5 mins in the game I was trapped in the sky...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198052181119", "last_played": 1500535244, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 109, "playtime_forever": 14}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1480847892, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500832", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1480847892, "recommendationid": "28180907", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "game is s!#t i rather play with dog S#$t then this game do yourself a favor and dont wast your money", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038288370", "last_played": 1493165534, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 44}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1490227314, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1490227314, "recommendationid": "30677465", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
