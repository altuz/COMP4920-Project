So when Arkham VR finally came to PC, I jumped straight into it after avoiding spoilers of it from the PSVR crowd.\n\nJust like the 2D flat games, this game is quite the looker. Fantastic visuals all around. Where this one differs from the previous Arkham games is the gameplay. Arkham VR is more of a puzzle or detective game, which makes sense with him supposed to be a detective. Its a bummer that they didn't go for some combat using all of Batman's gadgets and such, but still getting to use the gadgets that we do in this is really cool and fun. Once you 'beat' the game, there's still a lot of content here. Normally I don't hunt down things in games and try to 100% complete them, but in this I made an exception due to how fun tracking these Riddler puzzles were. \n\nIs this game worth it for you, I can't say. If you're only coming to this for combat or action, then stay away. If you just want to fun adventure and puzzles with great visuals, then jump on in. It's not the longest game in VR with a ton of content, but what's here is super polished and high quality.\n\n8.5/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004410106", "last_played": 1493592891, "num_reviews": 136, "num_games_owned": 576, "playtime_forever": 189}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1505627898, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524645", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505627898, "recommendationid": "35015199", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Simple question: Is this VR title worth its current full price of 20 bucks?\nSimple answer: Yes. Definitve yes, if you are a Batman fan.\n\nLong answer:\n\nAs many VR 'games' this one is a short experience. Around 1 hour is needed to play the story and additional 2 hours is needed finish the game again with additional Riddler riddles. Yes, this is short, but in comparison with other AAA single player games which charge 60 bucks for around 12 hours, the price is a bit high, but still ok in terms of playtime for money.\nBut beside this shortness this title is very well polished and offer a very good VR and Batman (as Detective) experience.\nOnly real critic I have is for the transisitions between the levels. You hear the sound of the driving or flying batvehicle, but the screen offers only the typical Steam VR loading screen.
