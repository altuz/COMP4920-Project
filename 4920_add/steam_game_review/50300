Given his usual sarcastic, cutting witty humor that he usually reviews games with, and since this game, at least by name, sounded like a conventional AAA shooter, I thought he'd take the absolute piss out of it.\n\nThe first sign that I knew something was up was that his normally upbeat yet cynical tone of voice was replaced with a hesitant, almost lightly despairing tone of voice, one that was very out of character from what I normally heard from him. The second sign was that this was one of the first modern military shooters I'd actually heard him give a significant amount of praise to, at least story- and narrative-wise.\n\nThis interested me heavily, and I decided to pick the game up on Steam after reading around about it for a bit. I'd already been spoiled a bit on the game in Yahtzee's review (although, in hindsight, nothing severe), so I kinda knew what I was heading into. But I checked out the trailers on the store page first and thought \"This trailer makes the game look like your average CoD-inspired shooter, what makes it so special?\" Read some user reviews, then eventually got around to playing it.\n\nAt first, I felt a bit underwhelmed. Sure, some crazy shit happened, but it didn't immediately make any impact on me. It still felt like a typical cover-based shooter with kinda-bland gameplay.\n\nI paused in my progress and made time to check out a shitton of other games I'd bought. But after watching an Extra Credits video about the game (which even the self-styled \"spoiler storm\" part didnt give me much to go on, cause I forgot a lot of it), I decided to resume my campaign. Still not much going on, I thought.\n\n[spoiler]Then the phosphorous mortar scene happened.[/spoiler]\n\nThat's pretty much all the explanation needed for how everything suddenly immediately punched me simultaneously in the gut and balls without hesitation. My mood spiralled downward instantly from intrigued to feeling absolute depresssion, shock and despair, all these emotions at a fucking digital program's video cutscenes.\n\nI'd read plenty about how fucked up the turns the game takes are, but [b]nothing[/b] had prepared me for that. But what drove it home was [spoiler]the almost apathetic reaction Walker had to everything afterwards. I instantly felt disconnected from him, wishing I was playing a different character but too absorbed to stop, at least until I had to go to bed.\n\nThen we had to kill the soldiers who had helped the civilians I had just razed alive, screaming \"murderer\" in my headphone speakers as I gunned them down with efficient headshot kills.\n\nThe bridge judgement scene was one I eventually made an easy decision on, once I realized after two or three attempts that I could not shoot my way out of it, because both guys die anyway if I try. Didn't make the soldier's death any more fucked, though.[/spoiler]\n\nSometime after this I stopped because I had other things to do, but I'll definitely be returning to this game.\n\nAs a (maybe) temporary closer, I echo Adams' sentiment:\n\n[spoiler]\"Phosphorus. I swear, if I never see this shit again, it'll be too soon.\"[/spoiler]"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506680348, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35288565", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198231660596", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1494587646, "num_games_owned": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2345}, "timestamp_updated": 1506680348, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Pretty solid gameplay, I really like the storyline.
