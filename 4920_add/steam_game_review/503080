The interesting side effect of this story is that each kingdom is totally tailored to the type of person you are curing.  For example, one person is a painter, and all the puzzles and HOP's involve paintings and sculptures.  In another kingdom, you are curing a scientist, and all the puzzles and HOP's involve machinery and lab equipment.  I thought this was kind of neat, as it added a lot of variety to the game.\n\nGraphics - Decent, with a lot of little interesting animations to add to the atmosphere.\n\nHOPs - Good variety with list based ones, find x amount of one type of thing, and the put objects back into the HOP type.  One HOP that I particularly enjoyed was a circuit board where parts had been ripped out or damaged.  You had a list of parts and tools that you had to use to repair it.\n\nPuzzles - Like the other \"Echoes of the Past\" game on Steam, this game really shines in the puzzle and mini-game department.  It's packed with them, with tremendous variety and originality.  Most of them were even different than the previous \"Echoes of the Past\".  I love it when developers really put the effort into fun, original puzzles and mini-games, instead of just putting different graphics on the same old puzzles.\n\nFeatures - unlike it's predecessor, this \"Echoes of the Past\" does have a map, with instant travel and indications of stuff to do.  There is a hint system, strategy guide, bonus chapter, and more puzzles and mini-games in the \"Extras\" section.\n\nLength - About 6 hours on Advanced setting with no guide/hints.  Another 1 1/2 hours for the bonus chapter.  So quite lengthy as HOG's go.\n\nOverall, an excellent HOG, and highly recommended.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198076381670", "last_played": 1484863216, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 301, "playtime_forever": 480}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1484369203, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501660", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1484376370, "recommendationid": "29239520", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
