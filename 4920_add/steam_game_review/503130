I played this for about 10-15 minutes, and I'm already addicted. I love this game, and I reccomend.\n\nPro's:\n\n- Procedurally Generated\n- They all require a little practice\n- Awesome Music Loop\n- Cheap for the Ammount of fun you can get from it\n- And Requires Precission (Only some will like games like this)\n\nCons:\n\n- The Music Loop can get annoying, but there is a mute button for that! :D\n- Some of the Obsticles can be tricky, but that's where practice comes in.\n- Is it infinite? Is there anything to reach? Is there a goal? I don't know, maybe specify that.\n\n\nBut Overall, I really am enjoying this game, and I recommend to anyone who wants to buy games that take a little time and practice, but are really fun for a cheap price.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198316292308", "last_played": 1492637570, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_forever": 36}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1469352080, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502420", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1469352080, "recommendationid": "24495576", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "while its not your're normal type of game its a great time waster. something you can start if you have some time to kill before you have to catch a plane or somehting like that. the dev really listenes to the feedback you give (a bug report i made got into the first update) and the the game is just fun, though some times it can have table flip levels of rage in it. like the Impossible Game. though i also think its on the wrong platform. as yes its a GREAT game for PC i think it would work PERFECTLY with hand held devices like the Iphone. once it gets some traction here on steam i think it would be perfect for the mobil phones.
