I highly recommend this game to those that like this genre or just want something fun to play.\n\nThere are 6 different classes you can play as, each with their own unique set of spells.  You can also buy equipement, which are class specific, to use in combat.  You can also gain levels which increases their overall power and use tome points to level up skills.\n\nEach level you have to beat a boss to proceed to the next level.  The levels have multiple rooms, you go from room to room and fight enemies.  Along the way you may encounter NPC's that give side quests which will earn you gold and exp.  \n\nThe best thing about this game is you have AI party members that tag along and fight with you.  Very refreshing to see, you can swap between party members as well if you want to play someone different.\n\nOne issue I have is the lack of healing in the game, there's not enough potion drops.  This kind of forces you to exit the dungeon early because your party members will die and you're left alone.  You can finish the level alone, but it's not worth the trouble.\n\nFrom an hours to price ratio, you will definitely get your money's worth.  The RPG elements combined with the combat are very good and will keep you entertained for a long time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040837514", "last_played": 1472189656, "num_reviews": 50, "num_games_owned": 476, "playtime_forever": 218}, "votes_up": 17, "timestamp_created": 1472185613, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527412", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1472187565, "recommendationid": "25155209", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "so far im really likeing this game ive been searching and searching for a game like dragons crown and no beat em up has come as close to this so far as i can see the only flaw is there is 3 spells for each character that only go upto level 2 im only on 3rd lvl with hr n half playtime so things may change but as far as ur lookin for a great rpg beat em up then this is one to grab", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198125745288", "last_played": 1473635357, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 460, "playtime_forever": 538}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1472165317, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505129", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1472165317, "recommendationid": "25141553", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Having just found this game earlier tonight and decided to give it a shot because of the low price, I'm really digging it. It's very fun, the RPG elements are great, the beat 'em up side feels great, I like the cast you get to pick from, and the art is good, too. If they ever decide to add an online option for co-op or duels, I'd be able to test out multiplayer better, as I have no local friends to ask. But as it stands, I am glad I took a shot on this game.

I just finished New Game+ and enjoyed my time with the game. Takes a little getting used to because at the start it feels like you don't have much in terms of attacks, but once you figure out how to use the magic attacks and swap in and out allies, you can do some high level cheese to trounce your foes.\n\nAlso, even when you die, you get a little bit of XP to level up and you can keep your items and money found. You won't beat every level on your first try, but you will always be progressing toward your final goals.\n\nAlso, don't skip through the cutscenes and dialog, they are really funny.\n\nNot having online co-op stinks, but as long as you know that before you buy, you won't feel burned.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198062227881", "last_played": 1488024797, "num_reviews": 157, "num_games_owned": 285, "playtime_forever": 1031}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1472091615, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499814", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1474719120, "recommendationid": "25124419", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great game so far with good details and characters.
