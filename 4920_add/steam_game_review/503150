But in the end it was worth it.  Trek a derelict ship a few hundred light years in search of a place where you don't know where it is, only how close you are. I started out stacking my parts neatly. They burn out every jump or two, and you need to replace them.  With a few supply points or hostiles along the way. After failure after failure I was quickly frustrated. Stocked up on parts, shot by a pirate.  9 km away, life support failed. I was so angry in an hour after 50 failed missions I thought it wasn't possible. I was slinging the parts at the compartments, f stacking. Then on my \"last try\", which was about 5 last trys, I finally made it. In short this game is worth $3, unless you punch and break your $600 monitor.. 6/10.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961038549", "last_played": 1494402032, "num_reviews": 188, "num_games_owned": 4108, "playtime_forever": 101}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1494402258, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512368", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1494402328, "recommendationid": "31660859", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "game works now and it's pretty fun!
