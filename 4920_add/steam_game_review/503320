The story is boringly simple and unrealistic. The characters lack any form of depth or even worse they lack any kind of personality at all. The game fails to transport what it wants to tell you.. that... what? War is horrible? That people can drift apart in favour of other people? That bad things can happen to good people and good people can do bad things? If this is what the game wants to transport, it does it really, really poorly to the point that it was downright annoying to play for me. Moreover there are loose threads everywhere because a lot of things are just happening conviniently in favor of the story and are left forgotten afterwards. It\u00b4s definitely not worth the asked price. I bought it for under 1\u20ac and still think it wasn\u00b4t worth the money. \n(I played it twice for the ending choice - btw the only choice that changes anything as far as I can tell - but I played it in offline mode in case anybody is wondering about my playtime.)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198075556595", "last_played": 1503500728, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 194, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503500918, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490665", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1503500918, "recommendationid": "34440376", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
