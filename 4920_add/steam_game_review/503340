I tried the tutorial and already thought about a refund.\nBut then I started a multiplayer game, and I had one of the funniest time with my Vive to this date. I literally laughed my ass off at some times. \n\nThe game is straight forward, totally no-brainer.\nYou scan the area to locate players and weapons, then dig your way to them by moving and punching cubes.\nYou die a lot and frag a lot.\n\nPROs :\n- Easy to play, games are fast paced, it's instant fun.\n- Lots of (funny) weapons, \n- Environnements are fully destructible. They are just filled cubes made of smaller cubes, and you shape your playground with fists, bullets and explosions. \n- lots of masks to unlock (I don't know how yet, though).\n\n\nCONs:\n- There doesn't seem to need a lot of strategy nor skill... But that means that anyone can have fun, no Munchkin nor powergaming.\n- The motion system is weird (you move \"step by step\" forward or backward with no transition), but at least it prevents from motion sickness. I don't understand why you're not allowed to move laterally, though. \n- Everything is destructible, even covers, so roomscale covering and ducking do not seem to be that useful (you die too fast anyway).\n- The immersion is not the best I've seen (everything goes fast and moves are jerky, dodging and ducking seems useless -see above-, that does not helps make you really feel like \"you are there\") but the fun and clarity are there. \n\n\nSome moments to help you better understand why I recommend this game:\n\n- Stealing the weapon from the hand of your enemy while he is using it, and frantically punching him in the face while he desperately tries to steal it back (seriously, this should be a norm in all shooters this is hilarious). \n- Dodging bullets with a frying pan, and repeatedly knocking your adversary on the top of the head with it... And winning... \n- Throwing a grenade right in front of an enemy who hasn't noticed you, observing him watching it, freaking out, trying to flee then exploding. One Tex-Avery moment. \n- Targeting an enemy with a scan through the wall with a rocket launcher, that digs a tunnel right to the target who never saw it coming. \n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992525604", "last_played": 1474068227, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_forever": 436}, "votes_up": 17, "timestamp_created": 1471262007, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531964", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1471262007, "recommendationid": "24932548", "votes_funny": 13, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Engage in free-floating first person multiplayer combat in minecraft-style environments in Dig 4 Destruction, a room scale VR game for the HTC Vive (and possibly also the oculus touch). In each level, you fly around digging your way through walls to get to items, weapons, or just to get a better vantage point on your opponents. The sonar feature allows for all players to quickly and easily find each other making combat really fast and crazy.\n\nThe only downside to this game is twofold: It\u2019s a VR game, which means the community for it is very small AND the developers unfortunately made it so that you can do 4 player matches OR bot matches but not 2 players and 2 bots or any variation thereof. So try and get some friends to pick up this title at the same time as you if you want to get the full multiplayer experience.

COLOPL is an interesting company with legitimately good VR games, but their releases have been treated as one-offs, likely sponsored for development by HTC, and others by Oculus. We\u2019re looking at the finished product: it\u2019s doubtful there\u2019s a contract to develop the game further (but perhaps paid DLC should the game become popular?). This game is so close to filling the competitive multiplayer VR FPS void, but it ultimately falls short without official forums and the promise of more content. \n\nThat said, D4D is an insanely fun deathmatch shooter that takes place in destructible arenas littered with guns. The main locomotion is done by short teleports in the direction of the headset, which means if you want to run from a fight, you have to lose sight of your opponent. I wish all competitive, arena style games (Battle Dome) forced teleporting in the direction of the headset like this. With a teleport mechanic that uses the direction of a controller, it's way easier to dodge, and player movement becomes less predictable, and much more random. But in D4D, you can\u2019t teleport far, and you can\u2019t strafe, so you\u2019re forced to engage and fight when you finally find an enemy with your scanner, or turn and run. \n\nAs a finished product, it\u2019s totally worth the price. There are tons of unlocks, and the lobbies (if you can find one) are pure chaos.

You use your sonar to scan for weapons and enemies. It's very straightforward and easy to pickup for anyone.  Even if you are the best player ever you will die plenty and even if you are the worst...well you will probably get kills because that damn rocket launcher is so op if you get to it's spawn.\n\nIn all seriousness this game will be a very fun game to pick up and play a few games at a time and then put down and come back later. There is loads of replayability in this game.\n\nThe game feels like it could be a lot like rec room in regards to the social environment. The waiting area puts all the players qued up for the match in the same room where you can play chess, light fireworks, break ceiling fans (oops I mean shoot basketball), look in the mirror at yourself, and loads more.\nThere is in game voice chat so that you don't have to rely on gestures. I feel that in a game like this both social and competitive voice chat is something that is greatly needed. Without it you can't hear the person laughing on the other end which in turn makes you laugh and then everyones laughing at something that had there been no voice chat wouldn't have even been that great.\n\nAs you complete achievements you unlock new masks to put on your head, esentially it's your in game avatar.\n\nWhen you jump into a game you spawn in seperate corners and you start digging towards weapons. You can take your opponnents weapons from them if you're close enough as well! The whole game is so energetic and funny that it just works! There are several different weapons to use and try out, my personal favorite being the frying pan!\n\nI can't wait for more updates and players online!\n\nIn case you want to see the game in action linked below is my gameplay commentary of Dig 4 Destruction.
