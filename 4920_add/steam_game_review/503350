The way they implement them is very well, balancing wise. Sure, some moments might get frustrating, but if you know what to do, or a strat with a character, you will do well (probably). \n\nWhat I like about this game that seperates it from the couple others is that it's a bit of cat and mouse, and you can evade as well as you know you can and it can create moments where the player thinks he is safe, then gets attacked by surprise. It really makes for some interesting (also scary) moments. \n\nWhat I wish this game had: More players\n\nWhat I dislike: Due to RNG, sometimes the investigators just start finding 1 clue right after another and make the game really fast and end short. \n\nAlso: For example, dead by daylight, you chase and chase and chase. An interesting take from White Noise is that they really thought about how to seperate a group, and different \"creatures\" have ways of splitting of a group, or making them panick. Tight knit groups are sometimes reaaaally hard to break up though. \n\nOh and they also have some good looking faces. But also some really ugly ones. (Denali though ;))\nOh and they also make clothing free - so there's that! No loot box random bullshit. :D\n\n\n\nseriously though, more players needed if the game ever wants to take off.\n\n\nShould you buy this game ***right now*** in its current state and players?

They can be unlocked just by playing the game as you level up, all skins change status points which is really cool if your playstyle doesn't match a certain character, or you want to try a different build with that character, or even make the strong points of your character even stronger.\n\nCons:\n\n* Almost no physics in the movements of the investigators, they look like robots when walking around the map. They do \n   some facial expression when grabbed by the creature tho.\n* Not many active players. (it's always around 40 players online which is kind of sad, it's a good game and it's comunity is \n   very friendly to new players).\n* Lacks the feature to add investigator bots to the match.
