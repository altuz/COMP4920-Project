I could not even play it in May due to broken pathfinding! \n\ncons:\n\n- currently a little bit too easy. I do not actually know how to make a practice that would loose money, though I am enjoying seeing my clinic become an actual huge hospital. \n- too easy to quit out of the tutorial. I navigated into the wrong place, tutorial thought that I navigated into the right place, so it did not let me press any buttons until I would do a thing on a menu that I was not on and therefore could no longer get to it. Thankfully I could just quit the tutorial and figure everything out on my own (the game is not hard to figure out!)\n- currently (on the 9th of September) goals and emails are very split on progression. My current goal still has me locked out of placing hospital wards, however my current email is reprimanding me for not being able to keep the patients overnight and not building hospital wards. \n- one of my doctors got stuck after I turned half of his office into a bathroom. I cancelled his current activity, collected all the furniture from the room and put everything back in. That fixed it!\n\npros:\n\n+ you can build and run your own hospital!\n+ unlock goal system gently guides you in what you need to get so you don't get overwhelmed.\n+ unlike other games of this type, this game offers constant contracts - you send one of your workers to help out a different hospital for a few hours, they bring back money and improve their skills. Meaning, I was never stuck for too long being unable to build and expand my hospital (getting stuck being unable to expand my prison would constantly happen to me in Prison Architect)\n\nOverall 1 year in the game is finally in a propper playable state.

I will point out I have only played a small amount so far. It is a game I intend to come back to and invest more time in. I will admit I am a sucker for simulation and building games. You can see a first look video here of the game\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8--UpCWxaOA&t=117s\n\nOn to the review\n\nHospitalize is a fun little game with some interesting elements and a few flaws that don\u2019t impede it to much. Any memories of Theme Hospital are quickly removed as its set up as a \u201cserious\u201d building management Sim. The building element is simple and the icon to show where the user would stand to use equipment is something missing in a lot of other games in the genre. Hiring / firing staff is pretty much as expected as is managing the budget. Where Hospitalize is different is the mircomanagment you could diagnose a patient before your Dr if you feel like it. However you will need to expand the facilites available in the hospital to really get to the bottom of an illness. You do this buy unlocking levels and which each level new equipment. \n\nI will say the UI can often make or break a game like this, however in this case it has its flaws, but its functional. It wasn\u2019t so frustrating that I could not deal with it but it could do with some tweaking to make it a little more user friendly. \n\nAll in all I enjoyed my brief time with the game and I will re visit and replay soon.\n\nScott", "received_for_free": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198243614582", "last_played": 1505602588, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 261, "playtime_forever": 102}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505994732, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505994823, "recommendationid": "35102661", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I got to say this is by far one of my favorite games.  And I am excited where it is going.  The Dev's just anounced departments are coming and that is going to be great.  I would like to see a true sandbox mode just for fun to build a massive hospital without $$$ being a concern.  Maybe we will see that in the future.  But you should deff buy this game.  It brings me back to the good ole day's of playing theme hospital on the orinal playstation.  I would rent it from Block Buster Video... Yea many of you are to young to remember that place..lol But you will not regret purchasing this.  The Dev's are constantly squasing any bug's that we the players might find and really put effort into findng out what we the players want to see put into the game and then putting our idea's to work.
