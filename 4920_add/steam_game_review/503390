I really hope this group keeps on going. They made progress towards every complaint I have. For now it's still a not reccomended It's just too raw at the moment, but it is getting closer and closer towards a great game.\n\n[b]OVERALL[/b] Seriously this game has so much raw potential, but needs either 10 more coats of polish or a price reduction. When two of your three game modes are outshined by other games and your main game mode is basically stepping stones, you need to up the value of your game.\n\n[b]Concept[/b]; AMAZING a game without needing a teleport system, fantastic, the execution however not so much, you see that spinning rock thing, be prepared to do that A LOT and it's not smooth, you will feel like a drunkard if you don't thread the needle as the game does not reset position until you  step off that stone, so you step off at an odd angle the entire game zips back into place. A for effort D for execution, if nothing else give an option for teleport or a walk forward button as the arm swing is awful especially during combat.\n\n[b]Visuals[/b]; Amazing visuals, it's as pretty as it's touted in the trailer.\n\n[b]Sounds[/b]; Not awful, sounds like a generic fantasy game, Nothing to write home about.\n\n[b]Controls[/b]; could be better, \"hand position\" calibration option would be nice, and modified hitboxes as in survival when I'm reaching for a throwing axe I often grab the shield from my left hand instead. And the alternate movement method needs severe tweaking\n\n[b]Game Modes[/b] \nHere's the meat and potatos of any game. Right now this game is serving up potted meat and undercooked potatos\n\nTower mode, spinning rocks and drunken walks, this is the main game mode, while it is an appealing concept it was just so poorly executed, on the plus side it is the only game of it's kind so far.\n\nClimbing mode, Fun but only for a bit, climbing is hopefully incorporated in tower mode to actually give some purpose to the climb, Better option, hotdogs horshoes handgrenades gunnasium.\n\nSurvival mode, without any locomotion this is essentially a sub par version of the game hollowpoint, I say this because you will quickly find the only weapon worth anything in this mode is the bow and arrow, unless I really really missed something (maybe a better tutorial would help).\n \n\n[b]FINAL VERDICT[/b]\nThis game in it's current state is like having a hot girlfriend who wants to do nothing with you, sure you can stare at her and go oooooooooo aaaaaaaaaa but when it comes to playtime it leaves A LOT to be desired. Hopefully this will change in the future, the devs do appear to be active so it's not a lost cause.
