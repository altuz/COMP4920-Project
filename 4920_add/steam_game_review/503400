Widely.\n(For those who are easily triggered by religious references, and having religion poked fun at... you can stop now, and just walk away from the Store page. This game pokes fun at religious beliefs and practices. Big time. And I LOVE the dev for it!)\n\nNo list of Pros and Cons this time. I am just going to try and give a *hopefully* brief description of the game and why it was so good for me. I did say *hopefully*. Remember that later...\n\nThe art is fantastic. You are playing in a wonderfully weird amalgamation of paintings done by the Dutch Masters during the Renaissance period. Many images from one painting added to another, with somne subtle, and some not-so-subtle changes to the snippets. Weird. Wonderful. Artfully done.\n\nThe animation style and much of the humor is very Pythonesque. Not so much the movies (although I seemed to notice nods to The Life Of Brian and The Holy Grail... but that could just be my imagination and obsession with Monty Python...), but more the feel and look of the old Monty Python's Flying Circus. \n\nMuch Meta. Old style dialogues with modern, overly meta thrown in. Again, weird. Wonderful. As tastefully done as possible. Without being prudish. No other way to describe it for me.\n\nThe puzzles were clever. Who and what you needed to interact with, in what order, and in what time. Yes, you need to use your brain. None were terribly difficult to figure out, but some took more time than others. A few were wonderfully simple and silly. So simple it was too easy to overthink how to work it out. Which made me chuckle. Going through a very difficult time in my real life right now, and having a game that is very clever and intelligent, with silliness and simplicity mixed in, and all sorts of philosophical and existential \"standards\" being poked fun at... I needed this. \n\nMy experience with this game. I adore it. It was just what I needed to lift some very dark clouds. But for those looking for \"deep\" gameplay, quick and easy puzzles and achievements, or handholding and brainless completion... move along. This won't be for you. The 4.5 hours of gameplay shown at the time of this review was ALL gameplay, no idling for Trading Cards, no artificial inflation of time played. But... I walked through the game, I did not run. I allowed myself to explore all interactions I could, and look at every little detail I could. And I know I missed some. So I will play it again. Just to see what I may have missed. \n\n[b]Thank you Joe Richardson! You did a good thing here, and made this middle aged lady smile.
