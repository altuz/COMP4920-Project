If i had read description i would know this was not for me as it is only text quests.. I recomend this for people who want to play that kind of game\n\n\nLong time since i was so disapointed in a game..\nBuy \"Space rangers HD a war apart\" instead.. This is far from what you expect after playing that..\n\nSeriously the biggest letdown in gaming i have ever experienced...\n\nIm going to try to force myself to play it some more.. Hopefully there is somthing good about it further inn...\n\nIts only text quests... \n\n\nIll leave the recomendation because i like the franchise, but this is not a good game...\n\nEDIT: I expected a different game..
