This is not a complicated or lengthy review but tells you what you need to know when thinking of making a purchase of this game.  You get excellent graphics, good gameplay and a great soundtrack and the game pulls you in for repeated attempts at getting to that next level.  When you have had enough, you can come back to this game again and again.  Well worth the money,  8/10.
