So when I heard of this game, I really wanted to play it.\nSadly, its has a lot of things that are the exact opposite of super meat boy.\nThis game is about jumping trough levels, getting collectibles so you can go to the next level.\n\nFirst of all, every level is way longer than a single level in super meat boy. Now this wouldn't be bad if the checkpoint system was not that bad. But the checkpoints are sometimes in place just to fuck you over and they only save very specifically which of the collectibles you get. So if you take a detour to get an extra collectible, it still won't save it.\n\nSecond, sometimes the difficulty spikes at random. A certain level in world 2 game me only at that small points more deaths then I got in the first world only, only to be fine after that level.\n\nLastly is that the game doesn't feel precise. The wall jumping felt it wasn't exact every time I jumped off a wall. Your'e jumps seemed like it had a delay sometimes. Moving platforms that sometimes jus fling you right off. Bouncy platforms that randomize how high you jump, no matter how hard you press the button. And then there are the wooden platforms. You can't fall straight through them when you use a controller, unless you want to use the d-pad, but that makes it hard to make the jump that comes after that. \n\nThis game is hard and I get that, but it feels not precise enough for a platformer that seems to push speed for that hardcore players, but also for casuals. Mostly because you need a certain amount of collectibles to even get further in the game, and most of them are locked behind speed sections.  \n\nOne good thing. The bosses are good. It feels good to slowly learn the bosses pattern and jumping trough its attacks to defeat them. Sadly, this is not enough to play this game for.\n\nTL;DR if you like super meat boy, that doesn't mean you will like this game. This is not a casual game. This is for hardcore platform gamers that can live with sometimes imprecise controls and a game that has unforgiving level design. If that is you, maybe also look at Rex Rocket.

For example, the game emphasizes speed platforming, but level selection is tedious. You have to run around in an overworld map type thing instead of just being albe to press a \"next level\" button after completing an area.
