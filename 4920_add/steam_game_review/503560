You respond to emergencies and 911 calls, telling the services where to go. At the end of a \"day\" you get some money and you can upgrade the services, buy new cars and med helicopters, and so on.\n\nIf you actually know how to do first aid, it's a pretty fun game, as you can sometimes give instructions to 911 callers and they take care of the issue, without you requiring to send anyone to the location. Makes you feel all the hours you sat in training were worth it :P\n\nFor the negatives, some calls start to repeat, which breaks immersion. Sometimes the options for responses are limited badly; e.g. at one call I had the option to ask for an address in the first prompt, but didn't and through the entire lengthy conversation I didn't get a chance to ask for address and then the call ended and I had to wait for the call tracker to give me the address. \n\nThe voiceover for the guy you're playing as could be better too. In many calls he sounds very annoyed and unprofessional, and I just feel bad for the callers. I also wish there were a way to zoom out more.\n\nGet this game on sale, and it'll be a worthy buy.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198148360578", "last_played": 1505697853, "num_reviews": 53, "num_games_owned": 198, "playtime_forever": 273}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505670449, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500450", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505697071, "recommendationid": "35029367", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Decent game but has too little content at this point to be worth it's price. Give it some time to develop and this will be a great game! \n\nAt the moment during game play there is very little and very slow progress, from what I can tell there is very little difficulty scaling as well. 911 calls showed a lot of promise when I played my first 2-3 rounds but then I stopped recieving varying calls, it was the same 3-4 calls every round; \"My car was stolen!\" \"There's a man passed out on the pavement\" \"My stomach hurts\" and \"2/4 men are fighting\". Luckily there's an option to turn off the 911 calls and focus on task management, which is good but also sad as the calls kept the game interesting if it wasn't for the repetitiveness.\n\nWhen your work is evaluated and your points show up telling you how well you did I wish there would be some sort of briefing telling you what you could have done differently in certain cenarios, kinda like tips and tricks. For example; If all your ambulances are busy and there's a woman giving birth that needs help, it's ok to send a police vehicle to help out. I did this once or twice out of curiosity, which it's good that they let you do, but if you make a mistake you will be severely punished for it in the form of losing reputation which then results in you losing income which overall slows your progress greatly towards buying that extra ambulance that you need (Vehicles are quite expensive).
