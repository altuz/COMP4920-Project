What do you do in it? Plenty of things are shown in the trailer but I left the trailer feeling very confused. [b]So here's the large and short of it. The main meat of the game is a video game that you play as a 1980's kid called \"Duck Season\". This game puts you into the VR play space of the classic game \"Duck Hunt\".[/b] You shoot ducks out of the sky with a rifle and a silly dog collects them and dances around. The quality of everything in this game, and I cannot emphasize this enough, is amazing. The \"Duck Season\" game itself is large amounts of fun despite being so simple. This game also has a rather dark storyline that happens in between successful \"Duck Season\" play sessions. Every time you jump into the game, time advances and the story progresses a little farther but I'll get to that later. All this being said it is something that might be best for people who show VR off a lot. There is some replay value but for 20$ you're getting something that can be completed in about an hour.\n\n[h1]Duck Season Itself[/h1]\n\nAs mentioned previously the meat of this game is the \"Duck Season\" game within the actual game. Starting this game up literally inserts you into the TV where you shoot at ducks for points. You gain more points the more ducks you hit in a row. The shooting feels nice and does something that I've yet to see any game, VR or not, do. This is to say that your ammunition is visible as an outline when you look at your gun, it visually shows you how much ammo you have by outlining the shells in your gun which I absolutely adore as a way to show ammo in VR. When you shoot you have to pump to ready another shell and eventually grab ammo to put into your gun, again all of this feels great. \n\nMy main criticism is to say that beyond shooting at some ducks there isn't much more to the \"Duck Season\" game. I don't think there really is anything they could have added but if this is the meat of the game then I'm a bit disappointed. I have plenty of shooting sims already in my library and I'm conflicted as to whether or not I'd actually come back to this one over others. It's as if I've ordered the best ribs I've ever had and I get one solid bite before I'm done. Still, I have to say the quality here is without question one of, if not thee, best vr experiences I've had!\n\n[h1]The Rest of the Game[/h1]\n\nOutside of Duck Season itself you play as a 7-9 year old boy who is spending a summer evening in front of the telly. The game takes place over several in game hours. As you play Duck Season, VHS's, video games, toys, magazines and snacks will pile up around you. It can be kind of fun to screw around in front of the television with all this stuff. I personally made it a game to see how many things I could chuck at my mom in the kitchen before she might take notice to her son. [spoiler] After the succulent hit her in the eye, and she didn't react, I gave up.[/spoiler]\n\nThe other \"Kingbit system's\" games are all played with a virtual controller gun. You shoot at the options on the TV to pick them and none stood out as something I'd do more than once. Some are pretty silly even just as a title but it's pretty clear that they aren't meant to be done more than once or twice.\n\nThe VHS's you find are mostly meme's of one sort or another and all fit into the 1980's theme rather well. Some of these look to have been made just for this game and none of them are short on entertainment. My friends and I got a really good laugh at a few that were up and even recognized some old youtube videos that were neat to see in game.\n\nAll in all there isn't a whole bunch to do here, just some fiddling around in between \"Duck Season\" sessions.\n\n[h1]The Story and World[/h1]\n[i]Spoiler Free[/i]\n\nThe story is quite simple and short once you see and understand it but holds several surprises that I don't want to spoil. Bottom line, was it enjoyable? Yes! It quite certainly is. The 1980's atmosphere set up is great and the game had me looking over my shoulder nervously multiple times. Each session of \"Duck Season.\" Advances time outside of the game by an hour. Around 4 o'clock, odd things start happening. It's no secret if you look at any of the trailers or tags but this is in fact classified as a horror game. Much to my own delight though it at no point says or lets that fact on. So if you have friends that come over to play VR, or maybe family, you could just throw them in and see how they react. \n\nIt's not a terribly long story and we were able to finish it in about 1 hour although there was a lot of screwing around and we also had to retry one of the \"Duck Season\" sessions once as well as retrying the ending. Speaking of the ending there are seven of them. I've found two, the sort of \"bad ending\" and the \"canonical ending\". I scratch my head as to how you might be able to get the other 5 though. I'm sure some replay value can be found there as well as the \"New Game+\" option that opened up but that I did not try.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n[i] A clear work of love this game shines but not for long enough. 1 Hour of gameplay for 20$ just isn't what I want for my money[/i]\n\n\"Duck Season\" is one of the highest quality VR experiences that you'll find. It lacks quantity, variety and length but makes up for it all with the sheer amount of love put into each idea and piece of the game. The game is by and large shooting at ducks but it breaks this up often enough that it doesn't become monotonous. I think after the first playthrough you'll probably want to stop but I can't tell you how much fun that short experience is. I've said it previously and it's kind of my verdict here but I recommend this game for a sale. If you think people will play again or if you're dying for a \"shooting at things simulator\" then I can certainly understand a desire to buy it. That being said I wouldn't recommend a let's play if you're bound to pick this up at some point. The surprises just wouldn't be the same without VR there.\n\n\n\n[i]Based on a score from -5 to 5\na 0 is \"okay\" or \"non noticeable\"\na 3 is \"quite good\"\na -3 is \"quite bad\"[/i]\n\n[table]\n   [tr]\n      [th]Category[/th]\n      [th]Score[/th]\n   [/tr]\n   [tr]\n      [td]Graphics[/td]\n      [td]3[/td]\n   [/tr]\n   [tr]\n      [td]Gameplay[/td]\n      [td]4[/td]\n   [/tr]\n   [tr]\n      [td]Story[/td]\n      [td]3[/td]\n   [/tr]\n   [tr]\n      [td]Music[/td]\n      [td]1[/td]\n   [/tr]\n   [tr]\n      [td]Sound[/td]\n      [td]2[/td]\n   [/tr]\n   [tr]\n      [td]Replayability[/td]\n      [td]-2[/td]\n   [/tr]\n   [tr]\n      [td]Legnth[/td]\n      [td]1 Hour[/td]\n   [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\n\nBuy\n[b][u]Wait for Sale[/u][/b]\nWatch\nAvoid\nNever Touch", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 67, "steamid": "76561198061635839", "last_played": 1506751592, "num_reviews": 40, "num_games_owned": 383, "playtime_forever": 173}, "votes_up": 117, "timestamp_created": 1505598317, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670949", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1505599842, "recommendationid": "35007983", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "66 Mins first play though (not rushed)  Well polished fun game, just make sure you understand that it is not a long game.

Just the fact that this game dragged me in regardless should speak volumes.\n\nPros:\n\n- Beautifully crafted environments all around. Attention to detail glows in this game, from the wonderfully constructed cartridges & game boxes to being able to steal your mother's sandwich and eat it while she stares at you. These little actions go a long way in VR\n- Homages to the 80's help to sell the time period\n- Aiming the gun feels consistently fair\n- Minigames and VHS's that unlock between rounds keep the game fresh. Minigames make good use of the lightgun system so you don't feel like you're \n- 7 different endings\n- Game plays at your own pace. It only progresses when you choose to\n- You can grab just about any grabbable object no matter the distance. Just reach out towards it and use the force to pull it to your hands. Game cartridges and VHS's can be thrown or tossed into their players if they're out of reach -- overall, the game is extremely friendly to users with small play spaces.\n\nCons:\n\n- Compatability with Oculus Rift/AMD is a little sketchy. Constant crashing and artifacts at launch, but reaching out helped bring out a near perfect fix. Turned async and interleaved projections off and added \"-noaq\" as a launch option to the game - now it works as intended, but a few crashes still occur every now and then. Playable, but they're still there.\n- (SPOILER) [spoiler]Devs have stated that the dog only attacks you if you shoot him first. In my \"pacifist\" playthrough, I was still put through the horror segments when I absolutely least expected them. I did shoot the dog in a practice room, but I don't believe that should carry over to the main attraction. Possibly a bug.[/spoiler]\n- (SPOILER) [spoiler]The solution to the big dog boss didn't feel like it was communicated well enough. It makes sense in hindsight, but in the heat of the moment I had no clue where to begin shooting until I accidentally found the weak spot. Could've sworn that area would be invulnerable[/spoiler]\n- The shooting mechanics, as good as they may feel when you get used to using them, feel really awkward to use. Aiming is pivoted to your dominant hand as opposed to the hand on the pump, so in order to aim with both hands you need to lead with the hand closest to you as opposed to the other way around. It does force your hands to stay in the general areas they would be if you were really holding the shotgun, but it feels extremely unnatural.\n\nOverall, mostly due to the nature of the shotgun mechanics and how crashing still is a (slight) problem after troublehsooting, I believe this game deserves a strong 8/10. If the crashes are addressed in the future, make that a 9/10.\n\nI would like to thank the devs I talked to for being patient with me throughout the troubleshooting process. I usually don't reach out like this, but I'm glad I decided to this time.\n\nMy specs:\n\n- AMD FX-6300 3.5 GHz\n- 16 GB DDR3 RAM\n- AMD RX 480 8 GB", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 182, "steamid": "76561198014268772", "last_played": 1506023014, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 273, "playtime_forever": 905}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1505541690, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530726", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505542178, "recommendationid": "34988718", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Really enjoying this game, and feel its well within its price band.

It's a limited experience, but it has enough charming, bizarre, and often funny touches that I think anybody who grew up in the late 70s through mid80s will love.  It's very Adult Swim in its approach and presentation, and it's done well enough that it feels well crafted rather than a cheap ripoff.\n\nI do wish the environment was more explorable.  It would be really interesting if you could explore the whole house instead of being bolted in front of your tv.  It's a small criticism though because a lot of what makes this game work is its singular focus on making sure your relationship to the dog is strange and scary.  Once the antagonist was established, even if I was sure I was safe, I felt uneasy about what was going to happen to me.\n\nTo top it all off, the shooting gallery game feels pretty good.  Although, I did have some odd moments where my tracking (oculus 3-sensor setup mounted about 7.5 ft in the corners of my room) had difficulty sensing that I was trying to rack the shotgun.  While this portion of the game isn't the most unqiue, the stock stabilization mechanic does work well, and I hope to see similar implementations in future games featuring guns with stocks.\n\nI'm looking forward to playing through this game a few more times.  I'm a little worried that there's just not enough of the side content to keep me engaged long enough to see all the endings, but I suppose that's not such a big deal.  It's a fun, trippy, and well-crafted VR experience, and that alone makes it better than 70% of the VR stuff I've experienced so far.  If you don't mind that it's not a game in the tradtional sense then I highly recommend this game to you.  For most other people, I still think it's worth checking out if you have the money.  8.5/10 so far.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988928976", "last_played": 1505847613, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 159, "playtime_forever": 111}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505433090, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490385", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505433090, "recommendationid": "34960109", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
