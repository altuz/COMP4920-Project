The spell-crafting system is well-made, the speed and intensity of the gameplay rises as more and more enemies are thrown at you like cannon-fodder for the ridiculous spells you can make in this game. People say it has no replayability, yet I've spend almost 30 hours in it, and plan to sink many more. A little rough around the edges, but these developers have done something with this game (their very first!) so much better than some AAA perfectly-scripted, 4K resolution drudge.

Yes, there are rough edges. Very rough. The graphics are visually in the scope of Elder Scrolls: Oblivion: kind of blocky, not stunning in this day and age. The engine, however, runs smooth and satisfying. I blew up a whole town just for the fun of watching the buildings collapse.\n\nNow you can whine about the plot and storytelling, and that's acceptable for sure, but I think right now they're focused on refining gameplay. There's room in the current 'plot' to add in elements of a choose-your-own adventure (more than they already have, that is) that ends with you either being a Good Guy or and Evil Guy (ala Fable series). And they definitely need a better writer for the journal thing they have going on, because the person they have now is, uh, not great.\n\nAll that taken into account, in my opinion it's worth the $20 to see where this game could go. It has a good foundation to build on, and it isn't wasting time trying to be a massive open-world monster. And the combat is unbelievably fun and satisfying.\n\nScraping Bottom Games, if you're reading this: for real, get a better writer.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 82, "steamid": "76561198055654904", "last_played": 1506701968, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_forever": 149}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506091152, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495813", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1506091152, "recommendationid": "35129370", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
