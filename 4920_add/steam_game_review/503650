This remastered version adds new lighting and post-processing effects. I personally played the original release when I was a kid and thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\n[h1]The positive[/h1]\n\n- Steam Achievements\n- Cute and awesome aesthetic (kinda reminds of Toy Story)\n- Full of innocent humor and funny dialogues\n- Simple storyline and loveable characters\n- 7-8 hours of gameplay\n- Affordable price for a nostalgia fix\n- Fully voiced and subtitled in many languages\n- Pleasant soundtrack and ambient noises\n\n[h1]The negative[/h1]\n\n- Some very bad camera placements\n- Uneven difficulty. Sometimes easy, sometimes frustrating when you have no idea of what to do to advance in the story (e.g. a very specific and unique item is required and you need to find it without any hint)\n- UI elements (mainly the hand pointer) are too big even at higher resolutions leading to difficulties to accurately interact with the environment\n- Game crashes quite often (had at least 10 crashes in my walkthrough in release date build, might be fixed later on). Check the forum as well for performance issues, some people are experiencing some.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIt's hard to say that The Westerner aged well. While I personally feel that graphically the game is still enjoyable because of its aesthetic, the gameplay feels dated and can act as a big turnoff. I would personally recommend the game for younger kids although the lack of hints could very well lead them to frustration. I loved replaying through it because of nostalgia but I hardly believe many adults would enjoy it now as many objectively better 3D point&click have been released since. If you're a fan of humor and aesthetic \u00e0 la Toy Story and are willing to look past gameplay issues, go for it though, you will have a blast with this clumsy cowboy that is Fenimore.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970216718", "last_played": 1489446097, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 2847, "playtime_forever": 404}, "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_created": 1489440009, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497052", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1489447212, "recommendationid": "30497451", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I bought this game as it was re-released as re mastered and it looked like allot of fun.  The intro was fun to watch and made you want to get into the game. There is a nice story behind the game and lots of nice comic touches and dialogue. It was fun to play while it lasted but unfortunately for me it kept crashing on screen change.\nIn the end I had to ask for a refund because for me it was a game breaker.\nI recomend trying the game for yourself as it is fun to play.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLbO88QlwQQ&t=248s", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053184399", "last_played": 1489326062, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 31}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1490771699, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495649", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1490771699, "recommendationid": "30808588", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I prefer original version from 2003 :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198116447540", "last_played": 1504993338, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 225}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1496493486, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491981", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1496493486, "recommendationid": "32151582", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Good Ol' Days \ud83e\udd20", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197998288095", "last_played": 1489271234, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 172, "playtime_forever": 486}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1489270116, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464343", "votes_down": 18, "timestamp_updated": 1489270116, "recommendationid": "30457389", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
