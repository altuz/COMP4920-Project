As space ships cross a certain boundary, you see a colored circle get closer to a white circle.  When the ship is in perfect position for the beat, you shoot the circle and get the points.\n\nIf you try to shoot too early it just makes a \"bu-buu\" noise and if you try to shoot too late, well the target is gone so you missed.  There doesn't seem to be any real progression to the game other than get through a set number of waves until the end of the song. \n\nI'm not sure if the number of targets was supposed to go up as your accuracy went up or not.  Also there seems to be a variety of styles of ship targets but my favorites were the orange ones that sorta did a \"dolphin dive\" towards the camera.\n\nIt might be easier (or harder) using the head tracking to aim.  I used the vive controllers to aim (which put a little blaster ship over my controller).  It wasn't too bad and for the most part I hit the majority of my targets, but I feel like the game was too lenient on aiming at some times and too strict at others.  I'm not sure if that's a bug or if it has more to do with the timing of the shots.\n\nEDIT: So I tried it a bit with the head tracking aiming and in a way it's easier and in a way it's not.  The head tracking seems more accurate somehow, but when you're aiming with head tracking you're also having to look out of the corner of your eye to see where the next ship is coming from, while using the vive controller to aim means you are able to keep the whole field in view and aim accordingly.\n\nAnyway, I played a couple of the built-in tracks and shot a few hundred enemy ships.  It's somewhat fun, but it'll probably be better with your own music.  The music that's included is just kinda generic sounding somehow. It's not bad, but it just doesn't stand out.  As an example of a song that stands out: 5 minutes after playing \"Space pirate trainer\" for the first time, I had \"I AM THE ROBOT\" ingrained in my head.  Nothing in this game had any such impact.  I couldn't even hum one of the tunes for you.\n\nEDIT: I played a few of my own imported tracks and I have to say, the \"algorithm\" is pretty lame. I think what this game needs is a sort of \"edit\" mode where YOU get to choose the beats the ships come out on.  Even setting the game to \"frenzy\" mode seems kinda lame.\n\nStill, it's not bad, it could use improvement, but it's Early Access(tm). I'm not sure I'd want to pay $10 for it (I got it 10% off) but I've played far worse for less money. As for VR content, this game could be played just as well without VR.  Maybe he should market it MORE as VR capable but not required, or else do something to give VR more of an edge other than head tracking= better aim.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969913402", "last_played": 1479267700, "num_reviews": 149, "num_games_owned": 1966, "playtime_forever": 73}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1472282315, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1472955448, "recommendationid": "25176399", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I really, really like this game.  The VR experience is really cool, too.  I found myself importing all kinds of different tracks to see how the game would respond...next thing I knew, it was 45 minutes later.
