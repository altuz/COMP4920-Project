What I did not expect, however, was the lack of a functioning menu. This is a proof of concept in the earliest sense of the definition and does not warrant the asking price (discounted or not). \n\nThe video displays what options currently work (options can be accessed in-game) and demonstrates the combat. When you die, you can spawn back into the game, but will soon be forced to restart the encounter. Enemies can get stuck when they spawn, weapon fire sometimes doesn't register, there are no meters or icons that show your health and there is no key listing menu (which means trial and error trying to figure out how to switch single shot to full auto on the rifle). \n\nI will let the video speak for itself on the matter, but for the price, this just isn't anywhere near ready. I recommend waiting on this until a clearer picture is painted.\n\nThis has been a EAW PSA.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000561257", "last_played": 1476137245, "num_reviews": 87, "num_games_owned": 2901, "playtime_forever": 145}, "votes_up": 52, "timestamp_created": 1475290820, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554509", "votes_down": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1475290842, "recommendationid": "25792377", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
