There really isint much of a story and the game starts you off with absolutley no objective or idea what the hell it is youre supposed to be doing. items dont always make sense and the controls are weird. while the music is good the rest of the enviroments are just barren nothingness. nothing is described to the player in this game and nothing really makes sense or even has a purpose. honestly not even worth $3.

I like it alot. I did find a glitch or bug and it was to do with the food and wood. What happened was I killed a deer and then I was freezing!!!! O_O. So I had to get wood... I couldn't because of the food taking the inventory slot. So what I did what click on the food to get it out of my inventory and then I could pick up wood O_O. The food glitched into the wood.
