The finely photoshopped backgrounds that surrounded the supremely human and lifelike drawings kept me watching with a close eye. Especially the young girl character Alex, who will stay in my nightmares for many weeks to come. I was unable to finish this game, sadly, because the true horror of murder and all it's dirty details was too much for me to bear. I hope someone with a stronger heart than mine will venture forward with detectives knox, clark and don't forget ROBERT!
