You wake up plastered in a bar and set out to find your wife. Why you can't just go home and check to see if she's there is a pretty good question.\n\nMeanwhile, you have some money, which you don't ever need to spend. You can buy a weapon, but you can find the same thing all over the map for free. Once armed, you can kill everyone and I suppose all the other island residents just go, \"Well, that's Greather for you. Whaddya do.\" But when you kill an innocent, your Bounty rating goes up, making you think you're going to get into a GTA-style chase with knights and steeds. Don't worry, that doesn't happen.\n\nYou do get attacked by bandits constantly, though. All of the weapons barely have any range, but this is just one example of the nearly infinite realism of this game. You see, Greather's quite inebriated, so swinging a battle axe more than three inches in front of him is a tall order.\n\nSometimes you encounter a friendly NPC who's happy to tell you to go to the complete other end of the map to 1) retrieve a trivial item or 2) find your wife. It's not a big map, but it feels gigantic due to (again) Greather's stumbling drunk  gait.\n\nWhich brings me to the true reason to play this game: Greather himself. He is a hoot. You'll never love a character quite as much as you love Greather when he says, \"Ooooouuurrrrgghh my head do hurt,\" or \"Off I go, then.\"  That's really the *only* reason to play this game.\n\nI won't spoil the ending, but suffice it to say it makes about as much sense as the game world into which you awake.\n\nI'm recommending it though, because this game is a million times better than almost every other unity or gamemaker game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993010181", "last_played": 1498523581, "num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 502, "playtime_forever": 75}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1498524419, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515529", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498524419, "recommendationid": "32836706", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}]}
