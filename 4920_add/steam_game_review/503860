While it has a bit of an initial difficulty hump to get over due to somewhat complicated rules, it will reward you with a good ten or so hours' worth of premade levels and a puzzle randomizer that does a good job of extending its longevity.  Recommended with great confidence for other fans of more number-based puzzle games.\n\nLONG VERSION\n\nThis is the rare occasion where my scanning of the Steam new releases every day pays off. Patterna as far as I can tell has received little press or reviews, but it happened to mention that it was inspired by Hexcells in its store description. That was enough to get me to try the demo, which was enough for me to pick up the game.\n\nIt isn\u2019t really a ton like Hexcells, although it does share some of the same DNA. It\u2019s also rather tricky to explain. This was updated later but initially the tutorial was fifty or so stages long and it is undeniable that there is a bit of an initial hump to get over. I couldn\u2019t even follow the couple videos showing off the game before playing through said tutorial.\n\nThe basic goal is to mark every node in a puzzle as either pattern or non-pattern. In the vast majority of puzzles these nodes are all interconnected via a web of connecting lines in a variety of patterns. There are a few sources of info upon which to determine the orientation of the nodes. In the bottom left corner there are a pair of numbers, the larger number indicating how many nodes have yet to be marked and the smaller (or when near finished even) number indicating how many of those nodes are pattern ones. Above those may be one of four colors (which can be customized for those who are colorblind or just like to mess with the colors). These will have two numbers associated with each of them that function the same way as the aforementioned ones, just relating to those nodes with a marker of that color on them. It is worth noting that some puzzles may have no colors, some just a few, and others where the number will change as you progress.\n\nThe other main source of info is on the nodes themselves. Pattern nodes may have a number on them that indicates how many pattern nodes are connected in sequence without a non-pattern break. Worth noting here is that some connecting lines only transmit info one direction, so while a pattern node can continue to \u201ccount\u201d while going along an arrow way it will not register a connection if trying to go against it. Meanwhile non-pattern nodes can contain a wider array of info. A number on a non-pattern node indicates that said number of nearby nodes are pattern ones. A single circle around the number indicates that said number only relates to those nodes within one connection of that particular node. If it instead has two or three circles around the number, then the range expands to every node within two or three connections of it. Said numbers may also be within brackets or a pair of dashes. If in a bracket then all the of pattern nodes indicated within that range must all be connected, while if within dashes then there must be at least one break between them.\n\nOn top of this as you unveil more nodes as either pattern or non some of them will likely give you additional bits of info. This can be any of the bits of info mentioned in the previous paragraph, but occasionally one of the non-pattern ones will unveil a colored number. When you get one of these a number of the unmarked nodes will suddenly get a marking of that color and said color will also appear on the bottom left.\n\nFortunately the game does give you a few tools to help make dealing with all of this easier. By clicking on one of these numbered nodes every node they can possibly affect becomes highlighted in one of four colors, as up to four nodes can be activated as such at a given time. This is a handy way to see which nodes\u2019 info overlaps as often that is the key to solving part of the puzzle. I must note to be careful with the pattern node highlighting as it shows not only all the ones the pattern can extend to but also the ones one node removed as if you know it will be three nodes long you also know the fourth node must be non-pattern. Just because you see the number 3 for example on a pattern node doesn\u2019t mean that there are going to be three nodes in the highlighted range that will be marked as pattern; it could be less if marking one node connects you to another pattern group, it could be more as certain perimeter ones can end up being pattern ones while not actually connecting to the numbered group. An update also gave one the ability to preliminarily mark a node as pattern or not so you can see how it\u2019d affect things without having to commit to it first. This is profoundly useful at times.\n\nNow, that\u2019s a lot of typing up just to get the rather complicated basics established. It can also mostly be skipped (shoulda mentioned that beforehand\u2026). What is ultimately important is how strong the puzzles designed around those basics are, and I must say that the ones in Patterna are on average very well realized. They are broken into groups based around a given concept or arrangement that have their own difficulty curve, which range from \u201cnot too hard\u201d to \u201coh god my brain!\u201d. If I had to level a complaint against them it is that some of them felt like they had to be brute forced after a certain point, although it is certainly possible that if I was a bit more clever that would have been less common. Even with that this is a very strong set of puzzles that should challenge a player for likely a good ten or so hours.\n\nWhat nudges it to a higher level is that it has a random puzzle generator that regularly produces puzzles that may lack a layer of refinement seen in the better premade ones but that are nonetheless on average pretty good in their own right. I\u2019m generally not a big fan of randomized design, and even in Hexcells Infinite the random ones left me feeling a bit cold, but they work well here and you are given a decent amount of options to tweak before generation. There is also a Steam workshop integration that is collecting dust as\u2026 well the game has gotten like zero press.\n\nAnd that ends up being a shame as this is pretty strong numerical puzzler all things considered. My Steam playtime puts me at about 30 hours after a few weeks, and while that is inflated due to me minimizing and doing something else on the computer from time to time it really sunk its hooks into me. If you like these type of puzzlers then I would strongly recommend at least giving the demo a shot as I\u2019d hate to see such a good game never get a legit chance to find its audience.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025780355", "last_played": 1478933007, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 219, "playtime_forever": 2457}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1477977752, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502600", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1477977752, "recommendationid": "26348854", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Did you like Hexcells but felt that there weren't enough ways it could bend your brain?

The puzzles are designed to be solved by pure reasoning, i.e. at any point there is at least one logical next step that can be deduced without guessing.

Nodes are not related simply by lying next to each other, but may be connected freely by edges. Some of the rules are rather complicated and may be confiusing at first, and the difficulty ramps up pretty quickly even during the tutorial. It took me well over 20 hours to perfect all included levels. The game includes Steam workshop support, but as of now there is virtually no user-generated content. The random level generator can create some pretty decent puzzles, though, when the parameters are properly tweaked.\n\nEdit: One day after posting this the tutorial has been completely overhauled.
