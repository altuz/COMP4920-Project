Even the control scheme (where you guide your units using arrows) and special abilities (such as a defensive shield or a 180 degree turn) are nearly identical to Steambirds. \n\nAfter requesting an options menu be implemented, the developer readily responded and added one. The options menu now lets you set music and sound effects, as well as resolution, advanced effects, and gives you the choice to play in windowed mode.\n\nDespite my harsh comparison to Steambirds, the fact remains that Star Tactics is an entertaining, albeit somewhat simple, game. It's not meant for people to spend all day playing, but for those who have limited time and want to play a game in short spurts.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend Star Tactics, so long as you realize you're getting a relatively simple strategy game.
