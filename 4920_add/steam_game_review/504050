Spent ages ignorantly mining for minerals.  Assembled something like a hovel.  A techno-hovel.\n\nBuilt a vehicle.  It was terrible; bad center of gravity, bad design, flipped, rolled, got stuck.

Resource rate went up further.\n\nBuilt my third vehicle.   It was fast, it had a high wheel base, it never flipped.\n\nDrove straight to the north pole.\n\nAn hour or so later, I was dying from cold and toxins on the edge of a mountain at the magnetic north. I managed to survive, headed for home, heavily laden with precious metals and optimism.\n\nOn the way back I discovered a beautiful hidden valley amongst the cold and ice.  Decided this would be my new home.\n\nUpon my return to home base I refueled my scout vehicle, manufactured supplies, upgraded my equipment.  It was time; I proceeded to carefully plot out the ideal route to the valley for a very heavy vehicle. Using my scout car I carefully placed a dozen solar way-beacons along the ideal route.  I couldn\u2019t risk any flipping or forced abandoning for what would come next.\n\nThis was the biggest vehicle yet- ten wheels, four for steering, a massive container for all my worldly goods.  Over two stories in height, she was huge. I Disassembled my sprawling base, all my items. Apprehensively I even tore apart my trusty scout car.\n\nEverything was loaded into this one giant vehicle.\n\nI have about an hour of frustration and driving ahead of me, I will get back to that valley and start my new life.\n\nRecommended for people with imagination, people that like to build things and people that want to support growing projects.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976388305", "last_played": 1505655605, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 275, "playtime_forever": 5343}, "votes_up": 17, "timestamp_created": 1504933383, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524054", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504933548, "recommendationid": "34829295", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I am 83 hours into this game. \n\nThings I am really enjoying: \n\nVehicles - LOVE IT! I finally came up with a design that is fast, has plenty of storage, can climb pretty much anything at a good clip and doesn't flip over every 5 mins. Pretty much the entire planet is accessible by vehicle. It super easy to jump in and out to collect resources. I absolutely love zipping around to see what is over the next hill or around the next bend.\n\nAmbient sounds - my favorite time is sunset. When I am out in the wilderness I will stop and find a good vantage place to watch the sun go down and the moon come up. The sounds really sell the peaceful feeling of that time of day. \n\nDifferent biomes - Vehicles are fun but there would be no reason to drive around without new things to see and discover. Found a tropical area with HUGE trees and sandy beaches today. Had to throw down a marker, because I decided i needed to build my next base there because it was so goreous.\n\nCrash sites/ datapad journals - Another reason to explore. I can't pass any of these markers up. Especially like that ones that have data pads and sites that have tiny bases set up. I am absolutely COMPELLED to expand these little bases and fix them up and create my next outpost.\n\nbuidling basees and Conveyor system - lets you link up storage to your machines so you are not constantlyi having to fill hoppers in each devide to build stuff.\n\nDev Support - these guys are super nice and very responsive to suggestions, bugs.\n\nThe future of this game is very bright.

Still early access obviously but it compares well to the competition. It's SP only and I have no issue with that - actually bought the game specifically because the developers said they were abandoning MP. MP requires a whole different approach to balance and almost universally degrades the SP experience. Take Conan and ARK as examples; both need mods or significant changes to make them playable SP because the balance is geared towards MP. \n\nThere's numerous biomes on the world and travel is neccessary. There's no one ideal place. Resource gathering is a good balance, it doesn't feel like a grind. Combat is still developing, currently you have no real way to fight any of the serious enemies save running them over - which they can't fight back against. There's only 1 weapon you can create and it's like 3 clips per enemy for anything challenging enough you'd need to shoot it - and clips are very resource intensive. By the time you kill all the beasties in a nest with the gun the first ones you killed have probably respawned making it pointless. \n\nBase building is excellent already, which is a very good sign. All in all it's a good entry into the field and it's starting out with a point - build a starship to get off the planet. The whole 'why' aspect of it is missing from many games still. \n\nIf you're good with early access and want a good 'stranded on an alien planet' survival game, this is an excellent choice and the developers have clearely laid out goals and have kept up with the updates. Good odds on this one being a finished game.

They are all pissy because of no multiplayer.  This game is in the Alpha state and it's VERY playable.\n\nThe Devs decided that it was going to be a single player experience and not a multiplayer one.  It's THEIR game!\nIt could change in the future but after Space Engineers\u2019 growing pains trying to make it multiplayer I'd rather play a game that works instead of it being broken for months because they got pressured into multiplayer.\n\nOk, that said, the game starts you out on a planet.  This is Alpha so there's only one planet for now.  I'm ok with that because there is lots to do.\nYou get out of your pod and try to survive which is very doable because you have planets to eat until you want to go after meat.\n\nThe weird looking creatures are (imho) placeholders for now.\nAfter finding/mining iron, and minerals, you can build a base.  This consists of separate floors, walls and ceilings, kind of like Fallout 4's building system.\n\nNext you add a generator and connect it to several machines you can build.  \n\nIf you want to get a feel for the game, Kage848 over on YouTube has done a few lets plays.\nRandomise User over on Youtube can teach you how to get started.\nOf go read their forum pages to see that they are updating the game almost weekly.\n\nIt does has some frame rate issues that are present in any new game.\n\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend this game if you're looking for some fun.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "steamid": "76561197973149646", "last_played": 1507117612, "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 100, "playtime_forever": 4198}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1504876927, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503047", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504876927, "recommendationid": "34814442", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Even at this early development of the game, I have to say it is very good.  I have had no performance problems since starting to play and I have over 30 hours of play time.  The build system is as good as I have seen for most games and it is still pre-alpha.  The variety of structures you can build is litterally up to your imagination.  As far as the vehicles are concerned, the physics are good and the reward for exploration is adequate and maybe a little too easy.\n\nThe biggest challenge in the beginning will be food and water (of couse).  Like any survival game, water, food, and shelter will be the priorities but the game is generous by providing the escape pod from the beginning.  Once water, food and shelter are under control, you will have plenty of time to experiment.  I highly recommend using the creative mode to experiment with vehicles because you are restricted at first by the materials you have access to.  That said, even with the basic materials, you can build almost any wheeled vehicle you can imagine.  I am looking forward to watercraft and aircraft.  I have seen video of a monorail system which looks great and would be a real challenge (all of the components have to be made from the available building blocks).\n\nThe concept of a mobile fortress is a great concept as well.  The player will have to find enough Xaenite but that is part of the fun and it can be done if you manage your resources with that in mind. \n\nJet packs can be upgraded as can the multitool; there is also a rifle now which is handy for the wild life that is entirely hostile and will react to your presence if you get too close or disturb its protected habitat.\n\nPros:\nThe build system has a fairly steep learning curve but creative mode is a great place to get used to it.  Once you get used to the build system, you should be okay in Story mode.  This cannot be overlooked and if you want to drastically reduce your frustration level, you should definitely use Creative mode to learn the game mechanics. Creative mode is a plus and without it, the frustration of the learning curve might be too much for some; creative mode is a ;us.\n\nSwimming is a thing and your vehicles can move underwater so you sort of get watercraft if you accept that; just watch out for crevaces.\n\nMultiple energy sources give you the flexibility to keep weight to a minimum which helps when designing vehicles.\n\nThe conveyor system is nice but it does require a lot of resources so be ready for that.\n\nCons:\nI would like to see a vehicle design function where you can save designs and export those for use in Story mode.  That would save a lot of time and only be stricted by the available matierials which you would still have to collect.\n\nI have had no hangs or crashes during game play with the current build; however, the game did hang once when loading from a saved game which was easily rectified by restarting the game..\n\nThere is no way to raise the terrain in order to level the ground out by building it up in some cases.  Being able to build up and/or smooth the terain would make a lot of sense in a game like this considering some of the advanced technology.  I expect this later and would be surprised if it wasn't added.\n\nThe graphics are not state of the art as yet but still very nice and I appreciate the fact that they are what they are which allows for better screen rendering of distant objects and better video performance overall.\n\nBy far my biggest complaint (and not that bad really) is the reduction of frame rate.  After playing for a few hours whithout stopping, you will likely notice a declining frame rate.  This is not a big problem as you can save the game and reload to resolve it.  I am sure the developers know about this and will optimize the game to account for this.\n\nI would like to see an away-from-keyboard (AFK) feature because you will die if you leave the game for an extended period of time; starvation and dehydration are real concerns and will kill your character.  AFK mode would prevent that.\n\nMultiplayer:\nI am not sure if this will be a thing in the game but it is not an issue for me.  I understand if it is for some because multiplayer would add a considerable amount advantages with regard to resource collection and planet exploration.\n\nConclusion:\nI realize the early game had a lot of problems (I did not play it before the current release 0.7.4) so bear that in mind.  The reviews prior to the last two version updates seem bad but the game has seen remarkable improvement (if the early reviews are accurate).  The price, 19.99, is not a hardship and for early access, well worth it.  I have purchased much, much worse for more money (a certain ******sky comes to mind).  Give Planet Nomads a try.  If you keep the fact that this is pre-alpha, I don't think you will be disappointed.  Each new update holds the potential to make this game even greater.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1562, "steamid": "76561198164966849", "last_played": 1507170364, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 19, "playtime_forever": 4391}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505828419, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502673", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505828419, "recommendationid": "35064609", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Finally an Survival/Build game without magic weapons and armor.\nBuilding the tools to get the ressources to build the tools to get better ressources, it is very well thought out.\nIf the Devs go on like that it will be one of the Classics, nuff said, five  thumbs up out of two.\nRight now still some parts missing that would be great but given it is in development it is GRANDE.\n\nOh and guys, do something about beacons, the compass is a mess as soon one has more than lets say 6.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 572, "steamid": "76561197994475018", "last_played": 1506406661, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_forever": 11620}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504683841, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500079", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504683841, "recommendationid": "34771191", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I gathered mats and cusomised an all terrain vehicle that could go anywhere, built another truck both having becons with the same letter because they only go from A-G and when i came back to my base the truck and all the mats just disapeared.
