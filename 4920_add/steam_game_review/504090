Great fun with friends. It's mostly focused on different variations of deathmatch where your only weapon is a grenade (or grenade variant). You can get all that from the trailer, so here's a few points that stood out to me:\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] \n-Numerous modes ranging from simple deathmatch to destructible floors to a form of basketball featuring a throwable pug.\n-A couple different grenade types to pick up in most levels.\n-Story mode (featuring all variations of levels and boss fights) or quick play.\n\n[h1] Secrets [/h1] \n-A fair amount of secrets to find throughout the game.\n-Intentional secrets such as gold/silver grenades (collectibles) and hidden weapons.\n-Unintentional (but still fun) \"secrets\" such as out-of-bounds or advantageous spots in levels.\n\n[h1] Boss Fights [/h1] \n-Patterned bosses that don't pose much of a challenge.\n[spoiler]-Only two boss fights (which is the same boss at two different points in the game). [/spoiler] \n\n[h1] AI [/h1] \n-Obviously the game works best with 4 humans, but AI is there to fill in the gaps.\n-Brainless on Easy, mostly ignored on Medium (never tried Hard).\n-Occasionally get stuck in places and become free kills.\n\n[h1] Inspirations [/h1] \n-Heavily inspired by N64 games.\n-Audio sounds a lot like Banjo-Kazooie and similar titles\n-World layout and level unlocks are very similar to Mario 64.\n\n[h1] Bugs [/h1] \n-Quite a few minor bugs, but nothing gamebreaking.\n-Bugs generally didn't affect the gameplay at all.\n\n[h1] Capture the Pug [/h1] \n-The \"basketball\" mode.\n-Honestly a minor thing to bring up, but it's very hard to score so the matches often lasted a long time.\n-My least favorite game-type (breakable floors being my favorite).\n\n[b]Prefer watching instead of reading?

Period. \nThe Doom-esque gameplay fused with grenade throwing madness makes this game a true masterpiece. \nWell done pixel graphics and simple music scores make up perfect backdrop for ruined friendships.\nThe game is filled with countless options to keep multiplayer gameplay fresh, and a fairly extensive story mode (basically incentivized multiplayer matches that allow you to unlock all the maps in the game).\nIf you aren't looking to spend too much dough, but still want a great time with your friends, you can't beat 3..2..1..Grenades.\n\n10/10!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063842792", "last_played": 1503807802, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 187, "playtime_forever": 390}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500785363, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500785363, "recommendationid": "33736201", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
