First of all, each of the 4 coaster rides were unique.  I had fun looking around and noticing little details as I was whizzing by at break neck speeds.  \n\n3 of the 4 rides were good.  Only 1 ride was subpar.  The subpar ride was the one in space.  It should have been the best, but it was hard to ignore all the  big asteroids cluttering the vastness of space.  And they seemed like they were a little too big and the constant explosions from their crashing into planets was okay at first, but was very annoying by the end of the ride.  [u] It took me 11 minutes to finish all the rides together [/u]\n\nI do recommend this for any VR rollercoaster fan.  These are very unique and mostly fun rides.  \n\nRating 6/10 the price should be $1.99 at most given the content", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1505872794, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505873378, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505873378, "recommendationid": "35075851", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
