In co-op, it's more complicated: half of Sam's body is assigned to each player, and even simple tasks like walking require close coordination to pull off.\n\nThe game itself is quite funny -- its take on the personification of Death particularly so -- but a lot of the laugh-out-loud moments in the early levels stem from mistimed button presses and lack of familiarity with the controls.  Such failures become less funny and more frustrating as the game progresses, but never enough so that we wanted to stop playing.\n\n[i]Manual Samuel[/i]'s controller support is great, and worthy of an honourable mention.  My wife and I played with one Steam controller and one PS4 controller, and the game was smart enough to show the correct button prompts from different controllers for different players.  This small touch was very much appreciated, and something that I wish more developers took the time to do properly.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197977499625", "last_played": 1505673473, "num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 269, "playtime_forever": 127}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505674596, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505674596, "recommendationid": "35030746", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "With controller this game super fun.
