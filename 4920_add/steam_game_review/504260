I shared a link to it with a friend just to joke about how weird it f#cking looks. He joked about gifting it to me as a joke, and at the end days of the Summer sale, he actually did it. And holy f#ck, what a let-down this thing is. Now sure, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect from it, but the whole game falls flat on my opinion. And as I usually do, I'll start by talking about it's negative points.\n\nFirst and foremost, the gameplay. It's f#cking boring. Have you ever played Arkanoid? Then this is it. The bulk of the gameplay is the exact same f#cking thing. And the worst part is, it's easy as hell until you reach higher levels, however to reach higher levels you gotta keep playing for 10 minutes in a game where even when you try to get yourself killed, it doesn't seem to happen.\n\nSecond, is the gimmick with the LSD-like effects. Sure they look cool, but the novelty of them wears off stupidly fast. Here's the thing: the game on itself is boring and easy, adding those effects makes it nearly impossible to see what's happening... But it won't matter because of you hold the trigger and move in one direction while spamming A, you'll still last for 15 minutes despite not knowing what in the actual f#ck is happening. What's the point of the effects? To make it harder? To look cool? Who knows, but it really doesn't do much to enhance the gameplay, it's just there as a selling point.\n\nThird, the price. 3\u20ac ain't too bad but you'll expect a game this kind of average to get some sort of good deal during big sales such as the Summer sale, which might I add, for most people it's the biggest one in Steam. Well, not for this game. All it got was a miserable 15% discount with is nearly unnoticable. I even though of buying the game myself before the sale if it did get a good discount but 15%? Even games that got released months ago got better discounts. And honestly, the game isn't worth neither 3\u20ac or 2,40\u20ac. Maybe 1.\n\nLastly, the game looks... Kinda bland. Not talking about the seizure-inducing effects, those look cool, but the rest of the game? All enemies are a variation of smiley faces either straight or turned upside down, the backgrounds rarely change the balls are those same MS-Paint-looking smiley faces but green and at times with hats, most of it looks bland as hell, like something straight out from the deepest parts of the Steam Greenlight. \n\nDoes the game have anything good though? Well...\n\nThe game works well with controllers. It's to be expected though, since as far as I'm aware, it was released first on Xbox360 and then re-released on Steam.\n\nThe dev/s did put a lot of effort on the LSD-like effects and the sounds. And for that they should be deeply commended.\n\n...But I honestly can't think of anything else. I haven't played this game much, yeah. But there isn't really much to see before you've seen it all. The whole game is all about some amazingly looking effects that don't really add up much to the whole experience. Maybe it's fun to play this while high, who knows. But you gotta be high as hell on my oppinion to play too much of it. I sure as hell though, gonna tell my friend to look if he can refund gifts.\n\nTL;DR Edition: Cool effects and sounds on an underwhelming pong game that's not even pong, IT'S F#CKING ARKANOID with smiley faces all over the place. The whole game is based around the novelty of having seizure-inducing effects that won't let you see sh#t. It's a cool concept but executed poorly. Couldn't even stand an hour of this thing before I got sick and bored of it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000002116", "last_played": 1499264148, "num_reviews": 128, "num_games_owned": 292, "playtime_forever": 27}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499420524, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504249", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499420524, "recommendationid": "33337896", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
