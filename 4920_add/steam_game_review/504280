It consists basically of juggling three different buttons over a range of countries that you're currently trying to capture to get your influence up, recuit more military, and reduce their stability. You can pretty much see from the screenshots all that you have to do is summed up by those 'add' buttons in the lower hud. There are no historical events, no diplomacy, no nuclear weapons at all, and the space race consists entirely of paying to advance along a set of images that give you extra global influence. Oh, and there's no save and load function either so you have to finish your game in one go - it lasts a bit over an hour. Another thing that's missing is any progression of military technology, which they aim to add in a future (paid I assume) expansion, but as for what they're selling now it's pretty stripped down.\n\nIt's kind of like a board game, but not a very good one. If you want to play a game like this, you'd be much better off with Twilight Struggle, plus you can play it with a friend. I seriously doubt I'll ever play this game again.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000715622", "last_played": 1484688470, "num_reviews": 34, "num_games_owned": 829, "playtime_forever": 762}, "votes_up": 49, "timestamp_created": 1473534562, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573305", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1473534562, "recommendationid": "25448906", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Update: I wish I could give this game a neutral review for now. Gameplay is minimal but could be interesting once understood. Shame there is not tutorial. Information flows along fairly fast so tracking it all is a bit of a head ache.
