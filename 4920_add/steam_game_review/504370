The problem is that they have zero sense of where there priorities should lie.  They continue to monotize skins and other pointless trash while listening to the absolute WORST section of the player base on balance issues.  The game is continuously being balanced around the premise that the players that have the least amount of skill should be granted the loudest voice.  Thus far this has ruined more than one character in the name of \"balancing\" the game so that people that have barely dipped their toes into gold ELO are dictating which characters should and shouldn't be viable.  \n\nThe game has a solid framework but it has a serious healer problem (i.e. healers are absurdly strong relative to the majority of the roster). Couple that with the fact that it was supposed to go FTP literally months ago you have a nearly dead player base while the remaining bottom half of those left act like a bunch of petulant children that whine about things they can't figure out counters to and so SLS nerfs them into non-viability.  \n\nThe cherry on the s*** sunday is the fact that the game has ZERO anti-cheating measure implemented.  It's fun watching Jumong and Varesh blind-poke over walls all day when you change direction five times and they still catch you in the center of every AoE ability they throw.  \n\nSo much wasted potential in this title.
