The graphics are actually quite good and most of the Hollywood caricatures are recognizable. I also liked the built in 'hint system' that you can activate by pressing the middle mouse button. It will light up every item in the scene that you can either pick up or interact with. And if your inventory is open it will show which items you can use in the current scene. It's not a flawless system but I've managed to finish the game without resorting to a walkthrough mostly because of this hint system. \nUnfortunately there are also a lot of things that annoyed me:\n[list]\n[*] Regular typos in the subtitles\n[*] Many lines of dialogue are literal translations from the original Czech and make little sense\n[*] Some of the voice acting is off, lines are read with the wrong pronounciation or intonation\n[*] Most of the cameos look, sound or act nothing like the celebrities they're imitating\n[*] Detective Hayseed is supposed to be a backwards hick detective yet sounds like a regular American instead of speaking with a southern drawl or sounding more like Andy Griffith, Owen Wilson or Keanu Reeves. He's also way to effective from start to finish and bypasses all obstacles without any problems. Like the way he builds an actual laser weapon in the beginning of the game. He also owns a spy watch that actually works (though it's under used), exploding bubble gum (never leave home without it) and a flying car! None of the fictional detectives complaining about not getting the job could have topped that.\n[*] Plot makes no sense at all for anyone who knows a little bit about how the actual Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences works (or to anyone with access to the internet, in other words: everybody): the oscars have been manufactures by at least three different companies in the past, the president of the acadamy is elected for a year with a maximum of four consecutive years and the names of the winners aren't on the statues at the time of the Oscar ceremony in order to prevent the names from leaking out, they are affixed after the ceremony. Knowing these facts completely destroy the plot since it hinges on the assumptions (I'm guessing there was no actual research done) that the Oscars have always been produces by the same company, that this company named the statuettes Oscar (which is strange since there are at least three conflicting origing stories of how the statues became to be named Oscar) and that the director of the AMPAS is choosen for life. None of which is actually true.\n[*] Puzzles won't work some of the time untill you speak to certain characters. So you could click with the right object in your inventory on the correct object in the scene with either nothing happening or getting a general response of failure. And after speaking to one of the NPC's the same combination suddenly works. It wouldn't be so bad of you got a more fitting response like \"I have no reason to do that\" or \"I can't do that yet\" or something similar.\n[*] What's up with the blue boy in your garage that is supposed to be your son? It's not properly explained and makes no sense at all.\n[*] Jokes are all over the place ranging from adolescent jokes about bodily functions to drugs to sexual innuendo. Some jokes made me smile while others were just badly executed and made me roll my eyes. The bad English translation doesn't really help here either.\n[*] Achievements are no fun. Some achievements can only be earned by playing the game over and over in order to get the 'miles walked' 'lines of dialogue listened to without skipping' and 'number of hints used'. I haven't even gotten halfway there for most of these meaning I'd have to replay the game at least once more to get these and then yet another time in order to solve it within one hour for yet another achievement. These are just lazy achievements, not creative at all. I prefer achievements which require you to solve certain puzzles in unusual ways or achievements which will let you discover an easter egg.\n[*] Some puzzles just make no sense. I know adventure game physics are different from normal day physics but in what universe can a little mole chew a wooden log to splinters? Why not replace the ants in that scenario with termites, that would've made perfect sense. And there are a few other puzzles where I stumbled onto the solution without it making a lot of sense. Sometimes I would have at least three items in my inventory that would be able to solve a certain puzzle but only one of them could be used for unclear reasons. Sometimes objects stay in your inventory for most of the game, other times they disappear for no good reason after being used. Which can lead to a situation where the bowie knife you use to remove a net around a propeller disappears from your inventory and then you have to somehow cut a rope holding the boat but you're not allowed to use your laser gun, swiss army knife or several other cutting tools in your inventory but you have to resolve to a solution which makes less sense. In fact you're not allowed to use the laser gun because it might damage the boat but it's perfectly okay to soak the rope in gasoline and burn it using a lighter instead. In the same scenario you're also not allowed to use a long crowbar, fishing pole or a long stick to remove the net for unclear reasons. Even though those would be viable solution in real life. And this problem comes back again and again. Your swiss army knife has a built in lockpick but you can only use it when the developers allow you to. In several puzzles you suddenly have to find an actual key and the lockpick suddenly doesn't work.\n[/list]\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] there is some fun to be had, but too many problems weigh this game down. Can't recommend this game since there are a multitude of much better point and click adventures games to be found on Steam.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017392185", "last_played": 1482703505, "num_reviews": 117, "num_games_owned": 3097, "playtime_forever": 412}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1482747302, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495776", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1482748128, "recommendationid": "28665714", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
