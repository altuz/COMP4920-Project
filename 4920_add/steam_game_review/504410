I played \" my exboyfriend\" but felt it was a bit of a caricature (yes, the bugginess didnt help) of itself. I really feel the atmosphere has turned into it's own queer subculture. Have just finished it,  the puzzles are often wonderfully out of the box but still make sense (i remember discworld taking lateral thinking to new extremes- i also remember at some point having to open my cd-rom drive for some game , that took me quite a while to work out ) . It's also inclusive;  straying from the earlier more superficial joe phillips homo-eroticism sex-comedy into something quite unusual , i think his work really fits. The prev episode also brought naughty sci-fi classics flesh gordon / barbarella to mind a bit too much ;) in this game i really like the Faith story line. Great improvement in the gameplay, enjoying every moment of it. Particularly the v-fantasies, are a great touch of positive social commentary without the \" celluloid closet\" misery of the average queer game (in yaoi and bara i have seen very few happy people , the forced (often brutal) relations, kind of takes away a lot of the sexiness for me ) . Showing people so vulnerable in their fantasies, feels very encouraging . Especially the nitup scenario, i hope empowers people. There's also a very natural but cartoony sensuality to this (the previous one was a bit \" Are you being served?\" :D ) . \nAll in all very good work . I have always wanted to play a combination of larry's passionate patti and space quest with queer content - lol . It could be naughtier, maybe it's a bit safe but \n perhaps this opens it to a wider audience , which i think it deserves.The music in the game s very well chosen too. perfect atmospheres, very fitting. \n\nShem approves ! The world needs more and queerer games!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198050884234", "last_played": 1496419882, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 197, "playtime_forever": 605}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1496472506, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508738", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1496472734, "recommendationid": "32145713", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great game on the background of first part, but if you look at it as the one of adventure genre, than you find just not very bad game with good mini-games, puzzles and a bit funny jokes.
