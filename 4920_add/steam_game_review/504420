The game is basically Space Pirate Simulator minus the polish, and the 6 weapons are unlocked by beating levels of 5 waves. On the positive side, the environment itself is quite nice to look at, the music is suitable, and the monsters have some variations of graphics and toughness. However, they behave in the exact same underwhelming way without any feedback to being hit, and most of the weapons are simply color variations of the initial underpowered spell. I can't recommend it even on sale because my curiousity about the game was fully satisfied in 5 minutes, and any desire to continue died 10 minutes after that (and I can't see myself playing it again).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002049680", "last_played": 1502532706, "num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 214, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502533302, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502533302, "recommendationid": "34188114", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
