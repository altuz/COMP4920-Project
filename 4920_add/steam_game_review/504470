Massive performance problems mixed with serious UI issues (like clicking only randomly working), unfortunately, make the game unplayable in it's current form.  Considering it's been 6 months with no update and no word from the developers at all, it's hard to imagine this is going to change.  I hope they update this game at some point and start making it live up to it's potential, but I wouldn't recommend buying it until then.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198039396315", "last_played": 1494973843, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 243, "playtime_forever": 1246}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1496704373, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1496704373, "recommendationid": "32209854", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
