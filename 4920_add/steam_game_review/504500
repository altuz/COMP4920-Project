It is mainly you just bumping each off the edge repeatedly over and over. I just got bored pretty quick. It's a fun game if you want to kill some time with friends, but I don't think it's something that will keep 4 people entertained locally long. Weapons, from what I played with were all the same. You could just technically just hold the throttle and try to knock someone off the ledge without ever turning. Why not since it doesn't count against you.

The only issue is now that the controls are too difficult. If they fix this issue it would be a really fun party game and worth porting to consoles.\n\nPros:\n-Good visuals\n-Fun power ups\n-Awesome 4 player local play\n-In general the game is very fun and I believe with a few tweaks the game would be great. If they had done an early access build it would probably have been a great game on full release but there are still a few things that I and the people I played with don't like.\n\nCons:\nNOW FIXED (THEY ADDED LAST MAN STANDING' MODE) -Scoring system *the scoring system is based on how many you kill, we all thought the game would be better if you had lives instead and had to stay alive, when we played this game it was a case of constant kamakaze and not caring because it doesn't matter if you die* REPEAT THIS HAS BEEN FIXED\n-Controls *this type of game obviously can't be played with keyboard and mouse so this is only reviewed using Xbox 360 controller and it still isn't perfect, none of us felt that  had full control of the vehicle*\n\nVerdict:\nFor now I will give it a thumbs up as if they allow you to select scoring system based on kills or based on deaths we would play this a lot. And I think they could easily improve the controls. I hope the devs don't just leave this game to rot as it is a great idea for a local co-op game", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198011058173", "last_played": 1493264808, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 469, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1469929060, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504327", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1475987474, "recommendationid": "24625591", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fun battle mode game, can be played locally with friends or against the AI.\n\nGameplay:\n\n-  9 Different weapons to pick up from the boxes.\n\n- 8 Different maps to choose from.\n\n- 3 Different Game Modes, \"Free For All\" (Kill most enemies), \"Last Man Standing\" (Start with \"X\" lives and kill all you opponents lives\". \"Hoarder\" (Pick up gift boxes that appear on the ground to score points, get killed and you lose one point).\n\n- The maps have different obstacles that appear.\n\nPros:\n\n- Good Graphics.\n\n- Obstacles on the maps.\n\n- Vehicle difficult to drive at first, but when you get used to it, it's fun.\n\nCons:\n\n- No Online Multiplayer Support\n\n\nIf you enjoy the battle mode on Mario Kart or Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, try this out.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198095564069", "last_played": 1506537621, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_forever": 1018}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485600580, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485601827, "recommendationid": "29538532", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ok, bought this because seems to have a nice visual art, thus it reminds me 'Saucer summo' (minigame from Thrill Land for playstation 2 as i've remember playing on my childhood).\nIt's kinda fun but needs more work, you pretty much listen to arena's music only, no bump sound or engine, powers-ups sounds weird...
