I tried Oculus Medium with the Vive, and it was horrific, there were so many issues that caused. So I tried this, and this software  is just as powerful, and is actually built for the Vive, (as well as the Rift,) so it works flawlessly, without issue.\n\nMy biggest, and one of my only problems, was the poly count. I blasted it up to the highest resolution, which is \"8x,\" and i still found small adjustments very hard to do. Micro-details are literally impossible, which is rather sad. I don't mind doing adjustments my desktop, but I want the option to be able to do micro-details in VR\n\nMy other problem was the smooth tool, even at 0% strength, smoothed small details out too much. A small, jagged crease became non-existent when I touched it with the smooth brush, when I just wanted it smoother, because it was jagged. But I think that goes back to the low(ish) polygon count. If the polygon count was higher, the smooth brush wouldn't affect the polygons as much because there are more to affect.\n\nOther than that it was really good. Quickly learned the tools and got sculpting right away, and I was able to create a rather high-quality sculpt.(Besides detailing like I said.)

I always expected a design process in Vr somewhat different, since you see the object in full size directly in front of you, and i was not disappointed. It is definitely something that is worth exploring.\n\nMasterpiece VR is an astonishingly usable program. It is stable and it's featureset is already good. The thing I missed most is symmetry on select/copy/paste, but I guess that is in development.\nAnd I missed something like the Clay Brush and trim dynamic in ZBrush to even out larger surfaces.\n\nBut of course I know these are the early days of VR modelling and I was surprised to find out that after just 2 hours I could already produce something usable and that the tools are already usable to a certain degree of detail. The FBX export works without flaws, and the generated mesh, though of course relatively heavy, is nice to use as a base for reduction or retopology.\n\nRight now I see the main strength of the app in designing, not in producing a finished model. Since Vr gives you a nice feeling of space and dimension I think the designs done in Vr will have a different twist then in 3D on a screen.\nI often noticed that when modelling for VR I would later, when loading the model into Unity, have the feeling that although modelled to real world dimensions the objects were not 100% there. I hope to be able to design stuff that better fits in the VR world with the help of software like Masterpiece.\n\nThis is definitely an application I will explore further and I am looking forward how this will develop.\nOn my wishlist, apart from the select/copy/paste symmetrie would be to be able to load existing models into Masterpiece and convert them into voxels to play around with hem.\nAlso Deformers that affect larger areas of the object would be very welcome, and a snapping system or magnetic grid.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 175, "steamid": "76561198050487685", "last_played": 1506277907, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_forever": 175}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506208900, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506208900, "recommendationid": "35166173", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "You can do some *really* fantastic stuff in this program.
