Unlike more traditional J:RPGs, there's no battling system; this might be disappointing to some people, but I for one find it refreshing to walk through a cave without finding a slime or spider every 5 seconds.  The only gameplay is walking through various terrains, solving puzzles, and collecting items.  I was a bit iffy on this part at first, but after Skye showed up the game got a lot more interesting story-wise.\n\nThe overall story of this game definitely makes up for the lack of gameplay.  As a writer myself, I have to say the world-building and lore is phenomenal; I wanted to learn more about the world these characters lived in, and I still do even after over 5 hours of playing.\n\nThis game is very dialogue-heavy, making it a lot more like watching an anime than playing a video game.  Those looking for tests of skill and epic battles won't be very happy.  However, if you're looking for a cute light-hearted story about angels, magic, and gay catgirls, this is definitely worth the $1.79 it costs! (or $1.99 if it's no longer on sale by the time you read this)\n\nI have unfortunately encountered a bug: in the cottage in the swamp, Castellanos for some reason does not follow Fiona and Skye when they attempt to leave.  The two girls just stand at the door while he stares at the bedroom wall, and when this happens I can't do anything, all I can do is Ctrl+Alt+Dlt and go back to my most recent save point.  If anyone has a fix for this, any help would be much appreciated!\n\nEDIT: The bug is now fixed and the game continues normally! Thanks for the quick reply developer!\n\nTL;DR - This game is very story-heavy and, while not having much actual gameplay, it's definitely worth the money!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198080267726", "last_played": 1471109779, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 390}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1470712663, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1470727188, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509072", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1471107296, "developer_response": "This was a delight to read but the final paragraph was alarming!

Why?\nIt takes too much time to let things happen:\n\nSome small spoilers ahead!!!\n\n\n\nThere you are wandering through nature, screen after screen, nothing happening - no interaction, nothing -, the artwork nice but nothing special. Is the intention to show you, that you have to be patient? Perhaps. \nThen you find a fireplace. You now have to search for firewood. But, you gotta be kidding me, there's lots and lots of it and you have to go back many screens. Then gladly something a little bit more fun happens. \nAfter that you are back at the fireplace and have to be patient again, while nothing really is happening.\nOK: While I played, I thought about my life and hobbies. I work. In my work, I have lots of situations where I have to be patient. Then I love to paint, there patience is needed, too.\nIn games, I want things to happen, I don't want to wait through minutes of situations that give me the feeling of waiting screens. \nSo, I decided to paint. That's more productive and more fun. Because the game now felt for me like a waste of time. Why was I playing? To come to another situation, where I have to patiently wait for some nice jokes? No.\n\n\nSo, if you want to kill some time, have time to kill and don't mind the slowness of the game, just try it! I think it's made with lots of love. \nIf you want more entertaining games, if you want things to happen a little bit more faster, think about, what I wrote - if you want to!\n\nThis is not about the money, of course; the price is more than fair.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198143030878", "last_played": 1489608597, "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 407, "playtime_forever": 57}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1471712799, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502725", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1471790435, "recommendationid": "25036381", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "While I haven't finished the game, I have played for almost 40 minutes, which was more than enough for me to decide that; no, I do not recommend this game. \n\nEdit: I went back to the game and played for another hour. Everything you see until the * is what I wrote for the first 40 minutes, and everything after that is what I wrote for the next hour of gameplay time.\n\nGoing into Faria, the first thing that instantly puts me off is the graphics. While the game uses several assets that look good on their own, these do not go together. The characters are generated from MV's character generator, and look REALLY out of place compared to everything else that's pixellated. There are a lot of cut-offs in maps, and the maps are usually not really fun to explore. While the maps start out fine at first, they eventually turn into empty meadows of grass, flowers and trees real quick. The cliff tiles are used really weirdly, and sometimes do not make sense.\n\nThe game has some pretty well written and advanced degree dialogue, but it pretty much disappears after the first 15 minutes as the game just turns into a walking simulator. And even as someone who enjoys walking simulatos, the game just felt empty and boring to me. A lot of the walking simulators I have played atleast give you dialogue and beautiful environments to help make themselves fun to play, but FARIA just lacks any kind of unique-ness. One thing you definetly do not want to do in a walking simulator is make the player super duper slow and force them to backtrack. Which the game does. It does have running, but you have a limited amount of stamina, which isn't that bad at first, but quickly gets annoying.\n\nAfter around 35 minutes into the game, you are supposed to find firewood to start a campfire. While the idea doesn't seem bad, it requires you to walk all the way back and just gather wood lying all over the place, because apparently even after getting like 20 she still wants to ''let's keep going!''. This is about when I dropped the game, because walking all that way was just way too tedious.\n\nThe game does have several branching paths in the maps, but they usually lead to nowhere, and if you have a game that's set up like it wants you to explore, you should definetly reward the player in some way.\n\nOther than that, the only issue I have would probably be the resolution. While many may disagree with this, I really hate large resolutions and fullscreen. I would much rather play a 640x480 or smaller/slightly larger than play a game that is 1024x768(which I believe is the resolution size, but am not 99% sure). While I'm not really breaking off any points or downrating the game simply for this issue, I would still like to be able to play the game in smaller resolutions~\n\nIt's a shame, because Faria feels like it could be enjoyable if it offered more than it currently has, but is just really boring and bland in it's current state. I'm totally up for giving the game another go if it was actually updated to offer more content, or if it actually gets better and the game doesn't repeat the same mistakes(because ain't wasting my time walking through the same meadows again for 6 hours), but right now, it's just... nah.\n\n*\n\nSo, I decided to go back into the game. I must say, it does get better. But sadly, not better enough to change my review to postive. And right afterwards, after around 40 minutes(again) the game goes downhill once more.\n\nSo, there is a lot more dialogue for the next 40 minutes of gameplay, and it's actually pretty silly and nice. However, the game is still filled with cut-off tiles, passability issues and semi-poor mapping. The music, which I forgot to talk about when I first wrote the review, is actually pretty good and -mostly- fitting (though the music in the dark cave is just too cheery, imo, hence the reason I said ''mostly''). Since the next hour of gameplay introduces a new character, I'll talk a bit about the characters in the game.\n\nSo, Fiona has some pretty silly and nice dialogue in this next 40 minutes, but she still doesn't have a personality that makes me like her. She mostly just feels like she is there to satisfy the ''playable character'' role, and despite her silly dialogue she just feels generic and boring.\n\nWe later on get introduced to Skye, who is also the main reason things went downhill for me again. While she is cute and, just like Fiona, has some pretty silly enjoyable dialogue. She is a lot more unique than Fiona as a character, because unlike Fiona, her LACK of personality is what makes her likeable. She mostly doesn't know what's going on, and gets easily distracted, which makes me like her way better than Fiona.... in theory.\n\nYou see, another major problem the game has is that it takes way too long to display the next sentence or words of dialogue, and Skye commits this the most. You usually have to wait atleast 10 seconds for her to say a 5-10 word sentence, because there is a second or two of pause between each letter she sprouts out. Even before she is introduced, people tend to wait 3 seconds to display ellipses(oh, and there are also a few ellipses that are incomplete and have only 2 dots instead of 3, but I didn't mind this all that much). There are also several cutscenes where the same baloon icon is displayed around 3-4 times, especially with Fiona. For example, Fiona is sleeping, and you have to watch silence bubbles come out of her 4 times before you can go back to the game. The huge moments of pause usually ruined the game for me, aswell as other things I have pointed out in the first part.\n\nOtherwise, the next hour of gameplay also does commit to the ''walking large empty and boring areas without any kind of input'' sin I have talked about in the first part, even though it is arguably less. Even so, I do plan to give the game another try again tomorrow, but probably for the last time. Because if the whole game is going to be like this, I'd much rather spend my time on something else than walking through boring maps and waiting 5 seconds for one line of dialogue to display. Sorry, still a no from me.\n\nOther little details:\n-In the mushroom scene, despite Fiona picking up mushrooms from the ground, the mushrooms still appear as though they are there, which makes it look like she is not picking them up at all.\n-I loved(and had a nice laugh out of)the minecart scene in the second mine.\n-Several objects cut-off Fiona's ears when she stands infont of them because the top parts are set to be above the player.\n-I like the menu.\n-The game is indeed pretty funny when there is actually dialogue.\n-Fiona is shown twice in 140 minutes with nothing but a bikini, so if you're into fanservice and pixellated cat girls in bikinis, you may like this~ XD", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198203340085", "last_played": 1470610053, "num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 273, "playtime_forever": 111}, "votes_up": 17, "timestamp_created": 1470452600, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1470679450, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497064", "votes_down": 16, "timestamp_updated": 1470684704, "developer_response": "I feel guilty for the troubles your honest opinions have caused.
