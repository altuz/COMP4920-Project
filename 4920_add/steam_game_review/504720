There are ways to input your own music, but they don't make it very straight forward and that is certainly not what this software is geared toward. Also, this software broke my audio drivers. Every time I open windows now, even after a restart, nothing will make any sound except of course this dumb program. I just uninstalled it and strangely still nothing has sound. I am getting very annoyed. After I fix the drivers, I will try one more install to see if it stops being broken crap, but honestly I wish I could get a refund on the software and the soundpool I bought. Speaking of soundpools, I bought one from their website, and I haven't been able to find a way to access it so watch out.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198098388366", "last_played": 1501113640, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_forever": 351}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1501042209, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502532", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1501042209, "recommendationid": "33800639", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
