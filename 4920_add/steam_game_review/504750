If you are not ok with Stratego, it probably isn't the game for you.\n\nThe UI feels... compatible with mobile. This is a turn off for some. The mobile UI compatibility didn't feel like a significant hinderance in this game (it has in others). Don't go into this expecting an experience that is optimized for desktop.\n\nThe gameplay itself has skirmish, which is your classic Strategoesque environment. There is also a campaign which allows for unlocking additional opponents.  The campaign has asymmetry to the pieces.\n\nThere are variations on the power scale compared to the more \"pure\" numerical environment of Stratego. There is a piece that always wins if it attacks, and always loses if it is attacked. There are fighters - which you can move two per turn and have two attack the same spot. There are mines - which behave like mines... except for the bit that light fighters aren't blown up by them.\n\nThe board placement area has more options than the number of ships - some mobility there.  The black holes (those circle things in the center) allow for slingshot movement, which can give fighters (with lots of movement) some sometimes surprising movement options.\n\nI'm not overly impressed with the AI, but its not awful. There's the \"I sent that fighter down the outside edge to scout out that ship and... oh, I won.\"  Incidentally, there is an achievement for that.\n\nAll in all, its what I expected and would be on the \"I'll play it again\" side of things. I got it on a 25% off sale and that felt about right. If you're on the fence, wait for a bigger sale or wait to see if it comes out for mobile at a lower price point.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024977470", "last_played": 1474060029, "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 793, "playtime_forever": 82}, "votes_up": 23, "timestamp_created": 1474041636, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545286", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1474059213, "recommendationid": "25529576", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game looks simple on the surface but is  rather deep. Deeper then i first imagined it would be, by far.  It reminds me alot of chess but with hidden pieces and boardeffects. \nThe campaign-mode is mostly a tutorial to get you to understand the mechanics and quite frankly doesnt really deliver on its promise of being a campaign and tho i found some of the missions to be overwhelmingly difficult, the overall experience of the campaign doesnt do the games depth justice.\nThe game should really be played as a correspondance-type multiplayer game. Which i LOVED. You start several games and get notified when its your turn (or not, you can turn that off and check if its your move in any games when you feel like it).Not being tied down to to a full game or have to wait for an opponent is fantastic and i wish more games implemented this type of multiplayer as an option. \n\nAnd i have to mention sounddesign. Both the music and sounddesign in the game is flawless. Its soothing and calming yet rich in texture and well mixed. \n\n\ni give this game 8/10 in its class (0 sum boardgame stratergy?)\n\n\nPros:\n------\nInteresting gameplay\nSimple yet deep strategy\nAn element of bluffing\nSounddesign is fantastic\nCorrespondance-style multiplayer\n\nCons:\n------\nNot much of a narrative\nsomewhat estetically underwhelming.\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057648112", "last_played": 1497356873, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 86, "playtime_forever": 173}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1474650369, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500832", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1474650369, "recommendationid": "25653703", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
