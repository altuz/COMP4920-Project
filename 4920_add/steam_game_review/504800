It keeps track of and reacts to the disguise you're wearing (out of 4-5 options), the level of alert you've left behind - not just in this game, but in previous installments as well - and to time shenanigans. Can't imagine how hard all that stuff was to map out.\n\nYour endgame can vary greatly depending on exactly which people you've met and left alive 2-3 games ago!\n\nBut, with all that in mind... I have the most fun in these games when I keep rewinding a situation to see how different solutions can shake out. Some of the weirdest outcomes in these games result from pursuing a marginal and seemingly irrelevant tangent. And Sorcery 4 kinda puts a stop to that. At some point, as a part of raising the stakes, your rewind ability is sharply limited. You can no longer fuck around and try everything :(\n\nNow, the above is a matter of taste - I'm sure most people play \"fairly\", just accepting whatever outcome the game throws their way and carrying on if they haven't died. What's actually a problem are the towers of magic. They're basically a series of puzzle rooms that you'll have to solve if you don't have specific information / allies from a previous installment. They don't react in the slightest to your disguise, the guards alert state, or time stuff. Basically, every time you replay, the towers are exactly the same, and it gets annoying quickly.\n\nStill a game with a very impressive bunch of scenarios. Just... not as much fun to replay as 2 or 3.\n\nAlso, on a petty personal note; the fact that I've spent a long time hunting for spelling and grammar errors, yet never got a response from the developers and the errors remain unfixed in the final update is fairly discouraging.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197978806930", "last_played": 1486065772, "num_reviews": 95, "num_games_owned": 1143, "playtime_forever": 1866}, "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_created": 1482346785, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472200", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1482346850, "recommendationid": "28513721", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I want to like this chapter, I really do.\n\nThe complete randomness in the choices provided this game detract from what could have continued be an interesting tale. Much of the game involves guessing what you think the designers want you to do--instead of choosing your own path--and you are often punished for choosing incorrectly, even if you follow gameplay logic already presented to you. The story is also stymied by situational puzzles that bear little if no connection to the larger story. \n\nNavigation, sadly, is also a mess. Once you pass through a location, sometimes you are able to backtrack, and other times you are not. And then, sometimes when you are allowed to, there is no purpose to it, as the game indicates that there is nothing more that can be done here. The mix between linear progression and choice of movement is, again, unfortunately, stymied by an overall lack of structure and greater intent. \n\nWhat was once a charming little adventure has collapsed upon itself, lacking the structure of a cohesive story and consistent gameplay rules; often, too often, random situations are presented to you with random choices to select -- with no consistent logic. Options in one situation for example, are often not presented in another, similar situation. Good games create an environment with a set of rules and provide interesting choices within that structure. This chapter lacks that systemic structure.\n\nThe primary weakness of this chapter is a lack of focus of intent. There is scant evidence of a lead designer, as the volume of random situations and random choices scatter what could have been--what I hoped would have been--a satisfying conclusion.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197982117896", "last_played": 1497310983, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 102, "playtime_forever": 566}, "votes_up": 17, "timestamp_created": 1476756706, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513501", "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1480085884, "recommendationid": "26095455", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "6.5/10\nA overall good part of a 4 part game series. However I can't help but feel that they rushed through the process of making this simply to put it out there. \n\nThe visuals: Plain and simple, it does not contain as much details as the previous parts, which is sad because I had hoped the parts would only become better along with the experience this rather new company got from the 3 last parts of Sorcery. Most of the map is simply mountains that you can not go to, and the inside of Mampang does not contain much more than large deserted areas of dust and crops. Once you enter the buildings inside of Mampang, you get a little better view of what's inside, yet you still feel isolated. You can hear a hint of people surrounding you everywhere you go, but visually you only see a open field of dust. So imagination is the key here I think. \nAside from lack of visuals, the visuals that do exist are pretty good, I like the way they draw everything and use pictures from the orignal books to describe characters appearences (perhaps more pictures of characters for the future though? Newely drawn of course).\n I'm not a big fan of the 3D elements that they incorporate like the timewarp towers or the large tower of Mampang, mainly because the timewarp towers fly around the screen when the game decides to steer the camera around for visual effects, and that the high tower of Mampang is quite chunky, you can see that they tried to make the tower round but it came out more like a stop sign than a circular shape, however this may just be a difference in taste.\n\nThe sound: Not much to get here either I'm afraid, mostly the sounds you will hear outside are the whisperings of the wind. Once inside of the fortress the background sound effects like the laughter of the townsfolk gets dialed down enough to barely be heard, you will mostly sit in the quiet and read the story that is written in this game, until you turn your volume up, only to fly out of your seat when you open your spells which has this loud bang that will wake up the dead on that kind of volume. So unless you feel comfortable turning your volume up and down every time you go to your spells (in a game called SORCERY), then you will have some trouble with this. \nHowever some soundeffects are rather nice, for instance the soundeffects in the sewers are well made, there are areas where the sounds are quite good, but this is still a big concern for me.\n\nThe story: Really good, this is where the game truly gets brilliant, and the reason for why I personally play it. They've taken the story from the famous books \"Steve Jackson's Sorcery\" which makes this game come together so very nicely. They've managed to incorporate the story of the books nicely into this game, you feel free as there is no lack of decisisions to make, and you keep your interest from the story which you get to read, and take part of above all.\n\nTips: One thing you should be vary of when playing this game, you can never be quite sure if your game will be saved if you press \"Quit\" in game. Personally I played for quite some time, I ended coming far into the game when it got very late and I decided to press \"Quit\" in the game (There is no save button which is a major flaw), and I woke up this day to open sorcery when I got to the main screen and apparently had to choose adventure all over and do it all again. So my advise is to test it a few times to make sure it will save, and perhaps if you can leave the game on at all times until you've finished the game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997620687", "last_played": 1475492486, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 10276}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1474806463, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510187", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1474806546, "recommendationid": "25691012", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I have been following Sorcery! since the release of the first game, when I watched Simon and Lewis from the Yogscast play it on their channel.

I am sick of tired of this game resetting my progress every 30 minutes every time I fail to guess the correct outcome for it's stupid encounters. Not only that, but it also decides you lose a point of max health- making it even more difficult to continue playing. \n\nI spent real money on all other three parts only to reach a rage inducing and poorly designed fourth part. This game tricks you and makes you feel like an idiot. The only good moments in this part are the parts where you don't play the game. Every time the game challenges you, you have to guess these character's intentions. I literally walked into a room and died instantly. No clues or anything. \n\nI put on someone's cloak and died. Okay, maybe I shouldn't have trusted them. I guess that's my fault. Why are there people standing in the middle of a crowded area instantly killing people? I don't know. These people shoot fire out of their eyes and kill me instantly for lying to them about a small thing. Every time I die I lose a stamina point. Every time I die I have to decide if it's worth wasting my time to redo  the things I just did. As soon as the game earns my trust back, it breaks it again. Have fun redoing the last 15 minutes! What if something I did was important? I met someone- will they help me later if I don't redo everything? Who knows. I don't. The game has no intention of telling me. So once again I'm in the middle of a stupid alleyway with 16 health points, down from twenty. \n\nYou need those health points- too. That's a powerful spell and a weak spell I could cast- things I could potentially use to get me out of a future encounter.\n\nIf the game lets you use that spell at all- or in the way you intended too. There's WAL and FOF. Wal creates a magical barrier in one direction, a wall. FOF creates a magical barrier 360 degrees. Clearly FOF is a better spell in every way. And yet, when surrounded by people in a street who want to kill me for literally no reason, I can only cast WAL. I cast it two block out two people, and fully intended to cast another spell and kill the guy behind me. But no, the game only lets me walk away or taunt the people behind the wall- and then accuses me of forgetting the third guy.\n\nWell, screw you, game. I hate being your stupid toy to play around with. \n\nI'm here to tell you not the buy the other three parts. As good as they are, your hours and hours of free time will come to nothing- unless you want to slog through hours and hours more of rage inducing repeition and helplessness. \n\n\nEDIT: Well...I beat the game. \n\nMy review still stands.\n\nThe ending was incredibly unsatisfying- and there were some things I had to do to get the best ending. I'm not even sure what the best ending is. A God even tells me I have brought a great peace by saving the day- but no. Not really.\n\nBecause when I die of old age, my character will go right back to where he was. Probably with one less max stamina. Because he's cursed with an infuriating checkpoint system. Screw that. All that hard work and the game tells me to go fuck myself. \"But you dread the day you die, and return to the Archmage's castle...\" Screw you!\n\n What was even the point, game? Why didn't you just tell me to give up?\n\nI have to do a challenge run of part three to get the best ending. Who told me that? No one. Nobody at all. Way to make me regret my purchase even more- all of my game time and money wasted, and I don't even get a 'happily ever after'?

Part 4 contains an incredibly well fleshed out world full of realistic characters, interesting locations and plenty of difficult choices to make which come with actual consequences.

But this one is much more punishing than the others. Still its faithful to the book and yet features more content and multiple endings, even hinting to a possible sequel. Very well done, full of choices and paths and a certain amount of replayability, although limited because the story always remains the same. I mentioned its more punishing but not hopelessly so. Eventually you reach a point at which you can no longer retrace your steps at will, however you can still die and suffer a small permanent stat loss for it. But this loss can also be recovered and recompensated at a few places. You also dont NEED to explore every inch of the map or resolve every event successfully to complete the book. Just dont get too attached to your belongings and dont get too discouraged about having to retrace your steps often (sometimes tediously so). I still think that this is the proper way that the other FF gamebooks should have been translated to digital form. They didnt just copy/paste the text from the original books; they reimagined and adapted it - successfully.
