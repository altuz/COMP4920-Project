The music was probably my favorite out of all the Pixel Puzzles, though it didn't make a difference in my interest for the game.  I finished....because I'm a sucker for achievements and completing games that I start.  Overall, not a bad game, it's a carbon copy of the other Pixel Puzzles, but with a different theme.  I just don't recommend it for reasons listed.  I'd like to see Pixel Puzzles add something to the game play in future iterations.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002506911", "last_played": 1501595930, "num_reviews": 200, "num_games_owned": 2805, "playtime_forever": 2039}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1501775795, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508633", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501775795, "recommendationid": "33995811", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I really liked all those puzzles.
