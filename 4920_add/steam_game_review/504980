Inconsistent visual art style\n2. Horrendous level design (game starts in a \"mario-like\" world, and then we get to explore some mines, and then an \"oriental\" palace)\n3. Unbalanced enemy encounter design (invisible foes shooting with pin-point accuracy, really!?)\n4. Loads of clipping bugs\n5. Long loading time\n6. Poor performance\n7. Lack of context to keep the player engaged\n\nSure, there is a first time for everyone. Without experimention, trial and error, we cannot gain experience. However, some early attempts are better kept hidden from the public.\n\nIt's hard to justify the quality of a game with the price tag when there are good free-to-play games in the market...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-mSqASQDgs\n\nRating:\n0.1 / 10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989199444", "last_played": 1482121370, "num_reviews": 123, "num_games_owned": 1062, "playtime_forever": 63}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1482385736, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508016", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485397364, "recommendationid": "28522316", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I bought this game out of curiosity when the change to review scoring caused it to shoot up.  Its old score was fair and accurate.  The game is less than an hour and is more of a walking simulator than an honest to god fps.  Occasionally there will be enemies to shoot or a door to open, but most of your time is spent walking down trails and corridors.  Quality control is non-existent; the spelling error in the trailer is one of many and enemies often passively stand still as you're shooting them.  This includes the final boss.
