Dev, Craigz, is very active in the community and works hard pumping out updates. Worth the money but don't expect a 72 hour campaign for a while until craigz has more time to get more work done, buying it now and waiting will give him more $$ to do so so i recommend you buy it and play it and do all you can (3-4 hours gamplay) rn and watch it grow and develop into something truly beautiful.

Labor of love.. never seen a dev more excited and motivated to work on a game! Very responsive and active in the community...\n\nThis isn't like any of the other games I have.. I have a lot of games. It's one of the more unique games I've played. I like to collect artistic/weird or interesting games. It's like Link went for a reach around on Mario (64) and shot out a whole new basket of fun. \n\nI haven't put much time in at all. Hopefully better controller supports will be added soon. There is the key binding option but I suck at figuring it out. I blame the buzz.\n\nThis game is really fun even though I really suck at aiming for anything with my mouse. I couldn't draw a stick figure with my mouse so I die a lot... The graphics are so satisfying!!!! Super cute little cubes!! I love the battle style. You pretty much make a line, like mini golf games work but you are in battle so you have to be quick... and the cube goes launching at anything ahead of it. But not overkill. It's physics-ly satisfiying for a basic gamer (it is believable, you know, if you were from the world of cubes).\n\nWorth the tag. If you can afford to support Early Access with a dev that is sure to push this gem to a wonderful release point... and probably keep going after that.. Give it a shot! This is one of my better EA games.. community is great too.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "steamid": "76561198392696249", "last_played": 1507009470, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 154, "playtime_forever": 26}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1507010357, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507010357, "recommendationid": "35436856", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Warcube is a perfectly fun game with entertaining animations and mechanics, as well as a unique charm to it.\n\nAs of now (Early Access; update 0.0.7v3), as is expected from an Early Access game, it is in no way complete; however,  the developer seems to be actively listening to the community and addressing important issues as well as consistently adding on to the game, which gives me a lot of optimism for the future of Warcube.\n\nTherefore, I would certainly reccomend the game, particularly with hopes that the game will be further expanded upon and improved as adeptly as it already has been.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198258603327", "last_played": 1499298416, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 167}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504660366, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504660366, "recommendationid": "34767496", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is fantastic, period.
