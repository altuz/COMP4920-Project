But I wasn't going to kick it until I tried it. \n\nPros\nCharacter design\nReminiscent of a Korean romantic comedy\n\nCons\nInconsistent music loop \nBlurry backgrounds\nLack of depth\nCliche plot elements\n\nSome of the pros and cons I listed could be taken either way. But here, I'll discuss my personal opinion of the game. (I know it says I've only docked about 11 hours, but I really did get all the acheivements already.)\n\nThe story starts out with you, the protagonist, newly transformed after undergoing plastic surgery to impress your fiance (slightly weird thing to do, considering he's already agreed to marry you, but it's good. lol). Later on, using your stalking skills and the help of a handsome stranger, you find out that he's actually a con man who tricks women into marriage. After returning home, you get a call from your fiance asking to borrow money, but you had spent it all on the surgery, so he breaks up with you. And thus, your otome dating sim begins.\n\nRight off the bat, I assumed this game would be your typical, cringy, dating sim. And I'm actually really into that (I've played so many Dogenzaka lab games lol), so I went into it with a very open mind. \n\nI really liked the art style in this game, specifically the CGs and character sprites. One thing that bothered me a bit was the way the protagonist was drawn (no eyes), but that is a minor detail. The backgrounds were disappointing and looked like blurry pictures, which has worked for other games, but these specific photos looked bad (maybe I'm just being picky?). The music also seemed familiar, maybe recycled from another game, though it was pleasant enough. I got the impression that the creators didn't invest as much time into this game compared to some of their other titles.\n\nAbove, I mentioned that the story reminded me of a Korean romantic comedy (which I'm not that into, so I listed it as a pro for others rather than myself). I found the protagonist a bit silly, with her clumsiness and stalkish behavior, made me chuckle a few times. She wasn't too passive overall, so the choices weren't ridiculously frustrating, which was a plus. A surprisingly common element in this game was that the characters were engaged to someone else from the beginning. Personally, I'm not interested in pursuing this type of character, so I didn't like that aspect either. And though the characters had great designs and personalities, I didn't feel an emotional attachment to any them or their stories. The suitors seemed cliche (e.g. rich doctor, model, CEO who sweeps you off your feet). Halfway into most of the routes, I lost interest. I can honestly say the story got pretty freakin' weird at times, but it still wasn't enough to keep me captivated. \n\nWhat I liked the most about this game was the obvious message and overall theme that beauty isn't only skin deep. Sadly, the protagonist had already gone under the knife before realizing any of that. And in a way, her beauty makes me question the integrity of some of these characters. It's likely that most of them wouldn't have even interacted with her, had she not undergone plastic surgery to be such a stand out beauty. \n\nEven though I liked it, this has been my least favorite of the Dogenzaka lab games I've played. Now, if you are a fan of kdramas, romantic comedies, strange storylines, or you just need something to pass the time, then you might enjoy this more than I did. Overall, I give it a 5/10. Not that great of a game, but I've certainly played worse. I'm not really recommending it, but I'm not saying you shouldn't give it a chance.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198127078109", "last_played": 1476908359, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 20, "playtime_forever": 684}, "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_created": 1476069413, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552322", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1476103261, "recommendationid": "25959881", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is one of the better VNs by Dogenzaka. After running through 2 terrible ones, this one was a breath of fresh air.\n\nBasic plot: The player character is self conscious and decides to get plastic surgery after her boyfriend proposes to her. [spoiler]Soon after, the player learns that her boyfriend was actually a con artist trying to launder money from her. He breaks up with her once he finds out that she spent all of the money he was going to launder on plastic surgery. The player then gets involved with one of the five romanceable guys, who all turn out to have a fiancee/girlfriend. The player starts to stalk them out of interest. The relationships are either one sided or had a fatal flaw within them. Eventually, the guy breaks off the relationship/engagement because he fell in love with the player[/spoiler].\n\nThe VN still has the problems that all other Dogenzaka VNs have. The 5 storylines are much better written than some of their other VNs published by Dogenzaka. They're 13 chapters + 2 endings rather than 8 chapters + 2 endings. There was actually character development compared to some of the other ones. I would actually recommend this one, even though there are some obvious flaws in it. The awkward translations are less noticeable in this one. The premise is weird, but it wasn't weird to the point where it's cringey.\n\nIf you plan on buying this game, get it in the bundle or wait until a sale.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065643817", "last_played": 1483741112, "num_reviews": 46, "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 661}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1483743930, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514170", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1483743930, "recommendationid": "29072831", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "When this title was released on Steam, I'm glad I recalled a friend some time ago praising it as one of their favorites (they played the smart phone version).

More of a \"weird GOOD\" than a weird bad.  Otome games can be predictable but this kept me on my toes.  Much of the credit goes to the MC, who had a strange mix of traits that somehow end up being kind of interesting & charming.  This girl can be shameless but the light-hearted manner of everything will make you like what's happening.  I never had so many dialogue options make me truly laugh & excited to see the following result.\n\nThe guys were far from perfect but certainly loveable, there are many amusing scenarios/crazy antics but just enough restraint that you can enjoy a few serious moments.

Personally, the thought of stalking for love creeps me out, which makes some of the MC inner dialogue awkward and unapealing.

She sweet and has some really great points about her, but i do find myself being annoyed a lot at having to immerse myself into really crappy personal moments.  Overall, she is so weak, practically maddeningly so.  That being said, I found that the redeeming feature that makes up for it are the boys personal struggles and trials.
