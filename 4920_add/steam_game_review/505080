But...\n\n\nCons - \n\nThe Price vs The Content: The game is beautiful visually and has many lovely CG's for the six character routes, but there is actually very little art and while it is fully voiced by many wonderful actors (voice acting and the amount of art for six full routes wouldn't be cheap) it still doesn't justify a $30.00 price tag. If this was ten dollars cheaper I'd say the full price was worth it if you don't mind a mostly kinetic experience. Otherwise I'd say get it on a deep sale as, honestly, it's not worth the full price in my opinion. \n\nStatic Experience vs Player Choices: There are very few choices to be made, roughly five per guy, with a couple having even fewer...and that's bad for a game that calls itself a Visual Novel. We make an assumption that there will be more of an interactive element and the fact that for some guys the choices don't even start until Chapter 10 makes you start really noticing how much reading you're doing and choice making you're not doing. That distracts from reading a route and since this tells the story of one year in the MC's life, meaning certain events have to happen each route (the school festival) it makes it feel even more like you're just reading a kinetic novel...which makes the price tag feel even more out of place. There's a whole ton of reading for very few choices and a lot of it starts Chapter 8 or later in a 15 chapter story.\n\nCon or Pro - \n\nPercieved Agency vs Railroaded into the Plot: This one is a lot more a personal player preference. The whole set up is to force the heroine into a situation where she gets to know the six most popular boys at the school she just transfered into. This is a huge staple set up in romantic otome manga and anime (Boys Over Flowers, Ouran High School Host Club so on) normal girl meets unattainable hot, talented, rich boys and hot drama ensues. Hell this is a staple of RomComs and a lot of teen fiction in the west too. \n\nBut the MC is also fairly laidback and passive. I actually didn't mind since this time around I felt the devs did a great job of making her an emotional touch stone and the rocky foundation of the group. She's a great listener, she's caring and nurturing and in most routes she doesn't let anyone walk all over her. If she was a guy she'd be the wing man or guy that everyone is friends with, but no one dates. As a girl she's closer to the 'always a bridesmaid' trope, awesome to talk to, rarely gets the guy. \n\nIf you're not into any of those things combined, you're gonna hate the pacing, the set up and the heroine. \n\n\nGroundshog Day: As mentioned you play the MC's 2nd year of high school at a prestigious Academy that she's transfered to after her father recieves a largish promotion at the corporation he works for. So each guy has a normal and good ending, which means even if you make a save before the first choice (and it's always recommended in VN's with multiple endings or good branches to save for rereading) you're going to have a lot of the same experiences or events happen. \n\nAdd to that the guys routes actually tend to pair off a lot. As an example at one point earlier on three people go out together, always the MC, but then two of the boys. If you happen to read their routes back to back it really feels like you're just reading the same thing over and over again when you see it with the same trio twice in a row.\n\nFish out of Water: In Japanese culture there's the office worker. This is the person who goes to work at a decent corporation in their suit and tie and provides for their family. It tends to come off as a worker bee participating in the larger structure to keep the whole hive going. MC's dad is one of those people, only he's actually climbed to a fairly reasonable station now. So being offered a transfer to live on campus at a school with the children of much higher social status classmates is tossing the MC into the deep end. There's a reason for this that isn't outright explained, but you see glimpses of thanks to the largest driving background force, the headmaster. \n\nIf you don't mind reading AU (alternate reality or what if I hung out with this guy instead this year) or shady background forces, then this ends up being a pro. If you're not into it then this could easily be a con instead. \n\n\nPros - \n\nThe MC isn't a doormat: No really, she actually isn't. She's passive, but she's actually got a pretty good head on her shoulders, shows a decent amount of common sense (still lower then the average actual human) and in a lot of routes feels like she does become friends with if not at least pretty damn good acquaintences with the guys around her. She also shows a surprisingly large amount of self awareness and yes she's a kindness-Sue (seriously not even Saints are that nice girl) but she's still not someone that's going to just let the love interest run roughshod over her...in most of the routes. \n\nThere are actual differences between the Normal and Good Endings in a route: Some of them aren't huge, but still noticable and other ones are like, wait, what just happened?! On top of that a lot of the 'normal' endings are actually pretty sad and many of the 'good' ones are bittersweet, but hopeful. MC got tossed into a high-powered, shady place with little to no social standing and no real power of her own and it reflects in the endings. \n\n\nThere is an internal continuity: This tells the story of one school year in the life of the MC. There are six romanceable men and they're naturally paired off and with that comes a lot of shared background. What I mean is, if you pick Renji, the stuff that's happening in the background for the other five is still happening. The guy you choose means you're helping your love interest win a competition, but that doesn't mean everyone else past or motives just disappear. They're not made up for the trope-y plot, they existed before, during and after the story you read. \n\nSo who you chose tends to be one side of a larger story with shared consequences. What you do with A will effect B, but when you read B's story you might see a different side to A & B's overall motivations, even though their pasts are the same. \n\n\nTL;DR - It's a nice game, but it's full of tropes and it's too expensive in my opinion for what you get (amount of money spent on voice acting, art and music aside the story doesn't feel interactive enough even with six romance options to justify the steep price tag). I'd recommend it on sale if you like the set up and don't mind a largely static reading experience with few choices. The guys, for me at least, were different and interesting enough and the endings varied so I didn't mind the hours I put into it. And yes, those are my actual hours. \n\nOnce I realized there could be pretty major differences between a normal vs good ending and that the guys naturally paired off narratively I found myself slowing down and re-reading a lot of the last third of each route to see the full changes. \n\nFinal Note: The boys pair off as so narratively: Asahi X Yuya, Renji X Toma and Saku X Wataru. So if you don't mind retreading a lot of the same things I'd recommend reading them in pairs so you see both sides of the mini-arcs (except for Renji X Toma, those two don't actually interact a whole lot, but they naturally pair off together because their personal stories are very stand alone). \n\nIf you want to feel like you get to see a different thing each read through then pick one of two so you see different interactions during the school festival and so on. It helps cut back on the samey samey feeling. If you only like happy endings save before choices and load if you don't get the brighly colored heart with an UP written in the middle. If you don't mind a wide range of endings I'd recommend doing the normal routes then using save files to get the good ones.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027817952", "last_played": 1502135032, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 2375, "playtime_forever": 1663}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1502167883, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514349", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502167883, "recommendationid": "34095713", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The art and voice acting are amazing, my favourite route is definitely Saku's. \nThe story and characters are bland, especially the main character, however she does have her moments sometimes (i.e. telling the guys to make their own decisions/path). \nSome of the guys are basically on their period, one minute they're normal and then they're angry af.
