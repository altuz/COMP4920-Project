The art is so awesome you might get it just for that. It is really lovely. The voice acting is very good.....The actual story itself is so rushed and yet slow to progress it is infuriating. I stopped playing before finishing the last route and I have never done that before. I just hit a wall thinking, \"if the story is going to be like this and the MC is going to keep being inconsistent and dense... do I even care to see the end?...\" I know that sounds awful but the story is either painfully predictable or completely unexpected (in a bad way that is confusing). There are moments (almost always the beautiful art) that made me keep going but then it would just get annoying again...\n\nYou have to play in a sort of order or things will be revealed in certain routes. The MC is painfully self depricating and clumsy and anxious and sad and pitiable that I don't want to be her and don't see why the guys like her. Oh i almost fell and he caught me like 4 different times... I ran to his room because there was a storm... I cry in every other scene...I need to be saved... I faint from surprise... I run into plot devices like it's my job haha so clumsy... -_-... Having all of those traits and then coming out with insightful or shockingly mature revelations out of absolutely no where is unrealistic and annoying and just to further the plot obviously because she just goes right back to her sad, emotional, pitiful, anxious, clumsy, childish self.\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198129409637", "last_played": 1505529390, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_forever": 3146}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505531477, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502134", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505531477, "recommendationid": "34986456", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
