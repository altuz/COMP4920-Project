The game looks incredibly fun, and I was hoping to add the 100k zombies killed achievement to my profile after some time.\n\nBut after loading the game itself, it crashes every single time I try to launch it and play.\n\nCome to find out, the Devs have abandoned it a long time ago. Yet it's still being sold to unsuspecting suckers like me :(\n\nStay away from this broken, abandoned game."}]}
