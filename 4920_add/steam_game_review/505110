Lots of fun.  It is like you are pacman and the ghosts are your mortal enemies.  However, you can definitely fight back with powerups located across the map, including fireballs, bombs, invulnerability, etc.  The level is finished when you defeat your foes.  \n\nThere's lot of options in gameplay.  Most importantly, you can choose to play in \"God\" mode (which is the map being small and you can move it and direct movement with the joystick on your motion controller or, my favorite, FPV which is first person view.  You are the baddy ghost and the other ghosts should fear you.  Obviously, some people will complain about motion sickness in this view (they should probably burn their VR headset).  However, even if you suffer from this malaise (I don't), then there's several options to ease your motion sickness in the options menu.\n\nYou can also control the AI of the ghosts.  I would recommend changing it from Super easy to normal.  That will definitely up the challenge.  You can also control everything from visuals, to audio, to how turning is done.  You can also change the language from English or Chinese.  \n\nOn top of all that, there's custom levels! \n\nRating 8/10 Who you gonna call?
