The attention to detail in both the physics and the graphics is beyond what I expected. I have never seen motorcycle simulation this accurate. I actually have to slow down to turn unlike the arcade motorcycly racers I grew up playing. This is awesome to say the least. I recommend this to everyone who wants and/or has a motorcycle.  I also recommend this to anyone who wonders why anyone would want a motorcycle.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/k9C15c0f4Yg", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198155146718", "last_played": 1487564548, "num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 267, "playtime_forever": 117}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1485688372, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510550", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1487571069, "recommendationid": "29561638", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "i had lost hope with milestone games making bike games with poor performance games since motogp 14,but you surprised me with this bike game,its the  best bike game out on the market to-date.\nlets hope motogp 17 is even better.\nwell done to all at milestone games.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198020558790", "last_played": 1497084296, "num_reviews": 55, "num_games_owned": 165, "playtime_forever": 144}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1494469462, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1494469796, "recommendationid": "31675963", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you're wondering what's in the game and what is the difference with the full game: there is just MotoGP, no Moto2 or 3, and no other stuff like dirt bike, drift, etc. Just the tracks and the pilots of the championship, plus the historical events from Rossi's career.\nI bought this on sale at 50%. Even at this price I can't recommend it. \nIt lacks some of the most basic features, such as the ability to cap the framerate. Because of that my graphic card's fan is running full speed in order to cool the CPU wasting energy computing frames my monitor can't display.\nThere are obvious, big, annoying bugs. If during practice Ihappen to crash my bike and it's too damaged to continue (happens a lot at the beginning), choosing the dialog option \"back to pit\" will just freeze the game, forcing me to kill it.\nThe driving is not even close to realistic.
