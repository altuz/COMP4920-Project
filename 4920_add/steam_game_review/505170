After playing the demo, yeah remember the good old days when we had PC Game magazines with lots of demo disks? I rushed out to the store and immediately bought the Carmageddon SPLAT PACK! Hours upon hours sank into the game it was a lot of fun! Ah Nostalgia factor we meet again. I like the remake and how they have gone back to their roots with this. The game is not for the faint hearted or easily offended, if you can get past that its hilarious in its own way: its violent, vulgar, crude, downright offensive and its all the better for it! It does everything a Carmageddon game should and more! I highly recommend this for all who played the classic as this new entry brings back more of the same Carmageddon experience!\n\n9/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 126, "steamid": "76561198003422578", "last_played": 1506645184, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 726, "playtime_forever": 1918}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504912140, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504852", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504912140, "recommendationid": "34824941", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So, i just reached for 100% in my career mode after 31 + 38 hours of play, it's time to review. \n\nI'm i big fan of Carmageddon series. First time i play first game was in year 1999. I was just 14 years old and this instantly. became one of my favorites game in that time. Graphic, physics, gore and fun was outstanding in this game. I liked it even more, because i played it secretly, when parents were gone, because it was forbidden game for me :). Later i played all other Carmaggeddon games. I even modded Carmaggedon 2 an made some cars for it, when i was about 15 years old. \n\nIt was pitty, that no Carmageddon game came out later, even when games like GTA substituted pedestrian slaghtering, it was not that good in this. When i first learned, that remake is preapared and alpha of Carmageddon: Reincarnation is available, i bought it instantly. \n\nAlpha has been so much bugy, it was not even playable. Loading time of map was about 2-3 minutes. I was disappointed and didn't play game of a while. Later i bought GTX1060 and i gave it a second chance. In that time was the game fixed and more playable. I make progress in my career up to 90%, and then i found that Carmageddon: Max Damage was released. Yeah, pitty that all my progress goes to waste, but what ever i began from beginning in Max Damage.\n\nMax Damage was noticably better optimised, faster, with better enhanced graphic. It's not a top notch, but still it's nice. Career mode is really challenging. Every item and upgrade must be earned. Wrecking of oponents and destruction model is pretty komplex and smashing of the oponents in replay mode looks great. Hurting peds is all the way fun as in the first game in series. It's even more fun with tons of power-ups, you can tear legs from ped, you can burn them down, you can levitate them up to the air and drop them down. Speaking of replay mode, you can have lots of fun from watching nasty smashes to the pedestrians or oponents. \n\nDownside is clunky control of some vehicles. I know, some cars are weird by it self, but controls could be at least predictible. Another downside is that there are no players online, it could be fun. Last thing are few glitches, that still stays there, but nothing critical.\n\nIn general, this game is successful successor and remake of Carmageddon 1. It's fun casual play, when you want to clear your head and just play something fun. \n\nPros\n-it's Carmageddon\n-fun to play\n-fast action\n-lots of blood\n-lots of destruction\n-lots of powerups\n-replay mode\n\nCons\n-not a top notch graphic\n-clunky controls\n-sometimes glitches\n-no players online", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 67, "steamid": "76561198013334146", "last_played": 1506545315, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 196, "playtime_forever": 2310}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506297827, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500313", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506298088, "recommendationid": "35193211", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I fired an anvil at a dog.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "steamid": "76561198028701401", "last_played": 1506531630, "num_reviews": 76, "num_games_owned": 320, "playtime_forever": 208}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506532452, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500313", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506532452, "recommendationid": "35245767", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I thouroughly enjoyed this game.
