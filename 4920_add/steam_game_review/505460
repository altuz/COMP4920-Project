You gain experience from doing stuff like healing soldiers,killing enemies,gathering. and rank, ranks are given from players that earned commendation points through the same tasks that gaining experience require.And what kept me going during those 7 hours is the commendations that kept coming in and how thankful front soldiers where from the job i was doing.At the end we won some great players manage to assemble and get together a fleet of Half Tracks(basically tanks but with machine guns) for the final push. it was the greatest game i had in my life and i been an hardcore gamer for 13 years now.\n\nBUY THIS GAME!!!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 3894, "steamid": "76561197983928289", "last_played": 1507075886, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 89, "playtime_forever": 12908}, "votes_up": 31, "timestamp_created": 1505511610, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552976", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505511814, "recommendationid": "34981884", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "i bought this game with high hopes.

In this review, I will be going over what Foxhole is, what it has to offer, and identify it's strengths and weaknesses in it's current state which at the time this review was written, the version is 0.4 Alpha, the Amphibious Warfare Update.\nLet's get started shall we?\n\n\n[h1]Important information on Foxhole[/h1]\n\nNow granted, you must know this going in, there is a HUGE learning curb here in Foxhole, and if you don't devote some time to reading the tutorials, checking out official videos on how to play, or communicating with your team, you are going to most likely [b]hate[/b] your first experience.\n\nYou will spawn in at your army's main headquarters, you will have a hammer and a pistol with a single magazine. You can gether scrap and hundreds of other materials in your backpack, but be careful as your bag gets heavy upon gathering materials, carry too much and you will become encumbered.\n Your objective, win the war. To win, you must capture all towns and your enemies' main headquarters, pretty simple. Upon spawning in, you can do one of two things, you can fight on the front lines, or you can take part in logistics operations. Rifles and other weapons do not grow on trees in Foxhole; they must be created through scrap, components and other various recources from the field of operation, and creating and manufacturing these weapons is quite a process.\nOne final thing, Foxhole is not a game that can be won by yourself. If you are not coordinating with your teammates through your microphone or text, then you're not going to be assisting your team very much by wasting recources trying to kill the enemy yourself, you will easily get killed all alone. Instead, look for some teammates to tag along with, fortunately the Foxhole community is full of very good and passionate players... mostly. The player's rank is displayed in parentheses to the left of their Steam username. Corporals and Sergeants are the most common and have a good amout of experience on what to do in a squad, don't be shy to talk with your teammates; communication is key.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\n\nVery fluid gameplay. It's a top to bottom shooter, taking aim will represent a line displaying the exact direction where you are aiming your weapon. There are many many different weapons in the game from rifles (which is the most common), SMGs, Carbines, Mortars, Assault rifles, Machine guns - you name it. Pro tip: you are harder to hit at a range when you are crouching or proning. Your visibility is greatly reduced at night, so you must stayon your toes when partolling at after dusk. I get this eerie feeling when slowly advancing to the enemy town with my squad, the thought strikes you - \"Are we walking into an ambush?\" \"Is there an enemy foxhole just up ahead?\" Combat can get tense.\nEven though there are only 7 maps, each of these maps are enourmous, and the average war can take hours and hours to end; I've never participated in a war from start to finish in a single sitting.\n\n\n[h1]Story of Foxhole[/h1]\n\n\nThere is not much known about the lore of Foxhole, however there are a couple of known facts and notes found by players during the weekly wars that give an idea of what the lore is about.\n\nFoxhole has two fictional factions, the Wardens and the Colonials, fighting a 100-year war in a fictional world (It's locations and setting do not have any correlation with the real world). The makeup of the two factions geographically are unknown, but they do not represent the historical Allies and Axis, even though many players including myself enjoy to depict the Colonials as U.S. Forces and the Wardens as the Axis Forces.\n\n\n[h1]Issues with Foxhole[/h1]\n\nMy largest gripe with Foxhole is how boring and tedious this game can be while running logistics operations, everybody who joins a war wants to grab a gun and fight, who wants to swing a hammer for an hour? And the thing is, logistics is arguably the most important role to play in this game. As I said before, weapons and ammo don't grow on trees. And many players take all these weapons and equipment for granted. Look at it this way: That Assault rifle that guy took and lost.. had taken 3 hours to produce. And yes, it can take 3 or more hours to create an assault rifle, because only logistics can muster the technology upgrades to produce said weapon, [b]which takes a long time.[/b] Logistics needs to be less of a hassle, or simply add a mode where you can respawn with more weapons and medical supplies. I get that Foxhole is supposed to simulate real war in a way, but it would be nice to see some changes.\nAnother issue is the reprimandation system griefers can use on any player at will as they please. If you are reprimanded, you lose an hours worth of experience points from playing the game; this happened to one of my friends, he was just about to hit the Sergeant rank and suddenly, he was ranomly reprimanded by some troll. The reprimandation system needs tweaking.\nThe next thing is when an army starts losing the war, the players on that team begin to lose the will to fight and proceed to drop from the server, this leads to the opposing army crushing their enemy beneath their treads as the game drops to 60 VS 20.\n\nLast thing I could say that would improve Foxhole, I believe more Players vs Ememies content is needed, it would help ease more players into the action, and it would be nice to just sit back and have a good time with your friends.\n\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\n\nOverall, Foxhole is very innovative and fresh, of course, this is in 0.4 Alpha at the time this review was written, so there are many spaces for improvement.\nFoxhole earns my recommendation for it's diverse gameplay, and the memorable moments I had with my squad on the battlefield. I got my $20 dollars worth from Foxhole. I am currently taking a break from Foxhole for now, once I return, I am hoping Clapfoot will add or improve some of the features I have listed above. If you have any friends that are considering Foxhole, it may be worth giving it a shot.\n\n\nThe final rating for Foxhole is a difficult one since this is an Early Access Game. But for me, the final rating for Foxhole stands at a 6/10. I hope to see a lot more from this game in the future.\n\nThis is my first review for an Early Access Game, This is Commander Stealth and I will see you all on the next review.\n\n\nOver and out. ~Stealth", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198064021071", "last_played": 1505802903, "num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_forever": 1594}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1505811725, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530105", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505812947, "recommendationid": "35060706", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "One of the best teamwork games i've played in recent years.

Once, I stumbled upon a trauma kit and began to help men out. I was no medic since I didn't have the proper equipment and training, but men looked up to me to save their lives.\n\nWhen night came, the enemy committed themselves to an offensive I had not expected. My eyes saw many fall trying to defend the FOB, but it was all in vain when the outpost fell. Many tried to hold the line; however, their bodies were now soaked in the dirt. With each dead man, I scavenged his body for ammo. Yes, it is disrespectful to the dead, but he would have done the same to me. Then, I was wounded in an attempt to resupply my fellow soldiers.\n\nOnce I was recovered, I was transfered to a different front. The enemy was trying to cut us off from our supply lines. Realizing we would be encircled, I rallied the disheartened to protect our only working factory left. We were the only men able to stand against the tide.\n\nThree platoons, about thirty men followed me on the road, singing songs to calm our minds. It was a death sentence, but the men on the other fronts needed us to survive. As soon as we made contact with the enemy, casualties mounted as I watched my platoons get cut down by machine gun and mortars.\n\nOnly five of us survived the engagement, but we averted disaster with those men.

Second are the manufacturers and haulers. These guys turn these BMATs into actual equipment or vehicles for the team, haulers are the guys who take equipment or BMATs across the map to where it is needed. Then there are the soldiers, the people doing the actual fighting. That is actuall the least important thing in this game, without any guns how are you going to win the war? There are also builders, who build a variety of structures key to defense and map awareness or production.\n\nSo here we have:\n1. Scrappers\n2. Refiners\n3. Manufacturers\n4. Haulers\n5. Builders\n6. Soldiers and people manning armed vehicles\n\nEvery player in the game can choose what he could do to help his team. But the most important role are the squad leaders the team coordinators, they make sure the basic roles are balanced out and make sure they do what the team actually needs. With good squad leaders a game can go amazingly swell, everybody would know what to do, and noobs could be guided by them if they appear to be struggling. \n\nThe concept itself is great and from other players' experiences the concept does indeed work on practice.\n\nBut...\n\nThe game is shaped by the people. There are no rules besides no griefing (obviously) so people could do whatever they want. There is no REAL reason to actually fight. Why not turtle in your base and build dozens of layers of fortresses and turrets? The game itself is a sandbox letting the player decide how the war will play out. The game gives the tools and we do the dirty work. But when the player has no idea what to do or nobody is listening to each other or communicating to each other, this game cannot work. \n\nSo far the game has no tutorials and rarely will anyone actually \"help\" noobs or each other for that matter. They haul it because the team needs it, not because that guy over there has no ammunition on him. This means although it is a team game, everybody is stuck doing their own thing. Hmmm, I want to be a trucker! Well firstly, you need to gather the BMATs to make them. Ask another player? They aren't guna give you their vehicle only for them to go through the entire process of making a truck all over again. There are no guiding hands, and although this is a cooperation game, everybody really fends for himself. We aren't watching for eachothers backs we are simply caring for the greater good, the team itself. And if I think I can do better by hauling items for the team, maybe I might go steal somebody elses truck to do that. Of course this is hard to do with the internet but IMO the game just isn't worth it if you are going solo.\n\nThis game just isnt my cup of tea. The community is toxic, and although soldiers are \"cooperating\" together as a team they are still fending for themselves. I think noobs should automatically get placed in \"rookie\" squads, as a full on tutorial would probably break the spirit of the game. Without a bond with your teammates and only focusing on the bigger picture the game won't play out as well. \n\nI do agree that the game is quite well, nothing wrong with it. Just the community. I accidentally stole a truck on my first game and I confronted the guy to apologize and he shot me down and killed me. He later ran me over with the same truck while I was AFK reading a guide. From my experience, everybody is fending for themselves, each truck is owned by 1 person and he doesn't give a flying fuck about the random noobs sitting in the street. This game needs more incentive on cooperation.\n\nThough, Galih just get it. If you can handle Elite Dangerous grind, the solo work should be fine for you. If not, use mic and say \"Im noob plz help\" and hope the guy doesnt get on his truck immediately and drive away.\n\nTL;DR: very social game. people are all solo introverts hermit following squad leader orders. mad extroverts are screaming in chat about how he aint got grenades in location A. and calm extroverts are like \"quit bitching and let the hive mind do its thing\"\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198107995368", "last_played": 1505127938, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 71, "playtime_forever": 205}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1507021268, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511270", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1507021268, "recommendationid": "35439982", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Sadly this is my first review after many many years of gaming.. foxhole is an incredible game, who just got shot down by the region lock.
