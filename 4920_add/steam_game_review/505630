Just like Dark souls....  heh.  Nah, just kidding although there were a couple of f-bombs droped on a few waves. Still it's a good way to spend a quick break and just disconnect from the world while you save the earth.\nPlenty of weapon and item conbinations, music complements the overall ambient nicely with some good synth jams.\nThe grafics suit the pixel art style nicely. Might need some precaution if you suffer from seizures as it gets flashy when you get on a roll.\nStill in progress of trying the extra modes like the \"Play with twitch\" and \"Boss Challenge\".

It's the perfect game to play when your unwinding, on hold at the computer, or just killing some time. I really didn't expect to enjoy it half as much as I did, but what a pleasant surprise. If you enjoy blowing things to pieces, lots of upgrades, 80s/90s scifi look and feel and just plain fun, then you should grab this game. https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=siITNYQv7bM  Here's a review/let's play that shows off the first 25 levels, the first boss, and most of the games features.
