The game itself is easy to get into and once you master the mechanics its fairly simple to beat the AI on hard. It truly shines in the multiplayer, especially if you have a friend to play with, but if not the queue for matchmaking is usually fairly short. There are some elements of RNG involved, and you certainly can get screwed from time to time, but its not as bad as many other board games and a game never feels unsalvageable. For its price its a great value proposition, especially if you get it on a sale.\n\n Recommended if you like boardgames!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1198, "steamid": "76561198383794231", "last_played": 1506319447, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 51, "playtime_forever": 5075}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505848545, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502582", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505848545, "recommendationid": "35070748", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not a bad way to pass a few hours. Gets a little old after the first five.\n\nSome animations take too long or can't be skipped, some mechanics aren't well-described. Some of the units are consumable and there's no clear opening strategy or even a good tutorial beyond the simple explanation of the game/story mode. Leaders are purely cosmetic and have no difference in function, a fact that is not immediately apparent. Soundtrack isn't bad, but it gets repetitive. Games can last for a full hour if you don't know what you're doing.\n\nAlthough it might seem like I'm unhappy with my purchase, I'm not.
