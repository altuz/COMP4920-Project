Instead of having a gun of some sort and being stationary the game is constantly moving forward sort of like unbreakable vr runner.\n\nThen on top of that you are flying and manuvering your ship through space trying to dodge rocks, enemy fire, and obstacles all while returning fire and collecting crystals to try to beat your highscore.\n\nAnother thing it does better then most games that have waves is that it doesn't start out with one enemy, then wave two has a few more, slowly building up. The first handful of games I died on wave 1. So even after dying and starting over you are still challenged from the start instead of being bored for 10-15 minutes while trying to get back to where you were.\n\nThe fact that the game is so challenging I think is what really makes this game as great as it is. I expected to load it up and get at least a few waves in but I found that every time it was a struggle to get through each and every wave! This keeps the game from getting too stale, it's a good balance where it's hard, but not too hard.\n\nNow on top of all this we can also look at the price tag, it's 1.99. For a game that I will probably play 5+ hours before any more updates are even done it is well worth the money!\n\nLinked below is my first impression gameplay commentary of The Crystal Nebula if you want to see the game in action check it out below!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=733858380", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043450023", "last_played": 1469790682, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1469816856, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504754", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1469817003, "recommendationid": "24600469", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Super fun little game at an amazing price.

The wand has tractor-beaming so you can collect those gems from a distance - but not too far as you\u00b4ll miss them. AFAIK you can eventually use a short-lasting SHIELD if you collect enough of those little gems and use the second controller to protect yourself from incoming bullets.\n\nThis is a room-scale shooter so you\u00b4re gonna move around a bit, especially when those labyrinth space-station-rocks come scrolling towards you, there are enemies and bonuses to collect inside those, so keep looking for that extra stuff. \n\nPros:\n\n- Awesome smooth scrolling space shooter arcade game for only 1.99!\n- Has more variation that many of the other quickly released VR games these days.\n- Global leaderboards (keeps you replaying and fighting to be seen at the top).\n- Glitch free (Tested machine I7-5820K, 32GB, GeForce 1070GTX) performance.\n- 80s arcade feel, this is what you dreamed of back in the 80s future games would look like.\n- Good workout, makes you sweat a little.\n\nCons: \n\n- Lacks game modes.\n- Shield too short and can be spoiled during intermissions.\n- Textures a bit on the primitive low-res side. (3D studio Max 1.2 memories anyone?) ;)\n- Back breaker, those caves and tunnels will demand giant leaps up and down. \n- No health indicator, you can see the ship burn when low...but no meter or indicator.\n- No realtime score (you\u00b4ve gotta guess where you are at).\n- Space ship attackers extremely predictable, has a clearly visible easy approach pattern.\n\nClearly things can be improved, but you get a LOT more in this game than MORE expensive games here on Steam, this one is well worth your collection ...even if they didn\u00b4t improve on it further.

I rarely write a review but this one really deserves it. Its a classic style shooter and runs flawlessly and glitch free in VR on my Vive with a i7600K, 32 gig ram / NVidia 980ti. First of all at $1.99 its a steal. You have your ship in one hand and a crystal collector which converts to a shield when it is powered up. Your enemies are drones that shoot at you and you shoot asteriods of various sizes to get the crystals as well as getting them from the drones and other enemies. You go through waves and between the shooting you go through narrow areas that completey surround you and the immersive feeling is so intense and polished. It has great graphics with an amazing mezmorizing soundtract that adds so much to the game. Music is such a huge part of any VR experence and there are SO many devolopers that have great sounding music when your viewing their videos at the Steam store and you buy the game and theres little or nothing. Now the very slight negative. The game is very hard and just to get to the 3rd or 4th wave is a huge acomplishment which is about 8 minutes long. You only have one life and when your ship gets too many hits (15 to be percise) thats it...\"GAME OVER\". If it was a little less difficult, maybe 3 lives and more waves and a few different enviorments, I would easily pay $10-15 dollars for it.
