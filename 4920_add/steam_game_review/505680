That much should be known. I can easily see someone paying a dollar to play this game at a VR arcade one time, so the price is beyond great. There are only a few things that I wish were different. For starters, you only get one weapon. In my opinion, having two vive controllers would only make sense to allow the player to have two weapons to fight off the hordes. A simple mistake that takes A LOT away from this title. The controls are a little peculiar, too. The grip button AND the trigger allow you to throw the glaive. This was only a problem to me while I was adjusting my controller grip to better attack the enemies. Making that matter worse, there are no options to adjust this. Actually, there are no settings at all. Apart from these flaws, the game is immersive, creepy and has you checking your six constantly when you hear those creatures approaching. It uses a unique lighting system also that will definitely add to your paranoia when you see something out of the corner of your eye. Steam has me at 0.9 hours of playtime at the time of this review, and I can say without embarassment that I haven't beaten all the levels yet. I highly recommend this title, and it will be one of the programs I show off to friends and fams demonstrating how cool VR is.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000028698", "last_played": 1498784976, "num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 83, "playtime_forever": 78}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1492971053, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492971053, "recommendationid": "31325553", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fun game, and so cheap it's hard to pass up!
