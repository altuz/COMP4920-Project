There are three primary storylines plus a ton of randomly-generated quests and events. If you don't like doofy pop culture puns, you won't like this. If you don't like choose-your-own-adventure events interspersed with objectively repetitive (but still super fun) turn-based battles, you won't like this. And if you're so incredibly fragile that exactly one throwaway line about gender being a social construct gets your nuts in a wad, you won't like this.\n\nYou will love it if you loved devoting yourself to games like Final Fantasy 8 as a kid, if a good grind session never scared you off, if gambling battle outcomes on your limit breaks was exciting rather than infuriating and if stubbornly reloading your saves when Triple Triad battles went way south is how you ended up with all those one-shot-only super rare cards. (Back before \"save scumming\" was a cardinal sin.) It doesn't walk or talk like Final Fantasy 8, but it has that [i]feeling[/i], you know? It's just a good time.\n\nThe scenery is incredibly beautiful, it's pretty quick to get an handle on the gameplay, and for being actual, literal potatoes, the characters are endearing as heck. Also, it's the only game that's ever made me string together the words \"mermaid carrot boobs.\" And that counts for something. I'm not sure what that something is, but it counts for it.\n\nP.S. Getting the rarer achievements for making weapons, by the way, entail doing what it asks in a [i]single[/i] playthrough, not cumulatively.
