The plot is sadly barebones/nonexistant as of this time and you're unceremoniously dropped into the action; great if you want to just jump into the action, less great if you want to know why you're a dragon kid going around shooting everything up.\n\nThe gunplay feels really solid.  The base gun isn't bad, though one-shot-per-button-press is pretty annoying.  If it would slowly autofire (with the Ultra Combo system letting it go into hyperdrive) with the option to button mash for hairy situations, that'd be much more enjoyable to me.  Other guns feel really satisfying (especially the shoulder-mounted Laser gun which makes your char grin in glee when wielding.)\n\nBoss fights are definitely pretty enjoyable, good rhythm between dodging bullets, dealing with mooks, and trying to find moments to unleash hot lead into them.\n\nMusic is also pretty good and solid overall if you like chiptunes.\n\nOverall I'd say if you love Contra run-and-gun action, pick this up.\n\nEDIT: The autofire addition was patched in, as was being able to swap away from the big guns to save ammo.

Great work guys, can't wait for more updates! \n\nFor people looking to buy this game:\nThe game in single player takes control of one of the dragons and you manouvere across levels that contain some platform elements but coupled with the high-paced action it makes for great fun.

Seems like it would be an unusual rip off of super smash bros by the title but it's not, it's just a really solid side-scrolling shooter.

This game mostly grabbed my attention on the fact that... Well, dragons. Plus the retro look got me extra interested. So I got this game on the spot months after playing the demo. And I friggin love it. The plot is as simple as, a group of baby dragons were born while their mother was taken away by evil robots. The group's first instincts are as follows. \n\n1. Realize mother is missing\n2. Steal a bunch of weapons and clothes\n3. Let's shoot some robots.\n\nThese are the stranges baby dragons in existance and yet the coolest. Also why is there only three in the intro when there's four elsewhere? Not to mention they all have names if you check the original website's press kit page and look for the images of the four characters.\n\nBlue Dragon: Larimar\nRed(Orange?) Dragon: Ruby\nPink Dragon: Coralie\nOrange Dragon: Amber\n\nOkay so chances are the pink and orange one are female judging by the names. But I'm not very sure at all honestly. *shrug*\n\nThat aside, the game is simple bullet-hell like platform shooter game. You get your basic yellow blaster. (Which is actually a robot arm. Who knew?) No ammo limit but you gotta spam tap the heck outta it to kill. Kinda hurts after a while. Although there's a machine gun that has rapid fire automatically. Every weapon has a super ability and all of them provide super fire power with infinite ammo for as long as it last and you can hold the trigger for the time being. Execpt for the laser weapon. You just get a screen-wide laser sweep. But that's cool too! The game's soundtrack is one of the biggest things in this game for me. It's so catchy that I bought the soundtrack only a day after I played the full game! I must admit, the main theme (Named, \"Dragon Bros!\" which plays at every boss fight.) really gave me that, \"Intense, energy rush\" feeling. Like I HAD to win this for the sake of myself. It motivated me to keep on trying no matter what. And I love it when music gives me that vibe. It's all the more worth listening to from there. Now then... The bosses. The game's bosses don't grab my attention too much in any way at all really. But I love em otherwise.  Just nothing worth pointing out. Soz. Although I do want to point out that I love the game's sense of rhythm in it's music. 90% of the time things in the level will be moving in some way to the beat of the music. Even traps! It's quite crazy and makes you want to just sit there and shake your head doesn't it?\n\nSo let's chop things down into simple to understand bite-sized pieces.\n\nGameplay: Bullet-hellish Platform Shooter\n\nMain playable characters: Larimar (Player 1) and Ruby (Player 2)\n\nPlot: A group of baby dragons get their mother taken away. And what do they do? Steal weapons and go on a mother fricken hunt.\n\nOverall this game derserves as much as it can get. Considering this game is still in early access however... I do want to say that I'd be careful buying this game if I were you. As chances are, it's in developement hell. I'm hoping it comes back out and gets on the move.
