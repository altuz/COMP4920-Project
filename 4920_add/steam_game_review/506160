However, my graphic setting seems to be stuck on \"fastest\" and it's very noticeable low quality even though I have a superclocked TITAN X. I have a Rift CV1 and a monitor that is 3440x1440 which the startup config window is also locked on. I dont know if that combo is a problem. Also, the fractals seem very dim. The brightness needs to be cranked to the point that I must be doing something wrong? The colored balls fractal is the only one one that seems to have acceptable lighting.\n\nThe black graphics that are used look like black goo or loading problems until i zoom in very close to the fractals. Then I understand what it is. If it was brighter and higher quality graphics (very blocky low res), I might understand better.\n\nThe main menu looks... wrong. It's beyond the purple fractal, distant, flat and wide and scaled wierd / not easy to reach. There are left and right arrows that seem to be useless (like on a web hero slider). I'm guessing because there are only 8 fractals and these arrows would load more but there is no indication that they shouldnt work, like being greyed out or removed when not needed.\n\nSome of these problems may be my setup or something.

Thanks for the detailed review. Hopefully I can address some of your concerns here.\n\n[quote=Tonybyte] However, my graphic setting seems to be stuck on \"fastest\" and it's very noticeable low quality even though I have a superclocked TITAN X.[/quote]\n\nThis is normal - the graphics settings there aren't really relevant because there is an ingame auto-optimizer that will adjust your settings to ensure a consistent frame rate for VR. This is the \"black goo\" that you see as well. Your CPU could be slowing you down if it is below the min specs, otherwise, try closing other programs if possible to give VR Fractals as much processor power as possible. Rendering fractals in real time using raycasting on the GPU is very computationally expensive. Another thing you could try is restarting your computer - Windows 10 seems to slow down after I have it running for a few days without restarting it, but restarting it usually fixed that problem for me. You can also try this is you experience any judder.\n\n[quote=Tonybyte] Also, the fractals seem very dim. The brightness needs to be cranked to the point that I must be doing something wrong? ... If it was brighter and higher quality graphics (very blocky low res), I might understand better.[/quote]\n\nIf you are looking at the capture on your monitor it will appear a little dim - this is normal. I tried to keep the brightness down so it was easy on the eyes, but it should be fine in VR.\n\n[quote=Tonybyte] The main menu looks... wrong.

[/quote]\n\nThere's a couple issues here. The scaling issue is probably because the scale is off for you - I just pushed out an update that should fix this problem, go ahead and try it when you get a chance. The arrows were slightly grayed out, but that makes sense that they weren't grayed out enough. This new update removes the arrows since you're right at the moment they aren't relevant.\n\n[quote=Tonybyte] Some of these problems may be my setup or something. It feels like early access.

It's nice not having to wait over night to find a black screen render.
