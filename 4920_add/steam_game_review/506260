The combat system and overall gameplay is deceptively simple. it's an action RPG vaguely similar to the Legend of Zelda series, where you control a character with a limited selection of abilities in a gridless battlefield filled with enemies and traps - most of the mind-numbing complexity comes from the insane amount of customization options and the Magic Circle system, which bolsters your main character's stats and abilities by using your other characters as something like equipment pieces. It's the same basic setup as previous entries in the Cladun series, but Cladun Returns packs in a lot of new extra features, such as additional randomly-generated dungeons, new weapon types, and new enemies. It's also a far more competent port than Cladun x2, its predecessor.\n\nNIS games can typically be played by those not interested in endless grinds, because those features usually start up after you've already finished the game. Cladun Returns is no different, and the main campaign can be finished with only minimal detours and grinding. Unfortunately, the additions from Cladun x2 aren't very noticeable in the main campaign, and the storyline in x2 is far more complete and interesting than the plot in Returns, for those who aren't well-versed in the Sengoku era of Japan (not that the plot is the main draw of either game, of course). Due to that, it's difficult to recommend Cladun Returns above Cladun x2 to casual fans of the series.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't recommend this above Cladun x2 to diehard fans of NIS games, numbercrunchers, or people looking for an endless grind either. The draw of the Cladun series is that the postgames transition to being intense roguelites all about slogging through randomly-generated 99-floor dungeons for loot and profit. Theoretically, the added dungeons, enemies, and customization features should make this a superior product to x2 in spite of its slightly weaker storyline - the main problem is the added content and especially the new customization features, which are often poorly playtested and sometimes downright gamebreaking. \n\n(For example: one of the new enemy types, a giant multi-headed serpent based on Yamata no Orochi, appears in the third chapter of the main storyline - due to its wonky stat scaling you can barely scratch it, so the \"best\" way to fight it is to stand directly behind it so it whiffs with all of its attacks and plink it to death over the course of 4 minutes. A lot of the other new content is equally tedious, with many of the new enemies relying on lengthy invulnerability phases - the only new content that seemed to be worthwhile and fun were the new weapon types, and to some extent the new dungeon varieties.)\n\nAs far as the actual gamebreaking components go, the main culprits are the additions to the title system (which allows you to add prefixes to equipment to give yourself passive benefits). While titles in x2 typically gave useful bonuses but were almost never downright essential, some of the new titles introduced in Returns allow you to never trigger traps while walking on them (removing one of the biggest difficulties of the game), bring back all equipment earned from a dungeon run even if you get a Game Over (nullifying any real consequence for defeat), and increase all of your damage resistances to the point that you become completely immune to all attacks (nullifying every other challenge remaining). \n\nDue to the fact that Cladun Returns allows you to add these titles to sufficiently powerful weapons through a new feature at the blacksmith shop, it's very easy to achieve effective immortality very early into the postgame if you know what you're doing, making any further grinding completely pointless. Given the entire premise of NIS games is endlessly grinding in the postgame to grow stronger, the title additions undercut the game's entire premise - why take 300 hours to boost your stats to absurd levels, when you can be handed total immortality in 30?\n\nI love the Cladun series and I definitely enjoyed my time in Cladun Returns, so it's painful to give this game a review of Not Recommended. But as it stands, there's little reason to purchase this game over its (significantly cheaper) predecessor.
