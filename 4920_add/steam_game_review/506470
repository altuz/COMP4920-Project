The game mechanics take some getting used to because your speed isn't consistant.  If you need to turn around, it takes a second to get back up to speed.  This makes dodging the Danre pretty challenging the further into the game you get, but I stand by my original opinion that this game is incredibly fun! \n\nWhen you finish the unique story (and let me tell you, I loved the dialogue that went along with each level) you can either go back and try to get the best score for each level, or you can play Endless mode and scream at your computer like I did until you make it onto the leaderboard!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198279731788", "last_played": 1471230159, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_forever": 170}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1470733964, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505227", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1471229563, "recommendationid": "24790452", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The setting and ideas behind this game are very unique, and the story is interesting.
