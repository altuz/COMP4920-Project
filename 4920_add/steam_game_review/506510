It's a basic old school rts that's not telling a compellingly deep story, but it's still good to follow through nonetheless. The graphics i personally think are very well done and really add to that classic feeling from the past. The game is not that lengthy (9-12h) depending on your playstyle it could be a bit more, but the developers are including new dlcs as we speak (Oct. 2nd 2017) which will add to the overall enjoyability and length of the game including new features and whatnot. \nThe sound/music is overall enjoyable too, but please also note it's similar to those scores and sounds from way back in the snes/Super Nintendo days.. So they've basically kept it all as real as possible which to me just adds to the whole as a retro game should be in the end. (But i know it will not fancy everyone who isn't yet as old als me) ^_^ \nTo conclude, it's a very enjoyable game guys but keep in mind that this game offers nothing spectacular, however what if does offer works very well together as a whole and it's very stable on whatever system you like running it on. \nThe developers are all very nice and responsive to feedback and offer help as soon as they can, which is always a really nice way to support the future projects for this developing team. \nThere's still more to say about this game obviously, but i'm not a man of many hints or spoilers so i can only advice others to check out the game (it's also offering regular discounts etc) and it's not expensive to get at all considering what you get in return. \nGive it a try guys, and thumbs up if you like it and if not well refund it for something else (Steam). \n\nCheers!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "steamid": "76561198029242857", "last_played": 1506113568, "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 331, "playtime_forever": 145}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505902942, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505902942, "recommendationid": "35081249", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A talking save point remind you to save the game and heal you just before the first boss,\neven though you can save anywhere in the game.\nvery great game. 10/10. need more of this good guy talking save point.\n\nJokes aside,\nI think this game mainly appeal to those who plays older RPGs with the pixel graphics.\nFor me this game remind me so much of RPGs that I used to play when I was little.\nAnd because of that, I decided to try this game, and I must say I'm really impressed.\n\nThe game have a very well-made pixel graphic with great battle, walking, and even expression animation.\nThe music is really great and really capture the moments in the game.\nThe Battle system uses simple RPG basics such as attacks, skills, magic, equips, with no confusing stuff, and that is a big plus for me.\nThe story is good with some comedy here and there. (I might need to update this later after beating the game)\n\nI definitely recommend this game for those who likes a well-crafted old-style RPG.\nAlso a new DLC is coming up that adds New Game+ Content.

Along with a turn-based battle system using an AP system where you recover some AP every turn and unique skills for every character that can synergize quite well with one another, the animation quality is quite top notch and surprisingly pleasant.\n\nThe soundtrack, which is available as a separate download, sounds very retro with a few memorable themes. At times however, there seems to be a disrepancy between the styles used as some themes will definitively feel like an attempt to reproduce MIDI chips while other themes will be much more orchestrated in style. As for overall sound design, battles definitively feel much more impactful than expected, with hits and skills being satisfactingly deep and crisp.\n\nThe story is entertaining yet not something that will blow away expectations. However, it has enough original ideas to make you continue on your quest. Some characters are quite interesting and funny while one in particular is a dead giveaway for a well known antagonist from another JRPG. Regardless, the heroes themselves have interesting personalities that, unlike most recent JRPGs, aren't too outlandish or exagerated; for the genre, the heroes feel grounded and believable instead of face-palmingly annoying.\n\nThe pacing is controlled in dungeon by the use of puzzles that uses specific mechanics. Some of these puzzles will leave you pondering on the solution for quite some time (and for that, let me advise you : the solution is usually far less complex than you expect) which lengthens the experience. All in all, I believe a good hour to an hour and a half might've been of puzzle solving. And the final dungeon gave a twist with one of the puzzles that I really didn't expect.\n\nGear progression is linear in that most towns will give you progressively better gear while dungeons will have a few unique pieces hidden behind more difficult puzzles. Given the gear is divived only between Weapon, Armor and Accessory, I was pleased that seeking the harder to find items often gave a serious boon to your characters.\n\n[h1]Verdict...[/h1]\n\nOverall, the experience is very nice for the price tag and the game can run for around 12 to 14 hours, depending on your puzzle deduction skills and willingness to search for secrets and endgame quests for the truly powerful equipment.\n\nIf you're looking for a little throwback to the early SNES era JRPGs and want something that feels polished as you play it, then this title definitively deserves to be given a try.\n\nIt definitively makes me look forward to the next game this developer will create.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989563720", "last_played": 1505274032, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 714, "playtime_forever": 825}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505275630, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505275772, "recommendationid": "34912948", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fantastic recreation of old school 8-bit rpgs.
