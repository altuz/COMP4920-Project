The game feels great now!  So I'll leave my original review for context,  but know that I can wholeheartedly recommend this game even more than before.  \n\n*Original review- This is a good game,  but it could be a great one if the problem of the shots coming from so far behind you is fixed.  It really kills a lot of the fun to be shooting at everything and bullets are flying from 20' behind you.  It makes it feel like you can't really aim at anything,  almost like you're pointing at stuff that someone else is shooting at.  That said,  it's still a thumbs up for being an excellent rollercoaster VR with a high level of polish and content for the price. \n\nIt didn't make me sick and I giggled like a schoolgirl on a rollercoaster with guns.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197977172115", "last_played": 1482560984, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 781, "playtime_forever": 50}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1473925714, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509038", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1475554053, "recommendationid": "25507619", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game has such a neat concept.  You're basically combining a \"rail shooter\" with literal rails (in the form of a roller coaster track).  Unfortunately the execution of the concept isn't as good.\n\nIt boils down to this: the \"coaster\" is moving so fast and yet the game is lagged behind so it never seems like you're shooting where you're aiming. The game hints that you'll need to aim ahead, but to me it seems like you need to aim EARLY as well as ahead.  Maybe if I turn the graphics down somehow it'll work better.  Nothing in the game looks so intense that it would stress out the GTX 1080 SC I have though.  It's also not like the framerate is bad in game.  It's just that my shots seem lagged by about 100-120ms or so.\n\nThe weirdness of this effect is that I can fire a shot, and because I'm moving forward and the track is going downward, I'll see the shot fly from slightly behind me and above me even though my gun is by my waist.  I tried repositioning the controllers in several ways to see if it was some weirdness from the way it was being tracked but it didn't seem to matter.  Shots to the side didn't seem to be lagged as bad.  Only shooting directly in front.\n\nThings I liked:\n[list]\n  [*] Rollercoasters and guns, sounds like a good time.\n  [*] The main menu graphics look nice\n  [*] There's an exit option that actually exits the game instead of having to hit the steam button and exit from there like a bunch of other games.\n  [*] The scenery changes from day to night as you go through the various laps.\n  [*] For the most part, the coasters are exciting enough to feel like a ride, and mild enough that you aren't horking up your intestines.\n[/list]\n\nThings I didn't like:\n[list]\n  [*] The apparent lag in the shots.  Your shots are all projectiles instead of beams or hitscan so aiming them is annoying.\n  [*] The enemy is rather uninspired.  most of them are just jagged blobs of whatever.  Only one or two enemies struck me as cool.\n  [*] Half the time you can't even tell what the hell hit you. \n  [*] Because of the lag, hitting the \"health\" pickups is made extra difficult though it seemed worse on later levels than the first level (maybe because there are fewer health pickups)\n  [*] After you finish your 3rd lap and \"win\" it makes you take a victory lap around the track and really, 3 laps is plenty, thank you.  \n  [*] The music isn't very memorable.  This is another game where immediately after quitting the game I can't even remember what the songs sounded like. \n[/list]\n\nI love the concept of the game, I just don't like the execution.  Also the game store page says \"10 tracks\" but 2 of those tracks are marked \"Free ride\" so really there's only 8 levels.\n\nI feel like this game needs a bit more polish on the enemies and some of the game mechanics to be more fun. Most people would probably say \"Eh, it's only $5, so who cares?\" but I'm not likely to get 5 hours of gameplay out of this (because it's not that much fun).  I'm not going to refund it, but I wouldn't recommend it either.
