It stands out from all of the other games (mostly because of its free roam). One of the best parts i like about it is that it's not just jumpscares. I always like when a game or movie has a in depth story that makes sense and is very criptic (which is one of the reasons I love FNAF). This game is moe lore based then the others and, yes it has it's fair share of scares of course but the lore is wonderful. The only thing I would have to say that I don't like about the game is Night four but hey thats just how the game is.
