(The higher level you are, the more difficult it is)\nGood guns. And well balanced.\nA lot of guns have infinite ammo so you can play for hours without getting bored.\nGreat description. \n\nSo those are the pros, but no game is perfect.\nCons:\nA bit overpriced. I would have put more than 0.2 hours on record if it wasn't $10. I'll put more in though.\nA little boring after a while. I stop playing after about a 10 minute session.\nNo story, granted, this is a small indie game, but just say \"A super virus has spread the world and has turned everyone into blood sucking zombies!\"\nNot enough health packs spawning and I died because of that :|. It's fine though.\n\nSo yeah, this is my review on the game. It's really good and I would recommend this game. Good time waster without having to charge your phone. :D", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198165721367", "last_played": 1494377880, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 60, "playtime_forever": 49}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1474684118, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456061", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1474684118, "recommendationid": "25661675", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
