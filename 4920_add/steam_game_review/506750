It flips normals on random elements on my .obj files. (Yes, they were exported properly) The controls are a mess, you can't rotate, or size yourself, or the modell just by dragging the controllers (like in any other VR software), oh no, instead you have to input your precise measures into a frickin calculator by pointing at buttons like a plonker... Also, when you resize your modell, you are resizing the whole \"table\" with it (which i guess has the size of your chaperone), and the modell will be always on the edge of the table, so you never have enough room to stand in front of your model to take a good look. Yes you can step away and look at the front in giant mode, but i want to walk around my model on a 1:1 scale, since...you know...THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE SOFTWARE. I know it's EA but problems like these should have been fleshed out in the pre-alpha state.\n\nThe UI is ugly, you can't set up the lights, you can't change environment (what's the point of a VR modell viewer in the age of PBR where you can't change the environment?), and only two formats are supported (.dae, .obj). \nThis mess should be free.\n\nYou can recreate almost the same software in Unity/Unreal within like 3 minutes with 0 knowledge, just by drag and dropping a few assets, or just wait until Blender  releases version 2.79 which will have official HMD support.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040493773", "last_played": 1489138867, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 755, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1489137291, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488368", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1489161179, "recommendationid": "30422801", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Will edit more detail into review later, but for now suffice it to say that I HIGHLY recommend to anyone with a Vive who either does 3D modeling or simply wants to play with/surf models.
