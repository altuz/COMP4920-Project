[/spoiler]\n[*] Nice ambiance, but nothing to be surprised.\n[*] Big map.\n\n[h1] CONS [/h1]\n[*] Crash every time there is more tan 5 enemies following you, which is pretty common.\n[*] Suffer from awful slow downs when you are being attacked.\n[*] When you loose all your life you star from the FUCKING beginning!\n[*] The last part is almost impossible! [spoiler] the soldier have a point-precise accuracy they never miss! And usually you don't have more than 1 disguise and 2 lifes [/spoiler]\n[*] You found lost, and normally this is good (becuse that means it's a big map to explore) but this time you are followed by enemies that miss 1 out of 10 times!\n[*] The level up system is useless, why even include it if it doesn't gonna make you stronger or get more life!\n[*] You cannot skip the dialogs, which are pretty annoying when you are normally walking and have to wait becuse a thing showed up\n\n[h1] BUY IT OR NOT? [/h1]\n\nLike always , first my score [(4*2) -7= 1], so NO, I don't recommend this game not even to my worst enemy, and I say this becuse i followed this game since it was on Desura, like 2 years ago, and I spected something to change, or at least don't crash/lag. Asking from money in a game that crashes so much shouldn't even be legal! Don't get me wrong, I see potential in this game but need collaboration from the Devs. I'm not gonna ask for a refound only because the game is \"tecnically\" playable, so goes against my politecs of refound.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198083748092", "last_played": 1505254368, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 13, "playtime_forever": 179}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1503017136, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504460", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505250548, "recommendationid": "34318197", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
