Very cool.\n\nThe tool set and menu systems are simple, a great size and they work every time. \n\nHere are some of my thoughts on further development.\n\n  The articulation of the pen is pointed at the whiteboard like North  on a compas needle. I feel that a more natural articulation for the pen, relative to the actual position and rotation of the control, is crucial for a writing experience.\n\n  I would love to enable haptic buzzes when in contact with the board and while making strokes.\n \n Holding the controller and writing by pulling the trigger is not working for me, and I doubt it will work well for many. My arm becomes tired after writing only a few sentences, and makes me realize how important it is to have full articulation of my wrist while I'm writing.  \n\n  The Pen maintains a orientation relative to the control, but there are a lot of ways one might hold the control in order to find the most natural writing position. I find that holding the conroller backwards as if there is a FAT marker in my hand, is the most comfortable way for me to get a better motion of my wrist while writing. It would be nice if there were some way to reposition the pen for different ways of holding the controller. \n\nThanks for the cool software! \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198106086564", "last_played": 1469648999, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 85, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 30, "timestamp_created": 1469666593, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542419", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1469666593, "recommendationid": "24566099", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "At first I thought - OK, this is a different take on Tilt Brush.

There are some things that make it unuseable for me, and I hope that it will improve or that someone else will do a better app.\n\nFirst: The soothing background sounds of waves crashing is cheesy at first, but you go with and it feel immersed in this place right up until it abruptly chops off at an ending upon looping itself. It's not only jarring, but it smacks of laziness in production quality.\nSecondly: The core feature I want, drawing on a whiteboard, is not so great. The whiteboards can only be perpendicular to the ground, the colors are crappy and limited, and the eraser is unwieldy.\nThirdly: An annoyance that can be avoided, but just emits \"poor production quality\", switching between desert and island mode maintains your position during the swap, so it's easy to get stuck in a vertical mismatch between the maps and not be able to move around.\n\nThis is a great concept and it's a good start on whatever this app ends up being, but I don't feel good having paid even a nominal modest charge for this software.

It's not early access. It's not even half finished but it's sold like finished one. \n\n1. There's no feedback on pen so you never know when you will draw something or not. Whiteboard is full of accidental dots and lines.\n\n2. Can't draw simple UML, coz i can't stop drawing a line - i don't know when i will draw something or not (UI response, no feedback).  Easy to draw UML square looks like drawn with random dotted lines. I think Google and other best tools use controller in 3D for some reason... You feel where it starts and ends in 3D. You did it like if the marker was on the invisible rod. I think a hand/marker/controller shadow would help too (growing shadow of controller on whiteboard combined with sound of marker on whiteboard moment before it starts drawing and forcefeedback) You have to combine all senses to achieve feeling of drawing\n\n3. Eraser Cant erase small errors just whole chunks of drawings and you have to start drawing the same again. You don't really control it. It doesn't rotate with your hand, have no feedback on whiteboard and is a square shaped -> easy to erase something by accident. Rotating is most important. Imagine yourself on real whitebord - how many times you tilted, rotated sponge?\n\n4. Can't write nice text, smaller it have to be the worst it gets. It feels like writing words on Ipad without raising your finger from the display. Imagine this and eraser which erase whole words.\n\n5. Cant undo erasing. If you accidentally touched whiteboard you're starting again.\n\n6. Palette is still a joke.\n\n7. Can\u2019t resize whiteboards. There is only one size. Too small for me, I have biiger one but not VR\u2026 I thought that this is what VR is for \u2013 resize whiteboard make it black, white or whatever.  I have more variety from real whiteboard with five markers. Yes there\u2019s only four here with hardcoded colors..\n\n8. Can't tilt whiteboard to be more comfortable\n\n9. This app don't work on almost every use case starting from positioning whiteboard on sun (@dev: you know user can have his place arranged against the sun and have to walk around island to position whiteboard so its visible  not in shadow right?).\n\n10. Cant rotate view. Just reposition myself but always facing same direction. Of course i can rotate myself byt i'm facing my sofa then and cant sit.. We need controlls move sideways, rotate and most important move all whiteboards to any place. You should use left touchpad to move and rotate. It's not used now\n\n11. Cant turn off sounds.\n\n12. User has to share his drawings with dev on meeting account? Is there a way to not share it with developer and still collaborate with other steam users?\n\n13. @Jason Ederle: I know you've some background but this app looks like you' downloaded Unity and you're learning UI, VR right now and selling it like finished product on Steam.
