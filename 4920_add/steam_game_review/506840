Also, the engine is unoptimized to the max, being slow and clunky even on lower setting. I don't mind low quality graphics, but low + slow :( The map is super basic and also a bit buggy, resets when you revisit a level, and so on...\n\nWreckable/dismantleable armor is a good idea, but there are just not enough materials/heat sources around to repair it or make a new one (and i chose a blacksmith character). Not being able to repair/upgrade armor or weapons while having them equipped is just silly, considering the inventory is so small and always full.\n\nNot to make this any longer, I have deleted the game after 7 levels and won't play it again. I surely don't recommend it, not for 13 euros. Try it when it is 50% off and patched/polished enough.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198272977364", "last_played": 1472332723, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 711}, "votes_up": 57, "timestamp_created": 1472336676, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586859", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1472337013, "recommendationid": "25192528", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I don't usually post reviews because I often can't define what I like (or don't like) about a game. I'm not new to games but the lingo is usually beyond me but here goes. First - it's worth the price. I don't usually buy anything over 6 bucks because of budget contraints but this one looked like most of the RPGs I've liked in the past so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. Also worth noting is that the devs are on top of things and have been incredibly helpful when I've had a question or a problem.\n\nGameplay is pretty straight forward. I use the arrow keys to move around (simply my preference) - it's first person when you're exploring then top-down real-time when you enter a battle. My personal preference isn't top-down or real-time but I've found it easy enough to adapt to the combat system.\n\nThe shop system is different than most games in that you don't sell stuff back to the merchants to gain gold to buy better stuff. You either make your own, find it or trade it for crystals that you find as you explore. The crystal drop isn't phenomenal nor is it horrible. The catch is that you also need crystals to save your game so it's a good idea to try and keep one on hand. Also, you don't necessarily need to go back to town to trade your crystals but I'll leave that for you to discover on your own. ;) \n\nYour storage is limited but that's okay because you don't really need to carry around a lot of stuff in order to sell it. I've found that if I equip two weapons (there are two weapon sets available that you use the mouse wheel to change) and keep a spare in my pack, I'm in good shape.  Armor is another thing altogether. Spend some of your skill points on Reforge and Smith - you'll need it. Armor breaks, if you don't have a spare, you'll need to fix your own. \n\nThere are a lot of little things that are just different enough to make this game interesting. \n\nMy complaints - and they're minor because I'm a big baby...LOL - I would like to see more crystal and food drops. The spell system confused me at first - I couldn't figure out how to set my quick spell or how to use it - when you learn a new spell, you need to reset your quick spell...RMB uses the spell (yes, that should have been obvious). That's the end of my complaints. \n\nSeriously, the game is really pretty good. I like the look of it, the music is good and the atmosphere is cool. \n\nOne final tip - check the walls carefully - some levers are really obvious but there are a few that are nothing more than switches that are a little hard to see.\n\nHope this helps - it's one of the few reviews I've written - and that alone should tell you how much I like the game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198015399703", "last_played": 1471996504, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 92, "playtime_forever": 428}, "votes_up": 19, "timestamp_created": 1471820886, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524943", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1471820886, "recommendationid": "25063057", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I'm enjoying this game quite a bit. Combat is fun, especially with some of the newer updates that have been pushed out by the devs. It seems to be a harder game if you want to play as a pure wizard but then maybe I'm just better as a warrior type or some type of blend in between. The retro look works well, on some levels better than others, and there can be a few frame rate issues sometimes but nothing too bad. The game seems to be getting frequent updates so I think any issues will get resolved (if they haven't been already). The new gem bag is great, it means less items taking up space in the backpack. The crafting skills do pay off in this game so I'd add a point or two into them as you level up. All things considered I would say, recommended. And good value, too.
