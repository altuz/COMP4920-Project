First and foremost this sets a new gold standard for procedural generation in games. Not roguelikes; absolutely anything, at all. the developer's concept of cyclical level generation does what no game before has -- creating a rich, varied, and complex play experience each and every game, with levels, puzzles and traps that feel hand-crafted. \n\nThe game's ability to generate a holistic dungeon environment, implement backtracking and secrets in inteesting ways and create a consistend dungeon ecology from level to level creates a feeling of a hand-crafted dungeon delve on every playthrough (or nearly so). After more than 100 hours i'm still finding new surprises, getting caught off guard by unexpected situations and even seeing new bosses and items that i haven't encountered before.\n\nMore than this, JD has created a dungeon environment with enough variation and cleverly-programmed interactions between elements and items that a very rare thing emerges; you begin to realize that just about anything that seems like it should work, does. As simple as it sounds, this is a profound concept, and all the more impressive that the game manages it with a seemingly simple, top-down hack and slash style of play. Simple controls, a light but satisfyingly chunky stat system and a low fantasy, low-magic sort of setting means finding a single bundle of arrows, a potion of poison gas, a staff of disarming, can all be momentous experiences, defining a playthrough or giving you the key you need to escape doom at a critical moment -- aided, again, by the level generator's cleverness.\n\nIf you like roguelikes, zelda-style action adventures where your tools are your weapons, classical dungeon delves, or just want to see what should rightly be the new acceptable standard for random level generation -- grab Unexplored, give it a few runs, and watch it surprise you again and again.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 329, "steamid": "76561197970765095", "last_played": 1507048917, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 377, "playtime_forever": 8770}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1507173723, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507173723, "recommendationid": "35485355", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a really fun take on the Roguelike genre.

The art and menu UI are pretty cheesy; If the main character was real I'd punch him in his stupid face. Beside the graphics, pretty much everything about this game is great. The 'cyclic level generation' works really well at creating fluid levels full of interesting, sometimes very complex puzzles. In-game text can get a bit repetitive, and the combat takes some getting used to so I usually stick to ranged stuff. It crashes every once and a while, but not annoyingly often.
