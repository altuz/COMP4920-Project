Fun and unique.  The worlds are captivating and fun to explore.  The gameplay is great and has plenty variety in terms of game mechanics and environments to keep the player entertained.  Some of the puzzles are nice and challenging; they force the player to think.  The story develops genuine curiosity and the desire to learn more.  Dialogue with the NPCs is humorous.  Would recommend to anyone (and I have)!\n\nGameplay:\nThe parkour is great.  The game mechanics build on one another and eventually combine to make some nice challenging puzzles.  The combat falls short and was pretty boring, but it's not a main focus of the game so it doesn't detract too much from the overall gameplay.  Would be nice if there were some more complex puzzles that involve moving platforms or timing, or real-time reaction speed.  There is SOME of this, but for the most part you can look at a puzzle and figure out what needs to be done.\n\nLevel Design:\nEach world has its own personality and feel to it.  The use of the 4 planets is very creative.  They drastically change certain parts of the world and allow the player to explore new areas.  It would be better if the choice of planet wasn't so obvious, or if there were more places to combine the use of the planets.\n\nStory:\nThe few characters that are in the game are very captivating and keep the player wanting to learn more.  The idea to put multiple endings for each NPC was great; it is a nice reward for extra exploration.  The issue is that the endings are quite ambiguous, and the true meaning of the world is never REALLY revealed.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198008374023", "last_played": 1505862742, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 97, "playtime_forever": 605}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505939125, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500222", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506023545, "recommendationid": "35091600", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game surprised me, bought it on a whim, (like most games) without expecting too much.

Exploration is really rewarding and more often than not, there are multiple paths and ways to get around, sometimes you won't even be sure of the way to your objective.\nThe graphics are quite nice and enjoyable while you are getting your parkour skills top notch\nIt might not be as games like Mirror's Edge, and it may still need some polishing... but Downward is a gem on its own and it has many points on it's own, and at a very fair price.\n\nIf you are looking for combat or something like that, this isn't it. There is no combat whatsoever here, even if there are enemies, it's not like you actually fight them attacking them. The game focuses on the parkour and exploration, and so far it has been an amazing experience.\n\nThere might be a minor thing or two that still needs sorting out, but nothing annoying or that could ruin this great experience so far.

There was enjoyment to be had. Beautiful looking game that kept my attention. This game has a 'Very Positive' review rating, so you have heard the good. \n\n I will jump into the cons:\n-The map was not easy to follow; I understand wanting a player to explore, but this was completely out of the way parkour nonsense. \n- Story wise, it seemed to be full of potential, but nothing of substance. Nothing was solved or concluded. Just a lot of questions. DEFINITELY needed more story. \n- LASTLY....The final boss was stupid. Absolutely horrible. Don't get me wrong, you were warned that this was the final boss. But there were no manual saves. So if you went into this (poorly designed) boss arena, you were stuck. No going back to an old save, no upgrading a little more. It was a cheap, horrible design, that lead to a very poor ending. \n\nIn conclusion, I had fun with this game.

I really don't like the voice acting. I can take low budget voice acting as long as it is kept to a minimum but they are always talking, and my character is always making grunting noises when jumping, reminiscent of quake only much more annoying.\n\nHere is my account: \n\nOk let me see how this game works for me. Ok some jumping puzzles, ok I think I'm getting the hang of this. Man my character is sure talking allot and I hate it but its Ok its the beginning of the game this is fine, I'm sure hell shut up soon. Ok i'm in some kind of surrealist world where there are magical mcguffins everywhere. Ok I can get into it. Man its hard to figure out the significance of all of these things oh well I'm sure it will make sense in time. Hes still talking... \n\nOh cool an enemy with swishing lasers, I bet I have to navigate around it and not get caught in the ... oh the off switch is right there, ok that's fine its probably an example level that's ok I guess. Man are they still talking?\n\nOh no a big monster, better evade him since this is a par-core game and all..... still evading..... still evading. Ok what the heck am I supposed to be doing? Ok Ill let him hit me just for giggles. Ok his back is flashing, I'll.... hit 'E'? ok hes dead. well that was..... anticlimactic. whatever its supposed to be about the running and jumping. \n\nOk a level up....thing where I can spend my points.....what the heck are these options? better focus? um ok I guess Ill get that out of curiosity, and more health? I don't have a problem with health but ok, at least I know what that one does. ok a new area. NOW SOMEONE ELSE IS TALKING TO ME omg the dialogue is worse than the voice acting, errg, I cant skip this I can't jump and i'm moving really slow. Ok this is making me mad now.\n\nIts over. ok there are some laser things again. Can't find the switch to turn them off. I'm caught in the beam... oh they just lightly pepper you with slow moving easy to dodge bullets that do little damage.......ok. what am I suposed to be doing here anyway? ok I'm at the top of the thing oh there is a collectable up here. But other than that this area is essentially a dead end. The whole laser climbing thing was just a dead end. \n\nOk whats this way? A big cliff over the ocean. \"jump into the ocean to start your adventure\" ..... um ok..... the ocean has been instant death this whole game but.... fine. \"You passed the level\" I click continue. I then immediately die in the ocean.......whhhhat? response back at the top, ok there is a little outcropping so maybe that way? Just. barley. make. it. Was I even supposed to make that? now I have to do what seems like a jumping puzzle in reverse. Am I supposed to be here?\n\n I make it to some weird area full of yet more unexplained magical mcguffins. I click on one that says meditate.\n\nNow I'm in a HUGE challenge course thing (I did not sigh up for this).... ok maybe this is where all the running is. I run for a little and go into a glowing thing. now I'm in another challenge course. challenge-course-seption? The challenge courses are nothing but frustratingly difficult with the still clucky controls. I want out, I hit escape, I don't see \"exit challenge\" (maybe it was there I just didn't see it) I see a quit. \"are you sure you want to quit?\". I hope they mean the challenge course.
