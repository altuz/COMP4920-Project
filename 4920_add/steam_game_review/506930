I havent made it through all the puzzles yet.  The game advertises \"Tracked Motion Controllers\", this is a lie.  I Specifically search for games with tracked controllers only.  Its just my preference.  This game takes input from the motion controllers, but the overall manipulation is done withthe headset.  There is a reticle and you point at objects then click the controllers.

You have to do *everything* by looking around; why even bother make use of the vive if you're not going to use the motion sensitive controllers that would be more appropriate for the task? What's more, there's no explanation for the controls so get ready for some guesswork!\n\nExample: assembly puzzles. You have to assemble an object out of pieces scattered around the room. How do you actually do this? You look at the floating pieces which will cause them to approach you (for whatever reason) and when they are close enough you press the trigger to \"pick it up\" so you can assemble whatever it is you happen to be assembling. The kicker? If you look at a piece too long and it collides with you, the walls or something else, it will return to its original position. I spent ten minutes trying to assemble the object by \"looking\" the pieces into place before I realised picking them up was both possible and the intended action.\n\nBoss fights seem to consist of juggling a chair for arbitrary periods of time. It would work as a gag but you can't move past a level without juggling that chair, continuously, for the stated period. The way you juggle is to place a small dot at the centre of your vision over the chair and press your trigger to \"bounce\" the chair up a bit. Half the time the game won't recognise that you've bounced the chair, the chair will fall to the ground, and you have to start again. Repeat until you're fed up and asking why this impossible test of skill is present in a *puzzle* game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984744105", "last_played": 1483377821, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 344, "playtime_forever": 53}, "votes_up": 28, "timestamp_created": 1483378706, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544759", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1483378706, "recommendationid": "28949254", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I'm torn on whether or not i can recommend this game.\n\nPros:\n- Cheap, and good for a few hours of entertainment.\n- Interesting use of gaze controls.\n\nCons:\n- Puzzles so far are way to simple.\n- The bouncing chair levels are horrible, they should be taken out.\n- No real use of TMCs.\n\nI expected more from this title and was disappointed to learn that it does not actually use the tracked motion controllers (you only need to ability to tap a button) but rather uses your gaze to control the world. While this is implemented well, it is too simple a mechanism for great puzzles and really doesn't take advantage of what VR can do. \n\nAt this point I have only completed \"episode 1\" and the audition (tutorial?). The puzzles are very simple, so I am hoping that they will increase in difficulty as the game progresses.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198056064820", "last_played": 1486273807, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 512, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 26, "timestamp_created": 1486325387, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543942", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1491805366, "recommendationid": "29727871", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "quite a bit of content and very simple controls. a lot of fun.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198226001224", "last_played": 1504556701, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 67}, "votes_up": 24, "timestamp_created": 1481826846, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519531", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1481826846, "recommendationid": "28391789", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Cool game", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053097624", "last_played": 1482316825, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 101, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1482316861, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463259", "votes_down": 20, "timestamp_updated": 1482316861, "recommendationid": "28504773", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
