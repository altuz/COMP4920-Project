Pong Champion is absolutely worth the money.  It is quite playable as of the previous patch and maybe just as importantly, the developer is actively interacting with users and really working to take their feedback to heart as he prioritizes and adjust the engine to feel better and better.  Would I pay fifty bucks to play this game right now?  No way.  Would I pay 50 bucks for this game if it fully realized its potential and included multiplayer?  Hell yes!
