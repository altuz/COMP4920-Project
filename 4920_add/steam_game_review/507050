It took all of 5 minutes to decide this.  I cant comment on the story or anything else but here are the issues I encountered: \n\n1) Would not grab mouse - my prefered control method for most games, but instead was clicking all over my desktop instead.\n2) Controling the ship via mouse is terrible. I might addapt but because of issue 1) it wasnt going to happen.\n3) Switched to controller; failed to work with my steam controller, except for XYBA buttons.\n4) No configuration menu, so no hope to remap keys, change sound volume. [EDIT: Or determine what actions are bound to what keys / controlls.]\n\nMight be more to this game, but ran out of patience and hope.  Refunding.\n\nEDIT: I should note the really confusing thing was that the left-stick actually worked in the main menu, in addition to the buttons.
