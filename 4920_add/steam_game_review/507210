I would give it a 3/10.\nThe most important thing is that you need alot of roomspace,  at least 3 metres of length. My 2,5m wasnt good enough for some levels because they start in the middle and reach out of the area, just some luck i finished them before hitting the wall.\nFurthermore the controller does not make sense, I get some \"Collision\" Errors but i dont know why. The Color at the tip of your wand changes blue and red without any known consequences. And the Points too, sometimes it increases , sometimes not no matter what state the wand color is. Both indicators are distracting from the game itself. The levels are hard but fun, better designed than the other \"Wire Loop\" Game. \nAll in all it has nice potential, but would not recommend the game as of now.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067196219", "last_played": 1470004731, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 101, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1470005216, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520727", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1470005216, "recommendationid": "24642746", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The wire is pretty enjoyable game i reckon, Challenging with simple play rules.\ni uploaded the play video of this game on my channel.\n\n\uc81c \uc0dd\uac01\uc5d4 \ub098\ub984 \uc990\uae38 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub358 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uc5c8\ub358\uac83 \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \uc870\uc791\ubc95\uc774\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\uc5c8\uc5b4\uc694\n\ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc601\uc0c1\uc740 \uc720\ud22c\ube0c \ucc44\ub110\uc5d0 \uc62c\ub838\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \n\nhttps://youtu.be/5TnGMZSlb30\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198311438222", "last_played": 1470385993, "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_forever": 126}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1471592703, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1471592703, "recommendationid": "25007480", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I could not get this game to start.
