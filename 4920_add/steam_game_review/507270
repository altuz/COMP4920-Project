Overall score remains the same.\n\nThis is a slow-paced puzzle game using match 3 type of gameplay. The levels alternate between a few goals like find x amount of treasure, reach a certain depth or find hidden doorways. There's no time limit but you get a limited amount of moves. I've come across 4 different special abilities to help with exploration and some blocks when used in a match give extra moves. Your pick gets stronger over time so you can dig deeper but the gameplay remains basically the same. Dig, dig and dig some more.\n\nSome worlds have special areas you can unlock for daily games of chance like spin-the-wheel. One of these was locked until I found a secret door on a different level which was a little unclear at first. There was also a npc that unlocked a new area in exchange for treasures. I asumed I needed to do so to move on but the new area was too hard to do without leveling up some and I still don't know how much of my money he actually took. A few things like this are unexplained.\n\nI enjoyed looking for treasures and trying to complete the collections but Lily's slow pace can be a little frustrating especially if you have to backtrack a lot to find another path to your goal. Also it can take a long time to finally be able to carry two specials at once which becomes almost necessary in levels that block your progress with rocks that can't be dug out normally. \n\nOverall score: 6/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198159186318", "last_played": 1475497188, "num_reviews": 50, "num_games_owned": 114, "playtime_forever": 855}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1472050975, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506782", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1473166042, "recommendationid": "25114202", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
