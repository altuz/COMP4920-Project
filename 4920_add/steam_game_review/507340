I'm assuming there's content for a whole book hidden in the dev's mind.\n\nTHE BAD\n\n-Dialogue options don't serve a purpose or affect the plot at all\n-No ship customization / weapons loadout\n-Ships are too small on screen\n-Camera management is poor and looks awkward when events happen during missions\n-Controls are bad, simply too much inertia in ship movement rendering combat a pain in the ass as you slide everywhere and off screen\n-No mean of advancing dialogues faster with a keypress, espescially when you've seen it twice or thrice\n-Some dialogues freezes the game for a while making you think the game has bugged... 10, 20 seconds\n-Lack of ships/enemies diversity\n-Missiles are overpowered\n\nTHE WORSE\n\n-Some conditions during missions make those missions last forever with no way to end them. You have to guess which condition to watch for to make sure you can actually end them (survival of a particular ally for example, or doing this before that, or not being there while this happens)\n-Had the above problem for at least half the game's missions but i was able to finish it all so it's possible to get to the end\n-Have to quit the game entirely to restart a bugged mission... no back to menu or whatever.\n-Some achievements are broken and do not register.\n\nWithout the 'worse' part i guess it's worth the 2$ for an hour long game session but even then you can find better for free. Just tell yourself you're helping an indie to get better... that's how they are born anyway.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198031485735", "last_played": 1483073977, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 123, "playtime_forever": 212}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1483075853, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512318", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1483075853, "recommendationid": "28817159", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Simple and fun game with an interesting backtory and excellent soundtrack!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001653809", "last_played": 1483142049, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 107, "playtime_forever": 61}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1483142193, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508312", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1483142193, "recommendationid": "28848830", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not really my style of game, but I wanted to try it out anyway.
