Unfortunately, the basic presentation honestly conveys what you get, shallow even by 1980's standards. While The Wizard's Lair has monsters, potions, armor, weapons, scrolls, and food there are no classes, abilities, or skills. Leveling up just increases your hitpoints as far as I can tell. You can fight in corridors to limit how many monsters can attack you at once, but beyond that there are no tactics. This is a game anyone could have written in a few weekends with an RPG generator.\n\nFor a basic roguelike get Dungeons of Dredmor instead - it is around the same price, relatively easy to get into, but still has depth and fun gameplay. Or for something deeper but also inexpensive, Tales of Maj'Eyal has a mixture of random and predetermined maps, quests, good graphics for a roguelike, lots of classes and skills, and a helpful online community.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970807880", "last_played": 1470241115, "num_reviews": 49, "num_games_owned": 530, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 37, "timestamp_created": 1470242445, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563750", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1470242445, "recommendationid": "24692799", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "its, really, not, that, good, and, im, not, sure, what, to, do, with, it", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198110843706", "last_played": 1471972556, "num_reviews": 38, "num_games_owned": 173, "playtime_forever": 63}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1471886457, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441221", "votes_down": 24, "timestamp_updated": 1472255624, "recommendationid": "25076899", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
