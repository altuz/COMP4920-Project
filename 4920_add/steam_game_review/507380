The gameplay is generic at best, some mildly interesting mechanics, but nothing likely to leap out at you. It's not bad, it's not good, probably priced fairly if you find yourself a big fan of this kind of thing. What sold me, honestly, was the music; I found there was some work put into the composition and I liked the opening theme a lot. I'll give a recommendation for that; as for the game itself, again, not good, not horrible.
