{"success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 529, "total_negative": 107, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 422, "review_score": 6}, "reviews": [{"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "At the time of this review I've put in 159 hours in the base game and 115 in Escalation, which is a lot of time for me so I definitely think it's a good game.\n\nCampaign\n\nThe campaign's story is fairly average but the missions are enjoyable and there's quite a few of them. The developers added a free campaign a few months ago that also introduced a new unit class. \n\nSkirmish\n\nThe best part of the game in my opinion. Has lots of options so players can configure it how they want, more resources gained from each extractor, faster build speeds and options to restrict units and orbital abilites being examples. Game speed can be sped up, slowed down and orders can even be given while the game is paused.\n\nAI\n\nAI is quite good by RTS standards, it's better than the AI in Supreme Commander Forged Alliance, Supreme Commander 2, Planetary Annihilation Titans and both Halo Wars games. At the moment it appears that the Substrate AI is better because it can utilise the unlimited storage Substrate have effectively. The game doesn't have sim speed slowdown either which is great.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe weapon effects from units look fairly good but they are all energy weapons so no shells or bullets at the moment. All units are hover units too, the 3rd faction (whenever it comes out) will supposedly alleviate those 2 issues, but that could be subject to change. Unit models are pretty good but it seems like the models could be a bit sharper (maybe I'm over taxing the GPU). Maps look ok but they are a bit bland, the lava/volcanic maps are the best looking in my opinion. The game is supposed to get better graphics sometime in the future.\n\nMaps\n\nThere's a big selection of maps even without any DLC. There's 6 different biome types: Terran, Desert, Frozen, Volcanic, Crystal and Turinium. There's also 6 map sizes: 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96KM, the bigger maps are gigantic and can support up to 14 players. The game has a map editor but it can be buggy at times.\n\n\nPerformance/Stability\n\nMy i5 4690K and RX 480 have no issues playing the game in 1440p with high settings, DX12 gives me the most FPS at the moment with Vulkan only a couple less. I think DX11 gives the best performance for Nvidia cards. I would recommend a 4 core CPU and GTX 760 or higher to get decent performance in 1080p. Lower end hardware can run the game but it might not be as enjoyable. It does take a while for the game to start up but doesn't have load times after that, an SSD takes start up to only a few seconds. I've only had 4 crashes in Escalation so stability has been good for me, I've heard that the game doesn't like overclocks though.\n\n\nUnits\n\nAt the moment there's air units i.e bombers, fighters, scout planes and gunships, Frigates, Crusiers, Dreadnoughts and Juggernauts (all land units), with more to be added later on this year. I think there's naval units going to be added sometime next year.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThere's a small but dedicated community that frequently hosts tournaments. There's replays, observer mode and the game gets regular balance updates.\n\nModding\n\nBasic mods can be easily made and the developers have been constantly improving modding support the last few months and are continuing to, with plans to add workshop support eventually.\n\nThings I'd like to see\n[list]\n[*]I'd like to have more props/architecture added to maps and the map editor.\n[*]Option to add neutral units and buildings on the map.\n[*]A radar that works like Supreme Commander's\n[*]Shields\n[*]Air transports\n[*]Game mode where you can build multiple Nexus (maybe the spawn point of a defeated enemy) and you only get defeated if they're all destroyed.\n[/list]\n\nThe game has improved a lot over the last few months and by the looks of it will continue to do so.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "steamid": "76561198126668943", "last_played": 1507150360, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 185, "playtime_forever": 6952}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1505084953, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505672", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505084953, "recommendationid": "34872972", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ashes has been a good purchase for me.
