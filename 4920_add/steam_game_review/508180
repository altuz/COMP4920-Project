Strap yourself into the cockpit of your fighter and get ready to blow up some asteroids! The onslaught of asteroids that awaits you would make anyone tremble in fear, but don\u2019t worry \u2013 your trusty ship can suck up random power ups to help you get through. You just have to survive long enough to collect enough energy from the asteroids and escape with your life and the asteroids\u2019 loot.\n\n[u]Release Date: 27 Jul, 2016[/u]\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\nYou control an orb of energy. The objective of each mission is to collect as much energy as quickly as you can, while you are avoiding asteroids and homing missiles flying at you. There are four \"power-up\" energies you can collect during your missions as they appear. They appear in two situations: randomly appearing within traps, and when asteroids are blown up. The whitish-blue energy increases your movement speed. The green energy makes you temporarily invincible. The red energy gives you mines to blow up asteroids. The yellow energy increases the chances your attacks are multiplied. What's even better is they can be stacked. You can wield all four energies at once, if you can collect them before they expire. Just be careful as you go for the energies, because they're surrounded by traps.\n\nAll in All[u]  Fly and Destroy[/u] is a really good Casual Game!\n\n8/10 From Me\n[i]Sweep [/i]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198147052088", "last_played": 1504422918, "num_reviews": 166, "num_games_owned": 159, "playtime_forever": 1326}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1503507421, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509669", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1503507421, "recommendationid": "34442420", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
