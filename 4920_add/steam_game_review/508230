It is too easy to fail, because you have relatively little control over the characters stress and happiness levels during the week after making your task choices at the beginning of the week. Funding is also a constant issue and you will not be able to complete a decent anime without money. Even if you complete an anime, it is difficult to produce a high quality anime (as in get enough stars for each production category) and this seems to come back to funding... Thankfully someone has written a great in-depth guide to the game and outlines each character's strengths. This helped me to effectively strategise.\n\nI liked that it was a visual novel / simulator. As a visual novel it was really fun, because the choices I made actually had an impact on the characters and the story. As a simulator, it gave me a chance to manage the team through choices of member tasks, upgrades, and outsourcing options at the beginning of each week. I liked the art style and the background music didn't get annoying either. The characters are all likeable too. For these reasons I recommend the game.\n\nI bought this game on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 349, "steamid": "76561198269060330", "last_played": 1506433900, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_forever": 592}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506472164, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506472164, "recommendationid": "35232712", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
