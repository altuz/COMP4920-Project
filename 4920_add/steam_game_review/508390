It runs really well. \n\nNice little exploration for a demo but the camera control in Chapter 2 is annoying. You don't spend much time there but the camera moves with your WASD/Arrow keys but it also moves with your mouse meaning the camera is moving two different times at the same time. The mouse is a controller to pick and throw stuff so this is a little annoying at times.\n\nThe boss comes out of you out of nowhere and you are given no hints as how to hurt it. By time you figured it out you have taken damage from it hiding underground. Not good for those going for the no-hit achievement.\nThe camera angle in this scene will effect if you get hit by one of the boss attacks, the floating red lasor thingies. The perception you are seeing may make you get hit by it even it seemed it was no where near you.\n\nOtherwise this is a cute and quick demo for the full game. The achievements are easy to get a part from the no-hit achievement so yeah give this little demo a go and then see if you want the full-game or not.\n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198167173649", "last_played": 1485211779, "num_reviews": 87, "num_games_owned": 202, "playtime_forever": 93}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1485127176, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509093", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485127176, "recommendationid": "29433113", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Well what can i say about this demo. \nI'm not gonna write a super long review but i think this demo deserves more credit than some people actually give it, It's crystal clear that whoever made this put a lot of effort and love into it and if i had the money i would most definetely buy the complete game because now that i've played the demo i'm curious to know how it ends. And besides i had fun playing it! That's the main thing. \nOf course there's some things that could be polished (like certain camera angles) but in overall it's a very beautiful game, the music is very intuitive with what's going on in the game, puzzles are not that hard to complete or figure it out and that boss fight at the end of the demo was just superb! It really put me on my guard XD I loved it! \nSo all i wanted to make clear with this review is that if you have free time and you like these kind of games, give this one a try, play the demo and even buy the full game if you can. It's worth your time, brings back that nostalgia feeling of old games and it's really appealing. And nowadays we need to suport developers like this to bring us quality games that are enjoyable to play and different from the majority :)\n\nIt's a 9/10 game for me.\nHappy gaming yall ^^\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019457603", "last_played": 1489435250, "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 236, "playtime_forever": 170}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1485366318, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504061", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485366318, "recommendationid": "29486748", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pros\n\n+ Cute and heatwarming characters\n+ Beautiful scenary and graphics\n+ Ambient music\n+ Interesting story\n\n\nCons \n\n- Short \n- Unskipabble cutscenes (unless you're in Dev Mode)\n- Controls not so suitable for keyboard & mouse\n- Simple puzzle\n\nWhy it's recommended?

The Mouse is too sensitive in playing even though you lowered the index of setting before the start. It\u2019s quite a lovely story and some its achievements are interesting too. However, there is no distinct instruction for players and I even died once (jump out from the window)before I found the right way to get out of the room. [spoiler]Friendly hint: you just need to put another battery back to where the phone exploded.[/spoiler] And the next journey is usual nothing notable to say but as a robot your enemy should be rats? \n\nSeriously speaking, the chunky robot which the player controls looks like a rubbish bin exactly. At the level 3, you will meet the hidden achievement-Pizza Time, take care! The determination of jump in this game is kind of problematic, hence it\u2019s hard to get through the hurdle on the water. Easily get restart from the very beginning of the current level as it was saved automatically and the interval is quite distant.
