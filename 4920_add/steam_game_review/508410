I recommend this just because in E.A but i'm looking forward for updates.

Space bounty hunter, gun customization, really nice minimalistic art style, animations, and color palette. \nThe meat of the game is the combat and gunplay but unfortunately this is where the it is really lacking.\n\nThe only viable strategy seems to be retreat and shoot at the enemy until they die. A dodge roll or shielding mechanic would help greatly. Taking cover is not an effective strategy because from what I\u2019ve seen all the enemies constantly walk straight towards the player. The grenades and explosions feel satisfying but guns don't seem to have much weight behind them.\n\nI can\u2019t think of much more to say about Skipchaser because there's not much to it as of yet. I understand that Skipchaser is still in development so I will update my review if any of my criticisms are addressed. I have high hopes for this game and I do expect it to be worth your time but as of right now I can\u2019t recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198225745724", "last_played": 1492710712, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_forever": 44}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1492710369, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504539", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1492710369, "recommendationid": "31260251", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Love it!\n\nI like that instead of ammo their is heat, I would say that making the gun glow as it gets hotter would be cool!\n\nWould love to see the awsome soundtrack as a DLC to download!\n\nDEV.
