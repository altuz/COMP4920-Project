It's easy to get a hang of the controls, and each bot has a different fighting style than the last.  My personal favorite, and current high score winner, is Bit.    \nI liked the fact that you could use the terrain to your advantage, pushing cans and other objects in the way of the oncoming hordes.  It slows them down just enough to get another heartbeat in before you fire again.  \nThe power-ups are cool.  The shield comes in super handy, as does the aerial bombard.  \nI haven't had a chance to give the multiplayer a try yet, but that's only a matter of time.  \nConclusion: it's a fun game that is challenging, fun to look at, and will keep me coming back for more.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067149185", "last_played": 1496117593, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1486249035, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507109", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1486249035, "recommendationid": "29705220", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I have really enjoyed MiniBotz and enjoyed the pleasure of working directly with the developers to grow and mold this game.
