Battles are varied and interesting, and strategy is useful. Visuals are artsy and weird, but professionally done.\n\nYou have a choice of three characters to bring with you as party members for each quest, and you may switch between them, as needed. These characters represent different aspects of your personality, and are entertaining in theory, but lack  emotional depth - their primary function is to participate in constant intellectual banter. As the game progresses, there is an increase in the number of party members you can have.\n\nEach quest consists of a map in which you must make your way to the final boss, while fighting random encounters along the way. There is variety in each level and there are unexpected obstacles to your path that might take a while to solve, but nothing that will really discourage you.\n\nThere are waypoints to save your progress, so you can leave the map and not have to start at the beginning. You are allowed at any time to travel back to Haven (your home base), which replenishes all stats. There is also a special room you can access that allows you to buy new skills with currency collected while on missions.\n\nAll parts of this game are satisfactory, and the biggest issue to consider for your purchase is whether you appreciate the kooky artwork, and the psycho-analytical content of the narrative.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035680861", "last_played": 1495812509, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 349}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1495815551, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513828", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495815551, "recommendationid": "31976784", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
