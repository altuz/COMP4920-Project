I hate this game with all of its bugs and glitches. First of all, this company thought it was a good idea to release an unfinished map. The enemies have aim bot. The trip wire mines sound like the guns. Literally I stuck a shotgun to the back of a guards head and it still didn't kill him. Why cant you start out with a gun? Why is the same code used in two maps? Plus why is the game called Sneak Theif when the entire game is not sneaking?! Also, the idea of having one try on a safe is BS and the aiming is a little off. This game should at least be free. Terrible god awful waste of 10 DOLLARS!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198160256365", "last_played": 1505685694, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 125, "playtime_forever": 109}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505686103, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490313", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1505686103, "recommendationid": "35034223", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
