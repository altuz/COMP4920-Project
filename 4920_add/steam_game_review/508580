Really satisfies my craps addiction. \nPros: \n- Environment looks great\n- Betting is easy and intuitive\n- Changing locations makes it fun to try different locations on the table\n- Developers listen to feedback and fix bugs in a timely fashion\n\nCons:\n- Dice stutter and flip over when you try to \"pinch\" the dice together on your dice set\n- Throws that don't hit the back wall count(you get warnings at the casinos for this)\n- The \"press\" option is really a parlay when it should only add a single unit per press(e.g. If I bet $5 and press it it goes to $10, but if I press again after that it jumps to $20. Pressing usually means to increase one unit.)\n- You can't easily go down a unit of betting. You have to clear the bet and rebet again. \n\nEven with these cons the game is great and you can see how much I like it by the number of hours played above my review. \n\nI would gladly pay another $5 if you improve the cons I've listed. \n\nLove the game and keep up the great works guys!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198349021760", "last_played": 1488566614, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_forever": 1035}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487784196, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487784196, "recommendationid": "30103391", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
