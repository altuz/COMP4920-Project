It's not good game, though for the price it's not a particularly bad game either.\n\nI was hoping for something along the lines of Xain'd Sleena or maybe even Exolon but it lacks the diversity of the first and the atmosphere of the second.\n\nFirst off there are no graphics options.  The only screen resolution available is whatever tiny 4:3 ratio'ed one that Xinatra was developed in.  The graphics are somewhat mismatched with a variety of texure resolutions (the character seems to be lower res than a lot of the other assets) and styles.  The art is functional but not inspired and looks a lot better in the small Store screenshots than on a large monitor.\n\nGameplay is where PROJECT XINATRA really falls down though.  What little I played felt like a chore rather than a work of passion.  The collision box is sometimes wildly different from the graphic on-top of it.  This is true for enemies and static platforms.  I regularly fell through platforms as they're shorter than apparent.\n\nThe gunplay lacks the ability to fire up, and becomes annoying when coupled with the small collision boxes mentioned above.  The default weapon is woefully underpowered.  Most of my play time (more than a half) stems from the first boss.  I ran out of green ammo shooting the lava balls before I reallised I could shoot the lava vents, however the default gun does so little damage I got bored and gave up.  I later retried and won with the green gun in about 20 seconds.\n\nThe non-boss music is okay, and the keys can be rebound.\n\nAgain, there really isn't a lot to say about PROJECT XINATRA.  If it gets significantly better; I was unwilling to spend the time to find out.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989528524", "last_played": 1474404356, "num_reviews": 40, "num_games_owned": 754, "playtime_forever": 67}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1474402555, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519961", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1474402555, "recommendationid": "25608923", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[h1]Works with the SNES controller[/h1]\n\nPROJECT XINATRA was developed by two guys from a small indie company called \"DemonVideogames\".\n\nThe game works with SNES, Xbox 360 controllers and with a keyboard. You can also rebind keys for all three. I'm more than certain that it also works with the NES controller but I have not tested it...Yet. Neither have I tested any of the PS or Logitech controllers.\n\nThe game itself is a classic run 'n' gun side-scroller and it plays just like an old-school NES/SNES game. You can move left-right, crouch, jump and shoot. That's all folks! The only issue with the gameplay is that you can only shoot straight forward and diagonally up. You cannot shoot straight up and that is making the first \"boss\" fight a real pain in the behind.\nOther than that it plays just like your classic run 'n' gun game. It's really enjoyable!\n\nThere are, however, couple of grammatical errors. \"From now on your are going to be on your own...\"\nGraphically the game looks quite good (Remember. It's supposed to be an \"old-school\" game). Sound effects and music and visuals are all quite decent and fit for the SNES era feeling. I've encountered one game breaking bug tho. I once missed a jump, fell and I should have died. I didn't tho. I was trapped below the screen and could keep walking to the right. However I couldn't kill anyone, get back on the ground to reach the next level nor could I kill myself. I had to alt+tab and close the game. This and the spelling errors are the only issues i've had with the game so far.\n\nWill update the review once i've finished the game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198060203956", "last_played": 1470923052, "num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 1143, "playtime_forever": 112}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1470734239, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501316", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1470931647, "recommendationid": "24790504", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": true}]}
