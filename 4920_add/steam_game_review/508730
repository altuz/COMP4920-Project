First of all the music is horrible. There's music that gets on your nerves quickly and then there's the soundtrack to this game. It's atonal and the rhythm doesn't match the 'melody' at all. To top it all off the controls are atrocious. You only have keyboard controls that aren't rebindable and the attack button is F while you move around with WASD.\n\nThere's an okay idea in the game somewhere, but the execution is very bad.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198108852006", "last_played": 1495033120, "num_reviews": 206, "num_games_owned": 7606, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1495033216, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523095", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1495033216, "recommendationid": "31806162", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
