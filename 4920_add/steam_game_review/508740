While it deserves to be applauded for trying something new and experimental, its gameplay and systems are so minimal that it matches more of what may be seen in an old Atari game or experienced via a film, with the very passive gameplay consisting of for the most part veering left and right on a highway as your indestructible car typically will always only need to drive straight ahead, at one of two speeds. At certain moments you can choose to pick up various hitchikers or not, which provide for more dialog exchanges, but beyond that the gameplay consists of all just driving along a highway and selecting dialog responses to your passengers. \n\nThe game is more of a somewhat docile, dialog-centric experience, with the enjoyment from the title deriving mostly from how you choose to respond to the other character's dialog and seeing how they react. Despite the weight of some of the game's dialog (abortion, running away from personal problems, etc...) I never found myself caring much about any of the characters. The game's presentation is very unique in that it mostly all takes place via the car rides being depicted and the portraits of the main character and another passenger going back and forth in dialog. The game has [spoiler] multiple endings (16?? according to the ending screen?) [/spoiler] which may lead to some replay value, and I'm guessing these are unlocked by selecting different responses to the dialog, taking characters to where it is they'd like to go, etc. \n\nI enjoyed some of what the game offers, and it has some introspective moments whether through the silence one finds in a car ride or a surprising exchange of dialog with someone you didn't expect to meet, but the game is also just art mimicking reality at that point, and while its illustrative style is appealing and its very limited gameplay is unique, I can only say I'm glad I checked the game out on sale as I've been interested in it, but I don't think I would say others \"need\" to experience it by any means. I would only recommend this game to people that find its visual style appealing and can tolerate extremely limited, near nonexistent gameplay in the traditional sense. The game will still immerse you in moments it presents, but its default asking price of 9.99 is somewhat high.  \n\nI still enjoyed some of what the game presents, its cool visual style, and a chill atmosphere, but I also found it to be pretty pointless as a game, and think it may have been better suited as a film. At only a half an hour for my first playthrough, I may still go through another time to see more of the content/characters/endings, but at the same time I think having already gone through and seeing what it does once it may be a diminishing return of caring to do so.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "last_played": 1501652931, "num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 799, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1501732849, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483589", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1501732849, "recommendationid": "33984781", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not much of a game.
