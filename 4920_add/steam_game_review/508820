First by collecting 5 sticks dispersed on each level and secondly by acquiring the trophy time as dictated by the developers. These time requirements need the finger agility of an octopus and the reflex speed of a cheetah, with hardly any room for error.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the game at first and found many of the levels challenging but achievable after a limited amount of retries, as I climbed the achievement ladder however, I quickly discovered that a handful were just trolling, seemed unfair and nearly impossible to beat. These levels just seemed to take the challenging aspect of the game too far and many have stated that they too began to have a disdainful experience with the game.\n\nWhy developers continue to invent levels with unbalanced difficulty is beyond me. It NEVER endears casual gamers to your product or to future buys with your company. It's basically just you forking out money so some egotistical developer can claim that he is smarter and better than you. Steam really needs to put massive stickers on games labelling them 'CAUSAL' or 'HARDCORE'. Maybe even have a difficulty rating so that we can determine before buy, how hard the game is.\n\nWill you be my laser? No...
