Truly looking at it from a glance you would think it would be a game that resembles that of a NES game. You would be wrong. Broken Armor is more of a DOS game with really annoying/irritating MIDI music. At first I was thinking \"Hey, this is kinda neat\" but then realized that I actually paid money for this AND seeing how there is much higher quality stuff on places like Game Jolt FOR FREE it wasn't long after that I felt ripped off. Fans of MIDI music and DOS games may have some appreciation for this but I wouldn't spend more than 30 cents on Broken Armor. I suggest putting on music of your own before loading as the MIDI music is repetitive and dreadful. The only high points I can't think of is the control works and the levels are randomized everytime you play.
