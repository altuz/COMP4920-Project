This game is from a different time, where games weren't really games. There were software limitations at the time. However! Despite it's simplistic look, it is actually a good game. The story is imersive as it describes a geneticly created being and his life cycle. Think of it like the Talos Principle of it's time.\n\nPros:\n-Good story\n-Can run on any computer (No points for guessing why)\n-The OG Talos Principle\n-Immersive\n-Fun\n\nCons: (For any underdeveloped brains wondering... I will be excluding graphics and sound from the cons list as it's like making fun of a kid in a wheelchair).\n\n-Too short :(\n-If you close the game... THE WHOLE GAME RESTARTS >:( (To be fair it is like an hour long game).\n-No tutorial. Litterally thrown in the deep end.\n\nOverall 8/10 - Would recommend to anyone looking for a short, immersive, singleplayer game from 1984", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198177103669", "last_played": 1487752304, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 87, "playtime_forever": 51}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1493320520, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505516", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1493320520, "recommendationid": "31400131", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
