I don't know. It doesn't matter though. I could have sworn it was around $15 when I first saw it mentioned in a rockpapershotgun article about 'new games on steam you probably didn't notice,' and its 'supermonkeyball-like' gameplay was what made me keep it in my wishlist. Welp bringing it down to $2 did just that and I can safely say that this game is SUPER quality, even if the main menu, choices of fonts, and other various things would have you think otherwise. \n\nFirst things first, the options menu is better than most games nowadays, even some AAA ones, including essential things for a PRECISION PLATFORMER such as this. Joystick deadzones, camera adjustments, frame rate caps(or lack thereof), are all present. Hats off. \n\nSecond, and more importantly. The gameplay here is really dope for fans of Super Monkey Ball. You navigate your perfectly-spherical egg to a bell instead of a gate at the end of the level. The bell, like the gate, can be missed completely, thus necessitates being hit every time to complete the level/update your score/hit more per-level objectives.\nThose objectives are, \n-coins\n-vulture eggs that need to be rolled off the level\n-the time limit (gold, silver, & bronze medals)\n\nWhat's unique!?\n[spoiler]-you have a limited number of jumps/hops per level, allowing 'some' SWEET shortcuts. Again, hats off.\n-you can rotate the gravity of the level 90 degrees with each press of some buttons. [/spoiler]\n\nThat's it really, this game is pretty great especially for the low price as of now. \n\nIf it could use one thing from Super Monkey Ball that could be that local pass'n'play multiplayer.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198011312998", "last_played": 1503356429, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 472, "playtime_forever": 24}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503357554, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503689303, "recommendationid": "34404618", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
