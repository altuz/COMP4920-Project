Me, a wee lad finds a game on Amazon for $5 that looks fun, and thus buys said game for $5. That game was Crashday, wee me plays the everloving shit out of Crashday until one fateful day a dastardly scratch on the CD. Anguish. Disgust. Irate. Pissed. All words to describe my feelings when I lost Crashday. Cut forward many years and BOOM I spied with my little eye Crashday Redline Edition on Steam. I buy that shit. Anticipation fills me as I watch that little blue bar grow and grow, until, BOOM its done. As I launched the game feelings that were locked away in a mind vault were unleashed to the world, much in the same way as Pandora's box but with less bad stuff. And thus history was born as I played my little heart away, never expecting to ever play Crashday again.
