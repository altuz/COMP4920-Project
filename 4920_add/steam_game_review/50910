The different components of the game gradually increase for a casual gaming experience, but don't mistake all the levels for easy. Because he can't jump, anything one block tall is a wall to him. The large campaign is great and the level creator is fairly convenient with hotkeys for each block in the game. (There's also a menu of them for those who can't remember.) Overall great game, and if you think you can beat all of these puzzles without a walkthrough, I wish you good luck!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1482939063, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504346", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "28755432", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197995664678", "num_reviews": 58, "last_played": 1486904344, "num_games_owned": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 155}, "timestamp_updated": 1485816291, "received_for_free": false, "review": "classic puzzler\nit has levels where you'll actually spend time looking for a solution, first 11 levels (decluding the tutorial ones) are a breeze\n\n[b]goty[/b]\nWould I refund if I could?
