Let me start by saying this is not just a game that will capture the curiosity of a child, it is an amazing \"boredom-buster\" for adults as well.  Today I was hunting for a game that would keep my mind busy and entertained, while my best friend was having a medical procedure done in the hospital.  I was extremely nervous and scared, as soon as I started this game up; I was at peace in a heaven-like, dream-like wonderland.  The music is absolutely amazing!\n\nFirst thing that came to my mind was \"wow this game looks like a dream!\" and it is!  There is simply no downside to this game, you CAN NOT die!  Despite some creatures that may seem a little scary and might make frightening noises, you will soon find that you must be somehow dreaming as nothing is really lethal and scary.  There are dozens of items that need hunting for you to move on, so you will soon find yourself going on a treasure hunt.  You never know what you might find!\n\nI dunno about other people, but this game is amazing to me.  I recorded myself playing the game and sent the video to my friend in the hospital, she absolutely enjoyed it!

You just walk over colored orbs, pick up random stuff lying around, and give/place it in other locations.
