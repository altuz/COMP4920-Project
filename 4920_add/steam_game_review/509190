There are gray balls with names in the game that I think are AI but I don't know honestly because they don't move. It's a small download for this but there are no players or functioning AI. I tried it with my friend and it just popped us in the same server but my friend kept crashing from it. I somehow made it to 200 consumed without crashing but there's really nothing exciting about this \"game\". In-game the floor squares hurt your eyes while you move, the controls are very vague and the camera will just phase through the buildings and walls when you turn close to them. I don't recommend even though it's early access, but that's not saying much either because this is just a Agar.io rip off, it is extremely buggy and the only thing going for it is the 3D/4D world, but even that isn't very impressive.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000404538", "last_played": 1485663025, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 199, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485726652, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499322", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1485726652, "recommendationid": "29574080", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
