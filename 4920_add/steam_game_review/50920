Now this is an older game so it's not going to blow you away, but I still to this day play it at least once a year (if not more). I've been playing it on Bigfish but since I use Steam 99% of the time, I'm glad the game moved over here.\n\nThe Hidden Expeditions are another group of HOG games that range from mediocre to fantastic. Steam is actually missing quite a few of my favorites but with the slew of hidden object games appearing everyday, I would bet we'll see them at some point.\n\nHidden Expedition: Amazon is all about the HO scenes. That's what the game is comprised of, with a smattering of puzzles here and there. The story is mostly told by reading journal pages, one on each scene, written by a kooky old man who is searching for the lost Beetle Temple.\n\nAnd now I'll tell you why I myself love this game. A large portion of the enjoyment is the music. It's just beautiful and I never tire of listening to it. Also, Beetles! I find beetles fascinating. In every HO scene (except for the very first one) there are 5 beetles to find which charge up your hint bar. I always find the journal page and all 5 beetles before searching for the other items. I also always read the journal pages (though I probably have them memorized by now) because they are quite amusing. The combo of lovely music, a beetle theme, lots and lots of HO scenes, and a story that makes me smile - it's great.\n\nI can certainly say this isn't for everyone. Obviously look elsewhere if you don't enjoy hidden object games. It's also not super easy and not super hard - definitely for the casual gamer. (Well, some of the items and beetles are very sneakily hidden but you'll find them eventually :p). But I really had to write a review because this game is dear to my heart.\n\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1418932745, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508611", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13434468", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198000556809", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1505495230, "num_games_owned": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2933}, "timestamp_updated": 1418932745, "received_for_free": false, "review": "My favorite hidden object game, its just so relaxing to play this, all of the every day stress fades away when i turn this on.\nFun puzzles, a good variety in the pics, nice story and beautiful music.\nHighly recommended.\n\nDon't forget to collect the beetles for extra hints;)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1412567335, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505147", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "12384730", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198140531353", "num_reviews": 61, "last_played": 1413165439, "num_games_owned": 354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 420}, "timestamp_updated": 1412567335, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Pros: Nice orchestrated musics, Fun little puzzles, Exotic scenarios, Connected maps;\n\nCons: Some grainy and hard-to-focus images.\n\nI recommend it!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1451156916, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502678", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "19970202", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198031085556", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1451156409, "num_games_owned": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 410}, "timestamp_updated": 1451157068, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Short Review: \nI would not recommend playing this game on the PC. It is clearly a IOS/Android port game designed for low resolution usage. Even on my old screen (16870 * 1050) it was shown in a real small frame. This made playing the game a bit of a hassle. (I would however consider buying it for my tablet if the price is reasonable).  I finished the game in roughly 6 hours, which was more or less my expectation although i hoped it would take me more time. \n\nPro's:\n+ Sounds and music are nice\n+ Puzzles are challenging enough for a hidden object game\n+ scenes are nice setup. \n\nCon's: \n- Screen resolution!  Screen resolution! Screen resolution! \n- Sometimes it is not clear what is expected from certain puzzles throughout the game. \n- 10 EUR /USD too expensive (value for money wise)\n\nFinal thoughts: \nI would not recommend buying unless you really enjoy these types of games and they put up on a steamsale deal. The scaling of the game to a small window is really annoying and would require adjustment of your native screen resolution to be playable. If the creators of this game would repair the screen resolution issues it might be a slightly different case."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1471549588, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502678", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "24998805", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198040662730", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1471549773, "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 28}, "timestamp_updated": 1471549588, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is for me unplayable.
