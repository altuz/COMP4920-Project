The art is amazing, the gameplay mechanics are very cool and the puzzles are a good challenge, but nothing that will get you stuck.\n\nThe main flaws are two: \n[olist]\n[*]The controls are not as responsive as I would like, specially when jumping. The game do not require pixel-perfect jumps, so it's not a big issue.\n[*]The level design is not bad, but could use some improvements. On later levels, you don't know what each lever/pressure plate activates, so you have learn via trial and error. The boss stages are not really \"boss fights\", but rather \"boss escapes\". I know it's hard to design boss fights for a puzzle plataformer, but even so I think they should have more action.\n[/olist]\n\nEach level is very short, which can be annoying at first but later becomes a blessing. The last stages can be very unforgiving so it's not a big deal when you have to to restart from scratch.\n\nEven with those issues, overall it was a great experience, it's very fun to sync all your copies to beat a stage.
