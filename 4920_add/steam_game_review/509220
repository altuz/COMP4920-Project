Quite fast and challenging. Ok, Space bar to restart instead of R key, but half of the physics puzzle games don't even have a restart option.. XD\nClassical Flash game, good controls and no apparent bugs of sort. Nothing new of course, there's plenty of these games in Flash websites from Red Remover to Super Stacker and so on, but it's still nice to play :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198356141989", "last_played": 1505070970, "num_reviews": 114, "num_games_owned": 225, "playtime_forever": 230}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1504970096, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517198", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504970971, "recommendationid": "34839695", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "this game is pointless,no matter how well you do and how many times you save him in the end he will be crucifixed anyway.\n10/10 ign but not ign", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198139572475", "last_played": 1490853843, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_forever": 91}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505634953, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504538", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505634953, "recommendationid": "35017086", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Jesus finally reaching God like status as he stands in the steps of our lord and saviour, Mario.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197974522156", "last_played": 1504858309, "num_reviews": 336, "num_games_owned": 1810, "playtime_forever": 271}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505039268, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503099", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505039871, "recommendationid": "34858489", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
