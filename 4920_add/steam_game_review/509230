Basically imagine a character model lifted from The Sims, who walks around emitting a sound comparable to a dozen banshees caught in a windstorm, even with her lips closed. Terrified yet?\n\n   Add some graphics which would have been cutting edge somewhere around the time that Half-Life 1 was released, and sound effects even WORSE than Half-Life 1 (grass and floorboards sounding exactly the same when you run over them) - and, of course, absolutely NONE of the inventive storytelling and clever mapping which make Half-Life 1 such a brilliant and timeless game - and you have the masterpiece which is Erusal. \n\n   Oh, and did I mention that there are no discernible \"stealth\" mechanics, in a scenario in which you are weaponless and have to actively EVADE the aforementioned succubus in black jeans and stripey pink shirt? Gameplay heaven.\n\n   To top it all off, you can apparently complete this game in a stupendously short time period, but the ten minutes which I gave it was more than enough of my life wasted. I hope that Mr Jack Pritz uses the ill-gotten proceeds from this game to nab himself some quality psychiatric care, or failing that, perhaps he could have just murdered whichever girl slighted him and saved the rest of us the trauma of having to play this alleged  \"game\". \n\n   Get well soon, Mr Pritz. Get well soon.\n\nVerdict: 0.5/10.\n\n(PS I had honestly no idea what an \"epistolary\" horror game was, so I looked the word up. Curiously enough, it DOESN'T mean \"utterly worthless and shithouse beyond all comprehension\".)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198048974498", "last_played": 1471016354, "num_reviews": 429, "num_games_owned": 1513, "playtime_forever": 35}, "votes_up": 47, "timestamp_created": 1471011587, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547721", "votes_down": 16, "timestamp_updated": 1472230388, "recommendationid": "24842977", "votes_funny": 39, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "My Professional Reviews\u2122\n\nLength 2-5 mins.\n\nScuriest Gaem Evar\nGOTY Every Year.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198081474791", "last_played": 1475957410, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 123, "playtime_forever": 55}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1475957995, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499346", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1475957995, "recommendationid": "25933209", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Lame game, but i have the world record for beating this game in 51 seconds.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042539736", "last_played": 1483168485, "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 241, "playtime_forever": 426}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1486491156, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488021", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1486491156, "recommendationid": "29766607", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "10/10 Make sure to pay child support.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961525534", "last_played": 1472602909, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 56, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1472602960, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467666", "votes_down": 15, "timestamp_updated": 1472602960, "recommendationid": "25259645", "votes_funny": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "16", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I finished this game in less than one minute.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994086183", "last_played": 1495885161, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 258, "playtime_forever": 191}, "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_created": 1470954034, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437516", "votes_down": 53, "timestamp_updated": 1470954034, "recommendationid": "24833199", "votes_funny": 48, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "i strongly recommened you buy it :)\n1. the ghost not even scary \n2. u can finish the whole game i guess by 2 or 5 minutes like that\n3. i like the way they copy the concept of who's your daddy but worst then that\n4. this game probely u should play it after 5 min finish the game just go refund and u play a full version of the story for free :)\nbuy one now :)\nhttps://youtu.be/oiyGzIuTET0", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198276850477", "last_played": 1471092425, "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1471094971, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.394598", "votes_down": 58, "timestamp_updated": 1471094971, "recommendationid": "24884491", "votes_funny": 8, "voted_up": true}]}
