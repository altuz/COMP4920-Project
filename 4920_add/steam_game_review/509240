I bought this for 10 cents for my son to try, needless to say that was way too much to pay for this garbage. It feels/controls just like it would if you were to put wheels on a bathtub and raced it down the road, no actually you could at least turn the bathtub a little better. \n\nGood points of this game\nSuper cheap\nFree steam cards\nThe car designs look good in theory. \n\nNow let\u2019s talk about all the bad stuff about the game. \nGraphic\u2019s look like they are from the N-64 days. \nMusic, yeah there is a track or 2, and it\u2019s annoying at best. \nHUD is oversized, and mini-map is funky.\nPhysics are the worst, can\u2019t race at all without hitting the walls. \nThings you won\u2019t care about.\nYou can beat the game in less than 2 hours.\nStory, there is one if you want to waste your time reading it.\n\nI only recommend you get this game if its free, and you want the trading cards. Other than that waste a quarter on something else. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198068647681", "last_played": 1497325647, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 1162, "playtime_forever": 97}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1498857223, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506029", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1498857223, "recommendationid": "33056046", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
