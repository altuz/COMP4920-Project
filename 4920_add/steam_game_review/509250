It's not bad I guess but it's just like turning on a generic radio station instead of having the game's own music.

To The Top is masterfully crafted, the environments are begging to be explored, the music fits like a glove to the gameplay, the leading curve is easy but you'll constantly push yourself to get better at it. When you find a secret area, you really feel like you're exploring outside the bounds of the world (even though you're not). Granted this is something I've done countless times in other games, but feeling that way with your own body is something else entirely. I find myself wanting to spend more and more time listening to the soundtrack and interesting myself in there environments and what usually stops me is there octagonal exhaustion of constantly swinging my arms around to leap from building to building.
