Like if I tried to make a building out of really shoddy resources I found in my backyard and kitchen or something. Overall it feels more like a basic student project.\n\nThough, I won't be a dick here. The game fulfills a creator's vision and I respect that - there's a lot of passion I see. I really respect the developers' efforts.\n\nI'll say this, too: The developers seem like really cool people, and take harsh criticism really well - I saw a review bashing the game about one of the installers repeating itself every time you ran the game. The developers fixed it in what seemed like the most honest and calm patch note I've ever seen reacting to that sort of criticism.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I gave the devs the money, even if it's a small amount. It'll probably help them out with later projects since this seemed like a low-budget game. So, I don't feel like this was a wasted purchase.
