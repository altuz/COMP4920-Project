It is so Buggy its unreal. Gameplay mechanics are dreadful and you have to die to learn what to do next. Your Character Moves forward on his own and give's me terrible VR Sickness. Things you pick up fall straight through surfaces, or gets stuck in them. You fall through the floor and cant do anything but exit the game (To be honest its a relief when that happens it ends the suffering) \nI would understand a little more if it was EA, but ive seen EA games make more progress than this one. \nThey don't seem to be working on fixing any of the bugs!
