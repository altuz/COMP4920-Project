I know that's not the best way to start a review, but hear me out. The genre leads to more frustration than any other for me, so I was hesitant to pick this game up. I am really glad I did. I can't get over what a rush the levels were to play through. I'm incredibly impressed with how hunted you feel by some of the sweeping and diving enemy ships. The bosses are really good looking, even quite menacing at times. As you reach each one it really feels like you've stirred up a nest or hive that becomes quite intent on ending your trespassing. \n\nAs far as downsides, there are occasional asteroids that are rather unpredictable and very hard to maneuver through. Shooting helps, of course, but they can divide and ricochet wildly. This did add to the tension though, so it most certainly was not an unwelcomed challenge. I really enjoyed the power-ups and that they come organically through gameplay, which I feel allows the player to focus on staying alive, not worrying about controls. The power-ups can actually have perfect timing, aiding in tight spots as enemies become stronger, more agile, and more erratic. I would most certainly recommend GalaxIverse to anyone, even players like myself that avoid or ignore the genre. A really nice thrill of a game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025025928", "last_played": 1505935482, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 490, "playtime_forever": 111}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505540416, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499550", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505540779, "recommendationid": "34988415", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I think this is a good shooter for the $0.5 I paid for it. I really enjoyed trying to get the achievements. I still can't quite kill the boss on level 10 but it keeps you coming back for more. Yes the graphics are a bit pants but the sound and effect noises are good enough and the ship is easy to control and does what you want it to do. For me it was a perfect balance of not too difficult but difficult enough to be challenging. \nThe only gripe I had with the game is sometimes you lose track of the reticle, especially on later levels when it gets a bit hectic so detonating the bombs becomes a bit hit and miss. \nOtherwise I would highly recommend this game for 1-2 hours solid shooter fun. It has leaderboards if you wanted to spend a bit more time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017076824", "last_played": 1505596879, "num_reviews": 53, "num_games_owned": 6269, "playtime_forever": 133}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505338457, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500330", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505338457, "recommendationid": "34927588", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
