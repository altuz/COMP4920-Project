It worked on Win 10, looked bad, sounded bad, played bad.   Has steam achievements.  The only thing that you can do without spending money is ride a basic horse around the training paddock.  Didn't have much of a tutorial but does have a help website.  Only people that like horse riding sports might like this game.  It has a daily login reward system. \n\nGraphics were not very good.  The sounds of the horse running was terrible. The game lags badly and naggs you to reduce your graphic quality to decrease lag.  The animations are not fluid or missing for some things ( obstacles knocked over). This game has a stamina system so once you run out of time, you have to wait a few hours, just to play only 20 minutes.  Your Horse tires quickly and only Apples that you buy with real money works to replenish your horse.  To challenge a friend, you have to buy a ticket with real money.  It is only recommend for Windows Vista and Win 7 OSs and been optimized to run from Facebook only.   I had more fun riding a horse on LOTRO, than i did here.\n\nTry it, but delete it before you spend real money on this game and look for a better horse riding game than this one.\n\nFor more info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwmJGy5Vnc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf43l5j0d_0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO4u5607lgA\n\nhttp://politefrivolity.blogspot.com/2011/03/riding-club-championships-review.html\n\nhttp://www.anteria.co.za/reviews/112-pc-reviews/189-riding-club-championships-review\n\nhttp://www.horseplains.com/games/riding_club_championships\n\nhttp://virtualhorsegames.net/horse-game/riding-club-championship-facebook", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197982295752", "last_played": 1491701482, "num_reviews": 558, "num_games_owned": 100, "playtime_forever": 18}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1485638158, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504151", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1487624993, "recommendationid": "29550377", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "As a horse-person myself, I like horse games.
