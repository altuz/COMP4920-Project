Trees, mountains, lakes, and rocks.  Once thats done you choose... animals and events? to happen. Theres also a SCORE counter at the bottem left.  The tutorial of the game tells you basic camra controls and nothing of the game itself. When you start a game your told what to do, but even that is extreamly vague.  The FONT for the 'events' sandstorm (not dust storm as it says in its desc) rain, big rain, and fog and something else, is Horrible. The UI is garbage.\nOne little thing that upset me is the game is based around humans, fair enough, but when Humans are summoned a 'food and happiness' shows up on the top upper left. The happiness is represented by =) face, while hunger is represented by a crudely drawn image of Pizza.
