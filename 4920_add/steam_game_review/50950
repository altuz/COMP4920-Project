I probably first got it directly from Big Fish's site, way back when I had a games sub there. Then sometime later I got the retail disc version. It was buggy but worked until some update validation issues made it unplayable. Finally, I found it here on Steam, and it was like finding an old friend. The Steam version works great, and all is just as I remember (minus the bugs). The graphics haven't been updated aside from the aspect ratio, but I think it's fine the way it is.\n\nThere are a ton of layouts to choose from, and you can get more or make your own. Choose from different tilesets and backgrounds. Some Mahjong purists may dislike that some of the layouts would be physically impossible, but I appreciate the variety."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1412463010, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518404", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "12367952", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036439650", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1474583546, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 488431}, "timestamp_updated": 1412463010, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I like this game when I dont want to deal with people and want to pass some time."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1483399730, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507907", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "28959839", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198023631416", "num_reviews": 101, "last_played": 1469141460, "num_games_owned": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 55}, "timestamp_updated": 1483399730, "received_for_free": false, "review": "this game has things wrong with it that make it unplayable on modern versions of windows.\n\none problem is that it takes over five minutes for this game to get out task manager and naturally steam won't allow another game to be launched until the last one shuts down completely.\n\nif i were you i wouldn't think about throwing my money away on this game."}, {"votes_down": 7, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1439394813, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500254", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "17506270", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198085253214", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1507058112, "num_games_owned": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 442, "playtime_forever": 101931}, "timestamp_updated": 1439394813, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I have Microsoft 10 and the game is not fitted, it is very small . \nThanks"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1425769373, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "14783955", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198055463311", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1426097381, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 570647}, "timestamp_updated": 1425769373, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I updated my computer to window 7 and now I can't play this game.
