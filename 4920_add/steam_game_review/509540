There are 6 levels, each wildy different and a bit more challenging than the last. I highly recommend this game for those looking for a relaxing (albeit sometimes rather spooky), yet challenging, VR experience that will make you think outside the box to overcome your obstacles. The campaign is packed with over 4 hours of mind-bending content that will keep you entertained throughout and wanting more when it's over.\n\nNow, that isn't to say that this game is perfect - there are a few small flaws. They are only minor issues; however, and really don't take away from the game. For example, there were a few occurrences where I was able to stick my head through a locked door or area, allowing me to see content that should have been otherwise unaccessible to me at the time. Even though this didn't break the game, it sometimes made it easy for me to guess what the next steps to solving the puzzle would be. It would be nice if there were physical barriers in-game that stopped players from being able to peek through unaccessible areas. Also, there were a few instances where I felt that it was hard to determine if an object was interactable or not. \n\nI bought this game for use with my Oculus Rift when I saw that it was on sale for $11.01 (42% off). At this price, the game is a steal. I would still recommend this game at full price due to the amount of entertainment value that it offers. Not many VR titles offer this amount of content at such a low price.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]6 fun, challenging puzzles\n    [*]Interesting, unique environments\n    [*]Mysterious storyline\n    [*]4+ hours of playable content\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Progress is saved only after beating a level - if you quit the game in the middle of a level, you'll have to restart it next time you play\n    [*]It is sometimes hard to tell if an object is interactable\n    [*]There are a few minor bugs that could use some polishing\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Tips[/h1]\nAlthough obvious, here's one quick tip that I recommend you use in order to ensure that you'll enjoy this game without frustration: make sure that your Room Scale is calibrated properly before playing. More importantly, make sure that your floor level is calibrated properly. When I first played the game, my floor level was set a bit higher than it should have been, which resulted in occurrences where I was unable to pick up certain small items off the ground.
