What makes it really special is that it's the very first game in the Mystery Case Files series. You start off as a complete rookie and each time you solve a case, your rank goes up a bit. By the end, you're a Master Detective, ready to face all the many Mystery Case File games to come. I think Steam has most of them but they're missing Dire Grove. I do believe it's on its way though. So.... Huntsville takes place in just one little town. FULL of criminals, apparently. And you get to track each one down. Each case is comprised of multiple hidden object scenes (remember, challenging ones!) and then a jigsaw-like puzzle at the end to identify the culprit. There's lots of humor to be found. Just as an example - one of the criminals you're after is named Gil T. Azell. I recommend this game to HOG fans, and for those of you who enjoy any of the other Mystery Case Files, definitely add this to your game collection."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1388705067, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521381", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "8523429", "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197969752619", "num_reviews": 211, "last_played": 1388704616, "num_games_owned": 4717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 224}, "timestamp_updated": 1388705067, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A Hidden Object game that shows its age, in that it is low resolution and 4:3 aspect ratio.

Even though there is a \"full screen\" button, I repeat, it DOES NOT go full screen.\n\n\nWith that said, if you do want full screen, you can go to\n\nwww.bigfishgames.com\n\nYou will have to create an account like steam, but it's a big fish games account. It's quite easy.\nOnce you do that, like I did, you can play the game and have loads of fun.\n\nSo if you like Hidden Items games, I would say thus far in the Mystery case files games, they do not dissappoint. I have played Huntsville, Return to RavenHearst, and Prime Suspects and I enjoyed every one of them. Surely a great way to kill some time and looking forward to playing new ones when discounts and specials come on.\n\nBigfish site seems to always have specials going on there so worth looking into."}]}
