I receive a program not responding CTD. [bundle has been published now]. Looks like it still defaults to some crazy low resolution before freezing up and crashing, which destroys whatever desktop/icon/window composition you may have. Please let us choose windowed mode and custom resolutions. Gonna refund for now until the bundle comes out and its been patched a bit. I will definitely revise this review, but i thought i should give an initial report for potential buyers.\n\n[Edit 2 5/10/2017] I decided to buy the bundle, as i want to support the devs, and gave it a try in a Windows XP VM and it worked flawlessly, and made me happy to see this game running again. I actually kind of prefer it this way, because i don't like that the resolution is still restricted to like 480p or something, and it won't destroy my desktop composition in a VM. Otherwise, its up to the Devs to patch for compatibility and add features like resolution choices\n\nSince my habbits already involve running VMs for various things, i have a VM for old games like this, so i can recommend under these circumstances until the developers decide to do more for compatibility and functionality.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197980971371", "last_played": 1495574834, "num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 955, "playtime_forever": 19}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1493736331, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499382", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1494440763, "recommendationid": "31507395", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
