Saw a bug reported and fixed in a few hours.\n\nCon:\n*The animations could have a bit more life\n*Dev doesn't do a good enough job of communicating that the weapons have a \"super attack\", like the lead pipe does more damage when you attack while jumping.  Learning that helped the combat from getting stale.\n\nWarnings:\n*It is dark AND has sarcasm.  If you want just one and not the other, look elsewhere\n*Playing it on Medium felt a bit Dark Souls-esque (had to learn animation patterns to know when to hit), and playing it on Easy made it feel a bit more like a brawler (I could just run in and start attacking). \n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198387214543", "last_played": 1494561912, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_forever": 492}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1494525334, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526438", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1494525334, "recommendationid": "31687449", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very fun game so far.
