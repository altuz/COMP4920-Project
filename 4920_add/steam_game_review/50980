I love Hidden Object games and play a lot.  There is some sort of story here, but the problem is that the graphics are really terrible.  Many of the objects are very small and and most of them are just plain ugly. Maybe this would be good for someone who is really looking for something creepy, but even then the example images above are not at all representive of what you are going to see in game and most of the sites you have to search are very very grainy. That is what really takes all the possiblity of fun out of the game."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1482644445, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "28620746", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198065064067", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1482650816, "num_games_owned": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 501}, "timestamp_updated": 1482644445, "received_for_free": false, "review": "*Happiness Sigh* My first MCF game that I ever got as a kid, (and played the demo on Pogo.com) I love this game (but not my all time favorite) I really love this game but, I also HATED this one as well, why because of the third crime computer puzzle is a crossword puzzle and when I was little its was hard because I didn't know how to spell and know what words they are, But this game is also fantastic by the, places you can explore and atmosphere is beautiful, and the soundtrack... well... creepy... (Turn the music volume down, to creepy) But still I love this game."}]}
