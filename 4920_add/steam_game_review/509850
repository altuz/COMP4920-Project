(but what did expect for such little money)\nthe game can be infuriating, what i expected was going around in great speed shooting rockets in every direction and blowing stuff up not very precise sniping cars and driving slow against a wall blowing my self up. (you cant even blow up the police cars, you can only stun them for like 2 seconds)\n\nthe infuriating part is that literaly everything hurts your car and you only have 5 hits you can take before the game is over.(I havent seen anyway to regain health back)\nyou also get power ups like more speed and more rockets after getting more checkpoints but the first power up is more a power down, you gain a movement speed boost wich will literally kill you because after this so called power up your car is much harder too control so youll crash into alot.\n\n\nand when you die everything stops, the music cuts out, your mouse indicator is stuck in its place and throws you back in the main menu.\n\nSo in short:\nPro's:\n* fitting music \n* fun for 30 min at a time\nCons:\n* you are too fragile\n* unprecise controls \n* aiming is way to precise wich takes you out of the flow of the game\n\n\nso over all a 5/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046912179", "last_played": 1474657625, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 202, "playtime_forever": 182}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1473783505, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1474543291, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515948", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1474640507, "developer_response": "Hi the Headless \u00a9\nI made some improvements in the game based on your feedback.\nPlease, take a look. thank you.", "recommendationid": "25496277", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "In this game, you drive around shooting other vehicles on the road whilst avoiding police cars and trying to reach the checkpoints to increase the time limit. Except the number of police vehicles increase and shooting them only disables them momentarily. Very simple game premise, but challenging as it you battle increasingly numerous enemies chasing you. Shooting enemies upgrades your vehicle's weapons and overall look. Not much to this game really. Other than it has cards. And unlockables.
