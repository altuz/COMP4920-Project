The game is fun for 1-2 play throughs, maybe 2 hours or so total. But it needs a lot of work.\n\n#1. Lack of content, updates and content have been promised at three separate release dates, all have fallen through. Now apparently the excuse is they have to rebuild the entire game? I'd be fine if the devs would just release content  in small patches, but nothing has been released.\n\n#2. Bugs/fixes are needed, but the game never gets patched or fixed. Literally, it has never been patched. A few other early access game I play literally patch/fix or add updates/changes nearly every month.\n\n#3. The devs are HIGHLY unprofessional and will engage in dung throwing arguments on their comment threads instead of posting a mature, helpful update or comment. They will literally attempt to degrate you, insult you, and speak condescending if you express any sort of frustration towards the game needing an update or patch. I've even heard them tell someone something a long the lines, \"go ahead, return the game we don't care, but you probably can't because you have 9+hrs played.\" I understand english may not be their first language and that's okay, but perhaps they should find someone, or pay someone to communicate better.\n\n#4. I purchased the game through steam, however apparently keys were being sold else where and even though the Devs were getting paid for the transaction, they were banning legitimately purchased/acquired keys because they were not purchased through Steam.\n\n#5. They will ban you if you apparently \"insult\" them on their message board, even though as I previously stated they will insult/talk down to you.\n\nI really liked this game at first, I recommended it to a friend and he bought it to play with me, but that was back in April, and since then nothing new has surfaced for it, only broken promises. I can't get behind a Dev team that insults/talks down to their customers; the people who support, and pay them. They need to understand their customers are frustrated, and feeling as though they have been \"ripped off\".\n\nI hope to be able to change this review when the game and the Devs are in a more positive state, but for now do not purchase this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 126, "steamid": "76561198052510986", "last_played": 1507188791, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_forever": 1415}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1506277597, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519441", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506277597, "recommendationid": "35187792", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I really wanted this game to work but when I start the game and click solo then new game it loads and freezes and if I do nothing I can hear the game.

This is also dangerous because one key can be sold to multiple users.\nIf we become aware of such youtuber his keys fall into the ban. \nWe regret that ordinary users can suffer from similar fraudulent actions.\nThe best way to get game is buying directly in steam.\n\nSo if you didn't buy it through Steam, you might get banned even though they got their money and you paid for a product. Shady devs are shady. \nNow for the game:\nNeat game for about 3 playthroughs. Basic. Catch bigfoot, put him in a cage. \nThere's not much replay value, and while it's early access, it's doing that typical EA thing where updates take FOREVER and there's really nothing to show why it took so long. I bought this game about 4 months ago (on Steam, thankfully), and haven't seen one new feature implemented. There's talk of drones and a new map with yetis, but nothing making it any more than just talk. \nI'd hold off on buying this game. The devs don't seem to care about their users, as this banwave shows. I'd understand if it was piracy, but this is just legit people buying the game, and getting punished for buying it from anywhere but Steam.
