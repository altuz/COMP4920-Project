If you can deal with a seriously creepy story.\n\nYou can tell the developers put a lot of love and time into this game. The graphics are beautiful (though the HO scenes aren't quite as crystal clear as some of the more modern games). The music is just wonderful - lovely, haunting, moving - it's one of my favorite things about the game. And here and there, real people act in the game. Not too often and sometimes there's cheesy acting that makes me laugh (when you're supposed to be scared :p), but for the most part, the actors really add to the great atmosphere and chilling tale. You'll also get your fill of puzzles in this game. The journal that the main character (you) keeps is essential for solving some of them so don't neglect to read back through it.\n\nI do recommend playing Mystery Case Files: Ravenhearst first because this is a continuation of that story. Mystery Case Files: Madame Fate actually comes between the 2 Ravenhearst ones and though it is also an extremely fun game, it adds little to the plot. Really, ALL the Mystery Case File games are so so so fun and I wish Steam had more of them. Of the MCFs that Steam DOES have, Return to Ravenhearst is my favorite.\n\nTwo thumbs up from me."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1395613577, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511963", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "9612663", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198095586079", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1396131290, "num_games_owned": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 635}, "timestamp_updated": 1395613577, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Really enjoyed this game,kept me on edge,great story.If i had to pick one thing i didnt like it would be the loading time on the hint system .But overall a great game ,worth getting."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1413336767, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501296", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "12494824", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098756177", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1413336271, "num_games_owned": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4490}, "timestamp_updated": 1413336767, "received_for_free": false, "review": "its awesome.\ni needed a little help with some of the puzzles as im not a very patient person. \nThe hint time takes long and it doesnt help you find out what you have to do next so you end up roaming around the mansion trying to figure out what you are suppose to do.\nIf you love puzzles, there are lots!\ni like the story!\ni think its worth it."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1452946604, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503015", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "20559555", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198009371985", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1475764990, "num_games_owned": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 94}, "timestamp_updated": 1452946604, "received_for_free": false, "review": "scaling problems for win 10, win 8 and 7"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1465683197, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499206", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "23510162", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198288507918", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1465682953, "num_games_owned": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1257}, "timestamp_updated": 1465683197, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I recommend highly! I had just finished the original Ravenhearst game and decided to take my chances on this one. What led me to the first one was having played \"The Malgrave Incident\" on the Wii. I love detective point-and-click games and HOG and really loved Malgrave (also Big Fish Mystery Case Files). The original Ravenhearst was great as far as HOG go, but didn't compare to Malgrave in terms of graphics and something I loved about Return to Ravenhearst and Malgrave, which is the opportunity to wander around the grounds and explore. \n\nThis must have something to do with the 3 or so years that elapsed between the release of the first and the second. I recommend playing the original Ravenhearst game first in order to get the story and feel of the series. Now, I'm going to check out the sequel to this one. I hope it's good--another company did it instead of Big Fish. I'm also going to check out some more Mystery Case Files games. \n\nEnjoy!!"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1465876620, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498382", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "23546812", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198045720356", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1465881863, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 456}, "timestamp_updated": 1465876620, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Sick Game me and the misses played it and had a great time"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1420003741, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494928", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13730721", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198140854616", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1420449090, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 46}, "timestamp_updated": 1420003741, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I really want to play but it says I need a security key?"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1435122142, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496259", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "16667742", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198165713733", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1433991648, "num_games_owned": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 52}, "timestamp_updated": 1435122142, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good game if you like to solve puzzles."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1498362694, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32754351", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198117635952", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1498362424, "num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 411}, "timestamp_updated": 1498362694, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A fantastic Hidden Object and Puzzle game.
