I like it though, and here's why:\n\nI've been a gamer for a lot of years. It all started with games on a Texas Instruments computer back in the early '80s with such gems as Parsec and Hunt the Wumpus (not sarcasm, they WERE gems).\n\nShortly thereafter Atari showed up along with Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS.\n\nSpeaking of MS-DOS, here is where the relevancy to A Matter of Murder comes in.\n\nBack around then, I first played a game that used ASCI graphics called Sleuth. You roam a mansion examining possible weapons and question suspects until you solve it or get killed. This game is very similar to Sleuth except this one has graphics, sound, and music.\n\nYou play as a budding detective in a typical British manor type setting with your usual suspects, various lords and ladies, an explorer, a couple foreigners, a veteran of the war, and a maid thrown together. One of them is murdered and it is up to you to point the finger at the culprit and say why it was done and with what weapon.\n\nYou have a time limit though and you lose a bit of time whenever you ask a suspect a question or examine a nearby weapon. Once you've ferreted out everyones alibis and motives and have found the weapon, you hit the accuse button and hope you're right.\n\nAs the cases get solved the next ones become harder. Alibis become more challenging to figure out, as do motives. You also have to rely on what the suspects say about the wound on the body to figure out the weapon instead of just being told that the poker has blood on it. The logic gets amped up pretty steeply after a few cases so it might help to have your own pen and pad handy as the in game notebook resembles a Clue sheet and doesn't have any space for notes of your own.\n\nIf you get tired of the names of the characters, you can change them into friends of yours. That's a nice little feature which Sleuth also had way back then.\n\nThis isn't a AAA game by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a fun little time waster for when you only have a little time to waste.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197975238415", "last_played": 1474521357, "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 381, "playtime_forever": 520}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1472802751, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505083", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1472802751, "recommendationid": "25300430", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a very fun murder mystery game, following the trope format of Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes stories.\n\nEach short 10-minute episode (which is procedurally generated on the fly, giving a different game each time) is a fun little logic puzzle, with whimsical and charming English humor.
