Besides that though 10 seconds is where you pretty much parkour your way through 4 arenas each with, correct me if im wrong, 10 levels. The art style is very unique, very pixelated and, in my opinion, just a very sort of fun style like flappy bird. Theres happiness and then theres rage. controls are pretty simple and its just another one of those addicting ragey parkour games. Me personally, I had to stop at arena 2 because if I did'nt I would not be typing this, I would be looking for a new not broken part of my computer. There are also some pretty cool/pretty weird ideas and unique gameplay. For example, you only have 10 seconds to beat a level like it says in the title of the game. Theres also magnets and reversed gravity I thought were pretty cool. So besides the rage, overall I reccommend this game.\n\nI will rate this game a 10 out of 10, it was a good time waster that I would NOT play again because god knows what could happen :D", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198361151700", "last_played": 1489036026, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1488168077, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1488343811, "recommendationid": "30212548", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "it's good for free time.but i think the stage of the gameq is a little difficult for me......\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198274278876", "last_played": 1485706575, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485287047, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485287047, "recommendationid": "29469066", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fun, simple game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198288031153", "last_played": 1471424543, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485453518, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485453518, "recommendationid": "29506175", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Wow, this game it is so amazing !
