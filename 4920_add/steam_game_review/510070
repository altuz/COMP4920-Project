The sight of hundreds of amber monochrome triangles floating at you across the screen is almost soothing, in a way.\n\nAfter the first several levels, every level essentially becomes the \"9\" levels of Robotron: 2084.

The game's store page is garnished with the phrase \"How long can you survive?\" but the game lacks any 'endless' mode. The gameplay workds on a level system, where you have a number of ships you need to eliminate and a new level is reached, with geometrically more ships to destroy. The transition should be seamless, instead the gameplay is paused for several seconds and you're caught waiting for nothing. And when you crash into a ship, the game is not reset. Instead you are set back to the last round reached which creates no pressure to survive. The gameplay is lacking and the weird pauses in gameplay completely destroys any immersion or focus. These are more likely to be code errors and poor function execution than lack of RnD; having taken a programming course and a half I know that these kinds of oversights can happen, especially for an inexperienced dev. It's not a flop, like I said it cost me half a dollar but I was hoping it would blow me away and let me beg my friends to spend the dollar for a simple and lightweight game. It was a good chance for Frizzank to try publishing a project though. More features and annoying immersion break fixes to come i'm sure.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198253370249", "last_played": 1471108941, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 32}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1471109571, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500027", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1471109571, "recommendationid": "24890685", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Super cheap and fun to play.

Easily worth it's $1 price tag to any old school arcade game fan who has played old school games like Asteroids.\n\nThe controls couldn't be simpler and is all controlled with the mouse.  Left mouse button to shoot, Right mouse button to thrust in the direction your ship faces, and mouse pointer to control the direction you face.  \n\nThe controls are very responsive, and each level gets progressively harder with more and more objects to destroy as well as a goal to destroy 25 more then the previous level to advance to the next level.  You have three lives to begin and if you die, your ship might spawn with objects on or near your spawn point, but it's okay as you have a few seconds of invulnerability allowing you to set yourself up to kill some more triangles.\n\nSimple game, simple controls.. hard to master.
