It has earnable power-ups, match 3 combo upgrades, and interesting challenging mechanics.  These challenges are presented as bugs that need to be removed.  Bugs can do different things like clog up the board, prevent tiles from moving, etc.  There are helpful items, too, that help destroy bugs.  Matching medkits charges up your powerups.  A medkit with a symbol on it will supercharge that particular powerup.  \n\nThe theme is not disturbing or sickening at all.  In fact, with every problem you cure on the patient, you can watch that part of the patient get better!  This is actually quite satisfying.  More so than saving the world, honestly, which seems so far fetched. It's quite addictive, and I want to bail on this review to finishing curing the patient (the ultimate goal, I believe).\n\nI always play on the harder difficulty, and this one is just two - timer or casual.  The timer hasn't been an issue so far ... it just dictates how much extra points and cash is received for upgrade purchases.\n\nAll in all, a very fun game!\n\nI am certian the next time I am sick I will dream about matching bugs in my head and medkits to cure what is wrong with me..."}]}
