Visuals are one of the game's strongest points.\n+ Ambient soundtrack (nothing like in the trailer though).\n+ Unique mechanics for every boss make for interesting battles.\n+ A very smooth difficulty curve.\n+ Good mileage for that price.\n\nCons:\n- Sluggish controls on keyboard. I often wished the Forma didn't have so much inertia, makes aiming bombs frustrating.\n- Slight lag when CPU-heavy effects go on screen (e.g. distortion from hot air).\n- Puzzles are very hit-and-miss. Some have well-designed hints that make you feel smart, some leave you scratching you head and looking for guides. Seriously, one of the achievements has nothing to do with the information within the game and requires a bit of gaming history knowledge.\n- Progression pacing is a bit off. After I unlocked the first three (out of five) abilities, I managed to explore most of the game with them; the last two were given very close to the end and with a very short interval. And since collecting everything requires the full range of abilities, I did quite a lot of backtracking for a 100% completion.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071847553", "last_played": 1497385545, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 174, "playtime_forever": 736}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1497387277, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521912", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497387479, "recommendationid": "32397779", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Interesting game, graphics are pretty cool, story ok, controls take some getting used to. But I either have to assume I encountered a bug, or the whole \"minimal tutorial\" bullshit got taken way too far on this one. Spent almost an hour trying to work out how to get through a wall. Eventually ended up googling a walkthrough and the video showed someone just blasting through it with an ability I already had, which I'd already tried. At first I really liked the way the minimalist intro left you really feeling abandoned on an alien planet, fitting well with the story, but then it was frustrating and limited progression through what (in my fairly limited gameplay thus far) seemed like a reasonably linear story.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198122391942", "last_played": 1495266409, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_forever": 55}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1496565625, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499282", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1496565625, "recommendationid": "32171139", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
