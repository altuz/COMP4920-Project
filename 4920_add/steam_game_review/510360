A lot of fun actually!! I ran into one strange bug which is to be expected but all in all the gameplay was enjoyable. I do think a $5 price would be more on point for the game especially in its current state but that said I dont regret spending the $10 for it. I do recommend this game and I do think I will be playing some more of this one! :)\n\nCheck out my video to see some gameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p3KCBtmiCI", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198232622752", "last_played": 1500479397, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 64, "playtime_forever": 41}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1499811192, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499955", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1499811192, "recommendationid": "33466598", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "To be honest, I don't think the devs understand what \"asymmetrical \" gaming is.\n\n[b]REFUNDED[b]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idiLp4fvh1I", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040587219", "last_played": 1499825753, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 559, "playtime_forever": 44}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1500226282, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494612", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1500226282, "recommendationid": "33589997", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I was really looking forward to this game coming out and bought it day of release. However I refunded it after 40 mins of gameplay. The only positive I can give it is that it runs well with no lag or crashes but it's just boring. The game consists of basically loading up on one side of a very small map with a building in the centre. You pick up a gun, walk a few feet, shoot a metal door that collapses like a rock wall, then pick up one of 5 small money bags on the floor and walk back to the van a few feet away with a cop shooting at you but the hitboxes are that bad that if you run or jump you don't take any damage. The maps are tiny, the characters look distorted, there is no asymmetrical gameplay as the description states. It is exactly the same whether you are playing as the cop or one of the robbers. The cop, although advertised as having heavy armour, is quite easily killed and if not, one person can keep him busy while the other 3 grab the cash, the cop is no threat whatsoever. The rounds barely lasted 5 minutes. I can't recommend this game, there are plenty of other early access titles that are worth your time. This is just a really basic version of Payday 2 and I mean really basic.\nFirst Imprssions Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtWXsuoY-vM", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198281910927", "last_played": 1499825715, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_forever": 44}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500459571, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485437", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500463287, "recommendationid": "33648548", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pretty good looking game but no players or servers online!\nViewmodel is awesome too.check it at the end of the year!maybe some has\nChanges....", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198128343964", "last_played": 1500170846, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 119, "playtime_forever": 9}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500196859, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500196859, "recommendationid": "33580462", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "kool small game but its some time hard to get a game becose the game is realy new\n\nlooking forward for new Update", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976090763", "last_played": 1499826157, "num_reviews": 89, "num_games_owned": 496, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499826290, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1499826290, "recommendationid": "33469909", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
