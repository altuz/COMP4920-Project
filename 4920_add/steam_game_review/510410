You'll watch the trailer and think of exciting cowboy action, rapid-firing away with dual revolvers like classic cowboy fare, but in reality the the gameplay is bland and unenjoyable, with many major flaws. [Note: At the time I wrote this review a major issue was that there were all kinds of delays on your rate of fire, although supposedly some have been fixed since.]\n\n*The weapon selection system uses a great idea, but the execution is very poor, so it takes intense concentration and several attemps to change weapons. The first robot has always started shooting at me by the time I've equipped a weapon in both hands\n*There is an unacceptably long delay (maybe .2 or .25 seconds?) between when you pull the trigger and when the gun actually fires. As if the game needed more excuses to limit your ROF\n*The game encourages you to dual-wield, but your guns are so unresponsive and your effective rate of fire is so severely limited that you'll never hit anything in this manner. Might as well put down one controller and only use one gun.\n*The sound is bland to the extreme and poorly mixed. The audio would be more exciting if your friend was watching you play and making sound effects with his mouth\n*There's a long rifle but no two-handed aiming afaict\n*[b]Forces you to type in your name every time you die[/b]\n\nSupposedly these issues have been fixed, but I already refunded the game and can't verify:\n*Loading the revolvers and rifle seems to require you to swipe from top-to-bottom on the touchpad, which I guess is supposed to simulate pulling the hammer down, but it's way too finicky. Sometimes it doesn't work, othertimes it works with just a tap\n*There's at least half a second of delay between when you pull the hammer back and when you can actually fire, painfully limiting your rate of fire and making it very difficult to tell if you've actually cocked the gun correctly", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197966877172", "last_played": 1471413824, "num_reviews": 78, "num_games_owned": 218, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1471332958, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511443", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1473790150, "recommendationid": "24949471", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Good little shooter, makes a refreshing change from shooting zombies, just needs more levels/areas.

I would expect having something more powerfull/smoother relying to the weapon-sound that shows \"hey, ive got a gun! Currently it feels like a 8bit sound-compilation.\n- for myself i feel like some weopons miss a reloadsound, eg sniper or the double barrel needs an additional sound when ammo is \"getting back\"\n- personally i dont like to drive around the trackpad to reload a weopon (it always gets annoying when the game has reached a specific speed level)\n- when the music/sfx volume is being reduced (out of the game) and the game has been restarted, the first couple of seconds are on a wrong volume and gets lowered afterwards.\n- the weapon-menu ... well, for now i cant say whether i like or hate it :). only noticed when i had my arm reached during the fight, choosing a weopon is not a good idea as the menue is being put a short distance off which means i need to reach my hand further or get it back and reopen the menu. maybe you can balance it a bit.\n- weopon damage needs small balance-update\n- weopon aiming seems a bit broken (especially noticed within the sniper)\n- to have an option to set the weopon angle would be great\n- global leaderboard missing - you already said its on the run :)\n- power ups would be great like (laserpointer, health recovery, autoreload, semifire and something like that)\n- bots could need a smoother moving\n- a radar which shows spoted enemys would be helpful especially on higher waves\n- getting close to an enemys shot that puts you under slow motion feels pretty nice (like it is SpacePirateTrainer) or even reduce the bullet-speed. its not that easy to to evade (or is it just me?)\n- how about dynamite!!!  (hey we are cowboys :) )\n- honestly i thought to have enough space to play but this game takes a bit too much. Some kind of teleporting would be great. Reducing the game-space could be an option as well.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017511808", "last_played": 1470947889, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1470949426, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1470949426, "recommendationid": "24832441", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I know it's early access, but so are most VR games.

After remembering that I paid $5.99 for it. Getting out of the game to see a dev console covering 1/4 of the game window was not a happy moment. Granted I could have closed it but there's no indication that it's there inside the game and it didn't pop up until after I put the headset on.\n\nOverall, this game is not in a state where it should be in EA yet much less should it be charging for the experience. I get that EA titles should be buggy but this isn't a release candidate build it's a dev build. Something I would run locally to test, not release to the public. Even as an 'EA' title.\n\nFocusing solely on the working wave shooter gameplay:\n\nThe weapon swap system is awkward and clunky. \nThe weapons themselves didn't feel good. It didn't feel like aiming was something I should take the time to do. It felt like it rewarded spray and pray more than accurate shots. \nIt also felt like there was artificial accuracy rather than my own accuracy being the only factor. \nWeapon instructions provided as tool tips were inaccurate.\nMusic setting does not appear to be maintained in the survival main menu.\n\nThe fast and frantic gameplay was enjoyable once I dropped trying to use any of the other weapons aside from the six shooters. It also gets points for an Exit to Desktop button instead of making us force close like a good number of other titles.\n\nIt's not an outright bad wave shooter if you can overlook that it was released too soon however...\n\nIt's hard to overlook the faults when it's currently in the mid range as far as pricing for these games go. It's got a nice premise, even if it is an over saturated wave shooter, but it's been released to the public faaaar too soon.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983689849", "last_played": 1473392562, "num_reviews": 92, "num_games_owned": 332, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1473394984, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1473395036, "recommendationid": "25420848", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great fun, and the dev is very active and open.

The western theme is good. The game play is not very unique though. You have guns and you have a shield and you can slow time and you are stuck in your room scale space and not able to travel any where on the map. Sound familiar? I am not going to be buying many more of these WBS's and probably more like never again. There are too many and they are just not exciting to me anymore. VR needs more than just arcade games. I grew up in the 70's too and understand the arcade craze like anyone else but that was then and this is now. I want the future not the past. I am going to recommend this based on the video below which you can watch and the fact that the dev says he is going to add a story mode. It took some getting used but it had its fun and the guns were a good mix of oldish style and future style even though the whole game is obviously a sci-fi western so don't go into this thinking you are back in and I say ,respectfully, Vietnam or Iraq  and things have to work that way. Let a game be a game. Games for the most part are for fun and not real life re-enactments. The game is cheap but that is not why I bought it. I don't care about cheap anymore if devs are just going to slap a VR game together in another skin and let the VR game grabbers scrounge for the dish. That is not my style nor do I appreciate that as a game consumer. I read a review and got soft and that is why I bought this. It had some fun but it does need work as of this writing but if you love WBS's then this will satisfy I am sure. Enjoy the game and the video below after it processes.
