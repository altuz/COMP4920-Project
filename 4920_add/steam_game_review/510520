However, the game uses this limited interactivity very carefully, allowing you to pace the game as you want and explore as much of the character's inner thoughts as possible.\n\nThe game is an exceptionally well-written exploration of debt, capitalism, family and mental illness. I'm not sure I agree with its uncompromising nihilism, which at times can come across as a bit of a rant. But everything is written with such flare that this doesn't become an irritant, even over the 6 hours of play it took to finish. At least for me, the writing was constantly challenging my expectations and making me challenge the characters, the game, and my own prejudices. So I may be coming down too hard on the nihilism - the ending of the game left me wanting to say \"screw you, game, I'm better than that.\" It's difficult to know which responses are intentional and which are just my own unique response to the game - by my consideration, a good test for a complex piece of art.\n\nAll in all, a highly recommended game. I feel like I ought to revisit it in the way you revisit a great book. Unlike most games, I feel there are still many depths to plumb in this story before I feel I adequately understand or appreciate everything the author has tried to do.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053586479", "last_played": 1504645343, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 150, "playtime_forever": 348}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1504647096, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508779", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1504647540, "recommendationid": "34764972", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I went into this game knowing full well it was going to be bad. I went into this game assuming this was going to be a progressive hipster's commentary on society and thought it'd be fun to mock on that basis alone. As such, I expected this game to naturally be a bunch of pretentious twaddle, but even my expectations were blown out of the water. This game just WILL NOT SHUT THE FUCK UP with its inner monologues that think they say WAY more than they actually do. And because you get inner monologue which is basically just the creator's pseudo-philosophical ramblings every 5 seconds or so, you don't really get to appreciate the story even though the story is, frankly, quite dull. Don't get me wrong. Sarah's story certainly picks up with a nice twist at the end, but the problem there is the creator managed to fuck it up in the end anyway.\n\nWord of advice, Will O'Neill: If you're going to label your game as \"Story rich\" then learn how to write a story first.
