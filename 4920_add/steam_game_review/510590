You play as Laura Harris, daughter of Dr. Richter Harris, a famous physician who, for some reason, has suddenly decided to murder everyone in his hospital and disappear inside the building.  You have two hours (in real time) to figure out why, with no saving, interactive movie-style.\n\nYou use the four directional buttons to move, space to interact with things, and I to access your inventory.  I'm telling you that here and now, because the game doesn't tell you any of that anywhere at any point (that was all originally in the manual).\n\nTo be sure, this game is old as shit.  Everything moves really slowly, the graphics (although I love them) are from the 90s, and some of the scares (although I love them) are kind of goofy in the modern era.  But, the hole-filled story does take a couple of unexpected turns, there are two endings, and the overall atmosphere is actually pretty creepy, even now.  \n\nIf you like horror, don't mind awkward ports of old games, and maybe also if it's on sale, then by all means show some love to one of the pioneers of the genre.  Also, for a fun drinking game, take a shot every time Richter says \"Laura.\"", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197998373669", "last_played": 1497080102, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 237, "playtime_forever": 248}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1495937310, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517455", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1495937310, "recommendationid": "32009670", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "- Good game for PSX FMV nostalgia pals! ;)\n- Laura, the protagonist, is looking to find out what's happening in the hospital where his dad is mass murdering people. D will take a plot twist right at the first minutes and there you go.\n- The game happens in a 2hs run (mandatory) or is game over. \n\nPros:\n- The port is based on DOS Box but is pretty playable, no issues.\n- Kenji Eno made the music of the game and you should check the story of the life/death of this dev.\n- Don't miss the endings and credits ;)\n\nCons:\n- The puzzles are very easy, but the rhythm of the exploration may be too slow for today's standards. That's why I say, play this if you like this genre and you played games like this back in the 90's. Low budget dialog, but funny classic danger moments.\n\nNotes:\nD has a sequel on Dreamcast called D2 that's very different and continues the story of the main protagonist and has nothing to do with D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die from Swery65.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034797533", "last_played": 1495230992, "num_reviews": 122, "num_games_owned": 296, "playtime_forever": 91}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1498721284, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512104", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498722835, "recommendationid": "32977637", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
