It's a mixture of hidden object finding, using the right objects from your inventory in the right places, and solving a number of moderately taxing puzzles. Well ok, the puzzles aren't that hard to complete, but a number of achievements rely on solving them quickly, or within a certain number of moves, or without making any mistakes. That's actually quite difficult for some of the puzzles on your first attempt where you're trying to figure out what to do, but a second playthrough would snag those. Still, it's not the kind of game to play through more than once, it's a linear story, it's not particularly difficult, and it's over in a little over four hours.

Franklin, the one that hide her, can't do anything as magic has taken the tower but he reveals that you can go into worlds created in paintings...\n\nDrawn: The Painted Tower is the first game of a trilogy, where drawings can act as portals to other worlds. The main idea is to use this opportunity to find items that will lead you to Iris. While the main plot is revealed little by little, I'll be honest: it's not really the focus here. You don't have anybody on your tails or pursuing someone, you're just trying to reach a little girl by solving puzzles.\n\nThe gameplay is the standard one in this game except for a missing feature: there are no hidden objects scenes. You can say that it's just to find items, use them, combine them and solves riddles and puzzles. However, trust me, it's not boring at all. Objects aren't necessarily easy to find but they're making sense. Everything is making sense, even the actions. Besides, you can find clues thanks to letters or notes scattered around.\n\nThe graphics are more close to drawings, however, they're very somber apart for the paintings themselves: a farm in the sunset, a witch doctor in the jungle, a dragon cave, a griffon castle (though it's an ice landscape), a forest during the night (perhaps the only real dark painting) and a giant tree. It\"s really changing from the rest of the genre out there.\n\nThe soundtrack is also marvellous: very fitting in each scene.\n\nAchievements are also included and ingame, once unlocked, they're for all the profiles.\n\nHowever, what's the problem here?\n\nI had several crashes. I returned to Windows, with the game closed but the .exe still running. I had to terminate. Once, it was even switching between the game and Windows. I had to do a CTRL-ALT-DELETE to open the task manager to stop this infernal switch.\n\nBut despite this, Drawn: The Painted Tower is a fabulous tale. However, you do know what I'll recommend you: to buy it during a sale. Seriously, Big Fish is planning to release the last game of the trilogy and I've to try Dark Flight before. Given the fact that I bought the CE and the SE edition, because I've misread the title, I'll make a comparison of the two versions soon."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1307130727, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505318", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "2331469", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198005845169", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1393989830, "num_games_owned": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 663}, "timestamp_updated": 1307130727, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This an excellent game, especially for the price.

Yes, its fa\u00e7ade is beautiful, but that does not outweigh the many problems with the game\u2019s construction. I have played many puzzle games and most have a beautiful exterior. It is generally the story\u2019s depth, the game\u2019s mechanics, and the variety of engaging puzzles that make for a fun puzzle adventure. This game lacked quality in all of the above.\nProblems:\n(The Story): This story\u2019s depth runs about as deep as a 3 year old child\u2019s written work. Harsh, but true. The only creativity or beauty seen in this game is visual; that would be fine if this were a pretty painting being sold for 10 dollars and not a puzzle adventure game. \nYou would be better off grabbing a snack and a movie at your local cinema than playing through this. That would cost the same time and money as Drawn: the Painted Tower, but at least you would have more to say about it than \u201cIt\u2019s pretty\u201d.\n\n(Mechanics): As other negative reviewers have said, the game crashes frequently. Also, when you use hints, they come in order of steps needing to be accomplished within a given room. So, if you are at a loss at the end of a room and need a hint, you will have to go through all of the room\u2019s hints to get to the one you are after.\n\n(Puzzles): I don\u2019t know about you, but for me, variety is key in a puzzle game. The variety in Drawn was not so great, but the main problem with some of Drawn\u2019s puzzles is that there are no instructions. So when you do get excited about a hard looking puzzle, your excitement is likely to fade by the time you figure out what exactly you are supposed to do. (In short) Having no instructions was okay a lot of the time, but it was frustrating when a clever looking puzzle was not intuitive.\n\n(Conclusion): Drawn: The Painted Tower is a picture book game for toddlers that frequently crashes, has disappointing puzzles, and will last about as long as a lord of the rings movie.\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1440432719, "weighted_vote_score": "4.994175", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "17695688", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198246137838", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1440431791, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 191}, "timestamp_updated": 1440432764, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Drawn is a great puzzle and adventure game with amazing art and witty puzzles.

When playing you require patience and smarts, but puzzles can be skipped after a few minutes have gone by (achievements are lost if you skip or don't solve them before this period of time runs out) and luckily there's also Franklin to give a hint or two (and not the easiest ones, at that!).

You solve puzzles and explore by using your cursor to hover over key points of interest and to interact with objects. There are pictures or areas within pictures and puzzles are presented with virtually no text or, at the very most, a few cryptic clues to give you a vague idea of what to do. Your ultimate aim is to reach the top. There is a trial and error feel about the game but it gives the player a decent enough workout for the brain. \n\n[u]PRESENTATION & DESIGN[/u]\nDrawn: The Painted Tower is a moody, atmospheric game which is put across immediately by its eerie main-menu. To sombre and mournful tones, a choir sings gentle choral notes in the background as if in a peaceful monastery. We also see the stone carving of Iris - the protagonist of the story - appear before us in a sad, pale turquoise colour. All of which sets a suitable tone adding to the mystery and dark nature of the game which has an almost dream-like quality.  It's more of an adventure game than a hidden object game and like many adventure games doesn't tell you how far you've progressed or how far you have to go. Although there are objectives to fulfil and it keeps you informed, there are no records kept or tabs kept on chapters. When you fire up the game, you're thrown in immediately from where you finished the previous session. \n\n[u]CONCLUSION[/u]\nAdventure games can be obscure and downright nonsensical while others can be too text-heavy or contain overlong and repetitive dialogue trees. Thankfully a few come along that seem kinder to us noobs and a bit gentler but which still manage to be challenging enough for us to be entertained. This is one such game. Granted, although there is an option to skip the puzzles (and there is a very nice hint system), I personally only felt the need to skip two which I found too tricky. \n\n5/5"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1483011093, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500891", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "28786896", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198051554398", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1483011247, "num_games_owned": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 372}, "timestamp_updated": 1483011093, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Love the game and its story.\nNot too complicated (with help of hints).\nEnjoy helping Iris! :)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1477773127, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500891", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "26300296", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197970687509", "num_reviews": 35, "last_played": 1477773002, "num_games_owned": 689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 131}, "timestamp_updated": 1477773127, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Sweet little puzzle game, simple enough to not be frustrating but challenging enough to actually have to think about some puzzles.

And for this reason, I am not recommending the game.\n\nSome of the blame for my negative feelings about the game falls on me, as I didn't look into the game and purchased it solely on the Steam store page (description, \"about this game\", screenshots and tags). The tags at the time of purchase were \"adventure\", \"casual\", \"point & click\" and \"puzzle\". My expectations and hopes were that it would be reminiscent of a LucasArts adventure game. \n\nSteam doesn't give the option of star-ratings or a \"maybe\" or \"neutral\" - If any of these were options, my answer wouldn't be a flat \"no\". If you can get this game on sale in the $2-$3 range, then yes, I recommend it.\n\nTL;DR Pros:\n- Pretty artwork.\n- Fun concept.\n- Short and light.\n\nTL;DR Cons:\n- \"Adventure game\" mechanics are severely dumbed-down.\n- Almost entirely games of fetch or hidden items, with a few pattern/number puzzles.\n- Crashed multiple times.\n\nThe graphics are nice and I enjoyed the concept of the main character's magic. \n\nHowever, the \"adventure game\" mechanics are boring and dumbed-down to the point where the majority of the \"adventure game\" type puzzles involve just finding the inventory items that you need.

In most cases, just *seeing* the item in the scene is the hardest part (don't get me wrong, some \"hidden object\" games can be fun... but those games aren't the same as adventure games).\n\nThe times that you need to combine items to solve a puzzle, and it's not made instantly 100% obvious, are few and far between. \n\nDrawn switches between this item finding mechanic and actual pattern or math puzzles.\n\nThe game also ended up crashing multiple times.
