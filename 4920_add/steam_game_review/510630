Easy to play once you get the hang of it. I manage to play and sign players just fine without spending any money on SM credits. All you need to do is win matches and leagues and use that prize money to purchase whatever players or facility upgrade you require.The only problem i seem to have is that occasionally, seeing that i play this game on different devices including the steam version and the mobile app version, sometimes the saved game would be out of date and i would therefore have to replay the matches and regain the progress which wouldnt have been transferred to the other device. Signing out and signing in again sometimes helps fix this though.  Overall i think it is a very good game, fun to play.
