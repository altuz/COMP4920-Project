Nice story, nothing special though. The puzzles are the same old, same old, but at least they come in an entertaining package. However, the HO puzzles always requiring the same items at each playthrough isn't very challenging. The difficulty level of the game overall is super low, and there isn't even an achievement for finishing it in Expert Mode, which makes it boring to a certain degree, especially for veteran players.\n\nThe lack of authenticity regarding Slavic mythology and culture is quite shocking, by the way. Among other things, one has to wonder what Celtic runes are doing in a Slavic setting.\n\nOn the technical side of things, it's annoying how, once you grab an item to use it with another item on the screen during an HO scene, you can no longer tell where the actual mouse pointer is, thus \"misclicks\" happen.\n\nThe achievements aren't too exciting and you have to play through the game a second time only for a single one (\"Choose Well\") - which then turned out to be bugged (which was reported nine months ago, yet still not fixed). So I just wasted two hours of my time playing through the game again, which felt rather tedious - this resulted in me changing my rating from \"Positive\" to \"Negative\" and will influence my future decision on buying another of your products.\n\nSpeaking of \"the route you choose\" in this game, the statement that your choices affect the story is a shameless lie. I finished my second playthrough and the different choices were of zero consequence - there is no real alternative route or ending, it is always the same storyline.\n\nErgo, I only recommend getting this game when it's on sale and if you haven't played too many of Artifex Mundi's HO games already to easily tire of the repetitiveness.\n\n(Hint @ The House of Fables: It is time to fix the bugs and also to come up with new puzzle ideas for future releases. You can't expect your customers to be still happy after playing through the exact same puzzle for the dozenth time.)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971043455", "last_played": 1498343573, "num_reviews": 58, "num_games_owned": 197, "playtime_forever": 477}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1498336704, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517587", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498345860, "recommendationid": "32742669", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Honestly I like the first one better.
