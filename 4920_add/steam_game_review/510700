The performance is poor on a GTX1070, the camera angles are not designed for VR (the entire world is tilted like in a regular desktop RTS, but in VR I can just tilt my head, I don't need the camera to be tilted already). The camera movement is very nauseating and not based on the direction you are looking. The graphics are nice and gameplay is pretty standard RTS (like original C&C level) and it's fun to see your army in VR. Maybe one day if the game is significantly improved it will be playable but at this point it's just far too early to call it a release or even early access.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025003435", "last_played": 1470858583, "num_reviews": 40, "num_games_owned": 152, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 31, "timestamp_created": 1470858836, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560605", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1470858836, "recommendationid": "24815467", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Simple but fun modern warfare RTS.

I think its rough around the edges right now but i feel really good about the dev. I believe this game is going to be really neat in due time... he is talking with players and addressing issues on regular basis so if you want to help shape the game, buy now. if you want it when it plays great, keep an eye on reviews and i will update when the game is ready.\n*update- i would wait on this product for sure, its just to rough right now, ill update when its better\n*8/27 update... i returned the game my 2 weeks was up and it wasnt ready... may try again later on", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992523182", "last_played": 1471131702, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 272, "playtime_forever": 41}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1470867094, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490220", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1472305557, "recommendationid": "24817292", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
