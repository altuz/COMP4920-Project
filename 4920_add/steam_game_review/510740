Certainly a lot of children are enjoying it.\nKeep up the development please, would love to see more animations and interactions - maybe use of the mic to call your cat over or curse !\nThanks again\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044784744", "last_played": 1498765560, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_forever": 552}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1497282660, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504505", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1497282660, "recommendationid": "32367731", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Cute little gem of a game that plays like a tamagotchi. I like the innovative way of using the controller, this makes it really unique. But the game also provides a common way of playing it for everyone who doesn't have a plush toy at hands.\n\nGraphics and sound are okay but not outstanding. Content is enough to keep you busy for a while. Definitely worth the money compared to other small VR games. Finally the gameplay is, what makes it shine.\n\nThis is surely the perfect game for your children or cat loving wife.
