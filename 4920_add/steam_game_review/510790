I did a let's play of this game last year and I was enormously impressed with the story line. aside from the bugs and kinks to work out (I found a few in my recordings, and the developer immediately addressed them) The game was pretty smooth. The battles get a little repetative as time goes on, but I belive that this only adds to the subtext. The repetition and the grinding out of menial tasks fit in perfectly with the story, and I thought it was an elegant solution to the limitations of the software used to develop the game(my roommate has the same software, great stuff, gets the job done) I wont include any spoilers, but HOLY SMOKES, THAT ENDING. As someone who has lived in the darkness of depression, every part of the storyline really connected with me. It took me to a dark place just playing the game, so I can only imagine how drained you felt after creating it! I can't wait for your next work and you have my full support!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198318469050", "last_played": 1476506265, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_forever": 366}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1486100872, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486100872, "recommendationid": "29663181", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
