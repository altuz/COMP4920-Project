Tight platforming where you take on common household items and food to collect keys. Get 5 keys and you can advance through the door to the next area. At Citadel's cheap price point it's really hard to go wrong. It's clear a lot of care and attention was put into this title. The levels are well thought out, a charming little background story and plenty of new obstacles to tackle. In my time with the game it didn't get repetitive whatsoever (there's even multiple versions of each enemy type, SO NICE WELL DONE!)\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game! 10/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970977129", "last_played": 1471473978, "num_reviews": 74, "num_games_owned": 999, "playtime_forever": 171}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1471466851, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498402", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1471466851, "recommendationid": "24980556", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A charming, well-made little platformer that brings back good memories. It's challenging but not frustratingly so. I loved the funny little cutscenes where the one-eyed computer screen taunts you as you progress through the maze. The artwork is cute and the game has a light-hearted feel overall. \n\nThe game is designed for speedrunning -- it shows your total time and number of deaths at the end, along with your best time. I completed my first run in just over two hours, which sounds about right for a two dollar game. I'm not really into speedrunning but I liked it enough to play through at least one more time.
