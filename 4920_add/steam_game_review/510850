That's its biggest appeal. If the thought of exploring the Red Planet makes your inner astronaut giddy, M2030 is worth it. If, while checking out a habitat if you spot an odd rock formation in the distance and your inclination is to say \"That looks cool, I wonder what's over there\" you'll like this game. That's the whole game, really. Checking out the marked places on the map, planting flags, and discovering unmarked places to explore using nothing but your eyes, then figuring out how to get your bulldozer sand crawling buggy over there.\n\nOther than that there's no real \"game\" to this. No fuel, no water, no resources to gather, no health, no running out of air, no combat, no alien ruins. Just exploration of an open map, getting your buggy hung up on outcroppings, planting flags and collecting samples, learning things along the way.\n\nFor me, that's what I want in an Astronaut sim. I loved Solus Project because it let me explore an alien world in VR. When I finished the plot, I really wished there was an open \"tourism\" mode that just let me explore the world without worrying about dehydrating or freezeing to death or getting sucked into a tornado. Mars 2030 is that experience and I'm digging it. I'm getting the same vibe while playing it that I do with games like Euro Truck. Crank up some tunes, hop in the rover and watch the sun rise and the shadows crawl across the land. It will probably take 10 or so hours to make the rounds and see all the sites, and as of right now I'm looking forward to the trip.\n\nThe rover is a bitch, though, until you get the hang of it. Then, it's actually fun to drive cross country. But if you don't like it, there's an autopilot to waypoints, or fast travel.\n\nLocomotion was also built with flexibility. You have trackpad locomotion with sprinting and jumping. (Bounding around in low gravity is a blast). But if that kind of movement makes you queasy, teleport to your hearts desire with a different button. Your call.\n\n(Important note: Roomscale is not officially supported. You can move from your center position and look around things, but you will clip through walls and if you look behind you'll see your body doing some very weird things. Also, if you have a HUD like while in a space suit, it will be invisible until you move back to the center point where it expects your head to be.)\n\nThe graphics and sound are excellent. I'd put the graphics and VR quality about on par with the Everest VR experience, except that Mars 2030 gives you the freedom to explore the entire map and discover things on your own. I've not seen any popup or texture issues. Everything feels solid and real - well almost. I did clip through the giant wreck of the heat shield that got ejected during landing. But everything else, the habitat, the Mars rover and the terrain are all detailed and convincing. The terrain itself is very well done. No repeating textures or procedural repitition so far. The day and night cycles are beautiful to watch, and getting caught in the open during a dust storm was an appropriately unsettling experience. \n\nSo - I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a chill exploration simulation or space geeks looking to play astronaut. It's a very polished VR experience far beyond what you'd get in Destinations. But go into it knowing exploration is the only goal - anybody looking for base building, resource gathering or alien life should look elsewhere.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "steamid": "76561197968546721", "last_played": 1506630455, "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 128, "playtime_forever": 397}, "votes_up": 29, "timestamp_created": 1501543370, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554676", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1501543684, "recommendationid": "33938126", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I guess the game is about exploring mars after a nice intro or something, but the game itself is ok, If ya wanna learn about mars and space, then this is for you, but so far its flag planting sim for me, and I still suck at driving the rover, so with it at auto pilot, its a sleeping in a moveing truck sim for a little bit, still nice to look at, but this needs a resenter button, my body gets so messed up when I get out of my chair, and its only because of the rover bit, where you stear with a joy stick", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198097112090", "last_played": 1501525771, "num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 269, "playtime_forever": 41}, "votes_up": 19, "timestamp_created": 1501526173, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518059", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1501526173, "recommendationid": "33933237", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Game isn't ready yet.

Just don't go expecting anything crazy like alien ruins or a story or anything like that.\n\nThat said, its biggest weakness is immersion.  You're supposed to be part of the first manned mission to Mars, but once you arrive at the habitat, there are no further goals, the other astronauts don't talk to you (or each other), they're always in the same place doing the same thing, Mission Control sends no further messages, etc.  You're free to come and go from the habitat as you please.  You also do everything solo without even so much as radioing the habitat every once in a while to let them know what you're up to, which is very unrealistic.  I think some banter lines for the astronauts and finding them at different places in the habitat depending on the time of day (or sol, I guess, in this case) could go a long way.  If the devs wanted to really go the extra mile, maybe throw in the occasional random task like solar array repair after a dust devil (surely some excuse could be made as to why the robots couldn't do it) or something.\n\nEither way, if you're seriously interested in Mars and/or education in general, this is a good app!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197980804400", "last_played": 1501706056, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 338, "playtime_forever": 176}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1501610691, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511762", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1501610691, "recommendationid": "33954302", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Extremely buggy and laggy.

The first few minutes of being on Mars are met with tutorials and some basics- I have to say that driving the rover was extremely cool. For me though, the graphics take the cake. Let me explain: Once I finished exploring the habitat- which is awesome by the way- I stepped outside. This is when the real fun began. I started walking around, just checking things out and all of a sudden I received a warning about a dust storm... what followed was the most breath taking thing I've ever experienced.... that oncoming dust storm was G O R G E O U S.

I've spent eight hours already exploring. Yes there are a few visual glitches and I still can't get the rover to move forward. Right, left, backwards and sideways I can do. Forward just doesn't work for me so it could be something I'm doing wrong. So I've walked everywhere.\n\nBut it was pleasant though! I walked and explored features that I might have missed simply by driving. By the way, I'm using the HTC Vive with a GTX 1060 video card. To continue: I've found all the flag markings on the map. There are twenty-four (I think) features that aren't though and that's where the exploration really gets fun. I've found four so far so obviously I haven't explored everywhere. The landscape is huge!\n\nIf you are looking for the feeling of being one of the first explorers on Mars you'll love this. It looks fantastic.\n\nIt could use a few more things like interaction with the NPCs, and something like a map that one can make notes on for future reference maybe to go back and visit for another look at something that caught your eye before.\n\nAnyway, I'm thrilled.

The superiority of the graphics' quality is complemented by an excellent choice of ambiance sound and, occasionally, music that perfectly go in sync with the scenery in front of you.

There is a handful of things to interact with (mostly rocks and the Mars Rover), no two-way conversations and no aliens to shoot.

Shadows sometimes moving with your gaze instead of the angle of the sun, your legs hanging akwardly bent beneath you and hands looking a little twisted.
