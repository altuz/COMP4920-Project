The visuals are stuning for a low priced game. \n\nVery bright and colorful.  I've had kids as young as 4 try this and kids as old as 70.  It hasn't failed to please anyone who has tried it. \n\nVery worth the 3 bucks for it, don't expect a deep storyline, or a campaign, just a nice simple shoot em up, that looks and functions great.  \n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976125667", "last_played": 1502740636, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 970, "playtime_forever": 105}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1480828225, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498542", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1480828225, "recommendationid": "28176560", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I am not sure how you could give this game a bad review... Honestly what did you expect. It is a great game to have younger  VR users squirt water at bugs. the graphics are nice and I havent seen any bugs (not the insect kind) or issues. And for you competitive people there is a ranking score board. Yes, it is mindless and takes no skill, but it is fun just like any VR game should be. If you had options to pick and upgrade guns i could see a higher replayability.
