The game comes in 3 difficulty settings, Easy, Medium and Hard. No gamemodes beyond the current one, of course, but why would there need to be?\nThe game is simply explained aswell. Release miners (basically your lemmings) from the house and go about controlling them in an almost identical fashion to the Lemmings games to traverse through every nook and crany of the map, collecting gems and other valubles which increase your highscore if you manage to successfully get them home.\n\nI bought this game myself shortly after coming into contact with the developer on steam. He was very kind and so I thought I would do my part and at least give his game a go. I'm glad I had. I had issues at first with the key bindings, but upon asking him about it, the game was soon updated to include tool-tips to remind the player of the keybindings. I have never met a developer who is so considerate of the needs of his customers.\nThis brings me on to his dedication. This game appears to be, despite what the update logs say, recieving updates (be it minor or large) on almost a daily basis. I can't deny that I'm surprised. I've genuinely been given the impression that he really, and I mean REALLY, cares about his work.\n\nMore about the game though. It plays a little clunky, I have had troubles from time to time controlling my miners but that may be entirely down to how incompetent I am at the game. I don't believe the game looks particually polished graphically and I can't help but feel like the game would have been better in early access, in the sense that the developer is planning for so many more features to be added that it almost seems like it's not quite finished. However, for this kind of game, graphics don't matter anywhere near as much as they might in other games.\nNon-the-less, I believe the game for such a small price of \u00a34.99 is definitely worth a shot (there's always the refund system if it doesn't turn out to be what you're looking for), there's a lot of fun to be had. Perfectionists will love doing the same levels in order to get the highest scores possible and casuals will love to pop on, play a short game and come off again. It really does feel like a new lemmings game but with more replayability, so if you were looking for more Lemmings or just a game that brings something completely different to the table unlike the usual over saturated shit on steam, you may be pleasantly surprised to find that MANIC MINERS might tickle your fancy.\n\nI really, whole-heartedly, recommend taking a look at this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071624442", "last_played": 1475371415, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 251, "playtime_forever": 64}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1472236925, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503524", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1472236925, "recommendationid": "25166815", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[h1]\"Its like a raw diamond which needs to be cut and polished...\"[/h1]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=873444184\n\nAs one of the less people who played this game maybe a bit longer (next to the main Dev of course), i guess it would be time now to write a review about this game - next to this i waited a bit before i write the review since the dev added a lot new things and stuff into the game and those might would have changed the review ever i would written it.\n\nSo after he also told me its now a good time to write one, i do it now.\n\n[h1]if Lemmings meets Boulder Dash, thats what the dev is saying and how you can explain the game...[/h1]\nActually in the Screenshot i made, You might can see that the dev & I worked a bit together. Said that, I have to say here that the Dev is really a nice guy and maybe one of the closed \"down to earth\" guys/devs i met so far (Konami, Capcom, you guys should learn something from this guy, srs!).\n\nSaid that, he also asked me to review the game.\nSo first, i bought the game (i didnt got a free key) coz i wanted the game. Now i have it, played it and can gladly review it.\n\nAs the dev already uses the main line \"If Lemmings meets Boulder Dash\", thats kinda the gameplay this game offers.\n\nYou have a Number of \"Miners\", which looks a lot like the classic Lemmings (if you compair them you can see a bit changed but still, they REALLY looks like the original Lemmings) which also act like the Lemmings:\nThey walk around till they hit a object and turn around, falling off cliffs & like, drown in water, die if they explode and like.\n\nAlready with that in mind, you get this \"Lemmings vibe\".\n\nBut where is the \"Boulder Dash\" part now you will ask?\nWell, the \"main part\" (i use this word with caution, you will see later why) of this game is to use abilitys with this said Miners in the style of Lemmings to dig around the map you choosed from, getting Gems/Jewels and like, avoiding ice, boulders which can fall and crush your Miners, explosivs, gas-pockets and other things which can easy destroy/kill your Miners.\n\nIf you got the said Gems/Jewels, here begins the other part of the game: Get the Miner back to your Home with this Gems/Jewels in one piece.\n\nSo its not only a \"How deep can you dig\" Game, its also a \"How can i dig and be Save to come home\" Game.\n\n\n[h1]Plays fluend...but it feels like something is missing...[/h1]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885327142\n\nAs i got the game, I already loved it but a lot stuff was missing or made the game kinda feel \"unfair\". I shortly after talked with the dev and i gave him some ideas like:\n- A Jewelbag a Miner loses if he dies so another Miner can collect the Bag with all the lost Jewels.\n- Coins which give you some cash instandly (unlike Gems/Jewels which have to be brought back home first).\n- More Weapons like a Bomb for laying, Lasers for destroying explosives or other obstacles and a flamer for digging out a smaller area\n- Mini missions which gives you a small challange.\n\nOf course, the dev had some own ideas and thrown them in (its his game, after  all) and just with this \"little things\", the game makes a whole lot fun. The Jewelbag makes it not so hard if you lost your Miner on the way back home, the Coins let you buy some abilitys wile youre digging and the Weapons work more as tools (at least that was my idea) you can use if you need them.\n\n\n\n\n[b]But i have to be honest.[/b]\nIt sure is a nice game and i played it for a long time as i got it and as the Dev build in all the new ideas and co but after a wile it got a bit \"boring\" and now i play it more \"ones in a wile\". Again, i really [b]love[/b] the idea and the game, mixing 2 great games from not only my childhood.\n\nThe problem i have (at least) is that this said \"main part\" (here i come back to it) has not really any kind of \"goal\".\nIts not like Lemmings where you actually have to save a number of Lemmings or Boulder Dash where you have to collect a number of gems and find the exit.\n\nIt sure mixes the gameplay very ([b]VERY[/b]) well but it misses the side of \"complied\" something:\nYou dig around with abilitys which you also have to buy again after using a said ability. You get money by either collecting a coin or bring back gems/jewels back to your home. If you bring said gems/jewels back to your home, you buy with the money you get from them said abilitys and go digging, returning into the circle ones again.\n\nIts not like it is a bad idea, the problem is just it misses something \"why\" youre going to dig in the first place.\nLet me explain that:\nIf i buy me a pickaxe [b]just[/b] to dig around and get a jewel, bring it back home, selling it [b]just[/b] for buying myself [b]another[/b] pickaxe.....i guess you see what i try to explain...\n\nIt misses a kind of \"goal\" to be honest. Something like you \"have to do\" or \"upgrate\" or like. I said in my review what Lemmings & Boulder Dashs goal was. Those might not fit for this game but i could image like you have to build a city with that money or upgrate your Miners with it - a bit like in Terraria or games like...(not in the gameplay)\n\n[h1]Are the Miners worth digging?[/h1]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=871526315\nSo is the game really worth playing?\nI [b]do recomment it[/b] since it is a good game and a good idea. Next to this, you can talk with the dev (who is begging for feedbacks to make the game better (in a good way)) about ideas and he might add those. The game plays nice but you will end like me maybe, playing it a bit longer at the first time and ending up playing it ones in a wile. Thats actually not bad but as i already said, \"Its like a raw diamond which needs to be cut and polished\", meaning that it lacks of a goal why youre going to dig around at the first place. It is really nice and it can keep you busy (i played it ones 3 hours in one sitting, forgot the time wile i did) but after a longer time you might begin to ask yourself the same question, where is the goal behind it. \n\nI will say, for 5 bucks, it really is a nice game and for that what you get you actually cant complain about a really nice old-school digging game. Still, as i said, something like a \"reason\", a \"goal\" why youre going to dig would be really nice.\n\nIf i would give it a score it would be a 7 our of 10 since its nicely made but missing a \"special something to make it whole\".\n\nAnd at the end for this review, here a fanmade trailer (so yea, i really like this game)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=872949889", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038310096", "last_played": 1499350394, "num_reviews": 158, "num_games_owned": 612, "playtime_forever": 874}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1489768851, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1490495452, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495581", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1489771759, "developer_response": "Thank you, again !-) I think the \"missing bit\" would be a human opponent.
