This isnt minimal, its categorically bad design.\n-Difficulty can be very variable, and the difficulty level can be the wrong way round due to the way timings line up better. (Also, the easy ending seems to me to be the best, but perhaps thats deliberate so most people see it.)\n\nWhen it works, its a pleasure to play and the pacing of fairly rapid single screen levels, along with the changing geometry and sounds keeps you retrying and progressing. Just expect more than a couple of spots where the annoyance mounts up way too fast to be fun.\n\n[Note: I bought this on sale at \u00a30.55]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197996964816", "last_played": 1494728283, "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 1496, "playtime_forever": 472}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1494729396, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1494729396, "recommendationid": "31737870", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
