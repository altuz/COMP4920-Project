It isn't worth 3 dollars. Every enemy clips through walls and the ground (granted, they are ghosts but it looks stupid) The attack combos are nothing special and you'll end up just mashing the number buttons randomly because none of it really matters. Honestly I got this game out of curiosity and that has been quenched after about 8 minutes of gameplay.

The game looks fairly decent, it plays smoothly, and the art style and gameplay go well together. The gameplay is a bit lacking, given that there are only Wave and Endless modes, no missions, no alternative graveyards(levels), and no multiplayer support (these are the biggest issues, it seems it will get old quick, and does, but its good in bursts for some time killing, if you were to add these things, replay value would skyrocket in comparison to what it is now.) The clipping of the ghosts feels kinda cheap, they can go through the ground at any point and fly right up to you, this is mostly seen on a slope where they have to compensate for your positioning, there are quite a lot of trees that are mostly off the ground, which looks stupid, the writing could really use improvement, and there is a lot of issues climbing the terrain at certain parts with too much of a slope. The game doesn't appear to have controller support either, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but controller support is often nice for more laid back play seshes, and I think it would add to the fun with this game being fairly simplistic; it's more a game that you will want to sit back and play rather than get up close and personal with the WASD and mouse. The combinations/element type idea was good, but seems poorly executed. The ghosts only seem to have a weakness to their opposing element, but don't really seem to be immune to others, i.e. they all seem to take the same damage from all mushrooms except the type that is their weakness, it would be better to implement a sort of immunity or resistance to other elements to make it more difficult. Other that that, the game itself isn't meant to be a huge thing, I mean, C'mon, it is $3, don't go in expecting a whole lot, it is supposed to be a small game, so quit complaining about your $3 game, if you're complaining about something that cheap, you probably just want to vent, there's been plenty of times you've wasted more than $3 on something you didn't like. And for what the game is on paper, you should expect it's more of a time killer type game that you will play in shorter  bursts than most games, but it succeeds at what it is trying to be, a decently fun, 'spooky' little FPS. Now I've mostly had negative things to say about this game, but it's $3 so I'm not complaining and with some improvement, this game could become a lot better. I will get more in depth with the review once this game has some new features, but for now, if you're looking for a cheap, simple, decently fun FPS to shred some time with, this game is for you!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198062030709", "last_played": 1484717123, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 345, "playtime_forever": 68}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1484690379, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505916", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1484691296, "recommendationid": "29325309", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a first person shooter with a magic casting gimmick.
