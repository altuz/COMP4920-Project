Looks like it took inspiration from \"The Forest\" but its alright. This reminds of a gamemode on Garry's Mod Stranded. \n\nIt has some sort of memory leak issue. With that there also seems to be a resolution issue. I would launch windowed mode but would always stretch to fullscreen.\nIt could use some ambient/menu sounds.\nResource requirments or objects would be nice.\nHunger/thirst etc go down a tad to fast.\n\nThat being said I would recommend this game if those few things can get fixed. Its a nice little survival game that is very alpha but its a step in the right direction.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198016485091", "last_played": 1471493254, "num_reviews": 57, "num_games_owned": 306, "playtime_forever": 41}, "votes_up": 31, "timestamp_created": 1471494263, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450551", "votes_down": 54, "timestamp_updated": 1471494263, "recommendationid": "24986078", "votes_funny": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is surprisingly really fun.
