I loved the point-and-click adventure element, along with the typical visual novel experience of making choices that affect outcomes. Solving the mystery was very fulfilling. I felt like the game wasn't trying to hold my hand through it, but actually allowed me to piece the clues together myself. \n\nI never had an issue with the previous artwork in Woodsy Studio games, but I'm sure others will be thrilled to see the artwork improvements. It looks much more polished and smooth. I thought the CG images were beautiful. \n\nOnce again (like in their other games), they did an excellent job of including diversity. People of color and queer characters are never tokens, but people who have goals and agency in the story. I was also glad to see polyamory discussed again, as there are very few games (or media in general) that show polyamorous characters in a positive light. One of the strongest themes of the story has to do with accepting others for who they truly are, no matter how much society doesn't accept someone. If someone wishes to live their life a certain way, and it harms no one, and makes that person happy, then why have prejudice? Why spread hate?\n\nI absolutely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story, a good mystery, and making choices that matter in a video game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067189801", "last_played": 1471921505, "num_reviews": 91, "num_games_owned": 248, "playtime_forever": 3144}, "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_created": 1471919129, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540033", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1471919129, "recommendationid": "25083948", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[h1]Short Synopsis:[/h1]\n\nFeatures: English language only.

It\u2019s a fresh breather from all the Anime stuff. The art style is consistent and well done. You can really see how much she improved from her last games.\n[b]Backgrounds[/b]: 9/10 Professional made, pretty and won\u2019t distract you from the story.\n[b]GUI: 6/10[/b] Simple, not distracting, get\u2019s the job done, but I still wish for more shortcuts like saving game or something.\n[b]Voice acting: 8/10[/b] Good voice acting overall - with some inconsistencies.\n[b]Soundtrack: 10/10[/b] The soundtrack is amazing and builds up the right mood. Mostly Electronic. It was made by the dev. Very original. No 30 second loops. Tracks are up to 2 - 3 minutes. The developer was nice enough to put it up as DLC. I wish more developer would do this. If you want a demonstration you can find her music to one of her games here:\nhttps://jennygibbons.bandcamp.com/album/quantum-conscience-soundtrack\nNote: Quantum Conscience is a pure science fiction game and much darker than this. So the music from Echos of the fey is a bit different.\n[b]Story: 8.5/10[/b]A really good mystery VN, that won\u2019t treat you like an idiot. Just a few minor inconsistencies.\n[b]Setting: 9/10[/b] While it\u2019s hard nowadays to come up with something completely different, I\u2019m very glad that Woodsy studio managed to make something original and gripping.\n[b]Characters: 10/10[/b] No kidding. I love them. You have your rivaling police detective, your responsible partner but they just feel so real and not cheesy at all.  ( Btw.

This prize is more than fair.\n[b]Final verdict: I would say a 9,5/10[/b] A clear recommendation. If you like a good story or you are a VN fan then this is for you. The only thing I don\u2019t like is the shortage of keyboard shortcuts and having only 5 saving slots (maybe that\u2019s intentional.)\n\n[h1]Lengthier description - personal thoughts:[/h1]\n[i]\"Humans aren't supposed to use magic. That's what the Leshin say, at least. They fought a thirty year war to stop us from using our machines to draw energy from the fey. It didn't work. In the last days of the war, a few Leshin radicals staged an attack on the Fey reactor in the city of Onigrad. They vaporized most of the city and killed thousands of innocent civilians. It ended the war, but not like they hoped. Horrified by the actions of their leaders, moderate Leshin overthrew their government and sued for peace. The Immolation of Onigrad changed everything. It changed the relationship between our two people, bringing an end to the war but deepening our mistrust and hatred. It changed the landscape of human society, sending small city-states running to the growing Empire for protection. And it changed me, because I was there. Humans aren't supposed to use magic, but now I can. I just can't control it very well.\" [/i]\n\nWith this we are introduced into the world and history of the Echos of the Fey. A perfect opening and introduction to our main character Sofiya. \n\nSofya Rykov is a private investigator with a penchant for drinking too much and avoiding unpleasant serious personal stuff. This fact is made very clear in the beginning as she laughs away her traumatic experience in Onigrad. I becomes very apparent that she isn\u2019t just a one dimensional character \u201cwho just loves to have fun\u201d. Her actions and behaviour makes sense. She has her own packet to carry and life wasn\u2019t very gentle to her. Thus she has her own voice, just like the rest of the cast. \n\nAnd that\u2019s what impressed me the most. Nearly every character has a sprite - side characters aren\u2019t just some talking sprites that gives the player information. They have their own motivation, their own thoughts and thus their own ethics and morality. They aren\u2019t just some blank characters who the MC can influence like some Bioware characters. They will act on their own manners. That doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t completely influence them. This VN managed to flesh the characters out so well that they feel like a real person and everyone has something interesting to say. Never have I meant such interesting side characters in VN who are right now on the market. \n\nUnlike most other VNs the decision we make here matters. It\u2019s rare to see a Vn where choosing which decision to pick makes you sweat. It will have consequences and you are expect to clean up the mess you made for the most part. You simply can\u2019t save anything at once and can\u2019t satisfy everyone. Once you picked a path you should stick to it.  That sounds more disastrous and depressing than it is. I just want to warn people that the game doesn\u2019t take making tough decisions from you.\n\nThe setting is a nice mix between magic and Steampunk, with a hint of Final Fantasy. It\u2019s unique in it\u2019s own way without being obnoxious and the superb writing really helps. The writing and the worldbuilding is consistent and is really, really well done. The art is also very consistent. Everything feels fresh since the different Art, the GUI, the backgrounds and the music is made by the developers. No more Kevin Macleod music that has been used to death. All in all, it makes it very easy to get immersed into the game and it\u2019s world.\n\nPlaying detective is fun, too. I should explain to you the game mechanics. The game is a mix of a Visual Novel and a Side-scroller. Dialogs and decisions are done and presented in a typical VN manner (Dialog box on the bottom, speaking Characters in the background, option boxes in the middle of the screen, see screenshots). Then there is the part we can walk around Vodotsk. We can enter shops and other locations by walking around the town and clicking on the doors or talking to people on the streets. The game has a map, an inventory and a quest log. We can walk around town as Sofiya or in our cat form. This helps with our research. People who play adventure games will feel at home here. And newcomers can easily catch up. The game is not to hard, but not to easy. The game will let you know on what to do so you will never feel lost, but also manages to not treat you like an Idiot. You are still expected to read and comprehend what you just read. Otherwise solving the case will be hard for you when you are expected to piece together all informations.\n\nUff, I hope I wasn\u2019t rambling too much and thank you for reading.

There is an option to turn off voice acting, but I chose to leave it on and just bear with the bad parts.\n\nThere are inconsistencies / plot holes due to the nature of being an interactive fiction novel, but nothing major that breaks the story.  Example:  I mention the name \u2018Tiatha\u2019 to a character called Luka.  In the same conversation, Luka mentions Tiatha as well, and all of a sudden my player character is absolutely surprised Luka knows the name Tiatha.  Of course he knows the name; I just mentioned it 45 seconds ago!\n\nThe art is decent.\n\nThe music is excellent and I believe this is what really pulls this game together.  No crappy loops like some VNs have.  Most loops are seamless; some can be detected but you really have to be paying attention.  The music really sets the tone for a number of scenes.  Despite all the flaws I feel this game has, the music really saved it for me.  In fact, this is the very first game I have ever purchased the soundtrack for.\n\nFinally, I would like to mention this VN has quite a bit of sexuality in it.  In fact, I think that\u2019s the whole underlying theme.  Intentional or not, this story definitely feels like a hidden message of what it\u2019s like as a transgendered person not being comfortable in their own skin, and how society views them.  Is this bad?  Of course not, but, if you are not comfortable with the subject of sexuality, this VN may not be for you.  It kind of comes out of nowhere, and then it\u2019s everywhere, if that makes sense.\n\nOverall, I feel this VN was worth the price and will most likely be picking up episode two when it becomes available.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013720439", "last_played": 1472428765, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 409, "playtime_forever": 541}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1472440856, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510330", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1472440856, "recommendationid": "25220777", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "After playing this at a convention, I couldn't wait for the Steam release!
