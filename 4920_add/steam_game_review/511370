I felt compelled to write it since I would love to see more than just the final forthcoming 4th level.  \n\nI have played many different bow and arrow games and I think this is definitely one of the easiest and best to control.  The aiming mechanics are spot on.  The game looks great and feels very polished.\n\nIt is an on rails shooter but one that definitely gives you a workout. There's no lack of enemies coming from every direction around you, above you and below you.  And, the game is loaded with lots of items to hit for points outside of its enemies.  \n\nIt moves at just the right pace so as not to cause locomotion sickness.  It's environments are varied and of decent length.  The end bosses, the 3rd in particular, are huge.\n\nWhile it does seem a tad short, with the share number of enemies and loot to hit and multiple difficulty levels, it does have replay value.  $15 seems a fair price especially since there's still one more level coming.  This is one of those games that I really hope outlives the final level.

Highly Recommend \n\nVisuals are great with an India meets the Incas vibe! Play is intense and well balanced with loads of targets to shoot + you can dodge incoming fire! \n\nGame is challenging and rewards skill with a high score table so you can see how well you stack up to others. I\u2019m writing this review after about 1 hour, thought I was doing well but obviously missing loads as no where near top scores.\n\nThe moving room vr platform works well \u2013 very comfortable and rewards the player for moving about to shoot around obstacles and dodging enemy fire. The moving platform means that enemies are always appearing from new directions with new rewards coming into view or being obscured by the environment.      \n \nBow implementation is accurate and the hit detection is spot on \u2013 you can fetch standard arrows from behind you or choose to use 2 types of special arrows within easy reach. I would like to see accuracy rewarded a little more so hope this is in a future update (if so I will update my review).   \n  \nI\u2019ve had the VIVE from launch and bought most everything that\u2019s available (and any good) \u2013 I can honestly say that this ranks in my top 5 games so far, in short its worth the money. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041228054", "last_played": 1482898398, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_forever": 148}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1471908684, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503110", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1471908684, "recommendationid": "25082257", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "https://youtu.be/gWjDGQ0x0-Y\n\nArchery on rails... with collectables!\n\n\nThis game is going to tickle that collectable itch you may be needing to scratch. There are items scattered throughout the level as you progress slowly moving along on your floating piece of earth that you can shoot to collect. Those items are tallied up at the end of the round and it feels like an Infamous/Spyro/Crash Bandicoot type of collection system as far as collecting all the hidden things goes.\n\nGraphically it looks pretty good. It quite a bit like Vanishing Realms in its cartoony design and I think right now that's what looks best in VR. We haven't gotten to the photo-realistic stuff looking very photo-realistic yet.\n\nMy main complaints are the angle of the bow and the fact that collecting gold is meaningless. There's nothing for me to do with the gold once I have it and it's not persistent through gameplays. It's only purpose seems to be score related. Outside of that there's no incentive to earn more gold.\n\nVR Graphics 9/10\nVR Gameplay 8/10\nAudio 8/10\n\nLocomotion N/A\nMovement by rails only. Floating peice of earth below you to combat motion sickness. Room scale to dodge projectiles.\n\nReplayability: Pretty high if you're a collector or a completionist\n\nBottom line. If the gameplay looks interesting and you're willing to buy in on the promise of more content then pick the game up now while it's $15 as the devs plan is to raise the price when exiting EA. They've already made good on adding one new level and they plan to add enough content to justify the $15 price tag.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983689849", "last_played": 1474824639, "num_reviews": 92, "num_games_owned": 333, "playtime_forever": 73}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1474869501, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502696", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1474869501, "recommendationid": "25705611", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is quite fun.

The small issues i had personally with the bow model are probably borne of playing other archery games but it did feel more natural the more i played. Regardless, the bow dynamics enable fast and accurate shots and are better than most Vive archery games imo. \n  Wasn't expecting an on-rails archery shooter to be among my favorite games after some pretty big releases recently but definitely worth the money (even more so if you can pick it up on sale).\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002872077", "last_played": 1502770054, "num_reviews": 75, "num_games_owned": 214, "playtime_forever": 115}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1483588957, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503908", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1483588957, "recommendationid": "29025015", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ok as you can see only 1 hour of game play so far.

No real idea what the money does for you other than score as I just haven't gotten that far but I will keep playing to see.

The first 2 levels are all the game currently has and there hasn\u2019t been any word in about 2 months which is a little worrisome but what\u2019s done looks and feels great. You can tell some time was spent on this game so far and it\u2019s very polished when compared to other VR titles. Not sure how the game will wrap up in only 4 levels as there is a slight story and I thought I was collecting or protecting 5 fire gems\u2026  not sure if I\u2019m missing something or not but 5 gems and only 4 levels doesn\u2019t add up to me. Also, I feel like there is going to be too much stuff in the game for how short it could end up being. Do we really need 3 different bows, 6 different arrows and a store for a game that may only be 4 levels long (once completed)? Maybe, but it\u2019s hard to say at this point. As it stands, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth a solid $10 bucks but once it\u2019s done I can see it going for $25, maybe more\u2026 If you\u2019re into the bow and arrow games and you can get it on sale, then I would definitely grab it.
