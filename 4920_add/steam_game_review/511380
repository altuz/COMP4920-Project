You move on a 2-dimensional grid and collect \"jello\" tiles, which destroy the grid tile when you collect them, meaning you cannot backtrack. Furthermore, the tiles come in a variety of colors. Collecting all of a particular color will open any corresponding \"locks\" in the level. This is the basic ruleset of the game, but the game iterates on it with some interesting gimmicks for each set of levels.\n\nThe game is really nothing more than what it appears to be on the surface.

Pozzo Jello Crusade being the most current release of the studio has clearly not obtained the attention it so deserves.  ToG has a clear understanding of the superior Japanese market, yet vanilla-brand \"gamers\" still occupy themselves with the likes of NBA 2k16 (which clearly breaks the \"one-sports-game-a-year\" rule of the vidcon industry, and can't even ever top the other b-ball games ToG themselves have released).  Jello Crusade incorporates the max-talented, DOOM-MURDERHEADS, gz and laz, and clearly reiterates the talents of ToG's own Nobuo Uematsu as lead composer.  I see my humble self as aligned with TRUE DOOM-MURDERHEADISM, so my opinion is one you can obviously trust (as if my point hasn't been proven fact already).  Pottsu~o no zer\u012b no j\u016bjigun is clearly one of the years best releases and can only be topped by the hopefully soon released Queklainn no Vengeant.  \n\n- Truckpump", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198132047288", "last_played": 1480559358, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 203, "playtime_forever": 244}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1473055684, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505045", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1480309048, "recommendationid": "25359292", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "good puzzles.
