It takes a while to figure out how things work, but I never object to that in a game, I like a challenge. \n\nThe weather and seasons are great. I absolutely love the ambient insect and animal life, even though some of them startle the blorp out of me occasionally. Staying alive through winter actually feels like an achievement, especially if you underestimate how cold it is going to get (and are a real cheapskate like me, who don't want to use your resources on making shoddy clothing that don't last terribly long). \n\nThere are plenty of enemies to fight, but you can also avoid them if you just want to focus on surviving the world. Unlike games like 7 Days to Die, enemies do not constantly seek you out, so your base seems to be safe enough. The creatures in the game are also very believable. They look good, move well (I am VERY impressed with how the deer flee if you try to hunt them). The hostile ones have made short work of me, particularly when I want to \"just look a little further, even though my health is at 24%\". Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back. At least if said cat had a statue of ressurection placed in some nice spot.\n\nThis is also a game that sucks me in, alllowing me to forget my troubles when I require it. I may think I've been playing for a few minutes, but suddenly, hours have passed. Which is invaluable when I have a bad day, one that I need to get through with a minimum of fuss.\n\nSPOILERS:\n*Unless you live in the desert, save your smelting and baking for the winter. You're going to need that extra heat then anyway.\n*Find a good pine forest to go lumberjacking in, in order to get enough tree sap; you're going to want those water barrels.\n*When the mists come, stay where you are, or go straight back to your base. You'll get hopelessly lost if you're not careful. When it's dark, you can at least see the horizon and keep track of your position, but in the mist, all you can see are your closest surroundings.\n*If you don't live in a dense leafy forest, you will want to harvest clay during your first summer. Midsummer may be the only time water level is low enough.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198031216298", "last_played": 1498158560, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_forever": 5448}, "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_created": 1497085547, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533931", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497085655, "recommendationid": "32312396", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Definitely one of the better survival games out there, recommended!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198022815390", "last_played": 1505987731, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_forever": 3357}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499342303, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489616", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1499342303, "recommendationid": "33309298", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
