But short. But nice. But short. I spend 2 hours to go through. Including an hour of replays, while i tried to understand the structure of campaign. The thing is when you press New Game, it does not mean you loose a progress. You never do. To Continue the Game is possible if you left it on a half of the battle and turned it off. Next, you don't have an easy, medium and hard campaigns. You have one level with three difficulties and two levels with medium and hard only. So, there's actually only three maps. Ridiculously short. It was a brief guide. Now, back to the game.\nGame mechanics and strategy is pretty unusual. Don't listen to people comparing it to the Creeper World. It only looks like CW, but much simplier and territory connected to the resources. Looks like tower defence, but there's no predefined ways for enemies. It is more like Titans but with calm, relaxing atmosphere and graphics.\nI vote up, hoping for more levels.
