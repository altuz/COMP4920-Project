I saw that this game is tagged \"Oculus Rift\" so I bought it.\nHowever, I was quickly upset because: \n#1 the graphics of the controllers are still from the Vive ones, not Oculus ones\n#2 the buttons doesn't respond as it should so we can't play the game \nFor example, I can target anywhere with the controllers rays but the guns are not moving and are firing only straight ahead or we can't launch any rocket in the tutorial so I'm stuck there.\nIf steam is tagging this game with oculus, it should first verify that the game is actually updated for oculus+touch and working similarly as Vive version.\n(Or maybe the steam download button is giving me the Vive version, not the Oculus version! I don't know)\nSo I asked for a full refund.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198380183373", "last_played": 1492263027, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 87}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1492377079, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510501", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492377079, "recommendationid": "31187013", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
