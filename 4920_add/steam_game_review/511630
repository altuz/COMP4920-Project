I have to admit I found myself rather charmed as the game went on - through the plot Max has his ups, his downs, and his moments where he's the same as any child his age. You're not going to find a mechanically complex or challenging game, since it's really more about experiencing Max's inner world and quirks specific to him - this is a good thing, though boss encounters will require you to be a bit more attentive with healing than other fights. There was one element I was actually quite surprised to see - [spoiler]very tenderly and gently given the age of the protagonist, the game discusses the risk of self harm and suicide in later years due to difficulties in coping and self management that can have their roots even in those early years of life.[/spoiler]. I respect spine like that.\n\nThis is also very clearly a game with a lot of love behind it. That normally isn't something I get to say in a review, not like this anyway.\n\nI also have mucho respect for attributing each and every song and sound effect used properly and visibly.\n\nWell done.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983307273", "last_played": 1503379923, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 903, "playtime_forever": 283}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503410284, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500195", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1503410284, "recommendationid": "34416385", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
