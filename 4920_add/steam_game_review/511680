The core gameplay boils down to repetitive button mashing, depth and customization is only toe-deep, enviorments are bland and cramped, enemy variety is almost non-existent, the camera is a mess, animations are pretty janky... Maybe there's a good Fate novel tucked away in there, but to go through the horrible musou-style drivel to get to it is complete lunacy.\n\nPerhaps this is the cynic in me talking, especially since I wouldn't consider myself the biggest fan of this franchise, but I'd like to think that, at least in Nasu's original 2004 Fate/Stay Night foray, this series used to mean something. Servants used to be a really big deal, Noble Phantasms and especially Command Seals were trump cards you only used as a last resort. There was an interesting story going on in Fuyuki, with properly fleshed-out characters behind the scenes of the Holy Grail War. When conversations happened, they had real weight behind them most of the time, questioning the reader on how far should you take your objectives before you start to hurt yourself and others around you. \n\nNow those elements have lost their meaning entirely. Servants are merely pawns, meant to execute the same repetitive actions over and over again, while being dressed up in Barbie-esque DLC costumes. Command Seals and Noble Phantasms are things you spam mindlessly in order to get to your objectives faster. The story makes Fate/Grand Order's plot look really promising, and that's a feat in and of itself. Your character may as well not even have a 3D model, complete blank slate that he is. Conversations bog down to downright nauseating flirting between you and your Servant. And just to rub salt on the wound, the game runs like a snow plow in windowed mode, even though it looks as simple as an upscaled PSVita novel.\n\nThe Fate series is dead, it arguably peaked at Fate/Zero, and died not a minute after Fate/Kaleid Liner came out. There have been some interesting experiments like Fate/Extra for the PSP and what could have been the Fate/Apocrypha MMO, but not even Nasu himself seems to know what to do with the franchise, introducing magical girls, time travelling, and numerous novelized spin-offs that all lead into their own parallel universes. It has become analogous to the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.\n\nFate needs to be dragged to the back of the shed and put out of its misery. It has had enough to drink, and this game, in my opinion, is empirical proof of that. I feel the worst for fans of this series, not because I want to take away their enjoyment of this game, but because they deserve much better than this.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 149, "steamid": "76561198051141972", "last_played": 1506846549, "num_reviews": 41, "num_games_owned": 267, "playtime_forever": 149}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1506848370, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491601", "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1506898560, "recommendationid": "35373062", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Saber= Babe-er", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198119258621", "last_played": 1504400501, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 203, "playtime_forever": 422}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1504683126, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494675", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1504683126, "recommendationid": "34771073", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
