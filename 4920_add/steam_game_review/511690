One of my favorites in VR.  Very clever and immersive gameplay.  This game doesn't give me motion sickness\neven in the \"follow\" mode where you're flying behing the duck which I use quite often.\n\nclick the trigger to teleport to the duck and hold it to follow works very well .  You find yourself teleported to some wonderful vantage points.  Speaking of which the graphics are gorgeous but a bit performance heavy.\n\nThe game is very immersive in VR.  Definite keeper.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063942102", "last_played": 1494603590, "num_reviews": 127, "num_games_owned": 185, "playtime_forever": 54}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1494604121, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1494604121, "recommendationid": "31704447", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
