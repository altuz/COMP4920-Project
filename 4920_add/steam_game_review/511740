Really its just a silly way to translate the rail gun shooting into an anime environment. Instead of zombies, robots, or soldiers, its your typical anime school girls. Intead of receiving injuries, love letters are shoved in your face. Instead of bullets, its the \"cupid angel\"'s gun that shoots love energy. Instead of dying, the girls stop in their tracks in a sort of state of euphoria.\n\nMore on the theme\nSome people can't stand certain elements of anime shows, comics etc.\nThe humor, the presentation, and a lot of the content, from character behavior, speech, situations etc., is completely anime flavored. If you typically watch, read etc., you'll recognize this and not blink an eye.\n\nExamples: A female character may be firing dual handed guns, and they cared to include a slight movement of her chest as part of the animation. Or, your good ol' girl in an embarassing situation lets out a drawn out scream.\n\nIf you can't stand those things, it may rub you the wrong way.\nHaving mentioned voices, some people don't care for female anime voices either.\nYou won't have a choice here, all in game enemies and characters are female, and speak this way.\n\nGameplay\nExactly what you'd expect from a rail shooter.\nWhere it goes weird goes back to the theme meld.\nIn addition to shooting people quickly, building accuracy combos, and skill shots for collecting items, You also build up a sort of super bar that throws targets into a dream fantasy screen where their specific weak spots, now become zones you rapidly bombard with projectiles until they get overloaded with euphoria.\n\nIn addition, you're given a choice of how the story plays out with who you claim is your true love in the beginning of the story, and there are story events corresponding to this that take place in the form of minigames, with more of the same sort of flavor. \n\nThe final element thrown into the mix is attributes. Story dialogue is available according to your character's stats, which are determined initially by a character type, then modified by items you buy in between levels, and who exactly you use your \"super move\" on. Maintain these appropriately to the story path you've chosen, and you're golden.\n\nAll this is what creates a different experience.\nA railgun shooter, built on the frame of a date sim, narrated like as a pseudo visual novel.\n\nThere are a couple of elements that really don't exist outside fanservice purposes though.\nExample: A completion gallery of all the characters/enemies in the game, which has their names, intro, and their body measurements. - Which are filled in by you zooming in on them in game to measure them.\nUnderwear is partial visible pretty frequently, and panty shots are pretty common.\nAnd then of course, the in game mini game locations and their objectives, the stages being all over a school filled with girls, visiting the pool, locker rooms, things like that.\nThere is DLC that modifies the in game character chest size. That should tell you enough.\n\n\nControls wise its nothing too complicated.\nThere is keyboard/mouse support as well as gamepad.\n\nSound wise it isn't that special. \nRepeated phrases of things like \"I'm happy\" and stuff like that when enemies \"die\"\n\nThe voice acting for the story elements isn't bad though. \nThe music was pretty good as well.\n(Sheesh, I can't get that theme song out of my head...)\n\nOverall, regardless if you agree with some of the themes, some thought was put into making this and it shows.\nWas definitely different. I don't see a ton of replayability though, outside of just wanting to see other endings. The VN element just barely keeps it fresh in that regard.\n\nYou're pretty much getting what you think you're getting. But its hard to look \"under the hood\" with how its presented to you in the screenshots and stuff. To me, the experience was like a mini VN, or almost an OVA. Almost. Comedy romance themed of course.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197968458879", "last_played": 1505845687, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 525, "playtime_forever": 462}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505286038, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510204", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505286038, "recommendationid": "34914582", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Came for the \"on-rails shooter\" tag, stayed for Maya, who is Best Girl. And then it was the other way around. [spoiler]Midori and Kumi are fine too.[/spoiler]\n\nI guess the original balancing was designed for a handheld console where you aim with analog sticks, and it wasn't tweaked or adjusted at all when being ported to PC. Which makes the game extremely easy if you play with mouse, even on the \"Expert\" difficulty. A speedhack helps after you've discovered all the interesting stuff and are just finishing up the achievements, but otherwise it's easy enough on its own. The achievements are not luck based but require a fair bit of grinding. Also getting a few bad ends, which is kinda lame.\n\nThe translation only covers text. That means the original Japanese voices are kept and honestly, I doubt I'd be able to play this any other way. I felt like I was missing out a bit, not knowing what the secondary characters were saying in gameplay, but it's still a lesser evil. The quality of the translation is solid, with only an occasional typo or artifact.\n\nSadly, the game has some serious crashing issues. Of particular concern is a crash at the end of the second level, when you're supposed to pick a route. By trial and error I managed to find a workaround that works on my machine, but some people are locked out entirely. Supposedly the publisher is poking the developer to work on this [i]right now[/i], but there are no hard promises that anything will come of it. If you're worried about this, buy it, rush through the first two levels, check if it crashes and consider getting a refund.\n\nIs the game worth getting? If you're able to look past the embarassment or outrage that society has likely conditioned you to react with when interacting with content like this, I think you'll find there's a lot of fun here, and some genuine feels. The writing, the stories, are cheesy but also lighthearted and genial. I've been away from weeb stuff for many years, for reasons I don't entirely understand myself, but the past few months I've slowly started going back and this game - for me - was a prime example of why that is a good idea. Even so, I bought it on sale and I recommend you'd do the same. 37 EUR is a triple-A price in my book, and there's only two A's in Gal*Gun: Double Peace.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961951106", "last_played": 1505649706, "num_reviews": 141, "num_games_owned": 845, "playtime_forever": 2700}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1505662374, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509710", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505679808, "recommendationid": "35026291", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Thanks for \"panic button\". it's saved my life from my mother.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 295, "steamid": "76561198029987125", "last_played": 1506777528, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 235, "playtime_forever": 386}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506764658, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505902", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506764658, "recommendationid": "35330356", "votes_funny": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Decided to buy on sale.\n\nIf you enjoyed classic rail shooters and arcade games from the 90's and early 2000's you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe controlls feel good ((if you are playing with a controller))\nThe story is mediocre but enjoyable. 7.5/10\nThe music is pretty great!\n\nI reccommend picking this up on sale, it has a decent amount of replay value.\nOh, and fanservice.

Great entry in the genre and good enough to obsolete a few older nineties rail shooter of a military/zombie variant I had lying around.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "last_played": 1505008305, "num_reviews": 1973, "num_games_owned": 4956, "playtime_forever": 74}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1504998213, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500317", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1504999934, "recommendationid": "34848670", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "this is legal right ?", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 76, "steamid": "76561198040669778", "last_played": 1505761996, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 146}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1505149044, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505821", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1505149113, "recommendationid": "34886510", "votes_funny": 11, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "BEST GAME  KAWAII AF 11/10 RECOMENDED, FUCK MY LIFE", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 3269, "steamid": "76561198073521263", "last_played": 1506655813, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_forever": 3375}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505645147, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499109", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505645147, "recommendationid": "35020185", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ekoro route final crash\nNot a first crash, but now i can't just get rid of it.

Wouldn't pay anymore than that tbh. I'm deciding to not refund because it's worth that, but DEFINITELY NOT full price... If you want to drop $40 on tiddies go buy Senran Kagura Estival Versus, the gameplay is actually fun whereas this game is like Sonicomi mixed with Senran Kagura, but with less fan service, and Sonicomi was only $10 retail but the story/gameplay was a lot more engaging than this game. The girls also are not as sexy as either of those games. I'm not saying this is a bad game, but it's not worth $40. If you think you might like it, wait for a 75% discount. The DLC options are a complete joke/obvious money grab. Like I said... if you want to play a solid game with nice anime waifu's, Senran Kagura is your best bet. Senran Kagura Estival Versus 10/10, Sonicomi 7.5/10, Gal Gun 4.5/10. Maybe this just isn't my type of tiddy game... lots of other people seem to like it. The game play is just rather boring imo, and the fan service is not enough to compensate.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198218242873", "last_played": 1505021461, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_forever": 53}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1505100556, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495217", "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1505383247, "recommendationid": "34876002", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "maya is now my waifu", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 132, "steamid": "76561198313220863", "last_played": 1506827407, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 20, "playtime_forever": 2691}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505025088, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498824", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1505025088, "recommendationid": "34854634", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}]}
