It's great that I can now play them on Linux (well, assuming the others succeed in their Greenlight campaigns). I like to play on my TV with my Steam Controller, which works a treat. The devs have even listened to customer feedback and implemented an alternate display mode that shows all the buildings, rather than sticking the a direct port from the mobile version (which I was already fairly happy with).

I have had no issues with bugs, not the prettiest graphics but is functional. A tutorial helps get you going.  Are there better renditions out there of board games absolutly.  But I typically play them because I want to buy the physical copy.  This allows me to see if it is the kind of game that I would invest 40 - 50$ for a physical copy. \n\n7.5/10 I think that the graphics could be a bit sharper and the early game is very repetative, I think some type of mechanism to allow for a bit of variety at the start up building buidings would help make the game great.
