The developer has listened to feedback and is adjusting accordingly. I don't want to update my review every build, but I will say that he has addressed concerns in a very timely manner. Text is being fixed, tutorial space is fixed, user errors are being compensated.\n\n**Original Text**\n\nPros: This game is worth its main price just for the singleplayer story mode/intro. It's clever and establishes that the developer is putting in effort for this project. It has a few gamemodes to mess around in, which is more than I can say for quite a few VR games out right now. Although I only have half an hour of playtime, I can see myself spending multiple hours down the line, especially if multiplayer catches on.\n\nCons: The game should have a boundary indicator to say how much space you need to play it. I have 2.1x2.1 meters, and I was BARELY BARELY BARELY able to reach some items in the tutorial mode (and some items I couldn't pick up at all!). Everything should be reachable within a 2x2 meter playspace. The graphics look nice from what I can tell, but there are too many jaggies and they are very very obvious on the wave-based gamemode. \n\nNotes: The text in story-mode needs to be centered and shrunken more. It's a bit too high up to the point that trying to read it is difficult unless you push your Vive RIGHT against your face, it will be blurry and annoying to read (it's not illegible, but it could be better).\n<<SPOILER>> [spoiler]in story mode, when I got to shooting the robot, I went against the game, and decided not to shoot it. I wasted all the ammo on myself as an avant-garde choice, but ended up being stuck in the room after wasting all the ammo. I need to have a method to gain more ammo if I stupidly waste it on myself.[/spoiler]\n\nConclusion: Buy it. Try it.

I hadn't heard of the game before the developer took to the Vive subreddit to give away a few keys, and even though I didn't win one, I bought the game in the end anyway considering how reasonably-priced VR games are so few and far between currently.\n\nI've tried a few game modes so far. I've heard good things about the story mode, but I haven't been able to check it out just yet. I can say that the wave-based shooter, while simple, was pretty fun and frenetic to play. Target practice is cool as well.\n\nAs others have said, some of the mechanics are a bit reminiscent of h3vr - you load your paintball guns and prepare yourself before starting certain levels and modes. Obviously this could be good or bad depending on how into that sort of thing you are, and I wouldn't be surprised if the dev added a way to skip that preparation stage at some point - that said, I quite enjoy loading my paintball guns and filling my inventory with paint grenades before a run.\n\nConsidering what I've paid for similar VR experiences, I'm going to be quick to recommend this  based on what the future may hold for it alongside the very reasonable price. I look forward to seeing where it goes.\n\nEdit: What I said before still applies, but I'm going to have to, at least temporarily, reverse my recommendation. It's been months since there were any updates, and the premise of a lot of what I said was based on the fact that future changes were promised and I gave the dev the benefit of the doubt to continue development and fix issues.\n\nIt still *is* fun, but it's simply not finished - and considering the lull in updates, I'm not sure if it will ever be finished. If you can get it for a buck or something, I can't say it's not fun for at least a little while, but I wouldn't make a decision on the possibility of future development.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970902789", "last_played": 1471062648, "num_reviews": 37, "num_games_owned": 1876, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1470866943, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505906", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1488669376, "recommendationid": "24817257", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
