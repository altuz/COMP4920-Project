Yeah we get that you made it \"ironically\", but at least make your joke consistent.\n\nLet's start from the good part. The quality of the background CG is amazing. I like the vibrant color they use for the trees, the sky and the water, it is very refreshing to the eyes. The problem is, that kind of style does not fit the image of North Korea they are trying to present. It makes Pyongyang look like Singapore. Clean streets, shiny buildings. I have never been to Pyongyang, who knows if it actually looks like Singapore in real life, but if they want us to think North Korea is a poor, dysfunctional country, the CGs are not helping to that end.\n\nThe writing is full of contradictions. Our main character is supposed to not know much about North Korea, but from time to time he cracks jokes about the Great Leader. Jokes based on the western media's info on the man - fat, likes basketball. And our MC manages to mistake Pyongyang as a suburb of Seoul. Yeah, right. Much of the humor in this game comes from the North Korean girls making mistakes in English. The jokes work well with Jeong, who is a fairly advanced English speaker. But when it comes to Eunji, I had to pause and think \"what is going on here\". Eunji flips between a fluent English speaker and a caricature of Asian people speaking English, and it's not clear if our MC is speaking Korean or English, and the result is I am confused. Besides, the writer uses way too much 4th wall jokes he just comes off as lazy and proud of it. At some point I just stopped thinking and clicked and clicked and laughed at the next tsundere gag that comes along. The ending was a huge disappointment - i thought it was going to lead somewhere, but then cue the accordion music. \"What the fuck\" indeed.\n\nShould you buy this game? It depends on what you expect. If you are looking for \"ironic\" jokes and anime tiddies, go for it. I came for the anime, so I guess it was money well spent. Still, it would be better if the game was more consistent overall, both in writing and visuals.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198343463742", "last_played": 1505314813, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_forever": 288}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1505310566, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503203", "votes_down": 15, "timestamp_updated": 1505310566, "recommendationid": "34919911", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "steamid": "76561198074953849", "last_played": 1506020405, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 69, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1506021263, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495944", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1506021263, "recommendationid": "35111806", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "There is no god", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042638419", "last_played": 1494648972, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 317, "playtime_forever": 364}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505843020, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494953", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1505843020, "recommendationid": "35069213", "votes_funny": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "so this game was good and i like kim in it he was sining katty parry plastic bag witch made me sad and cry give 2 thums up if u cry 11/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198140190228", "last_played": 1494895855, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 98, "playtime_forever": 44}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505358152, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469563", "votes_down": 20, "timestamp_updated": 1505358152, "recommendationid": "34941263", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
