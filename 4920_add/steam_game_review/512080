I almost fell over a couple times too. The main problem is there is only one level and it just seems to loop through the same part of the game over and over. If  you die you can sometimes start over, but sometimes it just freezes and you need to shut the game down and start it up again (also the text switches from English into Chinese). It's fun, but not for the $10 price tag.
