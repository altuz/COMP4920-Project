Menus/User interface is bad. Music toggle but no music. When you blow up something it takes a frame hit sometimes.  I find the single player campaign to work is fun and the online actually works for co-op not sure how well as I did not see any pickups drop also it doesn't identify the 2nd player in game from host I only knew the person I was playing with was in lobby because he said something in the chat box. I didn't try the vs yet I assume it would work o.k. Local mp or maybe even online vs may ahve issues with where tanks spawn sometimes where enemy tanks spawn next to each other not sure if its just particular maps or random spawning?  If you don't mind using mouse & keyboard controls and odd menus then I actually do recommend the game for its sp campaign. I feel the gamepad support to not be a smooth experience it is ok. I had issues where it wasn't working and then later it was. Not sure if it was a windows update or what but most other games xbox controllers worked fine so.. Game is in more of an early access stage due to odd menu layout etc. If your expecting a polished no bug experience I don't recommend. If your looking for a tank game with online co-op  a decent single player campaign and decent mouse/ keyboard controls then I do recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197990318149", "last_played": 1503043223, "num_reviews": 55, "num_games_owned": 429, "playtime_forever": 428}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1482475430, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504490", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1489821391, "recommendationid": "28551172", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "kinda reminds me of Tank Battles.... but with meh controls and hit detection that is questionable...\n\nAlso is kinda glitchy and very touchy.... felt like a waste of my money and time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042065891", "last_played": 1499839684, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 78, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1499839793, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499839793, "recommendationid": "33472639", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I tried and I [b]really[/b] tried to play this game.\nI dont know [b]why[/b] but as soon as I open the single player missions menu or the multiplayer missions menu, the game begins to lag [b]very heavy[/b] (just image the game starter counter is normaly 3 seconds but insteed its 30 seconds...).
