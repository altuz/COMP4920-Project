It mystifies me how something so basic, cheap and nasty, so lacking in grammar and such an insult to the English language not only does well but well enough to warrant a sequel?! \n\nIt\u2019s fun for about 2 hours if you\u2019re a twit. If you understand the basics of English language and punctuation you may get a \u00bd hour out of it. On principle I wouldn\u2019t pay full price. Its $2 and even then I felt somehow dirty for having bought it. \n\nFor 49 cents, maybe if you have friends to play against. For $2 or slightly more than I\u2019ve found better bargains.  Cards of Cthulhu was more fun, but not by enough that I\u2019d consider actually keeping one or the other. It\u2019s honestly like watching paint dry. \n\nLet the Metacritic score of 64 be an early warning sign the game just isn\u2019t that much fun.  For $2 you could buy a Big Mac and that would be better value and at least when you crapped it out, you wouldn\u2019t feel quite as sick as if you had wasted 2 hours of your life on this filth. \n\nI\u2019ll give any game 90 minutes to impress me.  If it doesn\u2019t wow me, I get rid of it.  If it has no replayability it has no place in my catalogue.  You\u2019re better off waiting for PVZ: GOTY to go on sale.  At least that\u2019s still fun.  Unlike this smelly old cum rag of a game. Avoid it. Really.  Every minute I wasted, I could feel my brain cells dying horribly. \n\nOr maybe, on some level, the game exists to insult the player by sheer virtue of its rape  of  the english language. I feel intellectually violated having spent any significant  amount of time playing this so-called game.  Its not fun, its not creative and its certainly not well designed.  Stay away from it.  Play something fun.   \n\nSucks doesn't even begin to cover it.  \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198408671944", "last_played": 1504526032, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505477404, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497232", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1505477404, "recommendationid": "34970277", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}]}
