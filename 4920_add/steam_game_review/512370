I've only played about an hour of the game but it's a cool little 2D beat-em-up with a nice story. I have some issues with the controls via keyboard, which seem like the inputs are delayed before the character strikes, but maybe if I connect my controller to it I'll have a better time with it. It is not bad, I do recommend the game if you love 2D fighting games & dig unique artwork.\n\n6.5/10 for me!!!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198318238695", "last_played": 1478788089, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_forever": 247}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1481075815, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491299", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1481075815, "recommendationid": "28229052", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Its really gay dude never should have bought it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067219045", "last_played": 1478582583, "num_reviews": 74, "num_games_owned": 177, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1479201142, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467015", "votes_down": 16, "timestamp_updated": 1479201142, "recommendationid": "26612431", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
