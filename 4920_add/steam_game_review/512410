I purchased it because of the waving hands motion locomotion and I really like that a lot but game itself is poorly made, buggy, crashes constantly and not challenging. I've been waiting to see how it progresses but there has been no updates or news. The melee weapons are totally useless when even dead zombie parts hurt you when get near them... and that's if you can even pick one up and not have them get caught on anything and lose it as you walk around and swing your arms. The guns are all either too weak or too powerful and if the map floor is dark you cannot even see where they are.  When the game has allowed me to progress without crashing the waves just seem to get longer but not more difficult. I have found places where I can just stand still and repeatedly shoot my feet with the cannon and that kills any zombies in range.  Then there are the little things like the blue laser pointer between levels and you get the hovering message that you died when you die AND when you complete a level. I paid way too much for a demo of the locomotion. \n\nI will update if things improve but I feel now that I wasted my money and waited too long to review.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971327630", "last_played": 1474202495, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_forever": 149}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1475234162, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515226", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1475234186, "recommendationid": "25779742", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I'm writing this review after testing this game at its first day of early access, and I hope that you devs improve this a lot!\n\nRight now I don't recommend this game because it's just not enjoyable. Why?\n\n - Although the movement system (swinging your arms pretending that you are walking) is intuitive and funny, I almost fell down a few times because I lost my ballance due to the motion sickness. I'm feeling really bad right now.\n\n - The game is really buggy and unpolished at this time: the bodies of dead zombies damage you as they were alive. Also, it's difficult to pick up weapons, because it seems that they collide with the floor in the pick up \"animation\" and that cancels the action. Melee combat is undoable: sometimes the game doesn`t recognize when you hit a zombie with a melee weapon, and when it does, the weapon vanishes, as it were a one use weapon. Also, bodies of zombies get buggy and greatly flicker, hitting you from the distance.\n\n - Other \"minor\" issues, like: There is no visible health metter or something that tells you how much life you got, but you actually have a persistent life level, and can pick up medkits that heals you.\n\n - Guns are held in a bad angle: If you grip the motion controller in the intuitive and comfortable way, the weapon will be pointing almost at your feet. You have to hold the controllers in a weird way if you want to shoot forward.\n\n - There are a lot of weapons, but many of them feel the same: A normal gun, a gun with slight lower fire rate buy maybe a bit higher damage, a normal gun with a muffler, a gun that fires a little faster... \n\n - Black weapons are invisible in a dark floor.\n\nInstead of feeling like a badass zombie killer, I felt like a dizzy boy trying to avoid mortal bugs, like the bodies of every zombie I killed, while I struggled to not fall when moving. I'm sure that you will improve this a lot and will result in a great experience (specially for the iron stomach vrers), and I hope this review helps you.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198015399816", "last_played": 1473466105, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 144, "playtime_forever": 17}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1473467436, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510142", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1473467698, "recommendationid": "25434765", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "this game could be a lot of fun at some point, but right now there is too little to do, and too many bugs and/or odd behavior.\n\nthe bugs i could live with, i'm sure they'll get fixed. but if this game remains simply a wave based zombie shooter, i don't think it will ever be worth $20. \n\ncheck out gameplay/reaction footage [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey8w-IGnyps]here[/url]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey8w-IGnyps", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198068873418", "last_played": 1483928178, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 51, "playtime_forever": 79}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1473574264, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503144", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1473574318, "recommendationid": "25456753", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Here's my first time gameplay video and my review below it:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dhuX2nx1WS4\n\n\nTHIS GAME IS VERY FUN! \n\nI originally submitted a post stating I didn't want to buy the game until the reported crash issues were fixed. After some thought I figured I'd try it out for myself instead of trusting the small amount of reviews and am glad I did.  \n\n \nPros: THE LOCOMOTION MOVEMENT IS SO MUCH FUN!!! Also I never ran into any issues where it made me sick. I love the variety of weapons in the game! The physics are hilarious! Although caused by a bug if you throw a weapon at a zombie it will tend to continue it's momentum and bring the zombie with it (as seen in the first few seconds of my first time gameplay video) which provided me with bunches of lol. There is a nice variety of Zombies and weapons to destroy them with. The levels are koo lookings and the game runs very smooth with really no framelag that I remember. I was bummed when Unturned didn't offer VR support aside from a level builder; while not on near as large of scale this game gives me that experience. \n\n\nCons: I played it for approx an hour and did experience about 3 crashes. I noticed the first 2 happened whenever I tried to picked up the magnum looking pistol. Once I didn't try picking that up anymore they gameplay lasted significantly longer. There are issues with the Zombies where you will take damage from them if you make contact with their body on the ground after it is dead. Zombies will sometimes keep coming after you after the heads are blown off. There's also a bug where a Zombie or 2 will spawn underground and remain stuck there stopping the ability to continue to the next wave. In addition to this, there is not a way to quit the level and return to the remain menu (at least not that I could find) without just fully closing out the game through the Steam VR interface. \n\nWhat I'd like to see: \n\nAside from the current issues; i'd love to eventually see co op added to the game. More interactive levels would be awesome too (i.e. being able to go inside buildings and destroyable debri). Being able to barracade yourself in would add to the fun. Maybe even a dedicated level (like a grocery store or abandoned house) that requires you to build barricades on the possible entrances and hold off zombies as long as you can. Difficulty levels would be neat too adding larger waves of zombies with each level of increased difficulty.   \n\nSummary: \n\nThe game definitely needs some work but is still very fun to play! For the amount of content it offers I feel a $10  - $15 pricetag might draw in more of a crowd. I do not mind supporting games which I enjoy though so for me $20 for this game is cash I'm willing to part with and really look forward to seeing the future progress for this game! I highley encourage you to check out my video! I go through each level using a viarety of weapons the game has to offer.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197963322624", "last_played": 1474422454, "num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 351, "playtime_forever": 53}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1474492767, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496474", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1474492922, "recommendationid": "25625985", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Was hoping for a bigger play space , I wanted to like it , It reminded me alot of what I thought VR for unturned was when it was announced.But the game just crashes way too frequently , wasn't able to get in for more then five minutes on about ten different sessions.I refunded , might re-considering buying when future updates are out , the game does look pretty good overall the but constant crashing , and this weird bug I had when I picked up weapons and they'd get picked up completely reverse and unusable killed it for me.\n\nI'd reccomend it , but in the future not currently.\n\n\nURL for video first look :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUExcFfzaEo", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197998657707", "last_played": 1473447340, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 240, "playtime_forever": 25}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1473498746, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493101", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1473512751, "recommendationid": "25439883", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Well, this game looks & sounds pretty cool.
