You can run around in the overworld and randomly encounter monsters to fight, pick up treasure, etc. Theres also an arcade mode for continuously fighting and gaining experience. I'm much more interested in the overwold and RPG elements than just another wave shooter, so I'm looking forward to future development there. Looking off into the distance of the overworld showed some interesting stuff I'm excited to check out once my arms recover.\n\nThe menu and level up screen is pretty good.

Who doesn't want to punch a few baddies and blow up some robots?! I really like where it's going. For a demo I think it's pretty fun for what I got. It's a rpg style with few bosses and lots of fun magic spells to choose from. For how much it is I feel I got my fun's worth. So far my favorite is fireball.  Oh also the wall spell is good for people like me who like to cower behind walls and throw fireballs at your impending doom. I like to hide behind the wall so I can throw fireballs at the other baddies. OH also very important!! Make sure if you don't have anything super punchable near you if your gunna falcon punch the running dudes!
