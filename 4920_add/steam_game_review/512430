graphics\n+ Adorable sprite work\n+ Does not bash or stereotype Trump\n+ Amazing backgrounds\n+ Soothing, nostalgic-esque music\n+ Kebab removal\n+ Fast-paced\n+ Addictive\n+ Extremely challenging for people with poor motor skills (like me due to autism)\n+ Your worst enemy is a spastic camel, or three, or ten, CLYDE GET AWAY FROM ME THIS INSTANCE\n\n<h2>CONS:</h2>\n- Controls are unwieldy and lack options to change what keys do what\n- Jumping is difficult to control, making many obstacles very difficult to surmount, but this is part of the challenge I like\n- Pressing left and right moves Trump an exact space, making fine control and aiming difficult\n- When using the mouse, you can only shoot by clicking in one corner of the the screen, and as such, you often fail to shoot when you want to if you forget where your cursor is\n\n-----\n\n<h2>LONG SUMMARY:</h2>\nThis game is a cheap, wholesome, side-scrolling addition to any Steam Library, and ESPECIALLY for any Trump fan. The artist who designed the game made painstaking effort to make the game look beautiful, elegantly mixing pixel work into stunning backgrounds. You can see the love put into this game.\n\nThis game is NOT for Trump-bashers and Hillary voters (unless they have an open mind).\nThis game is NOT for those who are impatient. Be ready to try again and again and again, always failing and restarting to get it right. The satisfication is amazing when you clear that part you struggled.\n\nI am proud to give my stamp of approval on this adorable little game. It could use some work in its controls, but the gameplay is solid and I am absolutely in love with the graphics. I normally don't care about graphics, but in this game, it really adds to the experience.\n\nFor the price it sells at and for a bit of difficulty with the controls, I have gotten my money's worth, and will gladly be decked by a camel again. -and again.\n\n-and again.\n\n-and again.\n\n\n\n.....-and again.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044093003", "last_played": 1500231640, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_forever": 91}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1484017502, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498688", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1484017502, "recommendationid": "29154438", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "MAGA", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993698871", "last_played": 1478746233, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 230, "playtime_forever": 1352}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1478676200, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497322", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1478676200, "recommendationid": "26499991", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Bad game.
