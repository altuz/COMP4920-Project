This one kind of sucks though.\n\nIt's not as relaxing as the original. It's wonky as hell when it comes to puzzle completion. As other reivews have said some levels require luck for the blocks to land how you want them or it will just throw the block forwards at you because the physics engine doesn't really know what it wants to do. There is very little consistency in this game. \n\nTry the first one but I'd pass on this frustation of a physics-puzzled-nightmare", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198208078171", "last_played": 1496793272, "num_reviews": 185, "num_games_owned": 256, "playtime_forever": 134}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1496473122, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500713", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496473122, "recommendationid": "32145875", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Surprisingly fun. I got this expecting it to be okay but it's actually very neat.\n\nI originally got it because it was cheap and had nice looking blocks in it. I wasn't expecting to want to play as often as \nI have been. I throw it here and there and do a few levels, it's great. Very casual style but done well.\n\nI could easily see this as a mobile game, but unlike most this actually works well on PC.\n\nYou basically pop the blocks and try to get the white one to land on the platform for 3 seconds. There's physics in this game but also you need to sometimes use speed in order to complete levels. Very nice game\n\nFIrst impressions video / gameplay\nhttps://youtu.be/XmFlS2L80bU\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games, especially physics based ones. Also, if you like Jenga this is similar in a way.
