It's not complete and so dont buy it expecting a deep game just yet. It's fun in current state and the devs have it written in the early access box that it's in \"very early stages\" so if you buy it then feel ripped off because it's not even near done then you have no one to blame but yourself, and also just give it some time and I'm sure it'll get better since the devs are very responsive and are always working on improving the game.
