However, I cannot work out how the dev thinks supply and demand works..\n\nIt's good game - and you cannot grumble at the price = FREE. But let\u2019s have a go. (At grumbling, I mean)!  I think this is a great game and I give it a positive thumbs up, it's just that I noticed (what I think) are non logical things happening in the trading system. \n\nI could be that maybe I don\u2019t understand the game, (I even have doubts about my own sanity), but I think it's fair to say I do understand how these things work; because I play tonnes of trading games, both in the PC world and in RL board games etc. And have done all my life, might I add!\n\nSeems simple enough.. You see a low price ( in green ) at a port for some commodity like Sugar and take it to a High Price Value port. (in Red).  = Logical.\n\nBut - the game gives you special missions \u2018commissions\u2019 too, but when you take the commission e.g. a trader in 'X' port is waiting for Sugar to be delivered, When you - buy the stuff and go to some ports there must be a glitch - because it sometimes says, you delivered the goods to the wrong port?\n\nOr even - before you buy goods - after accepting the commission. e.g. I'm in port 'A' and see a request for Cotton at Port 'B' and I can see it is for sale at a cheap price at port 'C' - I accept the mission, then go to port 'C' to get the goods and that's usually where you fail.. So - I don't understand what the Dev thinks the term 'Trading' means..\n\nI don\u2019t even have the goods yet and maybe even travelled empty to get the goods, so why would it say I\u2019ve delivered to the wrong port when I don\u2019t even have the goods in the first place?\n\nTime is a big issue in this game- so building out your base facilities to generate goods to sell is your best way (I think currently), go make money in this game. Then buy ship - (I have not got my shipbuilding working yet) ;-(\n\nI enjoy the ship battles, but my advice currently, is to always check to see that you are not outgunned in 'The Pirate'. (In reference to - I love to play \u2018Assassins Creed: Black Flag\u2019, but the battle mechanics are stupid in Black Flag, I can attack a couple of Man-o-Wars and faster escorts, - attacking a whole fleet and have them on the ocean floor in no time!  - Not so in The Pirate! )\n\nWith my misplaced false sense of security from Black Flag I went into battle after battle against military ships, even going up against a single Brig with two ships a Schooner and a Ketch as heavily armed as you could be. I got totally annihilated every time!  This will take more strategy - perhaps I just have to outgun the enemy two for one?\n\nGood game, Good Game. Get it - Cheap at half the price - right?", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069262805", "last_played": 1488786481, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 60, "playtime_forever": 1472}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1487864814, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516522", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487864814, "recommendationid": "30121449", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Having put a little over five hours into this game, I have to come to realize what prevents this \"good\" game from becoming a \"great\" game.\n\n\"Then why the hell did you give this a thumbs down if it's a 'good' game?\" You might ask.\n\nWell, i've yet to find any bugs, and the gameplay is for the most part pretty solid. I'd even say the gameplay if pretty quick. However, i'd also have to say it is a little too quick at some times, and this drive to have \"fast gameplay\" seems to me to be pretty ironic at times.\n\nHow battles start in the game is pretty straightforward; all the ships spawn in a \"coastal arena\" type of setting, with all the ships being within sight of eachother. What's wrong with this formula however, is how close this spawn in can be. Sometime's you'll spawn facing eachother at a fairly far distance... sometimes they'll spawn to the side of you at approx. double cannon distance. \n\nOh, and they'll also spawn directly behind you, and even in between your ships. \n\nWhat kind of captain would, before starting a battle, allow the enemy to sail BETWEEN his ships and then PUT HIMSELF AGAINST THE WIND, while having five other enemy ships within a cannon shot of one another. I mean, for god's sake, i'd swear the pirate that sailed into battle during the loading screen was hammered out of his mind. I kind of get the feeling of getting \"quicker into the action\" but for gods sake, the wind negates this! For example, when you're chasing an enemy into the wind and it causes you to spend five minute chasing them before you're in cannon shot range: It's at these times that the wind mechanics go from \"cool additions\" to \"aggrevating annoyances\" And when it comes to your friendly AI ship intelligence; you can tell they're hammered as well. \"AVOID THE ENEMY\" = \"Sail into the land, get yourself stuck, and then continue to take broadside bombarbments untill you sink\". It's rage inducing!\n\n\nTo summarize, the trading, sailing, and leveling mechanics are fun. Overall this game is pretty good. What ruins it for me however, is the purely mindblowing battle spawn locations, and the aggrovating chase into the wind that serves no purpose. It's at moments like these that all other aspects of the game are forgotten, and you feel nothing but a sense of dissapointment with what WAS a good experience.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042054306", "last_played": 1485637885, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 133, "playtime_forever": 337}, "votes_up": 27, "timestamp_created": 1485639031, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515360", "votes_down": 18, "timestamp_updated": 1485639031, "recommendationid": "29550639", "votes_funny": 6, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great game,  \nJust 1 thing I hate that you have to pay in-game to unlock everything.\nI rather pay 10$-20$ for a full game with everything unlocked from the start.
