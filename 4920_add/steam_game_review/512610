I really enjoyed the range of recipe difficulty. Also, IT'S AN OTOME GAME! (Enough said.)\n\nNeutral: Cookie-cutter plot. (Pun intended?) \n\nCons: The music can get a little repetitive (I much prefer the special event music at the end of each route,) grammatical errors abound, and I find the main character completely unlikeable. It also takes AN EXTREMELY LONG TIME to accumulate enough points to progress the story and collect more recipes.\n\nTL;DR, if you want to learn how to cook while playing an otome game (and don't mind the stares you get from your flatmates as you flirt with 2-D Japanese boys in the kitchen) this will be right up your alley!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198150865780", "last_played": 1502207649, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 398, "playtime_forever": 494}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1484941801, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510981", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1484942140, "recommendationid": "29382261", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Listen, just go onto google and find japanese cooking recipes online. That's what I was looking for with this and it just wasn't quite what I thought it was. I thought it would be more like cooking mama or something but there's no real gameplay, you just listen to a conversation with very sparce diologue choices. A few spelling errors as well, but these weren't too distracting as it seems to have been translated. \n\nOverall, if you're looking for an interactive story about a girl learning to cook, this is a good game for that. If your actually looking to learn how to make japanese dishes, I would advise a quick google search instead of spending the $5.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198092461078", "last_played": 1473310866, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 154, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 76, "timestamp_created": 1473310609, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503428", "votes_down": 79, "timestamp_updated": 1473310609, "recommendationid": "25406434", "votes_funny": 23, "voted_up": false}]}
