I'm going much easier on this game than say, Final Fantasy. There are multiple reasons for this such as the game having a lower budget, being made by not as experienced developers, and the game is only $0.99 at the most. So yeah if you guys think I'm going too easy on it then I'd say get over it.\n\nPros - The graphics and music are nice. The worlds aren't grey and lifeless, they have color and make me feel like I'm in an actual world rather than a dull boring game. The world is expansive with numerous places to go and different paths you could take. It's not linear, but not too non linear at the same time. I also love the fact that you can choose the main characters class at the beginning, it really makes me feel more involved in the gameplay factor rather than forcing me to be some generic warrior class in the entire game. Boss battles are also pretty fun since it cna sometimes get intense when one of your guys are about to be knocked out and you need to keep them alive since they might have a spell that's the enemies weakness.\n\nCons - While boss battles are fun, normal battles are a bit boring. They also happen way too much when it comes to random encounters. While the world is fine, the dungeons are not, since they are these way too large mazes that make you want to tear your hair out due to all the random encounters. The story is also pretty bad wiht a generic chosen one plot that makes no sense, but I can look past that. There are also some typo's in the game but they're not too bad.\n\nOverall the game is a mixed bag for me. On the one hand I think the fact that this game is only $0.99 excuses it from some of its flaws like the plot and typo's, but flaws like random encounter rates and boring battles really drag this game down to painfully average. After I finish this game I will move on to Final Quest II and see if that game is any better.
