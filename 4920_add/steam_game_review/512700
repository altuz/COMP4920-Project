Doesn't support joypads so stuck playing on keys, although there seems to be a jopypad configurator when you shut the game down but it looks complicated & shouldn't be needed. The art style looked appealing on the screen shots but low juddery fps at low res spoils any chance it had. The audio also is bad at times like it was recorded off something & has distortion on some music & voices even though some of the voice acting sounded okay. \n\nWanted to like it but it runs & sounds terrible with no simple joypad support. If it ran smooth at 60fps & supported 1080p & 1440p etc native graphics in either 4:3 or 16:9 with native XBOX joypad support it might be okay. As it stands I can't recommend it at all.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198064216727", "last_played": 1482490468, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 234, "playtime_forever": 17}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1482491034, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1482955386, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500925", "votes_down": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1482491034, "developer_response": "UPDATES - NOTES TO GAMERS. \n16:9 is the dimensions worked and tested on just as you can see in videos. However we have encountered the ocassional 4:3 dimensional squeeze on few other computers tested on which is usually remedied via the display settings - so it should fully fit your screen. You could also make sure secondary monitor (if you have one in your setup) is not interfering. On that not, we have listened to comments and included many higher resolutions and also joypad configuration to help you. As before, all you need to do is plug in your USB joypad (not tested on XBOX joypad), PS4 joypad or any PC joypad and it should be ready to go. The controls are very simple to pick up and play and that's the idea we had.  We're sorry that the game does not run at 60fps opposed to 30fps but it is still a smooth experience. Maybe next game. Sound and framerate runs very well on our 9 year old stress testing dedicated PC and so we believe you'll have a more than decent time running the game. Thanks and you can expect more content and updates for the game in near future. Have fun!", "recommendationid": "28556925", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
