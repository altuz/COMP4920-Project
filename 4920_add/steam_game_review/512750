Movement and controls are awesome, the graphics are cool, you really feel like you are on the moon (I can tell this, because I know, of course :-) )\n\nThe shooting is not yet perfect, though: When you move, the rockets drift away, because the dev forgot to add the vectors of your movement and the movement of the rockets themselves (as they are shot by a moving 'ship'), so it feels like they are drifted by strong wind. Maybe a laser gun woud be better to simply avoid this issue.\n\nBut anyway, once you are in this game, you really understand what VR is for. This on a flat screen would not make sense.\n\nWe played it with the whole family and the kids (6 and 8) still struggle with the controls but everyone enjoys hoovering arround. And of course I am hunting best times, which is quite challenging.\n\nSo compliments to the dev and a clear recommendation to buy. It is a lot of fun per dollar.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019035889", "last_played": 1504457207, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 152, "playtime_forever": 313}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1492368203, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502978", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492368203, "recommendationid": "31184418", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
