You want a review without any nostalgia for puzzle games of old? Here you go: Quern is freaking awesome.\n\nThe island is gorgeous and huge, but it never feels overwhelming. The game does a great job at subtly directing you towards your next objective. The puzzles totally hit the sweet spot for me. Great mix of object interaction puzzles, clue deciphering, and good old fashioned logic. The puzzle difficulty will no doubt have you leaning back in your chair, arms folded, for a nice think quite often, but there are almost no instances where you'll think to yourself \"that puzzle was unfair\". Each puzzle is also elegantly designed and will have you bursting with glee at every \"ah-ha!\" moment.\n\nOne aspect of the game I did not expect to be drawn into was the plot. Quern is a very unnatural place where its inhabitants don't age or require nourishment, and to them, time outside is frozen. The location sets up many interesting questions about the importance of mortality and the corruptability of man, in addition to being the source of friction between two interesting characters, both steadfast in their beliefs but neither with the clear moral high ground.\n\nThis isn't just a game for Myst lovers. This is a fantastic play for anyone who can appreciate a quiet moment, amidst some very pretty scenery with the waves crashing gently in the background, to get the ol' brain working and figure through some sweet puzzles.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 90, "steamid": "76561197971154053", "last_played": 1506300717, "num_reviews": 37, "num_games_owned": 306, "playtime_forever": 2313}, "votes_up": 17, "timestamp_created": 1505192205, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536032", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505192277, "recommendationid": "34895180", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The puzzles were very logical and fun to solve.

It is a beautiful game and very much follows the Cyan idiom of worlds that have just the right combo of realistic and implausible details to force you to think how the game wants you to. However, the storyline felt a bit forced at times. The puzzles were a mix.
