This game has some major issues that needs to be addressed before I can recommend it to anyone. A minor one is that it doesn't launch properly from Steam VR. You can get around this by launching it from the desktop view of Steam VR. A major one however is the sound effects that is either missing (or doesn't trigger for some reason) and that sound location is totally off. You'll find yourself looking behind your back because the noises seem to come from that location when they're not. Another issue is tracking of controllers that is delayed (despite overall good framerate) and breaks immersion.
