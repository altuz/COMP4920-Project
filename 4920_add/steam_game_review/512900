I literally can't stop playing.\nSo... I decided  to edit  my review! I thought I should give some more details to why this is indeed one of the best games ever made.\nPros:\n1. The developer\nBest developer ever, super active, always takes suggestions from the community, fast bug fixes, etc. Pretty much the perfect developer!\n2. The sheer amount of options, you can choose from a diverse cast of 23 characters, these characters range from an angry gorilla who bashes his way through levels with ease to a shapeshifter who can sneakily jump in and out of npc's bodies.\n3. Did I mention you can play as a gorilla?\n4. The levels are the just the right level difficulty, not to easy but not uncompleteable. \n5. Everytime, and I truly mean EVERYTIME, you play you will have a different experience.\n6. You can do missions using sheer force, sneakiness, etc. There are tons of different ways to do a single mission.\nCons:\nIf there are any its the lack of characters being released, there is a rather long margin of no new characters after one is released, but that's just my pickiness and impatience.\n\nRating:\n9000/10\n(Over 9000)\n\nShould you buy this game?\nYES, GO BUY IT!\nHonestly this is a prime example of a good early acess game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 3160, "steamid": "76561198150998973", "last_played": 1507176044, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 4150}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506220567, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506657919, "recommendationid": "35168991", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "steamid": "76561198220311863", "last_played": 1506726315, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 129, "playtime_forever": 919}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506220492, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506220492, "recommendationid": "35168968", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "its a brilliant game, lots of depth and so much to do even though its still in early access.\nI've only played for a few hours so far but I must say its one of my favourite games to come out of early access\n\nI would recommend you pick it up and play it yourself, you won't be disappointed.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198056659723", "last_played": 1500943798, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 519, "playtime_forever": 419}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506241797, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506249061, "recommendationid": "35174533", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "the game is good.. grab the free version to play on itch.io first if you're hesitate to buy it", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1640, "steamid": "76561198101846522", "last_played": 1507204724, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 832, "playtime_forever": 5327}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506194782, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506194782, "recommendationid": "35161941", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
