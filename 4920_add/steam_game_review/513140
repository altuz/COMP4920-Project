Well, it turns out that it isn't true. Apparently it requires certain level of craft to not make grass look deceptively similiar to deadly spikes, or in general make decor and gameplay elements easy to distinguish while moving. Also it's not easy to NOT create invisible walls that kill you when jump too high. Or to make a pause button that doesn't drop you straight to main menu, with the option to start a new game highlighted. Or to design challenges that aren't based on the clunkiness of controls. Or to not force backtracking only to place obstacles that are easy to avoid while going one way, but annoying as hell when you're going back...\n\nIf you REALLY need more Super Meat Boy in your life and you've exhausted all other options you might give it a go - it's only 5 euro after all (or whatever it's in dollars). But other than that I don't see a reason to buy it.\n\nPS: There's a reason why all screenshots on the store page are so low-res.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024033768", "last_played": 1471459060, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 414, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1471459682, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1471522411, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506416", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1471459735, "developer_response": "Just wanted to say that Super Meat Boy is known to not be beatable, and this game is. Only someone who has actually beaten Super Meat Boy would know that this game is more beatable.\n\nAlso, sorry about the pause thing, and you accidentally pressing start which resets! I am adding an update soon which will double check if you already have a save file, plus will have its own menu for pause! Gotten a lot of requests for this one :D\n\nThe screenshots weren't initially low-res, but they were like cropped down so much from the converter since I didn't do it myself I guess. But either way, they don't look bad to me? Sorry you didn't like the experience, hope you were able to get a refund in time :o This game is my first game, and I know now to never try to make a game like this, because I have no idea how to master a difficulty curve at all. Plus, I had no testers and this game seemed easy to me since I was used to it :/\n\nAlso, I am currently trying to lower the price down to $1.99 :P Hopefully that works out.", "recommendationid": "24978645", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Game has some good design and shows promise, however I cannot recommend since even basic movement is incredibly frustrating and makes basic puzzles quite difficult. \n\nDeveloper I read this was your first game, you show promise just don't make it so difficult to control next time.\nPlayed using keyboard", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "steamid": "76561198067506610", "last_played": 1506705136, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 581, "playtime_forever": 75}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1476681736, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1476764645, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502537", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1476681736, "developer_response": "Yeah, this game was meant to be brutally hard! Probably should have made the difficulty curve better, and made it ease up to the difficulty. This game is kinda meant for those hardcore platformer gamers!
