Plus he kills you for not hitting 'd' quick enough. Can't save until you get to the bar, i assume. Which takes a long ass time. i've played an hour and still not made it to the save point. unless you find gross discriptions with no value to the game and tedious long winded speaches save yourself the money. Or play it in russian. Maybe its better in russian. or maybe Russians are just better at videogames. idk. save yourself the time and money. play something else.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198305292272", "last_played": 1505424597, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 66}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1504972240, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502647", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1504972240, "recommendationid": "34840455", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Doesn't work on Mac OS X.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "steamid": "76561198131843628", "last_played": 1506380294, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 131, "playtime_forever": 65}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506298239, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495090", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1506298239, "recommendationid": "35193286", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
