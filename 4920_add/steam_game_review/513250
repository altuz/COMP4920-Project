Can't wait to see it succeed. [/h1] \n\n[b] I'll update this as the game changes. [/b]\nReally good game. I hope much more will be added to it. It's fun as it is though and worth $5. There's some bugs I've encountered but nothing too major. I've had 2 crashes in my 10 hours of game time. The dev seems very responsive and kind, seems to really care about the game. I'd like to see more mustaches and I'd like the weapons to be more balanced. As it is, some of them feel very lackluster. The SMG is quite bad. While the starting pistol seems like one of the better weapons. I personally like using the Pistol and the Shotgun to start my games out. The main idea of the game is you'll start your runs with 1 weapon or 2 once you buy a starting weapon. You'll get buffs as you level up and find more weapons. There is a super saiyan like form your character can take called \"stache mode\" when you press Q, which dramatically increases your fire rate as well as whatever stache buffs you've collected throughout your current playthrough. It can feel overpowered in the beginning but as you play the levels get longer and harder to complete during a single stache mode. There is a casino like minigame to use your earned money on that gets you new hats or more money. There's no microtransactions, it's all with money you've earned in game. Not all that much more to say right now. I know this is a bit messy but the game is going to change and so will the review.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198091314531", "last_played": 1502106300, "num_reviews": 46, "num_games_owned": 133, "playtime_forever": 1049}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1484947429, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497953", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1484947736, "recommendationid": "29383992", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I have been playing Rogue Stache for about 80+ minutes since the 3rd of March, 2017.

I'm not sure if it was my computer, but it was irratating for me.\nThere's a few bugs here and there - Enemies can shoot through walls if you're close enough.\nSome of the weapons need to be nerfed hardcore.\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198201540779", "last_played": 1489944962, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 13, "playtime_forever": 297}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1489360254, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502238", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1489360254, "recommendationid": "30481368", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Loads of fun, lots of variety with clean controls and movement.
