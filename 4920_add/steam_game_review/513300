I am not a huge fan of games that are designed around leaderboards because not everyone wants the pressure of competition. The game itself is pretty decent but do to lack of progression it won't appeal to everyone. \n\nThere is some \"single-player content\" in terms of finding secrets. After about 20 hours of gameplay, I started to look for glitches inside the game. Little did I know that someone was about to play a cruel joke on me. I realized that this speedrun format is a disguise for the real game. Duck Treasure Hunter .\n\n\n[b] Technical problems/Settings [/b]\n\nYou may experience infrequent crashes and glitches along the platform edges. Nothing too serious but it is not perfectly fluid experience. Basic video options and controls are there. I like that you can toggle a shadow of people who played the map if you want to do a race against it. When you actually playing the game you can use several hotkeys like restart the level or checkpoint ( small thing but it makes speedruns more intuitive )\n\n[b] Is procedurally generated environment good for replay? [/b]\n\nAs far as I can tell there are around 60 preset platforming sections while maps are made from a random pattern of those. This system can actually create some weird levels because I think the pattern can repeat itself. Still, once you play about 30 maps you will probably know how to solve any issue that game can throw at you. So after about 4 hours, you will explore the actual unique content of the game. \n\n4.2 Billion maps? Well, we all know how these games that promise the universe go. At least this game has good variety of backgrounds and combinations of platforms which are worth low asking price. I will have to complement developer on making platforming sections a risk vs reward . You will find that almost every preset section has a better way to approach it if you got some guts.\n\nThere is a map editor if you love playing with it but It seems limited to using preset sections. \n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\n\nPlatforming tools are pretty easy to pick up but hard to master. There are four basic mechanics that you can learn in 4 tutorial maps. I have been craving a bit of Spider-Man experience and this game kinda gives you that feeling of extreme agility. A very fast-paced game that you can play for 20 minutes on a break and still enjoy it. Overall very self-explanatory.\n\n[b] Artstyle & Music [/b]\n\nThe game looks very slick. Bright colors and surreal looking platforming give it a nice aesthetic edge. Sometimes Sun is too bright (hopefully a glitch and not design choice) Music is also nice but it is not as up-tempo as I would like for a game this quick. Audio is a bit too relaxing. You can also do some character customization with couple items and colors.\n\n[b] Verdict 7/10:[/b] For a speedrun focused game it is pretty darn good but you will mostly compete against your own best score. I really wish there was an arcade-like option with preset maps and maybe bosses that you would have to race. As it stands this game is focused on leaderboards and competition when there is no real community. I can see myself coming back to this game for a quick rush but replay value is limited.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995669628", "last_played": 1500478268, "num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 597, "playtime_forever": 3147}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1494129935, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499973", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1496444163, "recommendationid": "31595618", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
