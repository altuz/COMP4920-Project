Unintuitive, contrary to every guideline regarding how to use HTC controllers to interact. Movement is vomit-inducing, non-teleporting and unidirectional (only in the direction of the MHD; no strafing etc). The car only seems to cooperate about 20% of the time when going backwards. Picking up things and interactions are all trigger-based, regardless of context (i.e. grip controller is never used, for instance). Throwing is a button rather than based on accelerometer. All in all, the designers of this game very apparently did not design the game with VR in mind, or at least not the Vive.\n- Instability. The game has crashed or become unresponsive 100% of the times I've tried to exit the game, and also every time I made the apparently fatal mistake of pressing a button (any button) during the way-too-long intro sequence.\n - These \"puzzles\" aren't puzzled. \"Puzzle\" implies using the brain in some way. This is just trial and error combinatorics. Five switches, experiment with them until you activate them in the right order. Move this robot around this grid, we'll give you absolutely no clues as to which squares are safe. Experiment. Trial and error. Seriously, go play some Myst or even some old point and click Lucasarts game. Or pretty much any puzzle game. These are not puzzles, they're patience gates - You Must Be This Patient To Continue.\n- Uninspired, clich\u00e9d \"surrealist\" imagery, and equally uninspired sci-fi aesthetics.\n\nIn short: not worth it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992328443", "last_played": 1492959002, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 1028, "playtime_forever": 72}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1492960457, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524992", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1492960457, "recommendationid": "31322131", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I bought this on sale. After almost 6 hours of game play I finally beat it.\nI enjoyed it overall. But the ending was incredibly anti-climactic for the experience. Details below.\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\n\nPROS\n\nBeautiful environments (in graphics settings, turn up the graphics scaling for better visuals)\n\nA fun, casual adventure. Not crazy hard or impossible.\n\nGreat music and ambience\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nCONS\n\nIt's kinda glitchy. The floor height was always too low beneath my feet, I felt like I was hovering most of the time.\n\nWhenever I entered the \"dream states\" the graphical performance became poor. Lot's of stuttering until the dream was over.\n\nIf you want teleporation as your movement method, you have to decide that in settings BEFORE you start the game. Then you're stuck with the setting you chose. You can't change it mid-game.\n\n--------------------\n\nYou'll be driving a buggy a lot near the beginning of the game, but you'll eventually move past that.\n\nSpoilers below:\n\n[spoiler]\n\nThe ending left me really disappointed after playing through the whole game. The narrator basically said \"you didn't do well\" and then it faded to black.\n\nIt's possible that I made the wrong choice at the end, but the \"moral dilemma\" at the end doesn't make any sense. You're supposed to choose between obeying your orders or letting the city keep its resources. But the city is completely uninhabited! Even the Mad Hatter voice that speaks, asking you to spare the city, is a self-proclaimed AI voice. There are no living beings to worry about in the city, therefore the \"moral dilemma\" has no stakes, and isn't a dilemma at all!\n\nI found that confusing, which probably led me to make the incorrect choice at the end. I wish the game provided better closure for you at the end.\n\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyway, if you find it on sale I think you should try it. Just know that it's a little glitchy, and you need to decide on your movement style at the beginning.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198096412999", "last_played": 1495392834, "num_reviews": 86, "num_games_owned": 169, "playtime_forever": 346}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1495394831, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497129", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1495394959, "recommendationid": "31889370", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
