The player has to explore different areas and rooms in order to find items and clues that will allow them to activate strange mechanisms and reveal entrances to new areas. The game is set in the same eerie atmosphere of the first [i]Abandoned[/i] game, being inspired by Mateusz Skutnik's [i]Submachine[/i] games. If you have played the aforementioned games before then this series will bring you a feeling of nostalgia that will make the game, in my opinion, very enjoyable. The art style is good and the music enhances the eerie feeling of the game. The only downside I can think of is that it's a bit too short for its price. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to the next installment and I hope the series will gain the same prestige as the Submachine games. 10/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198156671913", "last_played": 1480175015, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 220, "playtime_forever": 190}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1480180898, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501504", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1480180898, "recommendationid": "27699779", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The long awaited sequel to \"Abandoned\" The Underground City\" has arrived on STEAM...and it's ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC ! ! !  This will keep you glued to your computer for a very long time...you've been warned...\n This second installment of the \"Through Abandoned\" series is even more impressive than the first: The navigation of the environment is simple enough for a \"newbie\" to instantly pick up the computer's mouse and instinctively know how to navigate and explore the multitude of environments in The Forest. The INVENTORY system and its operation in particular, is VERY ORIGINAL, and was just an all-around GREAT idea to put in a game like this! Like the first chapter of this series, the ambient is quite gripping, making it very easy for the Player to become totally immersed in The Forest...\nAs discussed by many in the past, the style of the artwork is of course \"familiar\"...so the player INSTANTLY feels quite comfortable here...The puzzles are original and interesting, and the game as a whole is challenging. Not too simple...not insanely difficult...It gets your mental gears turning while you remain relaxed by all the rest...\nTake your time and savor every detail of it...it's likely that you'll make some discoveries when you do.\nHOPEFULLY, many other developers will be influenced by this incredible game's style.\nIf you are not familiar with \"Point & Click Puzzle-Escape\" games with a good dose of ADVENTURE...check this title out.
