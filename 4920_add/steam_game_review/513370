Combat will focus much more on your footwork than your swordplay, because distance in combat here is extremely close. If you're literally not sword-to-sword, you won't do damage (and since this is actually quite realistic, this leads me largely to conclude that people are complaining about hit registry not because it's bad but because their timing is garbage and their aim/distance is terrible).\n\ni've already killed around 15-20 npc's in my half an hour of playing, and most reviews I read complained about these very same NPCs being laggy/bad reg/impossible/blah blah blah. I definitely don't agree with any of the complaints that I've read. \n\nBlade & Bones is a Souls game at its core, but it approaches the genre with an emphasis on movement mechanics more than striking mechanics (it's like Bloodborne in that regard).\n\nI also don't get the complaints about missing textures during the first 20 minutes. I haven't spotted any. I've only spotted a single knight who looked like that, and that was only because he's a Rock-type humanoid. The graphics/environment are actually pretty impressive and have a distinct and recognizable charm. This definitely isn't an asset flip. \n\nI think this game definitely deserves a shot, especially at less than 4$. Hardcore RPG fans won't be disappointed if they truly give this game a genuine shot and ignore all the negative hypetrain bandwagoners.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976104660", "last_played": 1504682782, "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 528, "playtime_forever": 37}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1501725088, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484589", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1501725088, "recommendationid": "33983159", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is the worst game I have ever played...PERIOD!\n\nRing...ring...
