You just guess by opening drawers or flipping switches. It's not rewarding because you don't really feel like you accomplished anything. There's no clues you have to decipher, no riddles, nothing like that.

You're curious as to what this thing is or what it means, then when you finally put two and two together you feel accomplished.\n\nVR Escape the Space Station doesn't do this at all. Just pull and press things with nothing encouraging your curiosity or finding something and looking at it to wonder \"what does this mean?\" You find something and it's obvious what it's for. \n\nThe very last puzzle is very easy to figure out what you're supposed to do, but it's very unfair in execution as it's just another random guessing game rather than puzzle solving. So you stand there looking at this thing trying to focus on it as you get double vision and think, \"ok is it these numbers?\" Nope, try again, is it in this order, is it this many, does that one count its out of the bounds I'm using, well what about that one, am I standing too close, too far? To me that's not fair puzzle solving, it's just lazy and unclever level design. \n\nCompound that with moving around with the point and click method sometimes teleports you miles out in space only to turn around and see the tiny dot that is your space station or that critical item you need just passes through the glass and flies away into space which makes completing a level impossible makes the game unplayable at times. \n\nI never had fun playing it either.

A garden, from which new and exotic experiences spring forth to entice you into the imagination of Game Designers, who's responsibility it is, to safeguard this fledgling industry from the oncoming march of tropes and mechanical issues that rear their ugly mugs.\n\nVR Escape the Space Station, makes no such efforts.\n\nDespite an intially intriguing premise, \"ESCAPE SPACE!\", the developer(s) seemingly make little effort in what could have been an excellent experience.\n\nMechanically the game has many flaws, not least of which is a broken grab mechanic which will leave you grasping repeatedly for objects which have become locked in invisible collider objects, or which simply leave your grasp once your hand stops providing the \"grip\" buttons with the nessecary might. I found myself squinting into the darkness to find objects which had floated into textures or within the games geometry. Oh yes, did I mention the lighting is terrible.\n\nFrom an Escape Room perspective (and I've actually run one in London a while ago) the poor design is continued to the puzzles and hiding spots. Each room consists of one to three, discrete puzzles. Clearly the developer ran out of ideas after room one, which boasts the best designed challenge, the proceeding rooms become less and less intriguing and more and more infuriatingly dissapointing. The problem is further compounded by repetitive reuse of assets, assuring that in each \"room\" there is a very limited subset of interactive elements from which to illicit \"clues\". In essence, every drawer has a clue in it.\n\nIf the game had used a decent ammount of artwork I'd have been happy to forgive it some of its sins, however the \"planetoid\" around which we are apparently \"orbiting\" is a large, grainy blob. What a damn waste.\n\nI look forward to the developer refining their efforts, I'm sure with their next release, hopefully after carefully study of some of the material being used in actual Escape Rooms, they will be able to redeem themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, this effort in particular, has been wasted.

Not because the puzzles were hard, but due to the unpolished use of VR.  A couple specific complaints:\n\n- There are collision bugs with the perimiter.  I put the screwdriver in a drawer and lost it it outside the station.  The flashlight somehow managed to get onto the other side of wall and although I could grab it, I couldn't bring it back to my side of the room.  Had to restart a couple times due to bugs, and I'm not the only one who had that problem.  The game should detect when these problems happen and respawn the items within reach.\n\n- If you have a small room, it will also be difficult.  e.g. I couldn't reach items near the ceiling.  I think they eventually come back down due to the very light gravity.  You also can't teleport when you're holding an item, which is lame.\n\n- A number of people (including myself!) have a lot of trouble with the final puzzle.  I won't say too much, to avoid spoilers.  It's a clever puzzly, but unfortunately you would need a VR system with more consistent optics than the HTC Vive in order for it to work reliably.  I got frustrated, and wound up bypassing the obvious intent of the puzzle, instead solving it using guesswork and rough proximity.

It's pretty dark in there and this may bother some. I enjoyed it because it added on to the whole lost-in-space vibe. There is a flashlight floating around, but it may not be enough for some. P.S. The images show on board lighting, did I possibly miss this?? If I did that's a cool dynamic that just adds on to the overall game.\n- The FX for open drawers and cabinets seems a bit too loud.\n\nThings that are great:\n+ The overall atmosphere was amazing and a fresh new enviroment from what we've had with previous VR titles. I've played a lot of Dead Space and Alien Isolation and this title felt like a nod to those games.\n+ Easy to pick up and play so great for showing friends/family.\n+ 4 mini rooms/puzzles instead of one single larger room, allows for a brief change of scenery.\n\nOverall, if you been looking to satisfy another escape room crave, you won't be disappointed. If price is a factor in your decision based take into account that the game can be beaten in less than a hour and also if you plan on sharing the experience.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009585222", "last_played": 1472187924, "num_reviews": 69, "num_games_owned": 194, "playtime_forever": 33}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1482562809, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493534", "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1482702856, "recommendationid": "28584113", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
