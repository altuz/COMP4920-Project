Both the art style and the soundtrack help you relax while playing. Level design is good although not perfect. Like collecting the tokens seems a bit counter-intuitive, some require you to kill yourself in order to get them. Luckily you only need to pick up each token once. The game might still need a bit of polish. After finishing and collecting all tokens (I got the achievement) it shows me I am missing all 3 tokens on the last level and 1 from the level before the last. Also the hitboxes are inconsistent in some parts, especially against spikes and flames. Overall a nice little indie game that, while flawed, will give you some platforming fun for a little while.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198029972608", "last_played": 1489889051, "num_reviews": 209, "num_games_owned": 459, "playtime_forever": 90}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1489889591, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514303", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1495266024, "recommendationid": "30605278", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Seriously, cutest game ever!
