Agenda attempts to, or at least I believe attempts to, combine the operational aspect of simulators like Evil Genius with part of the format of Plague Inc.  This concept is done somewhat well but has some flaws.\n\n1. Known bugs.  I know its 2016 (state of the industry ect.)  but better QA should have been done.  I know part of it may be language related BUT a lot of the UI stuff should have been ironed out.  Especially how sensitive the buttons are.  Click the wrong place on a button and you exit the window.  Speaking of Windows this seems to be only available for Windows 64 bit systems which the Dev forgot to put down which may make some users mad.\n\n2.  Goals for Regions and methods aren't so clear from the tutorial.  The whole point of the game is to keep each region's power level at or just slightly above what needs to be in order to ally.  This was not made entirely clear and thus may be the point of some other reviewers' frustrations.\n\n3.  One thing that is a legitimate universal complaint is the simplicity of it.  Some things such as an opposing force and region specific mechanics are things that make Plague Inc. such a good game and I would advise the Devs to take note as this seems to be a very valid concern.  To that end, adding events (such as those adding to or decreasing exposure or influence) would also be helpful as well as notifications as to changes in each region's desire BEFORE they break off the alliance.  Furthermore, some difficulty should be added to areas other than the exposure influence mechanic.\n\n4.  Considering Number 3, this game is to expensive and is liable to create some upset people who were either expecting something closer to Plague Inc., or something closer to a political simulator.  I got this on Week1 Sale but it still seems a bit steep for the content.  Here's to hoping for free content updates.\n\nAll in all this seems like an interesting concept but feels somewhat rushed.  I would recommend it for diehard fans of the Plague Inc. type game or those nostalgic for Evil Genius type action but I would WAIT for it to fall to 5.99 USD or somewheres around there before buying it.
