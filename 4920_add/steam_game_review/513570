It's like one of those low budget horror movies that are so terrible that they end up being a comedy. \n\nLet me start with what I liked. I thought the graphics were decent and I kinda liked the chiming sound that would help to sort of guide me through the story so I didn't get too confused about my objectives. When it made sense. Sometiems it would chime and say something that would confuse me even more.\n\nThe english translation is really bad. So bad that it is challenging to understand what the story is or what exactly is wanted from me. As an example: One of the first tasks is to find a key in a basket down in the basement. The trouble is, there was no basket in the basement. It ended up being in a big metal locker. \n\nAfter experiencing the first chase scene, I learned that the monster could clip through the door that locked it out of the stairway and kill me anyway. Fantastic. Teleporting zombies.\n\nI got as far as the puzzle in the fifth chapter before it crashed. And now everytime I go to reload my game it just does a repeat crash to desktop. \n\nBummer, I would have liked to at least finish this game. As it is, I can't really recommend that anybody spend any money on this game when most of the people who have tried it are unable to finish it for one reason or another.
