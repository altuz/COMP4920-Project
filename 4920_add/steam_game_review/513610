I like the balanced level progression when it becomes more challenging every level and I love the boss fights, they were well thought out.  Extremely well worth the price.  With long gameplay, high replay value for a low price, steam cards and full controller support (I used a xbox 360 controller - perfect and precise movement), it is hard not to recommend this game.

If you enjoy vertical shooter you're going to enjoy Madrobot X.\n\nThere are 12 stages in total, 2 difficulties (Normal and Nightmare), and a \"Challenge mode. \n\nThere is plenty of content to justify the pricetag and keep you drawn in for a few hours. Two strong feature the developers executed perfectly are the controls and the hitboxes. Many shooters I see released on Steam have some serious control or hitbox problems making gameplay a mess. Madrobot X feels solid and makes dodging bullets a natural reaction rather than a chore. The pixel graphics are clean and bullets are easy to see.\n\nThe only flaw I see is the variety of enemies the game has. As the stages progress you will see many reused enemies making several stages feel like the previous. This is a small complaint and has no impact on the overall game.\n\nI hope to see achievements and leaderboards added in the future.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043115858", "last_played": 1474789186, "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 1573, "playtime_forever": 165}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1474790803, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503027", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1474790803, "recommendationid": "25686743", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very bland game!
