It has many bugs and glitches. The voice acting is terrible and to top it all off the game can be completed in less than 10 minutes. So to finish here is a list of glitches and bugs i experienced while playing this.\n\n1. the back to menu and exit to desktop buttons don't work.\n\n2. the spanner would often take a good 20 seconds to return to my hands.\n\n3. sometimes i would clearly hit the turrets and the hit wouldnt register.\n\n4. every level can be completed by climing a building and jumping making no insentive to actually do anything.\n\n5. the level select screen doesn't work since even if you finish the game you can only select the first 2 levels and the first level is a cutscene.\n\n\n6. This isnt a glitch but throwing the wrench feels weak and flimsy and goes like 2 meters which is complete crap because by the time you throw the wrench the enemies have either already killed you or you'll still miss the target.\n\n\nP.S: I spent way to long playing this game because it had so little content i was sure i was missing something that i can no longer refund it.\n\nP.P.S: The excuse for a story this game gives is literally here have a wrench and a pocket watch now go fuck yourself and half of the missions cant even be completed by doing them as your supposed to.\n\nP.P.P.S: Seriously just save the money and put it towards buying games that you wont hate after playing for 10 mins like Cluster Truck or Superhot which are basically what this game is trying and failing to be.\n\nP.P.P.P.S: Sorry for being so harsh I just really hate this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198086787906", "last_played": 1497692903, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_forever": 212}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1497084838, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517859", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1497169341, "recommendationid": "32312187", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Want my money back.
