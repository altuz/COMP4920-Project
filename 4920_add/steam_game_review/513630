It feels like programming practice for a video game design class. Aiming is very difficult since your shots snap to 1 of 8 possible directions even though you can aim anywhere with your mouse and after you upgrade to a missle launcher, you pretty much are guarenteed to lose. (btw you dont even know what the weapons do when you are able to purchase them) Why? Because the missle does 0 damage if it hits an enemy. You have to aim at an enemy that is at its max range and the missle has to explode to deal damage. And since it shoots SLOWER than your base weapon, the game gets WAY harder. I got this game for 90% off and I still think it was a waste of money. Three levels, very short and simple game that is hardly complete. One more thing, the enemy spawn rate can be anywhere from not seeing any enemy in like 15 seconds to having 10 enemies charge in all at once, so the RNG in this game sucks as well. Expect to lose at least a few lives each round due to it being impossible to kill all the enemies that spawn at once when that happens.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198100675489", "last_played": 1495740707, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 57, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1495740822, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512334", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495740822, "recommendationid": "31958309", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
