You're also presented with a glowing flashlight you also cannot pick up, because it will break sequence. This is the type of game you're playing with Joana's Life - it's a mess.\n\nTowards the end, the game will start teleporting you random places without any transition or explanation. You'll even get to go on a Slender: Eight Pages-esque item hunt! None of it makes any sense, and all semblance of story gets thrown out the window in favor of cheap jumpscares and nonsensical game design.\n\nThoroughly terrible.

The game has a fairly unique mechanic: You can use a mirror to see what's behind you, and it won't always be what you can see directly with your eyes.\n\nJoana's Life looks quite nice and is very atmospheric. Unfortunately, the game is rather tedious. It does give you objectives, but often times forces you to spend time walking around aimlessly. The developers mentioned that they didn't want to hold the player's hand - which is fine, but that doesn't excuse poor level design.\n\nThe game also features enemies. Killing enemies doesn't seem to be possible, but avoiding them isn't very difficult, so they end up being more of a nuisance than an actual challenge. On top of that, there are performance issues and bugged scripts and triggers.\n\nUltimately, Joana's Life is just yet another Steam first-person horror game. It does have some potential, but I can't recommend it in its current state.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crW7ehXQb9w", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198144609502", "last_played": 1473183491, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_forever": 188}, "votes_up": 31, "timestamp_created": 1473080640, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540523", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1473283148, "recommendationid": "25363485", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Guidance is an important aspect of a good horror game. Sometimes it's obvious, sometime's it's more a cry of \"Ooh, interesting thing this way!\", subtly guiding you past the invisible walls you never even noticed were there.\n\nJoana's Life... Does none of that. And that hurts it as a game. No, you can't pick up the front door keys yet. Why? Because you haven't touched the mirror and thrown it away. Once you've worked out how to leave the house (A protracted process, not because the individual steps are difficult, but because you have to find them in roughly the right order or way, with little to no guidance), you have to go to a specific house... In an entire block, strangely walled off (Something I found more unsettling than the intentional scares, which were predictable as heck... Not least because they won't happen until you've done the thing it wasn't telling you how to do.)\n\nYes, I've tried it, and you can explore the entire block (Very slowly, because of *course* there's an unseen stamina meter, and *of course* walking speed is moderately slow), and if, like me, you then forgot where you were meant to go, your only sign is that it's the only door that opens that isn't your house.\n\nYou don't know who you are (Although, judging by the panting noises, you're a man.) There's no context for a lot of this, except the odd newspaper article in broken english.\n\nWhile it's a short game if you can predict what it's asking you, it's by no means a good game, where its supposedly core gimmick is used... Er... Once. Another gimmick gets introduced, but has more frustration than use, as it's on a cooldown, and slow to direct when it is used.

The jumpscares in this game are great when they occur and when I first obtained the mirror I was afraid of using it. I think that this game could do great if it built upon that fear of using the mirror. Sure we need to see through it to proceed and find out next objective, but what about putting some jumpscares into it where you use the mirror and bam, creepy demonic creature is right there!\n\nAs for the story and the world the game is in, I feel it needs more work. I feel like there is a lack of a sense of direction in the game. Although I am given an objective such as \"leave the house\" or \"find the girl\" outside of the objective written, It is very difficult to find out what specifically was demanded of me. On multiple occassions I would find myself repeating an action over and over again, walking past the same things time and time again, and then what seems to be completely at random, an event occurs. I will have no idea what triggered the event because I have done the same thing time and time again with no reaction prior.\n\nIn summary the foundation of scares and overall creepy demeanor in this game is good, but as for the story and the sense of direction as to what to do and where this game is going is missing for me.
