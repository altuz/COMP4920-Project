I've seen most reviews of this game are mostly negative, but I wanted to find out on my own. Here is what I found out.\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are very nice.\nIt has a mute option in game so you can turn off that music they play\nMy fingers hurt xD\n\nCons:\nThere is no real point to the game besides clicking a meteorite\nIt is simplistic\nMute is not remembered when leaving and coming back to the game\nMy fingers are hurting xD\nDLC is more than the base game  (downloadable content is something that is a no-no for me and should have been added to the base game already. The only time I've seen dlc be more expensive than a game would have been when the game itself was free and even then all the dlc had in it were clothes and other useless paraphernalia like that) \n\nGame needs a few things in order to be more popular. It needs a x5 buy option a x10 buy option and a x100 buy option as well as a max buy option when clicking on mines and Drohnes (as well as adding time to the timer).The game also should remember that you muted the game music after you left the game as the sound turns back on when you come back to it. The game needs something that will make it much more sophisticated to make it equal to other clickers out there such as Adcap or Clicker Heroes, idle civilizations. It is ok right now, but more variety is needed. The price is good for this kind of game not very expensive. The DLC on the other hand shouldn't  be more expensive than the base game (I would hang off on buying the dlc until the price is balanced better). The dev should up the price on the base game if that was to be done. \n\nI'm recommending just the base game. Not the DLCs. Not until the game gets a bit more fleshed out. It just seems a bit too bare bones right now.\n\nUpdate: Another thing which could make this more fun is if you run out of time  you could gain a certain type of currency to improve the time, drohnes and other upgrades to make them faster and mine more each time you sell off the busines, after \"Ascending\" or \"Selling\" off your business and creating a new one.\n\nNote: For the UPDATE above I will not buy it if the updates I mentioned were to be a different DLC and it was priced higher than the game itself was. Sorry I don't trust games like that.\n\nUpdate Again: I've noticed that the Drill Level locks at lvl 8 and the mining drohnes and drills go at a slower pace than before. Don't really know why this couldn't have been fixed in the base game instead of having it be a seprate dlc...Yeah, I can't recommend this now.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198047291933", "last_played": 1490792325, "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 89}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1489804443, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501946", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1490792212, "recommendationid": "30581816", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Im not sure what the goal is in this game. Im not sure what the point is in this game. It has potential if they would add more to it. I Never could figure out how to switch asteroids or if it is even an option. I got the DROHNE level past 35000 and also got the MINE level past 35,000. The Drill capped at level 6 and weirdly slowed down the mining process instead of speeding it up. The money was in the 9 digits 236459783. The game was actually making money faster than I could level up the MINE and DROHNE devices. It was kinda crazy. I patiently waited for something new to unlock, change, spawn, anything, but nothing happened. Maybe I played the game incorrectly or something. I think it could be a fun game if they gave it purpose and rewards, perhaps adding Different asteroids to mine or More drills, different Backgrounds, oh and the sound loop is like chinese water torture almost 2 hours in play. lol. It did not cost much at all. Maybe they will add more to the actual game play.
