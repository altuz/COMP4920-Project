I would describe this game as a poor man's version of SPT.  If I had the choice of SPT at full retail price or this game at the current sale price of .89 cents, I would choose Deadlock.\n\nThere's 3 different enemies: soldiers, flying drones, and attack dogs from neon red hell.  You only have the 1 neon environment that you see in the video / screenshots.  You have two handguns.  Using your joystick, you can select single shot, multishot, regular laser multi shots, and a single fire laser you have to hold to shoot.  Each wave brings more enemies.  You can dodge bullets (if you can dodge a wrench).  There's some powerups along the way.  And you can use a shield. [u] However, do not select the use grip button to switch to shield as I could not get this option to work,\n simply reach behind your back to bring up the shield. [/u] There is no tutorial, but there is a practice mode where you can go against one specific enemy type.  There is easy, normal, and hard mode. You can select music on or off.  I played this on normal and found it fun and challenging.  \n\nRating 7/10 decent value for under a buck sale price", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1507080998, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1507080544, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507081482, "recommendationid": "35460187", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
