Maybe Mindsweeper is what is 'hardcore' to you?  You'll enjoy this for the puzzles and minimalistic aesthetic.\nA\n\nA puzzle game veteran?  We got another tour of duty for you in the form of a game that seems simple but can offer a great challenge.\n\nInterplanetary Ambassador on a mission of peace for Xebos III in the Char galaxy?  Dude... there are spheres in here!  SPHERES!\n\n(bonus review thingie:  Check out Dumbfounded's other offereing... Vicky Saves the Big Dumb World.  It isn't required to enjoy this game... but its just another example to Dumbfounded's great work so far.)\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197991635993", "last_played": 1477782464, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 727, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1477783473, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501189", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1477783473, "recommendationid": "26303182", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "What a pile of shiit!
