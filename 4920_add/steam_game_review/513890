The winds were too forceful to withstand, even for the battle hardened Vikings. Slowly the ship sinks in the cold, dark sea, taking every soul with it, except yours. You are spared. The only living survivor, stranded on the northern shores of an island, that seems to be abandoned by it's inhabitants. What happened?\n\nThe Frostrune is a point-and-click adventure with an interesting twist. During the course of the adventure you find a magic staff, allowing you to dive into the world of ghosts. The mixture between the real world and the sphere of ghosts offers an interesting experience. \n\nThe story of 'The Frostrune' is mediocre. It' OK and the game is enjoyable but the main reason you should play this game is the atmosphere. If you like Nordic mythology, Vikings and ghosts, this game is for you. If you don't, you can skip this one. Personally, I enjoyed this very much.\n\nPros:\n- beautiful graphics, hand-painted\n- extremely good voice acting, gives you shivers every time a ghost speaks. The language is old Norse. Sounds wonderful to me.\n- great sound effects\n- nice music\n- very strong atmosphere\n- mysterious\n- inspired by Viking myth\n- magical\n- all objects recreated from archaeological sources, according to the developers\n- balanced puzzle difficulty\n\nNeutral:\n- short, finished the game in four hours, but it felt longer\n\nCons: \n- a few very stupid achievements. I played this game without caring for achievements. After finishing the game I discovered that you get an achievement for a speed run in 30 minutes. This kind of achievement is completely unnecessary, especially for a quiet game like this.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983740996", "last_played": 1500671466, "num_reviews": 89, "num_games_owned": 418, "playtime_forever": 241}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1500734111, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514265", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500745273, "recommendationid": "33722243", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Although it's short and concise, the art style is great and the atmosphere really helps to keep you involved in the story the whole time.
