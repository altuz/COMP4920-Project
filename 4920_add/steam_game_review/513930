It has a lot of potential while being at alpha state now. They ve got the gameplay working pretty well and I think there is a learning curve with fully upgraded cars. I only used the S13 now. The cars also really change their handling with tuning, sadly most tuning options only affect the hp. \n\nI hope differential adjustment, wheel choice, stabilisators, spacers, weight distribution and reduction will be added soon. Also the map is not really interesting or large at all. But I think the developers should focus on the mechanics for now.\n\nThe body tuning is on level of gtaV now, not quiet old nfs titles but again, there is potential... it feels more like a tech demo now. Also the paintshemes are not fitting, low res and so on, what about importing own shemes?\n\nAfter all I think if they stick to the graphics quailty they go with the cars and focus on game mechancis depth for now. Because they are allready on a good way there and this is where they can kick EAs ass now. They can later create a cheesy career story, add a nice map and combine everything to freeroam. Also I wouldn't add too many cars for now, more concentrate on the few now existing vehicles, giving them character while keeping them balanced, add options and over all keep it compact but make it good.\nBeside this: the turbo tuning is sick!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046944136", "last_played": 1499456602, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 112, "playtime_forever": 102}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1471486950, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486593", "votes_down": 18, "timestamp_updated": 1471487744, "recommendationid": "24984874", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is complete shit all the cars sound the same exept one I would rather drink bleach then play this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198124269437", "last_played": 1471491823, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 95, "playtime_forever": 14}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1471491923, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435650", "votes_down": 42, "timestamp_updated": 1471491923, "recommendationid": "24985726", "votes_funny": 14, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "wow not worth the 5 bucks but i see how much work has went into coding the game ui etc.....\nstill needs a ton of work this is beta at best lacking content such as cars dyno a way to tune the parts you just bought etc....\nthe driving is bad racing is worse there is a civic its an FF car and the game is based around drifting in every race so this does not work well while driving the car yet the other cars are FR they do better in the race as you would guess but still the drift factor is way to high every turn at nothing it goes sideways!!!!! and not cuz tha hp lolz\n\n                                            [h1] this could be a great game[/h1]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198020742658", "last_played": 1482914677, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 23}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1482916371, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1482916371, "recommendationid": "28744794", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Atleast it was cheap...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198047688384", "last_played": 1471826275, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487831712, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487831712, "recommendationid": "30113630", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
