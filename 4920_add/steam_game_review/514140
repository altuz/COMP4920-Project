Neither you, your teamates or enemies can look far. Enemies can be literaturelly meters away and neither of you are awared. This hide-and-seek-like feeling is what the game attracted me in the first place.\nMeanwhile, the characters are as fragile as the VCs. A shot in the right part can be fatal, so better aviod close combats because you'll get shot easier. But there're also the old school first-aid bag for you to restore some health.\n\nThere're about 2 dozen of characters you can recruit into your 4-men team. They all have a class, a heavy gunner can't shoot accurately with a sniper rifle, even when controled by the player. Though the option's varied, you only need the certain four to cover all 8 campaigns.\nCharacters feature some status that can be upgraded after every mission, but the game's campaign is so short that it ends before you can notice your characters have grown.\n\nThe weapons also has quite a varity, including 20+ main weapon but merely 2 pistols and 20 items(mines and bombs, grenades, radios for air strike, disposable rockets, binoculars....), all provide different experiences.\nEach character can carry a main weapon, a pistol and 3 items at the beginning of a mission, more can be picked up during mission. Even though the in-game hint says the accuracy will be affected if carry too much, but it's probably not true according the actual gameplay.\n\n\nThe game mess up frequently when you need to control the movement of teammates cause their  navigation is totally piece of shit. \nThey don't like to walk straight. When given the 'follow me' order, they run around the nearby area before they stop near you as you stop, only when given the 'move to' order can they move straight.\nThey get lost behind frequently, mostly being stucked somewhere. The map is full of bugs. Trees, rocks, cornors, rooms, even a plain ground can stop you or your teammate from time to time.They don't know how to cross bridges, most of the time they stuck on it or directly jump into the river.So you better have the patient to control them individually to cross some parts of the maps with even just a few obstacles. \nWith that said, the command machanic is quite stright forward. You can hold Q to enable a command panel featuring fire at will, hold fire, crouch/prone/stand, move to, hold positon, follow, all of which are also binded on reasonable hotkeys, and all of the orders have their use. \n\nFurther more, the game crashes quite often. In the first half of the game it crashed dozens of times for some unknown reason (I suspect it's about not killing all enemies in the game) and there're no really solution for this. Frequent saving might work, but you still have to restart a mission to solve that sometime.\n\nAll in all, the game can make you mad some times by either crashing or bugs.The game's machanic is completed but lacks some polish, as some aspects are well delivered but missions are too short to support these contents. It feels realistic but fun to play as the difficulty is well controlled.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071211771", "last_played": 1492610239, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 118, "playtime_forever": 830}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1492621045, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521201", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1496558019, "recommendationid": "31240850", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "honestly this is a lost gem i LOVE the way you set up your units and the fact you have an overworld map to rest and set waypoints its all so great and it runs great to on a modern computer windows 10 to be specific 0 crashes", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198129747659", "last_played": 1498456215, "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 317, "playtime_forever": 26}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1498456385, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498456385, "recommendationid": "32802049", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
