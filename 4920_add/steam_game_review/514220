GunWorld 2 is a bit easier than it's predecesor, but still has that level of difficulty found in older games. Developed with the same retro-hardware limitations as the original, it remains a faithful love letter to the early era of gaming. A pause menu is a very welcome addition and the RPG elements spice things up a bit. As is to be expected from a studio with limited resources, certain parts of the game can be a bit rough, but the developer is already committed to and working on a 2.0 update that will bring more content and a lot of polish.
