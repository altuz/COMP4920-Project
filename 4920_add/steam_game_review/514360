You start at what would be called the main menu, but the only thing you can do there is to start the game or check the leader boar. When I played the leader board didn't show anything. And there is some very repetetive music going on. \n\nYou start the game and since the spawn is randomly generated you might die right away and end up back at the main menu. If you survive spawning you need to figure out the controls because the game doesn't tell you. For anyone interested the arrow keys, z and x are the keys that is used by the game. Running and jumping feels good in Freedom Fighter  but that is about the only positive things about the game.
