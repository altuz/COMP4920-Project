The game has potential.  I think the artwork and graphics are very nice.  The issues are primarily with the control.  It's as if there's too much drift when you move the dragon around.  Doesn't feel as responsive as it needs to for this type of game (where you are dodging arrows, collecting coins, and trying to hit archers).  Needs collision detection when dragon hits ground walls, etc..  Right now you fly through everything even the floor!  If the controls were tighter (more responsive--including your fireball), and you were penalized for hitting obstacles: i.e. hitting walls and bridges would end your run.

This is one of the few games for Vive so far that doesn't just feel like a Tech Demo.\n\nSome reviews have complained about sluggish controls, which I thought may have been an issue as well.  It seems this is intentional for the first dragon.  As you upgrade and purchase more dragons, they get faster and the controls are much tighter.  His controls are definitely a bit slow, but it's not a cursor controlled by your wand, more like suggesting the direction it goes.
