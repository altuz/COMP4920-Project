It is the poop.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  It has ok sound fx. It had some major  lag, when it starts a round of diarrhea.  Game play was very short, like 10 rounds, so it seems like a shittty demo.  If you played Space Invaders, you will do well on this game.  Full of toilet humor.  Very easy to play crap.  Would make a good joke game.\n\nSit on it, drop it and Flush it.\n\nFor more info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyMGfolpw0k\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1izENYk3H2M\n\nhttp://www.indiedb.com/company/fergatroid-studios", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197982295752", "last_played": 1487645509, "num_reviews": 558, "num_games_owned": 100, "playtime_forever": 27}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1487646279, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500600", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1487647188, "recommendationid": "30071025", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A huge flop...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198315784605", "last_played": 1478129525, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 181}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1485938179, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496897", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1485938179, "recommendationid": "29623259", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": false}]}
