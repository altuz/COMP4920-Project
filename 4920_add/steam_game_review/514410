If it was a free flash game online somewhere, it might be worth playing, but as a game which is purchased and on steam, it is not good. It is way too slow, Oh My God it is slow, a lot of stuff is broken, as far as I can tell every character is fish but if you play as the roach a giant monster which is just a bad big dog is on every level, there are like 6 weapons, there is no progression, and literally everything is a bad copy of nuclear throne. World two is literally just the sewers but bad. Once I figured out how to actually play this game I 'looped' on my first run. There might be items, but they do not work unless it looks like the player were to use an xbox controller, and I am not willing to find my xbox controller to make a bad copy of nuclear throne work a little bit better.\n\nI am not asking for a refund on this game because I have hope. Nuclear throne is one of my favorite games of all time, I was hopeful this would breathe some new life in to my love of nuclear throne and it did do that. This game reminded me of how good nuclear throne is and how mediocre this game is both in comparison and in general. I am hopeful for the future though, the developers are active and seem like they might actually be interested in making a good game.\n\nEdit: It looks like a game called massive is literally the same game but maybe a little better from the same devs, in early access, with the same textures, and at the same price, so like, they might just be a money grab? I am not sure though. Just do not buy this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198037744509", "last_played": 1499672792, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 174, "playtime_forever": 30}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1499673109, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522499", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499673309, "recommendationid": "33424879", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Oof", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198082549610", "last_played": 1500483395, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 137, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1500942050, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507862", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1500942050, "recommendationid": "33776286", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": false}]}
