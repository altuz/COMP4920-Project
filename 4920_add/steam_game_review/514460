I'm hoping that later into the game this is reduced by better stats on better vehicles.  \n\nthe game has gamepad support but only for the races, menu's are strictly controlled by the mouse and keybaord (granted thats not a terrible thing, but some people don't want to get off the sofa to navigate a menu) \n\ndialog seems like it was written by a five year old, but thats just a gripe for a game of this quality and asking price.  models are actualy really good, but I hate that the game forces you to pick one specific vehicle even though you are being asked to buy your first one and it clearly has several choices, but forces you to choose one specific one.  I hate the addition of a PWR gauge that screams \"THIS CAR IS OBJECTIVLY SUPERIOR TO THE ONE NEXT TO IT\" which really kinda destroys the point of having so many to choose from.\n\nweapon variety is decent, and once you get over the obnoxiously sensative steering, its a great time killer.  \n\nalso there is a holographic strip dancer in the corner of your garage, I give her a 10/10\nI give the game a 4/10  only because of the horrid steering, but I can still recommend it due to its horridly low price.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043427489", "last_played": 1499568584, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 545, "playtime_forever": 38}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499569367, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499569367, "recommendationid": "33392415", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
