This game has the same satisfaction factor as 5N@Freds which isnt much. Let me clerify all you have to do is complete a few nights of checking specific areas then flicking a light @ certain specified areas. All in all id still recommend this game its got several jump scare scenes that are OK but this games is worth the $2 price tag. I garantee youll get several hours out of this game and at this price its worth it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=746856253", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010860661", "last_played": 1471530062, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 1285, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1471532762, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478243", "votes_down": 14, "timestamp_updated": 1471550144, "recommendationid": "24993974", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Quality little game for the price.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7cxIdRSlug", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988131698", "last_played": 1471631369, "num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 205, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1471645801, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473833", "votes_down": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1471645801, "recommendationid": "25021386", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "didnt like it", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079664351", "last_played": 1472071616, "num_reviews": 104, "num_games_owned": 234, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1472075132, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476320", "votes_down": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1472075132, "recommendationid": "25121039", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
