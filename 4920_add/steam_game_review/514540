Anyways, let's go over the good and the bad:\n\nThe Good!\n\nThe old school RPG they promise is real: This really does play like an RPG of old, and if you have been looking for a turn-based RPG, then this will be something you can get into. You have many different options of attack, from regular atttacks to techniques/Justice Skills to healing skills, using items, etc. The exp. in this game feels really in place, as (until you get to the Elite section) you never really have to worry about grinding too much as you generally stay around the level of your enemies. This is nice if you hate grinding in games. There is alchemy among other things to make yourself stronger, and there are a few battles you might be able to skip if you want to. The game flows smoothly as a turn based RPG with a good battle system that can get you hooked on the game. Also you can get a helicopter early in the game to just zoom yourself to the dungeon you want to go to, but you don't have to use it. Still its a nice perk to avoid mundane walking around. Your team is pretty balanced as well, although you must use the same 4 heroes. There is a general healer/buffer/magic user, two main dps, and a flex member which can heal/dot/damage/etc that is generally your most durable.\n\nThe Bad!\n\nWhile the good generally outweighs the bad, (I know this part is bigger but most of these things are pasable for me anyways) there are quite a few bad things with the game. Besides a few bugs here and there (I auto-won a battle once without using a move, and lost battles during the elite fight when my team was still alive). There are some things which I can forgive since its an indie game, and some that might lure people away.\n\n1.) This is probably my biggest gripe with the game, which is the story. Of course I did not finish completely, but if you are looking for an RPG with an immersive story that keep you coming back to find out what happens, this game is not for you. There is minimal character development, as well as just story in general. There is a story, as you are trying to cure the aggromites that are making everyone in the city hostile to others. But, that's mostly it. Bosses tell you they are sorry for the anger they had, and you get told of new missions to help find the cause of the aggromites... not much else... and no cinemas either, just text. The story is a bit more minimal than a GameShark Pokemon game. Do not expect anything like an Undertale or Kingdom Hearts in terms of story here!\n\n2.) Can't see where you are on the map. Eventually you learn the map, and you might not care too much with a helicopter and if you want to explore anyways, but I do kind of wish there was a marker that let you know where you are on your map.\n\n3.) Gear is bland. There is gear in tiers, and upgrades, but that's it. Gear is Chest T1, Chest T2, etc. They are all the same, as in there isn't gear centered toward healing, magic/physical damage, etc. Weapons can vary slightly, however your heroes will only have 1 or two options. There is no real rarity in gear or finding gear off bosses either, you buy all your gear at the shop. You might be able to find rings (which are REALLY powerful) in chests, along with other cool things, but enemies generally won't drop anything cool except a few bosses might drop alchemy recipies. (And potions, but that's not REALLY that cool to get off enemies).\n\n4.) Graphics. This plays like an old school RPG. The graphics are pretty much that as well.  Of course, this is an indie game, so you shouldn't come in expecting amazing graphics, so I can let this one slide. They are not the WORST graphics you will see either.\n\n5.) Equipping upgrades requires you to unequip the item, find it in your inventory, then putting them in, then reequipping the item. Not a big deal, as the game does tell you that, but it is a bit of a bother/ time waster.\n\nAll in all, the good outweighs the bad in this indie game. It is certainly not a perfect game by any means, but it does deliver what it promises.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197998090145", "last_played": 1500610724, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 10, "playtime_forever": 1019}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1500511733, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1500513947, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501511", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1500562313, "developer_response": "Wow, that was a very detailed review and a good one.
