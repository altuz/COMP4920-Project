Play a few levels, cause they're all really short levels, and once I felt like I was hitting a wall I would step away for a few minutes then come back later. Most of the time that would lead to me completing that level I was having a hard time with. If I was still having trouble I would try one of the different levels that branch off from the path I was on and progress from there. Overall I really enjoyed my time with Ellipsis. It's got a cool \"Geometry Wars\" like style to it with simple controls and levels that will definitely challenge you. Plus there's a level creator that will let you put your games on the Steam Workshop if you're into that.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043087347", "last_played": 1487468759, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 176, "playtime_forever": 143}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487469327, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487469327, "recommendationid": "30023275", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I played this game on iOS, and absolutely loved it. The PC version took a little getting used to with the mouse, but the controls are still great and there are some new levels that weren't in the iOS game. Also, the level editor looks awesome - I think that's going to be a lot of fun!
