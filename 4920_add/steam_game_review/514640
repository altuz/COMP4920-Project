Was a big fan of the top down tank game on the old TV consoles (can't remember name lol) so this game sure brings back memories. Gonna try and give a list of pro's and con's for the game so you know what you get. I've played it for an hour so far, and played quite a lot of stages so I think I've got a good idea so far. Also I've played it with an Xbox controller if it makes any difference. Didn't try it with keyboard and mouse.\n\nAnyway, PRO's:\n\n-it starts slow and gets pretty fast paced and hectic as you get more weapons and upgrades\n-the levels aren't too long and fast to complete if you pay attention\n-weapons are pretty diverse and it's nice that they upgrade to stronger versions if you take more of them\n-there's quite a few types of modes and a lot of level types (so far), so you won't get bored fast :P\n-SPEED BOOST is life (the gold coin powerup), best powerup in the game so much fun\n-it has bosses! didn't expect that, and took me a while to figure out, but yeah :P; they seem pretty diverse so far (i've only seen 3)\n-it's nice that the environment is destructible, especially if you take the piercing rocket which just shoots through everything :P\n\n\nAnd, CON's:\n\n-there's a few glitches here and there, nothing gamebreaking or annoying so far\n-would have preffered if you could choose the color of your tank\n-enemies sometimes gank up on you if you stay in the same place too long (dunno if con but I hate it)\n-aiming has to be too precise to hit things, maybe a little leeway would be nice\n-needs more announcements when getting something (like an upgrade) or when needing to do something; at the moment it's pretty vague and you need to figure it out yourself by trial and error (i still don't know what all powerups do)\n-i think the speed of the tank should be a bit higher (most fun when speed is high)\n\nCan't think of anything else on the top of my head right now. I'm not good with reviews so don't mind me too much :P. It's just my thoughts so far.\nI recommend the game for the price it's at, especially now that it's on sale. It's fun and fast paced, and if you're a fan of top down shooting games you'll love it :P.\nI've seen games worth more that don't have as much content as this game lol.\nAlso wanna note I've only played singleplayer arcade, no multiplayer stuff.\nCheers!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006399381", "last_played": 1474234731, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 476}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1474142592, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510538", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1474142592, "recommendationid": "25554930", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Been playing with my roomie for a while now, and it's super nice we can play cooperatively in the main mission!

Writing this review, I haven't yet had an opportunity to play it with friends, but it's pretty good as a solo experience as well. What I'd like to see is greater depth as in more power-ups and more stacks and more synergies between them! That and some more video settings, something about the colors and the detailed visuals hurts my eyes and makes it difficult to get a clear view of the map and what goes on. I know that the developer is still pushing out updates some of which may adress those issues, so I expect it to get better in the future!\n\nAll in all, it's a nice game that hasn't entirely lived up to its potential (yet).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038538084", "last_played": 1480804607, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 236, "playtime_forever": 97}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1480384472, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1480384472, "recommendationid": "28013047", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
