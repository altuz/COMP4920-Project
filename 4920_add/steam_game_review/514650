The game's soundtrack, while decent, quickly gets on your nerves as the only apparent track restarts every time you die. You die in one hit (unless you have one of the upgraded planets), which takes you from being engaged in a song to no audio at all.\n\nOther gripes:\n[list]\n    [*]Occasional stutters for 1-2 seconds\n    [*]The triangle track and the two-lane traffic cone track are functionally identical gameplay\n    [*]The track always \"resets\" after every section, there's no coherence.\n    [*]The track and the song have very little in common, you can put just about any song in it's place and get the same gameplay.\n    [*]The first and second thirds of the song are basically identical, and already incredibly repetitive to begin with.\n    [*]The UI is incredibly clunky with a hard to read font and no sound effects.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, 3/10.
