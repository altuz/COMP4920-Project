Very peaceful and relaxing with an OST to support this.\n\nProblems: \n\n-Even in SANDBOX MODE, you need to do contracts and research the new modules and upgrades. I mean... what? This is what sandbox is for- to have all the upgrades to test or play around with.\n\n\n-As people said, it gets grindy fast and pretty repetitive. You can't time warp unless all your satellites are sleeping, so you have to sit and wait for contracts to be finished- even/especially when there's only one in range.\n\n-MASSIVE spook every time a new tech. is researched or contract completed.\nPLEASE give us a way to turn that notification off.\n\n-The earth survey missions,where you need to scan locations on the earth's surface, are very fustrating as you either need to alter a satellite's orbit and make it super distorted, or launch a new one. And they orbit at realistic speeds, one orbit every ~90 minutes.\n\n-Hardcore is the most fustrating and least engaging, ironically, in that everything is harder and you need more contracts done before you can use any upgrades. The starting satellite has the battery of an iPad and dies even when fully charging. Unlike other hardcore/serious game modes in other games, I don't feel much accomplishment for doing this mode.\n\n-The game would probably take about 6-7 hours of play to beat all the contracts to 100%.\n\nOverall, was worth the price I paid, I'd reccomend for very casual gaming or for an intro to Kerbal Space Program astrophysics, as it doesn't let you do much outside of orbital mechanics.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198156394052", "last_played": 1503449983, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 546}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1499668353, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509932", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499795125, "recommendationid": "33423707", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great game, love the concept\nI got this during the 2017 summer sale for about $6 \nDefinitly worth the price there\nThe only thing is that the gameplay can become a little stale after a while\nYou are constantly doing the same thing every mission.
