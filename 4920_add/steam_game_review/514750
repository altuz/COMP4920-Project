Not really polite, have a different personality that I liked much better than in some other point and click games. The main character wasn't so stuck up. and I found her comments amuzing through the game. She said what she ment, and didn't try to hide it.\n\nI've been playing alot of point and click games lately, and even if they have been pretty fun to play, they have also started to bore me a bit, because they have used the same type of maincharacter/protagonist and the puzzles and achievements are the same.\n\nThis one was...different! I realised from the start...no achievements...and it relaxed me at once. Through the game it also made me feel more comfortable using the hint button when I was stuck, normally something I would never do if there was achievements involved.\n\nThe only real thing to point out in this game was the resolution. Obviously you get used to it, but I wouldn't mind if I could have played it in fullscreen, widescreen.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197968073802", "last_played": 1499535299, "num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 267, "playtime_forever": 366}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499535601, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503106", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499535816, "recommendationid": "33380895", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
