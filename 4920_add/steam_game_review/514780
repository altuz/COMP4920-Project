I picked it up at 80% off and wasn't going for perfect levels and unlocking and training every dog, so it didn't bother me that much when I couldn't complete a level perfectly because a mechanic broke somehow, and after I muted the game in windows' own volume controller, I didn't have to listen to the achievement get jingle at full volume even though I muted the game's audio in-game. but even at this price you can find better solitiare games to play and have more fun with while you're doing other stuff in the background. definitely not recommended.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042406453", "last_played": 1499886130, "num_reviews": 34, "num_games_owned": 383, "playtime_forever": 738}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499886454, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507966", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499886454, "recommendationid": "33486553", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
