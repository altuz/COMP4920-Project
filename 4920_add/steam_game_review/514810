This game uses the keyboard to move and mouse to use your weapon. Because of this, you'll end up with a cramp as this game is difficult.  It starts off easy enough but it doesn't take long before it gets hard. I was nearly screaming from the difficulty of some of the puzzles as the enemies swarm you relentlessly. I swear, the puzzles were designed to give you a disadvantage as you have to get the timing of everything right. From the exact position of the enemy to the exact spot where you must fire your weapon, some puzzles require you to be in rhythm at the exact second to have a chance. It's that hard.\n\nYet, regardless of all that, I beat the game in 3 and a half hours. My left hand hurts like heck but I beat the game nonetheless so it's not all that bad.\n\nI'd say it's a great game. Good graphics, nice soundtrack, decent story, easy to understand controls, you can even use a controller but I didn't had one that was compatible. If you do have a controller, I suggest you use it because your hand will hurt after dying over and over again.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198211285584", "last_played": 1503727366, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 208}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503727913, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503727913, "recommendationid": "34497582", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
