The movements are not fluid enough, the powerups are hardly usable and very sluggish, and there's a massive lack of consistency between the level difficulty and the boss difficulty. The bosses are the easiest parts of the entire game! \n\nNow, I know some will say \"you're too critical about a game on sale for $0.99\", but I take gaming seriously. Quality is everything, even for games worth this amount. I have played games of all price ranges, and there are some 99 cent games out there definitely worth playing, but certainly not this one. I was horribly disappointed and this game seems unfinished to say the least. I could have kept it, but it was so bad that I requested my 99 cents back.
