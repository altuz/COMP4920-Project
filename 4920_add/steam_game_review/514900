Time...to die.\"\n\n   Okay, so that's not actually a quote from this game, but the guy who delivered possibly the most powerful monologue in the history of cinema - none other than Rutger mother-fucking Hauer himself - is back, in the role of a psychic police officer named Dan Lazarski. So okay, he's not necessarily in top voice-acting form here, but he's still pretty good (and he's still Rutger mother-fucking Hauer, so stick that in your cyber-pipe and smoke it). And okay, this game isn't quite the Blade Runner of video games, but it's pretty darned excellent just the same.\n\n   Do you like games with story? Oh, you don't. Well, off you go then, 'cause Observer is ALL ABOUT story. Sure, there's a reasonable amount of gameplay as well, but when all is said and done, it's a \"walking simulator\" with the occasional stealth-horror sequence and an unusually high level of interaction. That's INTERaction...not action-action. There's very, very little of that. So again, if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea...bugger off and find another Store page to haunt. This one doesn't need any more of your complaints about \"this was pretty linear, and there wasn't that much to do\". Almost every video game made up until a few years ago should cater quite nicely to your needs, as well as a good majority of games being released right now. Kindly leave those of us who like a bit of variety in our gaming diets in peace for once, eh?\n\n   Are they gone? Good.\n\n   So for those who are left, what does this game remind me of? Well, it's no surprise that this product comes from the good devs who brought us Layers of Fear, a fact which especially shows during the game's exceptionally nightmarish and often ingeniously clever \"Dream Eater\" sequences. Anyone impressed with Get Even should also find much to love here, provided your enjoyment of that game wasn't highly dependent upon its infrequent gun-play. The exploration and investigation elements are quite similar, however, as is the overall tone. SOMA also comes to mind, as does almost every other game influenced by \"cyberpunk\" culture. I also suspect some of the devs have seen a David Cronenberg movie or two in their time.\n\n   My only real quibble with this game? It takes a while to get going. I'll admit that I was only mildly gripped around the two-hour mark, but by four hours in I was praising the cyber-Gods for its very existence. I won't spoil much more of it for you, other than to say: expect mind-fucking aplenty. This game is an EXPERIENCE, in the best possible way.\n\n   Modern games are certainly giving modern films a run for their money in the \"relevance\" stakes, and I'll be mightily impressed if the new Blade Runner movie is as good a film as this is a game. Is it perfect? No. Is it sorta-kinda absolutely fucking AMAZING, irrespective?! I'd say so, yes. But as always, each to their own.\n\n   Bloober Team, consider me a fan. Between you, Frictional, and Red Barrels, the horror and sci-fi genres are alive and well again. Feel free to drop back any time, preferably sooner than later.\n\n   Verdict: 9.5/10.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 323, "steamid": "76561198048974498", "last_played": 1506367020, "num_reviews": 429, "num_games_owned": 1513, "playtime_forever": 463}, "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_created": 1506417450, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543817", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506417459, "recommendationid": "35218455", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A good game, although not excellent.

Well, yes, it's a good game, but don't expect anything extraordinary. It's good as a horror game and has a precise storyline.

His restrained, almost mumbled approach may seem questionable but I think it fits the grit of a dusty detective. \n\nThe detective sequences are conceptually a no brainer inclusion, contributing to the gritty neonoir pastiche, but they are a tad simple - a double-edged sword that keeps the story moving but being bereft of any 'aha' moments. \nHowever, this detective is not of the garden variety, but rather the eponymous Observer whose uniquely cyberpunk conceit is the ability to interrogates witnesses by \u2018jacking\u2019 into their minds. This is where most of the horror aspect occurs, in a number of Inception/Cell-like sequences of psychedelic extravaganza, you try to gather information while navigating the deteriorating mental landscapes of increasingly depraved individuals. \n\nThe chase sequences however are the only true lowlight; being more frustrating than thrilling, and breaking immersion at their worst. \n\nThere is very little gameplay other than the aforementioned sequences, so for haters of 'walking simulators' this might not be your cup of tea. but if you don't barf at the genre, then you are in for the one of the best cyberpunk atmospheres i've ever experienced \u2013 yes, even including films.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198036255381", "last_played": 1504575123, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 397, "playtime_forever": 638}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1504691127, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512474", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504695516, "recommendationid": "34772435", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game's seizure warning is no joke.

Just a short review.\n\nPros: \n\n1. Atmosphere: Well thought out and detailed world with convincing voice acting makes for an immersive game. \n2. Bizzare story and exploration around the main quest is encouraged. There are collectibles but they don't add much to gameplay. \n3. Simple controls and mechanics keep the pace of the game moving; it's always obvious where to go and there is a quest log if you're unsure. \n4. Just the right length for this type of game; I clocked in around 13 hours with some basic exploration. I'm sure you could complete the game at around 10-12 hours. The conclusion to the plot was satisfying for me; and its take on 1984 was cool and adds a few modern ideas that make such a world even more terrifying.\n5. Not really a horror game, but more of a psychological horror. \n6. Graphics/music/audio are all top notch. Good work. \n7. Small Layers of Fear references were a nice touch. \n8. Fire and Sword mini-game was fantastic and felt rewarding to figure out puzzles on your own. \n\nCons: \n\n1. Monster stealth sections are awful. I think they could be completely removed without even changing the basic idea of the game. There are about 6 of these sections in the game where the protagonist can die; and they add nothing to the experience. Just doesn't fit the mood and theme of the game. Having said that; they are probably more 'gamey' than the adventure/story/exploration components in the rest of the game. *I usually don't enjoy insta-death sections in horror games though, so take that as you will. \n2. A falling through the floor glitch occured for me about 5 times throughout my time in the game; didn't ruin it for me but it definitely sucked to have to restart stealth sections. I have read that others have experienced this glitch right out of a checkpoint which broke the progression in their game. Hopefully gets patched. \n\n\nCons aren't enough to take away from the fact this is an amazing game that shouldn't be passed up.
