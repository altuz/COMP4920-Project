I've always wonder how big the terracotta army figures are. One sculpture was on the cover of my Latin book in high school, so it's amazing to finally come face to face with it. Lots of well-known touchstones and a massive outdoor statue. This is a collection that would be very difficult to see IRL because they reside in so many different locations.\n\nThe upper floor was just added. It's got some interesting sculptures too. The new paintings are a big letdown despite being able to understand their scale. They have a repeating canvas pattern specular highlight, but topographically have no relation to the painting. I know it would be incredibly difficult to scan accurately, but I feel like without that element they're not worth displaying. Seeing some of Van Gogh's work in person completely changed my perspective on them and flat versions completely misrepresent them.\n\nBut, you can't beat free, and in fact you should probably donate a few dollars so they can continue to expand this awesome project.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197978266558", "last_played": 1486324064, "num_reviews": 200, "num_games_owned": 1335, "playtime_forever": 53}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1486325006, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506716", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486325069, "recommendationid": "29727730", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not going to lie, I thought this was going to be some cheap looking deal, thought there's no way that art could look any good in a Vive with the SDE.
