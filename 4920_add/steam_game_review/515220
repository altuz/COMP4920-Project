You can easily find what you are looking for and never get lost. It does not take up too much space of the screen and they like adding pictures to the main menu which makes it look even better.\n\nAs in previous games, there is no mouse support which could make one or the other hardcore pc gamers raise their pulse rate.\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]\nI really like the way that Codemasters went with the graphics. The previous title, F1 2016, had too much color and brightness. F1 2017 looks much cooler and welcome compared to its predecessor. In the options menu you can change many settings to fine tune your visual experience and performance. The Benchmark tool is one of the best that the games of the current time have to offer and it lets you test your performance with the settings you have selected on any track as well as condition you like.\n\nThere are a few flaws in the game connected to the graphics. Even with motion blur set to 0%, the surrounding textures start to blur when the car is in motion. This can make the game look fuzzy and irritating while driving. There are also many reports of missing textures (textures are completely black) and colored lines appearing on the screen.\n\n[h1]AUDIO[/h1]\nThe audio of the game has not changed too much from its predecessor. The engine sounds are the same with a little louder whistle from the turbo. Contact and crash sounds are also mostly the same. In the options menu, you can change the volume of the different sounds, such as master sound, voice, car etc. . You can also switch to push to talk or deactivate voice chat from others in multiplayer lobbies completely. Your ingame engineer, Jeff, can also be changed to speak only when there are critical situations. \n\nThere are also issues with audio in the game as well. After patch 1.6, many players report missing audio or audio stutter. Unfortunately, in order to turn off the commentators at the beginning and end of a session, the player must turn down the voice volume, which also turns down the individuals talking to you in the paddock area.\n\n[h1]CONTROLS[/h1]\nSetting up the controls in the menu has become more detailed and user friendly compared to the previous title. The player can now use presets for his wheel or change them to make his/her own mapping which he/she can save. There are also wheel specific settings that the player can change, like the throttle saturation or wheel dead zone.\n\n[h1]CAR HANDLING[/h1]\nThe handling of the cars is the best that Codemasters has ever programmed. The the cars have a lot of mechanical and aerodynamical grip meaning that the car has very good traction exiting and very good grip through high speed corners. It just feels like you can do everything with the car. The force feedback on the wheels has been increased and the player can now feel every single bump on the road.\n\nMany players report the force feedback disabling completely all of a sudden in multiplayer races. Decreasing the enviromental effects can make up a few tenths of a second.\n\n[h1]MODERN CARS[/h1]\nThe modern cars models have been recreated very accurately from the first grand prix.\n\nThe liveries are not correct though. FIA have made a rule to make the drivers more visible by increasing the driver number and short name on the cars. The goal was to personalize the cars more to their drivers. F1 2017 players are still waiting for an update from Codemasters to make the liveries accurate to the current ones in real life. Due to the PEGI 3 rating of the game, Codemasters are not allowed to include alcoholic sponsors, which are on the cars in real life as well.\n\n[h1]CLASSIC CARS[/h1]\nCodemasters brought back the classic cars mode that was last seen in F1 2013. The player can do custom events and challenges using one of the 12 available classic cars from the past 30 years. The handling and the looks of the cars are breathtaking and the same goes for the sounds. The player can also use them in multiplayer. \n\nDue to the different programming of the engines and gearboxes, they cannot be set to the same performance in multiplayer lobbies.\n\n[h1]EVENT MODE[/h1]\nCodemasters use the event mode to challenge the F1 players. They also use it as a qualifying method for the new esports event that was announced. The events are changed from week to week.\n\n[h1]CAREER MODE[/h1]\nCodemasters have again taken the career mode to a higher level of realism, expanding on the fundaments of its predecessor, by adding more practice programms such as fuel saving and race strategy as well as adding the ability to change parts of the engine and the entire gearbox should they wear to much. Like in the real sport, the player will receive grid penalties should he/she resort to a fifth unit of an engine part or change a gearbox. The player can reduce the wear by either following the instructions in the parts descriptions or upgrading the duration department of the Research&Development Tree, which is a massive upgrade to the previous, simple and overpowerd upgrade system of the last title. It is devided into 4 departments, which are durability, powertrain, aerodynamics and chassis. Each of the departments have their own branches of minor and major upgrades that increase the performance of the upgraded department. The process is much slower and more expensive than in the previous game, making the comletion of practice programms vital for the car development. In total the R&D tree covers 115 unlockable upgrades. The safety car (SC) and virtual safety car (VSC) have been improved. Players will not be able to exploit the VSC without being penalized by pushing over the delta limit right before it ends.\n\nThe replay mode has not changed.\n\n[h1]MULTIPLAYER[/h1]\nThe multiplayer of the game has not changed a lot from the previous title. The only additions are 2 spectator slots in lobbies, short layouts of a few tracks and a ranking system, which saves the players stats and increases his/her level by gaining points through races.\n\nFrom launch onwards, the multiplayer was very unstable. Players were disqualified at the end of races and collsions did not work. Cars that retire stop on the side of the roads and never disappear, causing a constant yellow flag situation in that sector. Blue flags are not shown and corner cutting is very easy to get away with as the system somehow does not recognize the player going 10 feet left or right from where they are supposed to be. The spectator cameras have not been improved at all from its predecessor and there are still no live standings with gaps. The multiplayer still has no report option to report players who crash others out on purpose, ruining the experience for others.\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\nF1 2017, in terms of the single player aspect, it is by far the best that Codemasters have ever created. The rules and regulations as well as practice programs and upgrades are very realistic, accurate, balanced and a lot of fun. The cars feel amazing to drive the classic cars make you feel like Michael Schumacher in his glory days. The multiplayer however is a literal mess. The bugs and glitches as well as trolls ruin the experience. There have been no major improvements except 2 spectator slots, which do not have the tools to make good live streams for esports and league events. Through already many patches and a little luck, some multiplayer sessions work well and as they are supposed to, but most times they unfortunately do not, making leagues not possible at this point.\n\n[h1]MY OPINION[/h1]\nThe multiplayer has been ignored this year too. It is a mess and league cannot run properly like in F1 2013. Leagues are as much of a reason for Codemasters success as the Career mode, making it as important.\n\nUnfortunately Codemasters does not seem to care too much.\nI still recommend the game though.\n\n\nMy rating: 8/10 (the career mode saved it from a 5/10)\n\nLet me know what you think!\nI am open for respectful discussions!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 108, "steamid": "76561198023671513", "last_played": 1506278938, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 96, "playtime_forever": 2103}, "votes_up": 19, "timestamp_created": 1505382562, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538532", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505383296, "recommendationid": "34945448", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "F1 2017 takes the F1 franchise to a whole new level, and will most likely be the very last F1 game I buy from Codies, because next year, cars will get a halo. That kills all hype for next year.\n\nUnlike 2016, in 2017 you can push the car to your maximum pace without risking going off track, because there is much more downforce and grop (Just like in real life lol).\n\nPros:\n\n- Classic Cars (A dream come true for any F1 fan)\n- Short layouts for some of the tracks (which could make some races interesting, especially online)\n- Cockpit view has much better visibility than last year (You don't even need to tweak its Camera Settings to see the track ahead well if you're a cockpit view player)\n- Helmet customizable at any time (Colours and design as well. This could be particularly nice if you're changing teams and need to change the helmet colours to reflect your current team's)\n- Race pace is much more realistic and rewarding (You don't need to push like a madman and abuse lock ups on braking zones for a good pace, consistency and smoothness is key)\n- Transition from Formation Lap to Race Start Light sequence no longer triggered by a black screen (for added immersion)\n- HUGE R&D development system that will take you almost all 10 seasons to max out (Instead of the ridiculous 2-season long R&D system last year)\n- Engine Management (Must manage the engine wear in order to maintain reliability on top during the course of a season)\n- Pit Limiter is now Manual (must trigger it before crossing the pit lane entrance, which is a nice feature)\n- Pit stops now have manual launch (To make you have a more active role during pitstops)\n- Multiplayer now features a Rank system with Stats (Wins, Podiums, Poles, Average Qualifying Position, Average Finishing Position, and more)\n- AI difficulty adjustable from 1 to 110 (Instead of presets like Easy Medium Hard etc.. This allows players of all skill levels to enjoy a much more realistic race. AI will no longer be too slow or too fast for the player)\n\nCons:\n- Formation lap is still not fully manual! (It's a huge turn off for hardcore simulation F1 fans)\n- Pit driving still not Manual! (I hate not being able to drive the car inside the pits myself, as doing so could giev you a much more realistic pace over the course of a race)\n- Damage model remains unchanged (Apart from rear wheel damage, which is the only change so far in my book)\n- Multiplayer hasn't worked on lag issues at all (Not sure why)\n\nDespite all these Cons, this game will remain one of my absolute eternal favorite games of all time. As an F1 fan, it gives me the immersion I need to feel like I'm actually part of the F1 grid.\n\nThe AI difficulty is much better than last year. I can finally enjoy a good challenging race that will keep me focused and make me feel like there is work to do (such as catching up on the car ahead after a pitstop)\n\n9.5/10 <3", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 597, "steamid": "76561198281010141", "last_played": 1506881120, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 60, "playtime_forever": 6323}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1504634820, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526658", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1504634820, "recommendationid": "34761668", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is just super!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 626, "steamid": "76561198040441754", "last_played": 1506614789, "num_reviews": 53, "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_forever": 5203}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1505920266, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520714", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505920266, "recommendationid": "35086012", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fantastic title. As a fan of sim racing I have the whole kit and kaboodle, nothing fancy like a direct drive wheel (I own a CSW 2.5) but for what shortcomings F1 2017 has I believe it to be the best complete package out there for racing fans.\n\nThe sim community seems to have a few gripes with this game it's simple physics and the fact that using certain driving aids such as traction control makes you faster as well as rather flat FFB feel. While they have improved the FFB to make it more lively it pales in comparison to sim titles such as AC or iRacing making it much harder to judge what the car is doing. Part of what makes those titles feel so real is the FFB and its direct feeling that F1 titles have yet to achieve.\n\nThat said this game offers one of the most complete packages. What it lacks in simulated physics it makes up for with great AI, a career mode that makes you feel like a real F1 driver put under the stresses of performing (improved further with the previous point about the harder AI). It has a nice progression feel with its tech tree making you feel excited to test out the latest upgrade package to see what edge it gives.\n\nSimulations offer realism in terms of handling, tyre physics, car physics in the case of iRacing laser scanned tracks that are pinpoint accurate. But most of these games are built around the idea of short races or hot lapping etc leaving larger races to be done in private leagues. F1 2017 nails what racing is like, letting you sit down and experience it anytime you like, you have to manage your fuel. Pit strategy can change instantly as a safety car comes out. You can be left with your pants down after pushing to hard early and burning up your tyres. All this plus also having to really think about how your manage your four power units in the racing year and what upgrades will be the best for your teams current position. Its that tense that I seriously do my own out-lap and in-lap to make sure the car is not being over worked... Its extremely fun.\n\nF1 2017 is not a simulation, yet it offers the most realistic racing scenarios around and has me coming back every day for another race. It might not have the physics of the sims such as AC & iRacing but all that quickly melts away when you turn the AI up to the point it will really tests you and you try and make it as a formula 1 driver, the pressure is real, the thrill is like no other and shiz gets real when it starts to rain.

Career mode is a direct upgrade from last years, especially since RnD is no longer a gimmick. Online feels neglected, but the classic cars are a nice touch and provide some much needed extra content. Overall, this game has more replayability than 2016, and feels more polished.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1] My spiel [/h1]\n[i] Scroll down for pros and cons [/i]\n\nAfter years and years of disappointment, Codemasters have finally published a title that does F1 justice.  I have been a fan of F1 since the 2012 season, and started playing the Codemasters games since 2013. Year after year the games kept getting worse. F1 2016 was a breath of fresh air, but still not the title that I was looking for. The career mode was heavily hyped, but the car development was just a gimmick. \n\nWhen F1 2017 came out this year, I was skeptical. I did not pre-order it, breaking the 4 year chain of pre-ordering f1 games. After seeing a couple of positive reviews, I paid the premium price and so far I have not regretted it one bit. The cars are much more exciting to drive than they have been on previous games, and the career mode progression finally feels realistic. For me, its the small details that make this game better than all the previous f1 games. F1 2016 had a great  feel on track, but the menus and controls were a mess. This year, it feels like Codies have actually put in some effort into every aspect.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n- [b] Career Mode [/b]\nCareer mode finally feels progressive and realistic. The practice programs have expanded, giving them more relevance. You really need the resource points for car development this year. The R n D feels great this year. The resource tree gives you the ability to upgrade certain elements of your car that might be lacking in performance. Unlike 2016, each car you drive will have different needs. A McLaren Honda will need a lot of work on the engine, while a Williams will need a lot of chassis work done. The classic car events are a nice deviation from your standard career mode, although putting them right after a race can make them tedious, especially after you just finished an 100% race at Monaco.\n- [b] The Racing [/b]\nThe handling model keeps getting better and better every year. The cars this year are much faster, making them much more fun to drive. The AI has been tweaked this year, and is much more aggressive. They are still quite dumb, but it is an upgrade over 2017. Codies have also implemented manual clutch on pitstops as well as the pit limiter for entering the pits. It really doesnt change much at all, but I like it. \n- [b] Classic Cars [/b]\nGlad they are back. Really enjoyed them in F1 2013, really enjoying them now. Nice to have a more modern selection of \"classics\"\n- [b] Weather [/b]\nFinally, Codies has given us a more unpredictable weather system. There is no longer a clear crossover point in between dry and wet. This year you will actually need to think about when to come in to change compounds, and you might get it wrong.\n- [b] The Small Details [/b]\nThe menu is cleaner, it is somewhat easier to map controls, Loading screens have some pictures now, not just a boring white screen, AI now has a difficulty slider (THANK GOD)\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n- [b] AI [/b]\nWhile the aggressiveness of the AI makes them more racey, they still can be quite stupid at times. The AI really likes to park it on the racing line in qualifying, which is really annoying when you are on a fast lap. \n\n- [b] Licensing Issues [/b]\nWhile we have classic cars, we don't have the historic driver names.\n\n- [b] Bugs [/b]\nCould have been a bit more polished, quite a few glitches and bugs. I got boosted up 10 places while on the formation lap for no reason.\n\n- [b] Online [/b]\nStill neglected\n\n-[b] Strictness on Mods [/b]\nThis has been a big problem since 2015.

Yet they still continue to release games riddled with bugs and issues. They even have bugs in this game they had in the same game in 2010.\n\nIts completly unaccepptable to ask a full full asking price for an unfinished game. Its clear there is no investment in development or testing. Everything seems ot go into in just the yearly increments and the occasional feature, rather than working on the core game or making sure its actually working.\n\nSome of the bugs I've seen:\nMcLaren Engine upgrades not working\nAI cars crashing into the safety car\nPlayers given penalties behind they safety car when they shouldn't\nAI overtaking players behind the safety car when they shouldnt\nPlayers being allowed ot overtake the SC when they shouldnt\nPlayers not being released from pit stops\nAI using dry tires in wet conditions but going at dry pace\nAI not updating their pit strategy with adverse weather effects (will change from slicks to slicks in pit window, then immediatly to wets and vice versa)\nAI not updating their strategy when there is a Safety car\nAI lap times increase unrealistically in practice and qualy sessions if you fast forward or skip session\nDifficulty between Practice/Qualy/Race, players have to change difficulty manually between sessions to fix it\nGrid penalties for players if they use their gearbox for seven races, even though you only a gearbox for 5 races\nCompenent wear is too high during 50% and 100% races\nMultiplayer completly broken\nAI too slow in wet conditions\nTeams pace unrealistic (E.G. Williams)\n\nAnd thats not even getting to the bits that are a bit rubbish:\nCharacter and driver models are shocking, if codemasters can hire an proper artist and animator they just shouldnt have them in the game, its 2017 for christ sake.\nExact same driver animations from last year and re-used for every single race and podium celebration. Same with cut scenes, drievr enegineer and driver manager. Oh god the engineer is the ugliest thing ever and you have to stare it face for a whole new year.\nSound is poor, especially when mods on other games have made it better.\nHandling is improved but still poor FFB compared to other games.\nDamage model is still naff\n\nBasically, don't buy.
