The ambience and atmospehere is perfect for the survival horror genre. You wander out on to an open street and see a ton of zombies just standing there, as you spot the open building you hope they don't see you as you make a dash for it. Unfortunately you are not lucky enough and have to hold them off along the way! The sounds and model designs are great, along with a UI that is simple yet functional. There is no stutter, no missing textures or areas that feel empty. I agree it is a little too short and we do get left with items/keys and there is no end scene. I have to add, this as a series has a lot of potential if the time and effort can go in circumstances allowing. As stated in the description though, this is an episode and I hope there will be more to follow on! Good work on the first two Inventions, they are by no means the worst games on here, and with the possible potentials it could be one of the great survival horrors indie made", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198083896343", "last_played": 1503333757, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 140, "playtime_forever": 33}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503227687, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499255", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1503227687, "recommendationid": "34371058", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
