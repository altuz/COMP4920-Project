When I first started to play, it made me so sick, the starting sensitivity is way too high and the color combination is awful. After I turned down the sensitvity the game was very easy for me. The achievements are a little grindy like die 100 times which is pretty easy but still takes some time. As a game itself it is very boring and is not very fun to play. The music was okay; nothing amazing but okay to listen to. If you are looking for an easy perfect game this is for you when it's on sale. I would not recommend this to anyone else besides achievement hunters.\n\nThis was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\n\nOnce we have a 100 followers on our group there will be a game giveaway, but only the followers have a chance to win.\n\nIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

You just have to dodge some obstacles and can collect only 2 different kinds of powerups - health or slow virus. The controls are bad. Because of A D left right and W for jump. If you choose for left or right the ball keeps on spinning into this direction around the middle pole. It's quite nervy and cause the most crashes. Also achievements only popup after leaving or reentering he game. Stil not fixed. To protect you from epileptic reaction I recomment to choose some non flashy wall/surfaces on your sphere and the pole.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035285721", "last_played": 1493538847, "num_reviews": 397, "num_games_owned": 3507, "playtime_forever": 76}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1493588646, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506787", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1495835748, "recommendationid": "31473507", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
