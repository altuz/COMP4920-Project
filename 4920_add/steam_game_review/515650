The look and feel of the game is wonderful and unique. The sound and music are on point. The gameplay is fun and fast-paced, although sometimes fustrating. The developer is active, fixes bugs posted on the forums, consistantly adds content. The one thing that may shy people away from the game is that not much is explained, the tutorial is barebones and there are not that many guides to help new players learn how the game works. The broken english also doesn't help players understand items but is a fun addition. If you can push yourself to learn how the game works and decipher the broken english this game is worth is money.\n\nPros:\n+ Good music and sound design\n+ Gameplay\n+ Graphics\n+ Active dev\n+ High replay-ability\n\nCons:\n- Hard to understand whats happening at first\n- Some of the bosses and enemies are annoying\n- Items are hard to understand due to the broken english\n\nOverall:\n9/10 Buy this game!\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1205, "steamid": "76561198125699188", "last_played": 1506813348, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_forever": 4348}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505628208, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500160", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505628208, "recommendationid": "35015275", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fantastic little game.
