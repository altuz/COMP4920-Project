It mirrors the source material (river city ransom) but injects some interesting and unique mechanics that make it its own game. The 3-D really pops and the town elements are a little deeper than RCR. Being able to play co-op is a plus. \n\nThe game needs a lot of work, but for the price, it's not a bad way to start.

That says a lot about this project. It's as different from the sequel as this game is from the original.\n\nIt does resemble an Apogee classic more than River City Ransom. Think Apogee Classic 3D as a beat em up game instead of an FPS with RPG elements and unlockables.  \n\nI know it's Early Access but thats the best part. Its already quite impressive. It still can improve and after the release of it's competetor it might do just that, on the third stage now. Only getting more fun and I'm even more impressed. If this is unfininished I cant even imagine what is to come.\n\nFantastic job!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198165480221", "last_played": 1499565603, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_forever": 399}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1487641715, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501223", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500340810, "recommendationid": "30070102", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I have to say as a long time gamer, I love this game. It evokes a bit of nostalgia from old NES days and offers some really unique looking aesthetics. \nIt is early access so there are some occasional bugs and glitches but overall it's well worth the buy and I want to see where they take things. \nIt has lots of playable characters that are unlocked through gameplay (as opposed to how other games do this via DLC) which really adds to my fondness for this game! I love finding secrets and unlocking skills/characters. \n\nIt does take a little bit of getting used to as things can sometimes appear a bit cluttered but overall it has solid gameplay which makes it a good game to pick up and play whenever you feel the need for some old style baddie bashing fun. \n\nIf you like beat-em up games that are a bit retro-ish, give this one a shot, it's worth the price of admission!\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197991806381", "last_played": 1491664053, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 1834, "playtime_forever": 184}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1486329077, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500255", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1486329077, "recommendationid": "29729092", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So far it has no depth.
