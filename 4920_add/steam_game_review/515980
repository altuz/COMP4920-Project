Make no mistake, it's definitely taken a spill from the ugly tree hitting every branch on the way down, but Its a fun little game. \n\nPlaying the \"unbalanced\" Traitors was actually the most fun for me, as it required much more planning and making desperate flanking maneuvers compared to the sledgehammer efficiency of the Imperium. And for me that works! As for the inaccuracy of troops I'm from the days of old school PnP RPGs and I've seen the dice make enough mockery of statistics to not even flinch when my troops appereantly forget to load their weapons with live ammo and seemingly just fires randomly into the air anyway. However, it's not my experience that the enemy faction is any better off. It's just blind luck at times which can be frustrating to some but for me it kinda' works (seeing the same thing on my analog 40k battlefields all the time anyway). \n\nSo to sum up a short review... it's ugly, it's simplistic, and it's fun! \n\nIf you can get it on sale, I would recommend giving it a shot (though you might miss ;P ).
