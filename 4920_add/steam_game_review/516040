Great for anyone who wants a game they can play with just the mouse. \n\nCan be a bit glitchy at times, but for a new release it runs really well, hasn't crashed on me yet.

I'm usually pretty flexible but the auto-camera and more so the inability to have multiple robots moving at once completely ruined the game for me. If that's the point, then this game isn't so much about strategy as it is about precision clicking.  Some people may enjoy that, but I did not. The camera always following your currently selected robot was actually nausiating after a while even. moreover, the game doesn't even do you the favor of auto-selecting the next robot available, despite that being literally your only option. You have to click on it yourself.\n\nMusic is also too repetitive, but that's pretty minor compaint. If you like fast precision clicking, get this game.
