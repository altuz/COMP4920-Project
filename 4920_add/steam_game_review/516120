An interesting mechanic is that the main character at the start can not fight back, can only bounce on enemy heads. This means when fighting bosses, you need to collect butterflys to transform into a beast that can fight back, so often fights are tense as you sit and defend. Quite challenging, recommend for people who love non - linear level design and varied level styles.\n\nFor further viewing, here is a link to part 1 of my let's play.

It can be much more difficult than the early levels suggest, and a few parts have been quite frustating with slippery feeling controls.  But overall the platforming has felt solid and fair, and at this point I think the fun outweighs the frustation to the point where I will try to complete the game.

I have a small amount of playtime in here but what this single dev has accomplished is just incredibly spicy.\n\nTaking sweet little Juno through the dark mysterious tellings of this world is quite the experience, and really tells a lot through the journey the little harmless spirit makes in this game. This game is a reminder that it's not about the destination, but the friends we make and challenges we overcome along the way that help us grow as a person. This really spoke to me on several levels. I sweat a lot, I laughed, I cried, but most of all I found this game to just be incredibly spicy. A real spicy meatball. The best part about the game was when Shiv commited sudoku and I felt immediate joy in my life as Juno was once again free to express herself without being oppressed by a giant koreaboo mongoloid who thinks all loafs are rolls.\n\nOverall I give it a solid 8/10 because I'm so bad at it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066794142", "last_played": 1482199053, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_forever": 24}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1482202195, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495785", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1482202195, "recommendationid": "28479256", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
