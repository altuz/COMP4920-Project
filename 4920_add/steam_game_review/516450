I personally believe\nmuch of the text that has brackets could have easily been shown\nto the player instead of explained. Video games have a visual advantage\ncompared to novels, and showing a story through text can break\na player's experience.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1] - 1/5\nA lot of text, as expected from a \"story-driven\" game, but as most of it is text,\nthere is barely any interaction besides clicking through the text box.\nThis game may have been better as a visual novel.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1] - 0/5\nInconsistent art style with the map tiles and the characters.\nIt would've been better to stick with one style over another.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1] - 1/5\nClear use of RTP assets, which are pretty bland and generic.\n\n[h1]Custom Assets[/h1] - 1/5\nThis is the big selling point of RPG Maker games, and Glory by Example fails this.\nThe main characters are unique, but are built by the RPG Maker Character Creator.\nThe primary assets used are from the Pop! Horror City pack,\nwhich is a great looking retro resoure.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1] - 1/5\nI cannot recommend this game, especially at this price. Avoid like the Affliction.\n\n[h1]Some advice from someone who isn't really qualified to speak on such things, but wants to help out.[/h1]\n\n- Stick to one art style.\n\n- Justify the price in comparison to other games and other things of value for $10.\nMinecraft Pocket Edition is $7. FNAF is $5. Both games have higher production value.\n\n- Show more of the story. Give each character their own moments.\nI've come to appreciate and like Elanor's story more than Kayle's\nbecause I don't know anything about Kayle going 30mins into the game.\n\n- Take advantage of the visual aspect of video games. There are some clear hints of the story\npreviously being written and converted into an RPG Maker game. Some things are worth better showing than telling.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994600441", "last_played": 1487344362, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 397, "playtime_forever": 384}, "votes_up": 42, "timestamp_created": 1472345600, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574960", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1472345722, "recommendationid": "25194875", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I've only played two hours or so, so far, but at this point I'm already a little fatigued.

It is more like a visual novel than most of the other rpg maker games in have played.\nThe story was interesting with few twists but I have still have a few questions that have been and probably will be left un answered. Way to many chapters for me as some of them have very little content. I also found there were things that I didn't know or showed any signs of being they until the last half an hour of the game and this made it rushed. The Virus for me just got out of control, I felt the impending doom with  every turn but every turn it felt like someone asked what was going to go wrong next and the answer was Lets evolve the virus. The RPG battle system for the little bit it was in, should have either been a more of a thing whether it was just fighting humans or the undead or just not there at all.\nSome of the characters were well done but others i didnt spend nearly enough time with or know enough about to feeling anything for when they passed on.\nIf i am completely on honest i would buy this however not for the \u00a36.99 price tag, I believe its a bit high.

It clearly didn't want to spoil anything.)\n+ Funny parts are funny, and plot twists are real. (Which makes the sad parts even sadder.)\n+ Game runs smooth as butter. (Zero performance issues to report.)\n+ The game's story and twists really build and shine the farther you get into it. (Looking at you mid-game).\n+ I wasn't ready for those endings.
