I bet this game will be a simple yet still enjoyable VR shooter\"...or so I thought.  The title of this game is exactly what this game is.  The controls are super clunky, the animations are god awful, and most of the gameplay elements are either poorly implemented or simply don't work.\n\nLet's talk about the guns... The three guns that you can choose from: pistol, shotgun, machine gun.  They each have decent sound effects and the aiming is done well, not that you will ever have to aim more than 10 feet.  The pistol and machine gun both need to be \"manually\" reloaded; however, the shotgun has unlimited ammo for some reason and all you have to do is pump it.  I say \"manually\" because you do have to press a button to release the mag, put the new one in place, and kock the gun to chamber the next round... However, in order to grip the slide of the pistol or charging handle of the rifle or the grip of the shotgun, you just have to place your hand in the general area without pressing any other button, like the trigger.  This leads to you constantly pulling back the pistol slide at unwanted times or pulling back the charging handle of the rifle the same way.  Why you don't need to hold a trigger down to grab the secondary portion of the gun is beyond me.  It leads to clunky controls that feel awkward as all hell.  Then there is the action of grabbing a gun off of your hip.  Once again, instead of needing to actually GRAB the gun like any other VR title that has been made yet, the guns just slide into your magnetic hands anytime you drop your arms to rest your shoulders.  Now, you might think \"Gee, Vash, why would you want to put your gun down anyways?\"  Perhaps because duel wielding DOESN\"T WORK!  When you grab a gun from your hip, it has an empty mag, so you must reload the gun.  Now, let's consider how that effects duel wielding with manual reloading.  You have two pistols, ready to shoot some zeds. *click click* they are both empty.  You drop the mags from the guns and now have no way  of sliding new mags in place because your hands are occupied by the guns.  So you put the left one on your hip which replaces it with a full mag in your left hand.  Now you can reload the one in the right hand.  Now you grab the left handed gun off your hip and put away your right handed gun to reload the left gun...WTF, the empty mag is magically back in the gun, so you release the mag again and reload the left gun.  Then you grab the right gun off your hip, finally ready to kill some zeds *BANG click* WTF!!! The right gun is empty again because it touched your hip.  WHO THOUGHT OF THIS?!?!  I watched the store page video carefully and noticed that they never show the guns being reloaded when duel wielding.  They do, however, show both pistol slides clicking back into place, which you can do, but you can't put a mag in the guns with both hands occupied.  It's borderline false advertising.\n\nThen there is the singular melee weapon.  You swing it.  You smash zombies with it.  That works.  Then you try to throw it... Once again, unlike every other good VR shooter out there, instead of actually throwing the axe with the momentum of the Vive controllers, you just point and click the trigger and  watch the axe rocket from your hand... It feels sooooo bad, and the aiming makes no sense because you're trying to fire a throwing axe like a gun.  They, once again, do a good job hiding this  in the video, but it is falsely representing how the physics work\n\nThe grenade is what it is.  You awkwardly pull the pin by placing your off hand over the pin and clicking the trigger of the hand with the nade... and throw it a matter of 4 feet.  I flung my arm as hard as I could and the nade never went more than 4 or 5 feet.  Which doesn't matter, I guess, because you are fighting the zeds in the smallest of rooms EVER.\n\nThat leads me to the room that you are fighting in and the zeds themselves.  The room is tiny.  I mean frickin tiny.  The zombies spawn no more than 7 or 8 feet from you.  They spawn out of dark hallways, and some of them throw axes and shoot guns, and they can shoot those guns before they have left the pitch black hallways!\n\nThis game is so small and has so little content that it is actually amazing how many things that can be bad.\n\nIf this game was early access, I could go easier on it for being new and in alpha, because that's what it feels like.  Do not get this game.  Killing Zombies is more fun, and has online co-op.  Get that instead.\n\nGranted, I only had to play for half an hour to come across all of these blaring issues, so I will play a bit more to discover whether or not it was an operator error and update the review if so, but I don't think that is the case. -----  Nope, the game sucks.  I tried and tried, but the mechanics are just broken.  It certainly doesn't help that there are ZERO option for the game or instructions.\n\nIt's refund time.\n\nDo not support this team.  The way they hide the flaws within the video is clever without a doubt, but it is shady none the less\n\nBtw, I spelled c.o.c.k kock, because c.o.c.k is a dirty word to steam lolol", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197975051410", "last_played": 1477798592, "num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 900, "playtime_forever": 27}, "votes_up": 108, "timestamp_created": 1477794361, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610520", "votes_down": 27, "timestamp_updated": 1477809891, "recommendationid": "26305511", "votes_funny": 9, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "At least the title isn't lying.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198118770718", "last_played": 1488351753, "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 199, "playtime_forever": 19}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1488351805, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521286", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1488351805, "recommendationid": "30255481", "votes_funny": 10, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Picked thisa game up on sale for $0.99 becasue, well why not at that price?\nEvery time I try to run the game it crashes..... :(\nI've tried multiple times, but it simply will not run.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197974709811", "last_played": 1490919838, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 560, "playtime_forever": 37}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1488647759, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1488647759, "recommendationid": "30319028", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "You are trapped in a small police office with a lot of zombies walking and crawling towards you from all directions. There are some weapons and guns, but all fire arms need to be reloaded manually and it takes several shots to kill a zombie so I played the game with two axes in my hands slicing and dismembering incoming zombies and watching an increasingly big piles of gore on the ground. You can teleport through the office, but I played it more like a traditional (room scale) wave shooter just staying in my 3m x 3m. Every wave has different twists like no weapons but fist fighting or smaller or giant zombies. All in all it is a B-movie style game with no story, but a lot of action and gore. I had fun playing it and will be coming back to this title from time to time for sure.\n\nUpdate: I just figured out how reloading works. Actually it is simple and adds a totally different difficulty to the game since while reloading teleporting is not only useful but essential! So first you can't have a melee weapon in one hand and a pistol in the other. So just grab a melee weapon or a pistol/rifle. With the pistol in one hand the other hand needs to pull the slide back and forth before you can shoot and if the magazin is empty the pistol hand needs to eject the empty magazin by pressing the grab buttons. Then in the other hand a new magazin will spawn that needs to be insered into the pistol. Then you need to pull back and forth the slide and you are ready to go. While the pistol is rather powerful and you can kill zombies with a single head shot (rather satisfying ;-) the rifle needs several shots to anywhere to kill a zombie.\nThus this game gives rather different experiences with non comparable scores depending on the weapons you use. Are you more in the mood for slaughter, then use axes. If you like to kill zombies one by one with aimed head shots then use the pistol. While the shotgun is nice, it is simply to slow for me. On the other hand the rifle does not have enough stopping power for me and the granades I have not tried yet. So depending on my mood I have a nice time using axes or pistols ;-) Fortunately you can switch weapons between each round!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013020097", "last_played": 1493405516, "num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 810, "playtime_forever": 141}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1477767041, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500288", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1477772793, "recommendationid": "26298241", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not so crappy.
