Two teams try to destroy each others base. The only difference I can see on offer is a 3rd person view rather than a tactics view. As the aim is lock on based and you cannot use abilities without targeting, all this view does is be restrictive.\nWant me to talk about the non-battle arena aspects of this game? well I cant because they do not exist. If you are bored of your library and would like to see what poundlands answer is to this continually existing genre of games with NOTHING added on top then this give this game a go.\nIf you are the sort of person to give \u201cearly access\u201d a try because it sounds like a great idea, and this game does, then do not play this game. Poorly optimised, delayed controls, small maps, all points to a developer who is over reaching and will offer no great experiences in any of the areas they are attempting.\nhttps://youtu.be/Gs6kRhT2SXM \n(P.S. Online only right now so unless you think 9 other people want to play this at the same time as you, good luck finding a game. Can be with just 1v1 but is pointless in a lane pushing game, and took me ages to even find the few partners I did.)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994868319", "last_played": 1474042677, "num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 98}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1474041518, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518968", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1474041518, "recommendationid": "25529540", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}]}
