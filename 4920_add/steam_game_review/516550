It feels awkward. Slide teleport is better, but not much. That leaves touchpad moving, which should be the way to play it, but touchpad movement made me ill about 3 levels in. It might be able to be fixed without the super-sudden stopping, I'm not sure. \n\nIt does seem like fun, and if they can fix the movement, it can probably be turned into a great game.

There is no general \"down\" direction, as the floor is only defined by what's under your feet in this harp-accompanied fantasy world.
