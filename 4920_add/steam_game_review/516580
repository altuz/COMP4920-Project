I finally got through the first system (7 levels). As I exited the last level, the game crashed. After verifying integrity of game cache, I opened the game to find out I had lost not 1 but 2 levels. Since I played 6 hours, according to steam, and I played 5 levels, (according to the game) you can figure out how frustrating it was to lose 2 levels. I replayed the 2 levels, upgraded my ship, and got ready for the next system, only to have the game crash on me again. Now I am back on level 5 in the first system. Oh wait, no I'm not, because I uninstalled the game and it will take me a while, if ever to try it again. I did like the game, a lot, frustrating as it was to get through each level. However, the reason I kept playing  was in the hope of moving on in the game and just maybe finishing it. (I'm sure all other gamers feel the same way). There is no replay value to 5 levels that I know the secrets and techniques to, and if I cant go on in the game past there, no reason to play it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198180938233", "last_played": 1504542766, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 95, "playtime_forever": 2074}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500835266, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500835266, "recommendationid": "33750246", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
