I really don't have the words to express how much I thought of the story, the characters, and the VN as a whole, but I'll try to organize my thoughts as best I can. (ps I definitely played for much more time than it says, but I had Steam offline most of the time so I think that affected it. Oops.)\n\nSetting: Excellent. There are a TON of different backgrounds and character portraits. Unlike a lot of VNs that you'd spend a lot more money on, the constant changing of scenery and expressions made sure that it never felt monotonous. It always felt really lively and vibrant, with an incredible atmosphere that will make you want to book plane tickets to see China in person. The characters didn't feel like they were hastily pasted over a background, but like part of the scenery, and there are dozens and dozens of beautiful CGs. Some are more eye-catching and artistic, others are more casual but still well-composed and nice to look at. You won't go a very long while before getting a new CG to stare at.\n\nCharacters: All of the characters were very well-rounded, expressive, and distinct from one another in personality. The main characters were all really strong emotionally, to boot. I really felt an attachment towards Jiayun, He Jia, Nurse Yang, and even the POV character Qiuwu. Even Qiuwu's parents were really funny, though we didn't get to see them drawn. My only criticism is that I wasn't really invested in He Jia's extended family/family acquaintances, though I liked them well enough. Qiucheng was pretty cool.\n\nVoice Acting: Stellar. Like many VNs, not all characters have portraits (though the vast majority of them do), but for the ones who don't, you barely notice due to how professional and emotive the voice acting is. Again, Qiuwu's parents are awesome. Most VNs I skip through and don't bother listening to the entire sentence, but this one made me want to hear them out even though I don't understand Chinese AT ALL.\n\nMusic/Sound: Not bad. It definitely sets the mood, but you could get tired of it after a while. Still, I left it playing most of the time, which is more than I can say for most VNs. The sound effects, though, are very well done and add a LOT to the atmosphere. There was definitely a lot of effort put into them, and they really make it feel more life-like. Occasionally, you even get to hear characters play an instrument or sing.\n\nStory: The overarching story is a very simple one, about a boy meeting a girl in the last few months of her life. This is not a spoiler; it's explained that she died as the set-up for the story which is told as an extended flashback. In this time, the pov character Qiuwu makes a major impact on the lives of Jiayun and those around her, as they do the same for him and he ends up with several new, unbreakable bonds and a close-knit nakama. Dealing with terminal illness is never easy, but this game is NOT a tragedy. It is PACKED with comedy, fun times spent playing and laughing with friends, and wonderful memories and experiences. Trying not to spoil too much but there's an arc where Qiuwu tries to teach a few other characters to ride a bike, and a class play featuring Jiayun and He Jia, and it's good. It's really good. Only in the last 2.5 chapters out of 10 is there even a hint of sadness, and the game never tries to milk the situation for tragedy or make the player cry. There's like a REALLY good chance you'll cry, but you will NOT feel manipulated into it.\n\nEnglish Translation: More than passable! I was really worried that it would be awkward and difficult to read, but it certainly gets the point across! It's not perfect and you can tell that the script wasn't originally in English, but I never felt like this was a huge hurdle to get over. \n\nCons: This is gonna be really short, but the con is that there aren't a lot of choices at all. I think there are like 5 of them, more or less? So it isn't a very interactive VN like I usually prefer. There are multiple endings which is definitely a big plus, but I've only gotten one so far.\n\nOverall: 100/100 just read it already!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198115247277", "last_played": 1505938141, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 366}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1505617064, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515169", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505618325, "recommendationid": "35012622", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}]}
