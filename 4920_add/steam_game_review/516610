I'm not sure what they saw in the game, but I'm definitely missing it.\n\nThis has to be the worst VR cash grab title I've seen. The \"combat\" and I use the term loosely here, consists of repeatedly waggling your swords back and forth as fast as you can or flicking your rists as fast as you can. Most gesture commands did not work about 50% of the time.\n\nHonestly this looks like a 12 year olds weekend project for Video Game club. I say that and feel like I'm insulting the 12 year old who probably would have put in more effort.\n\nThis is definitely NOT a 9.99 title and I will be getting a refund on principle.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFt_zhyUq60", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983689849", "last_played": 1472433497, "num_reviews": 92, "num_games_owned": 333, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1472434387, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529233", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1472437883, "recommendationid": "25219377", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I took a leap of faith on Guardian War VR and I'm very satisfied with my decision.\n\nThe game from the trailer looks like it could go either way. Really cool and fresh feeling or very very bad.\n\nI played one run through with both the Mage and the Warrior. Both have different moves that they can use in order to handle the enemies that you face the best.\n\nThe graphics on this game are pretty good. They aren't the best I've ever seen on vr but they are far from the worst.\n\nThe game is easy to jump in and play once you look at the given demonstrations of the different ways to cast your abilities. Out of the two runs that I played to my knowledge I didn't even get close to the end which is a huge plus for me. I will be jumping back in later tonight to see if I can't take down that dragon.\n\nThe absolute best part about this game may not be that it has a huge amount of levels and content but in the fact that this experience made me feel like a World of Warcraft or Diablo style of game could easily be possible for the Vive.\n\nEven if for now it's a simplified version of that fact in that you start the dungeons and just get teleported to different spots of the dungeon after each fight and looting, adding in co op to an experience like this and developing several different dungeons and bosses would be incredible.\n\nNow this game doesn't offer co-op play but it does offer two different playable characters right now and two more that say coming soon on their pictures, the ranger and the sorcerrer. Imagine this game with co-op possibilities and multiple dungeons I would throw money at my screen to play that.\n\nThis game definitely gets me excited about the possibilities that vr can achieve and I think is definetly a step in the right direction in regards to what kind of content and originality there can be.\n\nI am recommending this game purely on the fact that I felt fully immersed in this experience and could honestly see something like this with multiple stages being the go to VR game in the near future. But keep in mind that this game is not listed as in early access so besides the two additional characters I'm not sure we will be seeing much more updates in the way of Levels.\n\nI will dive back in later today to test the game out some more and update my review afterwards.\n\nIf you are still undecided like I was after watching the trailer check out my gameplay commentary for more footage of the game!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=751144206", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043450023", "last_played": 1472319600, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 47}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1472068895, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509848", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1472068970, "recommendationid": "25119355", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pointless.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198058314661", "last_played": 1472777835, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1473617182, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464470", "votes_down": 14, "timestamp_updated": 1473617182, "recommendationid": "25467345", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
