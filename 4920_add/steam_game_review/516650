If that presses your buttons, then this is for you.\nThat might seem overly critical, but this isn't bad; Preston Sterling doesn't really grab me as a charismatic adventure franchise lead, he seems to lack a charm or a wit, he's just serviceable.\n\nThe voice acting & audio was fine.\nFirst play was 53 minutes; I got given a Gamerscore 418/500 screen at the end, I never knew how score worked in old Sierra adventure games, but if you do then I guess there is replayability there.\n\nIt's not bad, it's not hidden object, it's not hard & it's To Be Continued...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198086542708", "last_played": 1471601591, "num_reviews": 77, "num_games_owned": 3590, "playtime_forever": 82}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1471599950, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516433", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1471601677, "recommendationid": "25009002", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So this game isn't a terribly long one but the fact that it is doesn't really matter as the gameplay makes up for that. Yet, there's a few things I would've liked to see handled differently in the future episodes of this game. \n\nConsidering the fact that this game is entirely point and click with the occasional puzzle scattered around makes controlling Preston incredibly difficult. You\u2019ve got the option to literally click the spots that Preston has to move too or you can drag your mouse around to make him move but both options are incredibly difficult as there's the risk that he'll end up getting stuck on a wall. The movement segments would be a lot more enjoyable if you'd be able to use your keyboard to be able to do that but there's no option for that resulting in getting a game over a few times as I got caught.\n\nAnother thing that's a little annoying is the load screen that pops up almost every time that you've got a change of scenery. It doesn\u2019t take long for the scenes to change, maybe 10 seconds at the most, but it's still a little annoying when you're eager to get going with the game and finish it because you want to see how the story is going to end. \n\nRegardless of that fact though, this game is enjoyable. If you're into King Arthur mythology, a character who could be considered an English Nathan Drake, enjoy solving puzzles and searching the surrounding area for the objects you need to progress, then this game is for you. However, having said that, having bought and played the game in a little over an hour and a half? I don't know whether it's worth the 5 euros I payed for it. Especially considering the fact the terrible controls are making me reluctant to play the game again and get a better score at the end of it. (I got a score of 375 because of the way Preston is controlled as the puzzles weren\u2019t all that difficult if you think logically about them)\n\nAll these things combined isn't enough for me to say that I don't want to play the next episodes of the series. I'm very eager to see how the story is going to end up being resolved and learning more about Preston's life/history/character and the like. \nSo all in all, good game if you ignore the controls.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198225108172", "last_played": 1471727237, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 95}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1471728094, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508200", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1471728094, "recommendationid": "25040760", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game had so much promise but in hind site, I should have passed on it.
