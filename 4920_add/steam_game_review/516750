I love this game because it pretty much simulates life, and all of the issues in life.  You start off with a case of beer, a package of sausages (which don't seem to be cooked, but that's not going to stop you from eating them), a catalogue, a working van, and a car that is completely in parts.  The body of the car has only two things already mounted in it, the windshield and the rear windshield.  You want a sound system?  You better put that in yourself.  You want a dashboard?  You're gonna have to build it.  I might say that I'd like it if the game had a few more options about the make and model of the car, but all the same, you build the car that you want to drive.  \n\nNow here's where it gets complicated...  The game has permanent death (which is default on), and the game has survival aspects.  Remember that beer and sausage?  You're going to need those.  You start off with $3000, and you have enough food for ONE DAY.  If you want more food, you're going to have to drive into town.  Where's town?  It's down the road, 3 km in one direction, 1 km in the other.  Sounds easy enough, maybe you could walk to town?  Nope, you'd never make it, because the food/drink meters constantly go down when you run and walk.\n\nEither way, the moment you start driving, you are playing a mortal game of chess with the gods.  If you drive too fast, you'll constantly lose control.  If you don't drive fast enough some arsehole will start ramming you from behind.  It's up to you to figure out where you want to go, and get there, and hopefully arrive alive.  Because if you crash .. you are probably dead.\n\nGood luck building Your Summer Car!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 163, "steamid": "76561197968302441", "last_played": 1506046250, "num_reviews": 32, "num_games_owned": 661, "playtime_forever": 163}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506041421, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506041421, "recommendationid": "35117104", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "SO MUCH FUN", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1928, "steamid": "76561197972096694", "last_played": 1507071925, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 262, "playtime_forever": 1978}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506643607, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506643607, "recommendationid": "35277065", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Went to suck some sewage from this guy.\nDrove to the guy, sucked his sewage.\nWas the wrong guy.\nFell into his sewer because I was enraged.
