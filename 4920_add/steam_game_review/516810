It's not that great, but for $1, it's still a decent time sink.\n\nGraphics - The graphics remind me of an old 90s indie game.  It's not very good, but it works well enough.  No fancy stuff here.\nMusic - Decent, but feels a bit too similar to many other classics.  It could have used more originality, but it's still good.\nGameplay - This is where the game can take quite a hit.  Specifically, hitboxes.  Pay attention to where your feet are, and use that to help determine whether you can hit your opponent or not.  In fact, I beat the final two bosses with very little damage by getting slightly below and to the side, where I could hit them and most of their own attacks would miss.  Other than that, the game has a decent progression, some basic puzzles, and an okay plot.  Nothing special, but not bad either.\n\nAt this point, I've beaten the game (I decided to do so before reviewing), which only took about 3 hours.  It's short, the hit boxes are wonky, nothing really shines, and even the UI is pretty bad at times (health bar, I'm looking at you).  So, why do I still recommend this game?\n\nIt's $1.  For the price of a combo meal at your standard fast food joint, you could buy several games at that price.  So, since it's not like I ended up frustrated or bored out of my mind, I'd say it at least makes up for it's problems by being priced right.  ;p", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197975468777", "last_played": 1505688434, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 221, "playtime_forever": 295}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505783894, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505783894, "recommendationid": "35055874", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
