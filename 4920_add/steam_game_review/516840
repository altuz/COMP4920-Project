Finally, a story where an old woman gets to have a proper adventure and meet a friendly dragon! I got exactly what I expected: a short, endearing, straightforward homage to point-and-click adventures, with the kind of story and characters I always wanted to see. It felt like rediscovering a favourite little cereal box bauble from twenty years ago. \n\nOf course, this retro experience includes all the frustrating little things, like feeling 'stuck' often and clicking and right-clicking and dragging every pixel on the screen to figure out what I was supposed to do. Each puzzle was relatively straightforward though, since there's only one or two puzzles you can solve at a time with your entire inventory. The game also has lengthy conversations that, though amusing, are hard to skip through until I figured out that you're supposed to \"use\" an item on a person, not \"interact\" with them, to give it to them. It's also hard to tell when a character has something new to say. I'm sure many of the less fun things will be smoothed out in the next episode, though.\n\n[spoiler]The music box puzzle was my favourite because I love music puzzles and bone/fossil xylophones, but it took me a while to figure out because I had sound effects turned off, because after a while the Fur Elise snippet playing every time I clicked on the box reminded me too much of all the times people wanted me to play it on the piano. I sympathize with the demon entirely. So basically I couldn't figure out why nothing was happening when I clicked on the ribs.[/spoiler]\n\nI'm very glad that The Tale of Doris and the Dragon is being told. It's the kind of pure, snarky, cute adventure I always wanted, with just my type of humour. Its \"clunkiness\" doesn't get in the way of the story. I'm very much looking forward to Episode Two!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198257542843", "last_played": 1499134081, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 79}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499197493, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499197493, "recommendationid": "33245560", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Point and click adventure for you to figure out what needs to interact with what...\n\n Norb is soo cute and cool.

The character designs for the dragon and the demon are cute. The music is nice and sets a nice tone for the game. Unlike games such as Undertale, I don't think the pixel graphics are used to the game's advantage, but rather makes it look very basic. It's not a bad game, but there's nothing special about it.
