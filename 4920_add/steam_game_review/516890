As you combine elements, you unlock new elemtnal defenders, as well as buffs and spells and passive augments. Each win unlocks more guesses to allow you to continue (hopefully) upgrading your elementals. Overall, it seems fairly intuitive and gives hints, however, since you don't know the names ofall the spells ahead of time, you, like myself, may resort to simply trying every combination. That's where the game gets rather grindy. Also, though the game starts out easy, the difficulty scales very quickly. By level 10-12, even the easiest setting become a hard-fought battle to win (or maybe I just stink at the gameplay part). In short, if you can get the game for around $5-7, I'd say it's a good play, but I wouldn't pay full price for it because, once you start consistantly losing, there's nothing to do but grind lower levels and hope to get lucky in the lab. If you are very god at side-view tower defense, however, you may well do much better at this than I.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198115319608", "last_played": 1493987085, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 334, "playtime_forever": 184}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1493962438, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1493962438, "recommendationid": "31553353", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
