This one could be the simplest among all, from the technical point, it's very basic. Anyway it's fun and extremely cheap at the moment (40% off during launch) so I feel I should upvote this game.\n\nOniris Basket VR offers three modes, on three courts (any mode with his court). Without real goals or chart or multiplayer, the only mode who could be fun for more than a few minutes is the training, so you can teleport and play as you want. The overall physics isn't very good, the ball bounces in a very unrealistic way and looks awful, but I can say than the shot itself works pretty well, could be the one I prefer at the moment especially from far shots like 3 point area. The video on the page don't make it justice, you can shoot with the proper position over your head and use your legs too. You miss any weight on your hand, obviously, so it's not like the real world... but it's not bad.\n\nWhat it's really bad is the graphics. I'm not so interested in the grahpics, but the ball itself is the worst I've ever seen. Textures are very, very low resolution. Super low polygon count too. The basket itself miss the net, or has a rigid net (in the indoor court) that is just horrible... way better no net at all than this one. In the training court, you can see a bridge interrupted like the dev stopped to draw the bridge or clipping cut it.\n\nThe music instead is extremely good, you've some very decent backing tracks than add value during your training.\n\nThe ball, as I said, it's ok in the shot management. It seems so difficult anyway, for any game (not just this one) to use your hands in the proper way. Here when you grab the ball, your controller is inside the ball! What's the meaning of this? The hand should be over the ball, not inside. Other games offers like a magnetic field, so the ball is not on the hand but closer floating in the air, weird as hell and totally immersion breaking. Every games, including this one, lack to support the second hand to grab the ball or to align the shot. In this context, Oniris Basket is better than other games as I said, but still doesn't feel 100% good. Wrist, support hand, grab the ball with both hands, bounce the ball on the ground like the real words: we need those stuff.\n\nThis long review seems strange with a positive rating, but as I wrote it's a cheap game and I really want to support basket games for Vive. You can get for free the Nothing But the Net demo, with a way better technical work behind, but this one feels better during shots. Anyway both are far from be perfect, let's hope in some positive challenging among those games.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969101080", "last_played": 1474406100, "num_reviews": 132, "num_games_owned": 290, "playtime_forever": 71}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1474147083, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499280", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1474147083, "recommendationid": "25556232", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Nice start but the hoops could be a little lower (seemed like they were 15ft high!) and the balls could have a little more weight to them.
