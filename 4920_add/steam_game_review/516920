Maybe no big deal for skilled gamers! :) (You can\u2019t rebind keys and invert axis.)\n\nThere are 3 main levels, divided into sub-areas. The game saves your items, but your location always goes back to the beginning of an area. The developer intent is to play through one area [or more] per sitting. So this can take 1-2 hours, or even more\u2026 But there are checkpoints within an area.\n\nWhat you get: Diversified level design (tropical island, desert, lava caves, underwater sections, snow-scape, etc.) with beautiful looking graphics (including day and night cycles), nice art style and lovely sound/music. (There is an option to hide the HUD, for taking screenshots! ;-)) \n\nVery kind and supportive developer, always responding to community feedback and constantly improving the game!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984817271", "last_played": 1473268501, "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 1409, "playtime_forever": 560}, "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_created": 1472902429, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545611", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1472975333, "recommendationid": "25323012", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great art, creepy atmosphere, difficult puzzles.
