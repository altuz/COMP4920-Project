I eventually got used to the gameplay, although I still don't recall how to change flags indicating whether it's a mine or a question mark.  Tough call on recommending yes or no on this one.  I'm going to give a very tepid recommendation because the game delivers on putting minesweeper in VR.\n\nNormally, that would be good enough.  But I'm just surprised by the mechanic the dev used to make this game.  You basically teleport to the square and push trigger on the square with your ... shovel/spear/pole whatever that thing was.  If you're correct it marks a number 1, 2, 3, etc.  If you're incorrect, you blow up.  If you know a mine is in the square, then you plant a flag (why is there a question mark flag?  how does that help you?  it is really not needed unless you're going AFK for a long time and forgot your train of thought or suffer from amnesia  :/  .... ).  Once you have discovered where all the mines are without blowing yourself up, you win.  In zombie mode DLC, it seems like you really need to plant the flags as well, while you kill zombies with your shovel.  Now, you do have roomscale so you can walk around, and point the shovel thing and hit trigger on the squares to reveal them.  \n\n[b]Here's my problem with this game (besides the clunkiness of the controls and the UI), why couldn't your step be what activates the square?  That way if feels like you're actually in a minefield.  So walk over to the square using joystick or whatever locomotion and if you step on it and it's not the mine, a number is revealed.  If you walk on it and it's the mine, then it blows up.  Why wouldn't you do that?  You can still mark squares as mines so that if you step on them they don't blow up.  You'd have limited flags so you can't just mark every square as a mine.  That's the minesweeper game I want.  Just make sure to have smooth controls so your steps into the squares can be precise.  [/b]\n\nAnyways, is the game worth $3.99 as is?  I don't think so.  But I got it on sale for $2.39.  I think this game is a $2 and change experience and it well worth that.\n\nRate 5.5/10 please make a step option for activating the squares dev! My score would be much higher if that were the game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1506232855, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506236838, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506237052, "recommendationid": "35173014", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
