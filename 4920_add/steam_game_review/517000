While staying at his grandfather's house, he receives a visit from the resident guardian spirit of each of the two shrines - catgirls Kayo and Nayoko who show up at his house as uninvited guests and at his school as his classmates. Over the course of this visual novel, Toru's grandfather Mr. Akita will explain to Toru that his required task as a priest is to perform the Rites of Ascension to help Kayo and Nayoko become true spirits of the land during the Ascension Festival where one or both of the guardian spirits might eventually develop feelings for Toru.\n\nThe story and plot is written like a romantic comedy with a share of humour and fanservice and has 3 nice happy endings, the background music by REN from the circle 'Bastat tail', artwork by Inma and Fatelinealpha and overall presentation are great. Reading through the storyline and dialogue and unlocking all CGs at gallery will take less than 10 hours.
