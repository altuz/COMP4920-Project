On one side, it is capable of elevating the human race to its greatest heights. On the other hand, it is capable of bringing the human race to its lowest. Since the dawn of Steam Greenlight, PC gaming has turned into a mass grave of shovelwares, to the point that it is now impossible to keep track of every bad games being released in a year. Here, bear in my mind that I use the word \"games\" very loosely...\n\nDevelopped by Displacement Studios and released in 2016, Aztecalypse is an adventure-horror game in first person perspective made with GameGuru. Set on an historical site in Mexico, you play a scientist who must investigate on the disappearance of an excavation team. While this sounds clich\u00e9, keep in mind that the real issue with the game is not the story itself but the fact that it has been made with GameGuru...\n\nBorn from the unhealthy minds behind FPS Creator, GameGuru is a gamemaking tool that spawned many abysmal titles since its official release in 2016. Like its GameGuru counterparts, Aztecalypse is an amateurish project at best, plagued by bad game design, poor optimization and bugs. The game starts with a 20 seconds theme music featuring harmonica. Then we are greeted with a 3 minutes loading screen. Just enough to give us a bad impression already. But the worst is yet to come...\n\nAztecalypse features one huge open map made with blocky mountains, stretched textures, glitchy lighting and shadow effects, poor level design, as well as uninspired sound effects. Due to the sheer amount of elements displayed onscreen, the framerates dip below 30fps most of the time. As for the gameplay, Aztecalypse feels more like a walking simulator than an actual adventure-horror game...\n\nSince you play a pacifist scientist, you cannot carry any weapon, except for a knife. You won't need it anyway! The zombies do very little to harm you and can be outrun easily. Not to mention the fact that the models have no lighting and shadow effect, hence why they uncannily look so dark. That being said, your worst enemy is not the poorly implemented AI and horrendous visuals, but the map as it can be really easy to get lost during your journey.\n\nThe finale itself is notheworthy as it pins you against a horde of Regenerators from Resident Evil 4, that can be avoided easily by running to the chopper and... THE END... rolling credits...\n\nConsidering that Aztecalypse had undergone through an intensive phase of playtesting, it is incomprehensible how it got released in this state. While the video game industry leaves room for newcomers and experimentation, it is certainly not a place for high school project, especially not GameGuru games!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWr9xbHGL1A\n\nRating:\n0.1 / 10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989199444", "last_played": 1493013739, "num_reviews": 123, "num_games_owned": 1062, "playtime_forever": 106}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1493061278, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521580", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497846927, "recommendationid": "31344690", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
