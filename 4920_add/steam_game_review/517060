Firing the cannon at the Trump supporters requires you to use the space bar instead of the left mouse click, like any other game. The camera is controlled by moving the mouse around intead of using arrow keys or point and click direction, like any other game. \n\nGraphics are sub-standard.\n\nGameplay consists entirely of building towers and shooting at Trump/supporters. There is no vertical progression with weapons and no ability to repair walls. Low effort in the extreme. \n\nSoundtrack consists of maybe three tracks, all of which seem to be free-to-use.\n\nSound-effects consist mostly of fart noises, which is just as juvenile and as annoying as it sounds. \n\nStory is non-existent. \n\nI wish I could attribute such a horrible game to a named person, but the developer has chosen to remain anonymous. Rightly so, I might add, as anyone with any sense of profesionalism would likely not want to be associated with this horrible excuse for a game.\n\n*bonus round*\nOnly clue about the developer seems to be a tag called \"AmazingRuss\". He likely worked for Crescent Moon Games and Human Powered games at some point.

This game only has 1 level. Once you beat the game in 10 mins, you are done. Nothing else to do afterwards. The game is great for a laugh. I enjoy seeing Trumps face as a Butt, Farting the entire time. The game is funny and thats what they were going for and they did a great job on making fun of him, but as for a game. It wasnt great.
