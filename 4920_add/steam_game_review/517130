It's one of the best GAMES for VR at the moment. Most of the stuff I've seen are simply tech demos, but Soundboxing feels like a complete and actual game.

Such a simple idea, superbly executed, and an utter delight to play. If you've ever punched the air to your favourite songs, you'll know where this game is coming from. The genius of its YouTube-based system is that you're never stuck listening to a song you don't like, and creating patterns is every bit as fun as playing those others have made. I've discovered new music through this game, and the sense of community is strong; when you realise how the patterns are made, it's a real delight to grok the person that connected with the song like you do. \n\nAlso - this game is great for a cardio workout if you want it to be; a good session on this and BoxVR will give you a proper workout that's completely fun. \n\nOne of the first games we bought for our Vive, and it will forever be one of the best.
