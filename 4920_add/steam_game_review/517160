Added bonus levels for those with not only a fear of heights but also a fear of spiders and you can help them experience a perfect blend of augmented reality while they face their fears in virtual reality and feel the real physical effect of those phobias in real life!\n\nWhile I don't have a fear of heights I hate everything about spiders so here's me sharing my fear!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWdMTtv-USc\n\nIt's a fun game but has no story plot or modes. It's great for introducing your friends to VR and recording their reactions.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984300232", "last_played": 1487465761, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 186, "playtime_forever": 68}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503091027, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503091027, "recommendationid": "34336864", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
