The chance you'll get the really cool items is pretty low, but that's probably because they're all powerful. For example, I only get double shot every other run, at really late game. There are a few weapon types, more specifically Shotgun, Machine gun, Blaster, Laser, Torpedo, and Homing Missile. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, which is nice. For example, Shotguns and Torpedos are good for single-target, e.g. bosses, [strike]although, i'll admit, i'll always go for torpedoes or missiles, no matter the situation. Get enough fire-rate upgrades and torpedoes, too, work for crowd control[/strike]. The stages are randomly generated, with mostly well-designed waves, [strike]except for maybe the asteroid + yellow orb-shooting enemies combo wave[/strike] The bosses are a bit easy, but they'll probably fix that soon. \n\n- DESIGN - \nThe pixel art isn't my favorite style in the world, but that's just my opinion. I'm sure some people will absolutely love the pixel art, and I won't criticize them for that. Some of the boss design is a bit awkward, but again, that's just my opinion. Now, the music... The music is damn awesome. It's fast-paced, well-made, and gives off huge Carpenter Brut vibes. Being a huge Hotline Miami fan, I absolutely adored that. The background art is also pretty nice. Oh yeah, and if you're a weeaboo like I am, there's a few references to various things that should be pretty easy to spot. Very direct references, that is. And that isn't necesarrily a bad thing. My friend pointed out that [spoiler]Homonculus looked exactly like some thing from FMA[/spoiler] and we both thought that was neat.\n\n- BUGS - \nI haven't gotten any glitches or bugs before, which is good.\n\n- DEVELOPERS - \nImaginationOverflow are awesome. They're extremely active and listen to their community actively, which is everything i've ever wanted in a developer. If you're reading this, keep up the good work :)\n\n- OVERALL - \nIn my opinion, it's either a 9.5/10 or a 10/10 for me.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 712, "steamid": "76561198079433900", "last_played": 1506657237, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_forever": 914}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506460806, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498718", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506460806, "recommendationid": "35230546", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's hard for me to believe that any game would still come with only keyboard controls.
