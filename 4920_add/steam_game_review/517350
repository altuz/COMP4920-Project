If you enjoy small characters in a giant world then this is right up your alley.

First off, It is not a regular linear game where there is nothing more to do after you beat the game, it has some other interesting modes like racing(yes, racing, thats unexpected isnt it?), survival(How long can you survive when youre up against limitless zombies) and Open world(this one really surprised me). Second, you can customize your character freely and there are lots of options for you including colors, faces, and clothes If i recall correctly LOL. Third, there are many weapons and pets for you to choose, you can pick a pet and bring it with you anywhere.
