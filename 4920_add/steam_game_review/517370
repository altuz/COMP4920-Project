You control a tavern at a macro level, choosing decor and food to draw in certain factions, each of which brings different kinds of scenarios you must deal with. Depending on your preference or distain for a given section of the community, different choices may open themselves up leading to a pretty entertaining combination.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+I really enjoy this art style. Almost a comic woodblock, see also [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b].\n+Music is all-around really great and actually acts as a mechanic in itself, with different music choices drawing in different customers.\n+Low price tag. I got it on sale but the current full price of $2.99 is pretty good for the fun I got out of it.\n+The overarching narrative is intriguing with fun twists, especially with the first run through or two as you get different endings.\n+Many of the weekly scenarios will make you think or can just be off the wall and hilarious.\n+Good, clear, skippable tutorial.\n+You'll want to give the game multiple run-throughs to see the different scenarios, endings, and achievements.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The game can be quite short. Once I figured out the game's most efficient pathways and knowing what the various quests were ahead of time meant I could eventually knock out a full run-though in minutes.\n-Actual tavern management is limited. You have a small-ish selection of tools, furniture, and food to select but the entire experience is on rails so there isn't much space to experiment or go free form. It wasn't a huge negative for me but worth mentioning.\n\n[b]Meh:[/b]\n=The game makes a big deal early on about your cave/cellar, but I found it was only some of the games' menus compiled into one place, seems like a waste?\n\n[b]Overall:\n\nTavernier[/b] is a light game with some interesting surprises. To me it almost feels like a board or card game with some twists. It's great to pick up and play for a few minutes and easy to jump back into. It has its flaws but I quite enjoyed it for what it is.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994830200", "last_played": 1498270416, "num_reviews": 46, "num_games_owned": 376, "playtime_forever": 296}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1500509025, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507576", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500509025, "recommendationid": "33661963", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Its fun the first couple of plays but it does get boring rather quickly.

However, I finished my playtest wanting the game to be more than it is. I would be giving a neutral rating if this were possible.\n\n - The music is great; the art a sort of pencil-sketch style that does a good job. The English wasn't written by a native speaker, however. The grammar is generally okay, but you consistently encounter words that are completely inappropriate. For example, \"the right SPRINKLES are what makes a people come and go\" (referring to extras that improve the tavern; I believe the word they wanted was \"touches\"). Other times, the game refers to the \"cave\" when I believe it means \"cellar\".\n\n - It makes excessive use of anachronisms (your bard can play rock music, for example) and fourth wall breaking (in one weekly event, I have too much to drink and see my beer floating before me. My choices are to grab it or \"press the space bar\". I chose the latter, and [spoiler] my bar floated into (outer) space, and I was able to grab the beer, which gave me a bunch of gold and increased my reputation with several of the customer types).[/spoiler]\n\n - Something about the core game mechanic is unfulfilling; there just isn't enough to do in the tavern management, and no real sense of story in the choose your own adventure part. You have four types of customers (guards, rogues, wanderers, etc) and can change the menu, music and decorations to draw more of one or another; your one \"choose your own adventure\" choice each week inevitably changes your reputation with one or more groups. These A / B choices do not give a sense of story so much as they simply move sliders around. The management part feels similarly unfulfilling; you're given a money dump at the end of each week, which happens as soon as you make your \"choose your own adventure\" choice. The money seems to pour in no matter what, and the net at the end of the week doesn't really feel like it has much to do with my choices so much as like I've been given an allowance by Mom and Dad.\n\nThe game would probably do better if it were re-tooled into a real-time mode (like the old SIM series) with a more rapid-fire series of events to respond to and the ability to pause. It would probably be better if there were some micro-management to do in real time, and the events occurring more than once per week.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198130948719", "last_played": 1502416045, "num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 1480, "playtime_forever": 57}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1502413264, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1502436564, "recommendationid": "34158421", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "My family name is actually Tavernier so this game immediately caught my attention.

It felt a bit like a Kongregate game but the promise of a hidden narrative added enough that I'm happy I bought it, given how cheap it is. I've only played through it twice and I'm not in a hurry to play through it again soon, but I'm sure I will somewhere down the line. I really wish I could give a 'meh' rating. The only reason I went with a 'no' was because other players won't get that boost from sharing the name with the game.\n\nIf I had one note it would be that I wish the decorations and food you ordered for your tavern actually showed up in the game.
