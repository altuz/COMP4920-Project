The \u00a315 price tag really made me nervous though.\n\nAnd rightly so. It doesn't live up to anything in the description, the challenge I experienced in the first area was not an intuitive and fun one. \n\nThe sound design was very poor. The interactivity with the world ranged from very competent (e.g. gun mechanics) to downright awful e.g. things that are ambiguous to interact with, half of the things you'd expect to have sounds not having them and just generally poor design - for example a random crank in a hospital room that moves a radiator... I mean yeh okay that's \"hidden\" but why?\n\nIt's not scary, the sound design shoots it in the foot.\n\nAlso, personally I had textures flickering like MAD. Other anomalies like a wall that's black until you look at it, then it's a wall.\n\nThis wasn't released as an alpha, they had the cheek to just dump the fact that it is buggy at the bottom of the description. I don't think anyone can in good faith ask for what they've asked for this title.\n\nBuy at a heavy discount (1/3 as much) OR if it gets heavily patched and worked on. Though to be honest you're almost certainly going to find it an unsatisfying time.\n\nHere's my video review, it's also a humorous thing so skip to around 3 minutes in if all you care about is gameplay, I show almost everything in first area. If you want to see review fabrication skip to 9 minutes. Or watch the whole thing ;)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/gXjvXI8O3gA\n\nCheers,\nRammo", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972283208", "last_played": 1484760393, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 403, "playtime_forever": 60}, "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_created": 1484877693, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539576", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1484878736, "recommendationid": "29367194", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Bad :\n - locomotion : no choice : teleport, but with a mix of free moove when there are ladders\n - Light is very buggy !\n - Bullet impact look like golden eye 64 XD\n - Ugly zombies, in a bad way\n - Bad sound design\n\nGood\n - Pretty hands\n - Good intent\n\nPlease, for the gameplay, refer to Onward !", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013172531", "last_played": 1484833933, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 184, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1484834343, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504175", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1484834343, "recommendationid": "29356245", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Terrible interface.

The developer (as seen on comments) quickly responded and fixed the main issue I had and the game got a lot more enjoyable.\n\nBasically this is your basic escape room type of game with some enemies thrown into the mix and you're just trying to get solve puzzles and move from one are to the next.\nI enjoy these types of games and the puzzles here were quite difficult for the first half.\nThe game is split into 4 scenes, each which you can conviniently replay after finishing it once, and each of them are quite short. I'm certain that I could do a playthrough that lasted 10-20 minutes if I wanted. \nHowever as you can see I did spend quite a few hours with this. Most of that is me being stupid or restarting due to bugs, but the first half of the puzzles were puzzling and kept me guessing what to do. You'll probably get around one or two hours of gameplay time from this, if you're a simple fellow.\nHow so? Well, I myself felt lost during the two first scenes. I missed some small but obvious hints and took my time figuring them out. The puzzles however get a lot easier and straightforward on scene 3 and 4. They get shorter and much much simpler and I can tell that not a lot of effort was put into the ending.\nAh, the ending... I really don't know what to say\n[b]Spoilers! Don't proceed if you want to finish it yourself![/b]\n...It becomes a shooter. You solve a small gear puzzle and get to shoot monsters. I guess it was kinda fun, but it totally ruins the \"Forget about killing most zombies\" mood. The music was cool though.  \nAfter using all the pistol ammo I had some shotgun ammo left and shotguns locked in a cabinet with a puzzle on the ceiling. I could have tried solving the puzzle and killed rest of the enemies, but why would I do that when I simply teleported quickly past them and finished the game?\nSo it was slightly dissappointing, but we'll see if the devs will do some adjustments.\n[b]End of spoilers[/b]\n\nAnd indeed there are bugs still left in this game. Some of these were a hinderance that forced me to restart a level and some were quite an annoyance. Do expect game breaking stuff to happen.\n\nNow you've propably realised that I still gave this a recommendation even with all of its flaws? That's because I still enjoyed it. I honestly can write a long list of bugs and negative experiences I had with this, but the game was simple enough that I could enjoy it even with the occasional swearing and I'm glad that I finished it.\nOne last note is that on my previous halfway finished review I stated that the price is spot on now. The thing is that when the bugs get removed and you can have a solid playthrough, I'm not sure how long of an experience this will be for new players and whether 9\u20ac  is okay for them.  But I can tell you that it's a lot better than the original 20\u20ac.\n\n[EDIT] I guess my 3.2h from last two weeks is pretty close to what it actually took me to finish this.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040845636", "last_played": 1486415493, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 727, "playtime_forever": 340}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1484839370, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494591", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1486418435, "recommendationid": "29357673", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "like bullshit ,awful operate,awful interactive", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198070812619", "last_played": 1484809420, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1484809600, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488833", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1484809600, "recommendationid": "29351187", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I spend more than 10 minutes only just reloding the pistol !!!!\nI even dont play just in the loby>>>>\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198268198877", "last_played": 1484740869, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1484751880, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458167", "votes_down": 23, "timestamp_updated": 1484751880, "recommendationid": "29338064", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "the controls are not very good . very difficult to pick things up from the floor .and story or plot is very scetchy '", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198373092975", "last_played": 1498948103, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_forever": 171}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1495274970, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495274970, "recommendationid": "31857380", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
