Maybe one of them, but I haven't got the patience to keep at it.  I'm going to try to be as constructive as possible.  If you're considering a purchase of this game, the things I disliked may have no effect on you and it might be an awesome game for you.  It just wasn't FOR ME.\n\n[h1]Stuff I liked[/h1]\n[list]\n   [*] The game has a really good Steampunk aesthetic going. \n   [*] The graphics are OK.  Some of the textures seemed a bit dark to me but that could be chalked up to a design choice\n   [*] Voice Commands! This is the best thing about this.  You can just say one word and switch to some default loadouts!\n   [*] You can combine weapons in several ways so there is some potential for interesting strategies\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Stuff I disliked[/h1]\n[list]\n   [*] The narration/voice in this game is made to sound \"old timey\" which fits in with the steampunk aesthetic, but I found it hard to hear and understand properly. \n   [*] The enemies are all basically rats in the first level (I'm sure this changes) but it felt like I was constantly having to run from them to avoid being overwhelmed\n   [*] Run is the wrong word.  I've never felt more restricted in-game movement than this.  You can press the grip buttons to dash to predetermined points in the map and that's it.  I'm not a fan.\n   [*] The weapons seem really awesome, but don't really FEEL awesome. There's a tesla coil gun that seems like it should do more but it's pretty weak.  There's a steam hammer weapon that should feel more like you're power-punching enemies but didn't convey the feeling of power at all. On the plus side you can upgrade these weapons though.\n[/list]\n\nI think the main thing is that I'm not as big a fan of the Steampunk aesthetic as some might be. If you're into that stuff then this will probably be super cool for you.  To me, it's just a wave shooter with some really interesting but weak weapons and unsatisfying movement methods.\n\nI think maybe the developers could add captions for the speech (which could help with other languages too) and maybe tweak the weapons so that even if they didn't do more damage, maybe they could stall enemies or keep them from swarming you so quickly.   Adding another option for movement would be nice as well.  The S.M.A.R.T. system is really just teleporting to specific nodes on the map, and while it makes sense in terms of the Steampunk world, it doesn't strike me as a fun mechanic.  \n\nIf the developers are reading this, sorry that I didn't like your game, and no, I don't really want a free copy.   It's possible that I'm in the minority and everyone else will love it.
