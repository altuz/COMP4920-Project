I thought this was going to be one of those games that embraces the \"glitch\" aesthetic. Sadly, the game is just plain glitchy. Overall it's a poorly-made, bug-filled mess that's not worth your money. \n\nIssues:\n[list]\n[*] Poorly-designed UI. The buttons don't respond when you hover or click on them.\n[*] No loading screens or loading bar. When a level is loading, the entire game just freezes and becomes unresponsive for several seconds. There's no indication that anything is loading.\n[*] Poor collision detection. The player character sticks to walls like glue.\n[*] Unresponsive controls. When you click to punch, the player character punches about half a second later.\n[*] Major game-breaking bugs. For example, I have tried to play the game three times; each time I get to a point where I get stuck in a wall or a piece of furniture. There is no option to restart the level. When this happens, I have to quit the game and re-launch it from Steam.\n[/list]\n\nI'm going to see if I can get a refund.
