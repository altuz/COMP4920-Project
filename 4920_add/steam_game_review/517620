The UI is well done, the effects look great, and the game mechanics are original. The Gooblins, which look like some sort of alien species out of a kids movie, slowly close in while reacting to shots in their own distinct ways. Some of them dodge, some shoot back, and a few go kamikaze at high speeds. The sound effects warn when shots are coming, and the combo meter on the gun offers a fun way to earn more points. For a quick and fun arcade game that can be played with almost anyone, this is a great deal.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198039603972", "last_played": 1503273407, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_forever": 18}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1482291984, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513973", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1482291984, "recommendationid": "28499473", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's gud!

Honestly, The VIVE or anything VR is just something I myself dont play for LONG periods of time like I would a regular game.  Whats nice about it is that Gooblins is simple. It brings back that arcade style feeling of gameplay. Something that you can pick up and play when you are getting that itch to rack up points and shoot things. The \"Color Combo\" element in the game is what really makes it shine. It keeps the game from getting stale and keeps you engaged and focused. I also get this sense of really having to use my senses, which I dont get alot from VR games. I dunno, I just feel more engaged in this. I'm constantly having to focus on each individual creatures different attacks while trying to maintain my combo. \n\nSimple, wonderful and fun.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198021192273", "last_played": 1486245549, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_forever": 530}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1482533941, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508150", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1482533941, "recommendationid": "28573272", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Gooblins is amazing!
