Got into a game with some buds and from the visuals to the sfx to the music to the gameplay itself, it's been pretty horrible. The hitboxes are unclear, the guns feel horrid, and the jump and run speed are infuriatingly slow for an arena shooter like this.

The graphical style (based on Tron) is simple and while technologically it's all very basic (I imagine this should run well even on a 2005-era PC), in the end the presentation is clean and minimalistic, even nostalgic in some sense. The music isn't very noteworthy but I suppose it fits the ambience well. Now the gameplay is were this game really shines! With a bunch of friends this game is a blast.\nAs for the negatives: there is really no single player experience to speak of. You [b]need\t[/b] other people to play this game and because it's not very popular yet they can be hard to find. I recommend you buy this game though and tell your friends about it! It needs and deserves more players.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198305992917", "last_played": 1477324499, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1477326656, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497086", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1477326656, "recommendationid": "26200519", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
