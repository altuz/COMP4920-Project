I read the game desciptions and was very impressed by Custom Town. It is very complex, so many possibilities to customize and interact. I read other reviews about crashes and I also had 1 crash after 20 minutes, but I had a savegame and could play again for 3 hours without any crashes. It's like Sim City but with more depth plus The Sims. You can create and customize your residents and your configuration matters. You have to manage any single resident, watch them if all is ok, give them houses, beds, kitchens and so on. You have to build Supermarkets, Colleges, Schools... You also have to build a good defense system against zombies, it's like a tower defense game in the game.\nI also like the 5 Minute Adventure and Slime.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 138, "steamid": "76561198410042904", "last_played": 1507025283, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 1451}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501950608, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500713", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1501967883, "recommendationid": "34041677", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
