I have being searching for a fast pase racing game for PC similar to the likes of Extreme-G and Wipeout, and this games just looks mind blowing at high refresh rates, 144hz in my case, and in comparison with the disaster I belive was wipeout 2048 for the Vita always strugling under 30 pfs (poor control I felt as well), even the PSP held 60fps flawlessly on Pure & Pulse (much better control than 2048 in my opinion) Back to Redout :), the tracks, the areas, the weather, all awesome!

If you liked anti-grav racing games like F-Zero or Wipeout, this game should be right up your alley. The graphics are surprisingly better than I thought, and the controls feel very comfortable (although there's a slight learning curve to it). There's tons of maps, to the point where I still have many that I haven't played yet. There are lots of teams, each with 3 models for each company along with different skins for the cars as well. You can use your money you win from winning to upgrade your car's stats and add a passive and active ability. Honestly I'd recommend buying this game if you want to get a racing game.\n\nHowever, even though I recommend it and think this game is definitely worth buying, I feel obligated to mention a few cons with the game. The multiplayer is almost entirely dead, so don't expect to play it with others. There is a discord server for Redout though, if you're willing to find some people to play it with. Also, something about the game feels hollow. The races can be different gamemodes, but I feel like there's soo many modes that almost every 3 races there's a new mode being introduced. At least you have lots of options when you want to play your own game, but it just feels weird having to do certain objectives on a new map you haven't played much or at all. It's honestly not that big of a deal though. It almost feels like the campaign is used as a demo for all the different gamemodes that were added to the game. Also, randomly while playing you might receive a contract from a company to win a certain amount of races with their team's car. I guess this was meant to introduce variety and make people try out other vehicles instead of sticking to one, but it just didn't feel like a fleshed out concept at all.\n\nAll in all, I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who loves racing games. You can tell the devs put a lot of hard work into making this game polished and work well. It's not completely flawless but I think it'll scratch that itch for most people.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044220398", "last_played": 1494566913, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 104, "playtime_forever": 393}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504981629, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504981629, "recommendationid": "34843705", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I don't get motion sickness often.
