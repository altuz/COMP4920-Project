I also  really think this game needs a good tutorial as there are quite a few systems to try and grasp and the managment pages certainly can look and feel overwhelming.  \n\nI have done early access before on a few other games, some I have bought way to early, others I have gotten were pretty close to complete.  I would say this falls in the middle.  You can certainly play and get some enjoyment from it, but you can also see that there is so much more that is to come. \n\nI will say the game comes in on the high side as far as price goes for an early access this far from completion.

Basically it is managing a tavern and hiring adventurers that frequent the tavern to go on quests to earn gold to keep it running.  Don't expect a game where you are doing all the fighting yourself, it is more or less managing the band of adventurers and the tavern's day to day business.  The real meat of the game comes in the form of the game's witty writing, the stories that are sewn together through the adventurers and the quests are fun to read and give life to the game's palette of colorful characters.  It's fairly easy to get hooked on the game, as you build up your tavern and go on quests, you want to see what the next unlock item is, and what characters fit in each mission.  It needs a bit more polish in terms of explaining the importance of the traits per quest, so you can better prepare a party to go adventuring, but that is nitpicking.  For an early access game it has a surprising amount of polish, and although there are a lot of elements that show it's a WIP (especially in the GUI) it doesn't really impede the gameplay, rather it gives you insight in to what the developers are going to integrate in.  You cannot use a controller with the game, so make sure you have your keyboard and mouse handy, even if it did though I think it would be pretty clunky to navigate the UI as it is with a gamepad.
