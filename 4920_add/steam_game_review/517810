While I understand why they don't like it, IMO Caesar 4 has its own charm that Caesar 3 does not.\n\nI don't even remember how many hours I have spend in each games. Must be more than 100 hours. Back in the days, there are not a lot of game available to play and it's difficult to get new games, not like now. And over the years i've been re-install the game in countless of time and redo the campaign.\n\nIf you love city builder game, especially roman or mediaval age, this game worth the try.\n\n[h1]=========[/h1]\n\n[b]+ Simplified worker/citizen housing[/b], divide them into 3 categories and have their own housing, so you don't have to worry about house merging like in previous Caesar game.\n\n[b]+ Market Place[/b], now citizen will pick things up from the market, previously market has worker that do house patrol and sometime their pathing can be frustrating and some houses didn't get their supply fast enough. Caesar 4 also divide the market building into each category depending on the luxury level, you can also control the access (who can/can't buy).\n\n[b]+ Campaign[/b], lots of missions to clear and have 2 different route for each stage (economy & military). Roughly if you are new to the game, I would say you are going to need at least 30-40 hours to complete all the missions (perhaps more)\n\n[b]+ Free/Sandbox mode[/b], it also got this freeplay mode and even scenario editor (a bit difficult to use though, not a very good editor)\n\n[b]+ The city feel alive[/b], I should say that the city do feel alive. Citizen interaction and your action felt meaningful, not like in most modern city builder game where they are just pure number. Though I have to say CivCity Rome got better mechanic regarding this issue, but Caesar also felt good.\n\n[b]+ Better Graphic[/b], than most older city builder game (well, because this is one of the newest). \n\n[h1]----------[/h1]\n\n[b]- Military & Combat[/b], are as bad as ever in city builder game (lol)\n\n[b]- Old game[/b], this is an old game therefore there don't have the most user friendly UI like modern game. The option are lacking, control can be difficult, tools can be frustrating when you first learn them. But you will used to it after a while.\n\n[b]- No Caesar V[/b] :<", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198037594255", "last_played": 1483636644, "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 183, "playtime_forever": 1027}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1500985053, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519740", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1501043827, "recommendationid": "33785430", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "IF YOU CANT GET THE GAME RUNNING  DO THIS IT SHOULD FIX THE C++ RUNTIME ISSUE :\n\nGo to the game's folder in your C:\\ drive (or wherever you have it is you have this stored).
