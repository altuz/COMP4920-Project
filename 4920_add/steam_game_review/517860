If that sounds like greek to you, I\u2019ll explain the concept briefly: On each map you must indirectly guide a group of 4 bears along what amounts to an interactive obstacle course, all with the goal of getting them back to their space ship so they can return to bear planet or wherever it is space bears come from. Because the experience is in VR, you can reach out and grab pieces of the level and place them in ways that direct the traffic of your wandering bears. Failure to route a bear correctly will result in its death and a lower rating on the level in question, though you can retry as many times as you want until you succeed in saving all the bears.\n\nThis game is an underrated gem, especially because of the overall great visual and audio quality and well-polished VR interface. Moving blocks around and switching devices is as smooth as real-life movement which is imperative for a physics-based game. Most puzzles can be solved in a number of ways and you may even find a few unorthodox solutions involving juggling bears over short distances or highly improvised block bridges. FtKM features a level editor with online function, allowing for you to create and share your own levels or browse and experience other users\u2019 creations online, making for virtually endless unique gameplay (rare for VR gaming). \n\nIf I had to recommend a VR title to pick up for anyone wanting something different from the usual wave shooter or room escape game, Fly to Kuma Maker would definitely be in my top 5. It\u2019s super cozy fun with just the right amount of challenge. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197967229781", "last_played": 1498529263, "num_reviews": 272, "num_games_owned": 425, "playtime_forever": 344}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1493276565, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504847", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1493276565, "recommendationid": "31388712", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
