It feels like walking around a city made out of cardboard paper. It looks more realistic in the screenshots (or on any 2D screen, probably) than with an actual headset on. It also looks like just a small downtown area is detailed, and the rest is unfinished. The border between the detailed and unfinished (flat) area is really visible and you can walk outside of it, so I hope they fix that soon.\n\nThere is a day and night cycle, but it's rather useless because the buildings don't cast any shadows and they don't light up at night. There is also no traffic, nothing animates, which reinforces the unreal, cardboard feeling, and reinforces the uselessness of the night time mode. The water is also just an ugly green blob and there isn't a single reflection in any window. All the geometry is nicely done though, and there are quite a few interesting, detailed buildings which hold up to closer inspection (but also many which don't). One more thing is that the very fast moving clouds did make me a bit nauseous on quite a few occasions.\n\nIt's fun for a few minutes, but then you wish it was a flight simulator or a virtual train set (or tycoon game). Or at least had some interesting overlays with street names, areas and buildings of interest, or even data visualization on population density, traffic or anything.\n\nHopefully, they will add a city I've actually been to in the future (London, Paris, Stockholm, Tokyo). I might pay for a pack of well made cities, but they'd have to be way more fleshed out than what's currently present.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972785116", "last_played": 1474995532, "num_reviews": 66, "num_games_owned": 313, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_created": 1474991022, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527810", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1475000970, "recommendationid": "25726333", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "*Update Dec 2016: Now that Google Earth VR is out for HTC Vive users FOR FREE, there is almost no need for this software's current build unless you want high-res textures for a handful of buildings of downtown S.F.*\n\nOriginal review before Google Earth VR was released: \n\nI've lived in San Francisco for many years. This is, on a macro level, a somewhat accurate VR rendering of the city. However there are two great disappoinments - first being that an entire half of SF is not available for viewing, including the iconic sunset district, half of ocean beach, the famous twin peaks, south San Francisco, as well as the San Francisco International Airport are all missing. Shouldn't this game be called \"CityVR - Half of SF\"?\n\nThe second disappointment is the lack of more detailed textures or volumetric rendering for objects such as trees, vehicles, signs, poles, and other such urban objects commonly found in any city. Adding to that, there is absolutley no lighting or option of lighting at night (not even a moon shine). If so, why bother making \"night time\" even available as a viewable time frame?\n\nOnce the above two issues are fixed, then it's a buy even at full price. For now, this is at best a low-res demo of the arbitrary HALF of the city that was claimed or implied to have been rendered in full.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995648910", "last_played": 1478335069, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 1482, "playtime_forever": 27}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1476966236, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508148", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1482263741, "recommendationid": "26128475", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Now that you can basically get the same experience with Google Earth VR, I feel pretty foolish for buying this.\n\nGoogle Earth VR is free and this set me back $15 and has worse graphics.\n\nUnless they get better textures or offer something more than G.E. gives for free, I have to give this a thumbs down.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198259749419", "last_played": 1477427777, "num_reviews": 62, "num_games_owned": 233, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1480975366, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503486", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1480975366, "recommendationid": "28210352", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The farthest away I've ever lived from San Francisco was 45 minutes.

I've never thought I'd be able to see it like this before. \n\nTracing how I'd typically enter the city, from the bridge to the exit I like to take - finding my way to my favorite Coffee spot, the art store, and the book store.. Seeing the huge towers shrink beneath me.. Cycling the day and night cycle while gazing off into the would-be hectic city. \n\nThis experience is great. It's hopefully the start of a new genre that I'd love to invest in. \n\nSure, theres no moving cars, pedestrians and lights when dark. But does it really matter?
