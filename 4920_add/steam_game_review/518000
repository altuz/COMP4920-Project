I have played quite a few times and my arms and shoulders are getting a real nice workout.

Your score increases very quickly if you do your best to keep your combo number high. The current implementation of the edge system (wall summoning) doesn't seem to add any strategic benefit since it resets your combo counter to 0, but maybe I'll figure out how it is beneficial after more play time.
