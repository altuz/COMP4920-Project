Aim Hero currently supports Overwatch, Paladins, and CS:GO. I train myself with Aim Hero if I'm bored and before every CS:GO session for about 5 to 30 minutes and my aim has improved significantly. Ace? done that several times in a few past days. Flick Headshots? done that 3 times in a single round on the last session I played.\n\nSure some fellas out there said that the classic and reflex training mode is available on custom maps in CS:GO community workshop. But the thing is Aim Hero also provide other modes that haven't been available on the workshop. While I should admit that classic and reflex training in Aim Hero lacks customizations (also in other modes), but I don't think that would be a dealbreaker for me.\n\nAlso, the mechanics and hit register is far more smoother than in CS:GO. I don't know if this is a negative thing for Aim Hero or not, since this would mean that Aim Hero doesn't reflect CS:GO's mechanics and hit registers perfectly (lmao).\n\nIncluding CS:GO's weapon (AK, M4, SMGs) recoil characteristics and its recoil training would make Aim Hero the perfect aim training simulator. Including pre-fire training on several popular maps such as Dust II, Inferno, Cache, or Mirage would also be nice.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198176205591", "last_played": 1506379835, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 55, "playtime_forever": 224}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504985703, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502876", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504986713, "recommendationid": "34845035", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The only thing that this game need is a horizontal sensitivity and a vertical sensitivity settings for overwatch.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "steamid": "76561198232139296", "last_played": 1506104887, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 208}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505203358, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502300", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505203358, "recommendationid": "34896840", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "workshop maps do the same thing but better.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198157180467", "last_played": 1503093321, "num_reviews": 41, "num_games_owned": 103, "playtime_forever": 46}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1505620791, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491206", "votes_down": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1505620791, "recommendationid": "35013527", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
