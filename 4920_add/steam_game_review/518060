Purchased game because I thought it included animated AI opponents, but there are none.  Perhaps in a later DLC they plan on releasing them. Tournament play is dead.  No players at all. Cannot offer a draw, computers AI never resigns.  Controls are clumsy. \n\nOnce the eye candy wears off there is not much here.  For those that really love the game of chess, this game cannot be recommended because it doesn't inlclude even half the features you can find in free chess programs.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 258, "steamid": "76561198035694064", "last_played": 1506887425, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 768}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505140873, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500096", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505140873, "recommendationid": "34884028", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
