I liked the small details, sounds like the developpers really thought about it.\nThe inspiration from Her Story is obvious, but I liked how they went further: there aren't just videos, there are small scene, sometimes really emotional- really enjoyed those with Winsmay. The characters are more relatable this way.\nIt can be quite hard sometimes, but I think it's a quality: you really have to think sometimes, there is a real mystery.\nBasically, I recommand it !
