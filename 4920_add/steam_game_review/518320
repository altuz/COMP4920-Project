If you played sokoban or a similar game before, it is easy to solve, you just need to backtrack and find which piece to move first.\n- Adds nothing new to the genre\n\n2/10 For that price, if you are seriously thirsty for another sokoban puzzler and cant find anything else, i say, you might try it.
