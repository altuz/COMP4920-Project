He would do that all day if I let him.\n\nSome thoughts on the game after watching him play it:\n1. Controls are very intuitive. He was able to figure them out quickly and I only had to remind him once that he could pull an object closer to him if he needed to. After that he was rotating objects on his own in order to finish coloring in a side.\n\n2. Although being able to move the objects around is nice, sometimes a new object is spawned over top of one that he just completed, resulting in clipping. He wasn't sure what was happening because he doesn't know what clipping is. One suggestion would be to replace the object back at its original position after it was colored in.\n\n3. The \"dong\" noise at the end of coloring the object was very helpful. He would keep looking for more places to color in until he heard that noise, even if they weren't apparent from his viewpoint.\n\n4. My son is a scaredy-cat. I had to literally push him into the swirling leaves at the beginning of the game because he was afraid they were going to hurt him (he was fine with subsequent leaves). I had to convince him the spider wasn't going to get him so he would keep playing (maybe make it a little more friendly looking?). But then he encountered his mortal fear at the top of a tower: thunder. That was it, it was time to get back to playing with Legos.\n\n5. Keep in mind that this game is all about walking around the objects and peering at them from different angles. Make sure your child knows how to not get twisted up in the cord.\n\n6. Excellent use of room space! Able to walk around the whole playing area without dealing with teleport or locomotion.\n\n7. It would be nice if there was more interaction with the completed objects. For example, in the \"tutorial\" area, when you finish the key it would be neat if you then had to bring it to the door. Nothing complicated, but it adds some interaction as a reward for the coloring.\n\nAltogether a good game for young children and well worth the price. When watching the preview video, remember to view it through the eyes of your pre-schooler who is fascinated with doing the same things over and over again, creating things, and seeing things change, and not your adult eyes that wonder why on earth anyone would play such a game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960456871", "last_played": 1475346798, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 147, "playtime_forever": 44}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1474049750, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497877", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1474049750, "recommendationid": "25531850", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Live in color is incredible fun!
