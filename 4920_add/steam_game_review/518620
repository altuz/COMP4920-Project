This game had me laughing from the opening cutscenes to the dialog in the mission prep which is a nice bonus and didn't expect. Reminds me a lot of PAYDAY, seeing what are your options from gaurds, objectives, entry points and ways to manuever around the level. At first the gun mechanics feel weird like why press 3-4 buttons to reload. But after doing it a few times and playing with it for the first few levels, its actually fun style of gaming. The pump shotgun, pressing left and right to cock the shotgun back every time you shoot is fun and makes you think and slow yourself instead of running through all the stick enemies. The game paces itself well with these gun mechanics and overall a nice system that works well. The beginning of the Ballistick is made really well, introducing the player to the three different styles of completing levels; stealth (silence pistol), tactical shoot em up (assault rifle), and balls out (pump shotgun). After the first levels of understanding each stlye, its up to you which style you want to play the of the levels. Overall Ballistick is fun and surprises you with the story, dialog, and gameplay.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046259064", "last_played": 1486184926, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 196, "playtime_forever": 275}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1477092149, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504630", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1477092149, "recommendationid": "26153798", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very good game, but short (3.5 hrs) thus the low price. Nice simplified graphics with a focus on fun gameplay. Its atkin to Gunpoint or Deadbolt but lots of differences too. You have infiltration missions that use stealth, grates to hide, covert close kills. Choose between a silencer, machine gun, explosives, gadgets (security cameras (equipment to disable) and can take cover behind objects to shoot/hide.  You pick how you want to enter the facility as well, so has replay value and a bit fairly tactical.\n\nIt is difficult too, on stealth missions if you are spotted by a camera - you start the level over, but the levels are not that long so it works well. I hope they add more missions, seems to be about 10. Probably can get 6 hours of out it as is.\n\n9/10 based on price.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198106729629", "last_played": 1477103465, "num_reviews": 235, "num_games_owned": 543, "playtime_forever": 197}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1476537430, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503097", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1477103622, "recommendationid": "26048767", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game was a nice little gem to me.\n\nIt's simple like the old stickman games, except not quite. You simply run around, kill enemies, get in cover to magically turn invisible.\nThe weapons system, if you use advanced mode, is actually really fun when you get the hang of it. My fingers enjoyed sliding around my Xbox controller (probably not as good if you used a keyboard) to reload and cock my weapons.\n\nSome parts of the game feel like they need improvement. Sometimes cover is just too easymode. You can sit in cover and cameras will ignore you, even if you're between the camera and the cover. You can sit in cover watching a patrol of three guards walk by and you can just stealth kill each of them, nobody will notice or care. You can place a Claymore mine - green with \"Place front towards enemy\" signage and all, on marble white floors - and then sit behind cover and click your clicker, and the enemy will just walk towards you and blow himself up. Never mind that giant green Claymore you're about to step on, you need to find out that mysterious clicking noise! (Side note: You can blow yourself up with Claymores, too.) I also disliked missions that force you to use stealth and try to narratively justify it. No, I don't have to go unseen, I just have to kill all the witnesses, I already had to kill all the witnesses elsewhere and it seemed to work just fine...\n\nThe story's almost disappointingly short, but it does have some replayability. I played every mission I could with the \"juggernaut\" loadout: the shotgun, ballistic vest, and grenades. But I want to try going back over them with the \"all-rounder\" loadout: the rifle, the clicker, and Claymores. Stealth nuts would also want to try the \"secret agent man\" loadout: suppressed M9, door snake cam, and EMP camera-busters. Plus the achievements seem interesting enough for an achievement hunter to want.\n\nBut what really would you want or expect out of a game like this? Aside from some, and certainly not all, stealth mechanics it's a shooter, with enough gore to satisfy those who crave it. It's all about slaughtering stick figures who apparently are ideologically incorrect and copies and clones and bosses and mafia and crimes oh my. There are certainly some missions where you can just waltz in and blast everyone in sight. The feedback of taking them down makes the experience feel hardcore, it's cool. I probably have issues but remember, video games don't make us violent - lag does. On top of that, the game does a good job of feeling open-ended, though whether it's actually open-ended is up for debate.\n\nSo yeah, this is a nice little game and especially one to check out if you played a lot of stick games back in the day. Stick Strike and Sift Heads are what I really remember thanks in part to Ballistick here. It plays surprisingly well, despite the lackluster graphical style (who am I kidding, it's stick figures here!) and parts that don't make a ton of sense.
