The GMs at first did pay attention to what people got to say and tried to make changes around it, but lately the only time you see GMs around are during the time with PVP with GM is here.  Even then is hard to present your feedback to them without receiving obligatory \"Thanks for your feedback (But clearly we are not interest)\".\n\nI see a lot of people say the game pay to play but that is the least of the issue here. Not so hard to make Zen without pay for currency.\n\nThe larger on the scale for problem is more on the side of the content/gameplay. \n\n1. They released a majority of the content in the beginning of the game, did not give time to progress  and let us have something to look forward to. Aside from the latest content, a hard mode difficulty arcade and one new special attack set but I will return to make points with this in another section.\n\n2.The new ladder system. Sure, its nice to see new things but this was something they should have left alone.  With this revamped ladder system, sre is easy earn your ladder that's nice but it broke PvP. Not only did this make it so that playing with friends practically become useless since there is no way to gain ladder but it has a negative effect as well. When you play in beginner1 its more than possible to leave it with 8-10 Stars in ranking. its almost the average now before entering Free1 Channel. \n\nHow does this effect gameplay? Well, if you want to earn ladder you are forced to play Auto-Team Balance, which in turn sometimes you are paired with a level 20 with 7-8 stars or so that does not actually know how to play. They earned their stars from winning just enough or being paired by someone who has maybe put an alternate in beginner 1 to make new class/help a friend level. And when you are paired to these person in pvp then chances are you will lose due to the amount of deaths they take and/or lack of ability to assist. So ranking means nothing. Also with this system its heavily abused from people leaving the room to prevent ladder loss.\n\n3.Content missing that was supposed to be here. With daily events half of them are broken. Warfare was suddenly taken in a patch and never did make a return even though it was supposed to in the last patch. The increased drill rates that do nothing. Unless the already incredibly small rate was increased by incredibly smaller amount, I do not see any difference.\n\n(etc)\nThe Hard mode arcade was a nice addition but its one of the very few things here you have to pay for to enjoy, or buy from a selling player.  But you need VERY good stats to stand a chance. For this you have two options. Grind heavy and buy good items or farm cow suit (Takes 30 days with once daily event.) or you can put cash and buy what you need. Either way its likely you will need to refine these items as well. So more grinding, or more money spent. Your choice.\n\nLastly, I feel that since this is intended as a Global server, they should make investments into something much more powerful. That, or invest in servers for each area (EU, NA, South America, Asia etc.) And I feel the GMs should interact more with the players and at least listen and consider the feelings and suggestions of the players regarding how the gameplay experience should be. \n\nUntil this happens, my review will remain negative.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198076650258", "last_played": 1490420337, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_forever": 20385}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1487336110, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505289", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1487336110, "recommendationid": "29983537", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "There is a lot of work to be done in this game, I played it back when it was in OG Planet, now its sort of a watered down version of what it was. \n\nIt literally is pay to win, no matter which way you look at it, but I have found a good way to farm money that involves separate accounts but that's another story.

It is fun only if there is balance, but that exists like in the beginning when everything just started. A game has been run several times by different companies already and now another publishing for almost three months, the player base dropped and is still slowly decreasing. According to its record, hope this time it will be lasting longer before shutting down.\n\nThe fighting system is definitely a rip-off of Urban Reign, a Namco game on PS2 released in 2005. Zone4 seems to appeal to more potential customers, so violence behavior is a bit reduced, and the pace is slower than Urban Reign. Somehow, certain handy features are not implemented like targeting on a specific opponent. Without this, confronting multiple enemies nearby may lead you to attack one which you unintentionally target.\n\nFighting movements of eight classes are highly inspired by famous fighting games, for example, Tekken, Virtua Fighter and Urban Reign, of course. In my opinion, most of them are the same animation yet crudely made.\n\nThere are three major modes, Hunting Ground & Arcade like Beat'em up games, PvP and Zombie Defense. Despite that, none of them are played often, at least, publicly.\n\nTo get survive in this game, good and high-level items and skills are required. With them, a player can advance to a better state, probably. However, problems are everything is based on luck, which is too strictly rare to happen when farming and upgrading. Without fair luck, there is no chances to acquire better gear. Without better gear, farming is painful. because of these, hunting ground is crossed out. Arcade is paid low, and the rewards of Zombie Defense even got nerfed. What's worse, all of them are limited in times to enter per day. Hunting Ground gives a player 30 minutes to hang around every time.\n\nPvP is what gives players more fun to stay and much more gaming experience, although there is some flawed unbalance between classes which are never fixed. All entertainment vanishes after becoming level 20 or above. A few hits by OP players and downs are the situation an ordinary player is going to face. Personal skill and experience won't work much against them when the difference of ability values between you and them is so huge, and also the delay makes it like rock-paper-scissors when dodging.\n\nItems purchased via the microtransaction are either too expensive or frustrating Gacha eggs which are usually timed.\n\nThe biggest deal in this game is, that stuff only available for people who pay real cash, which makes them earn Zen faster and easily. These items can only be accessed by them. As time goes by, the gap is getting even huge, making this game much harder for normal ones and of course, unfriendly to newcomers.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]\n\nConclusion, Game is based on good luck, paid for much better luck, unclear and unfriendly guides for starters, consists of unfair and unbalanced competition and glitches lying there for a long time. Game is potential fun, lots of selection for classes, but for a PvP game, which is still requiring some skill, it becomes a fail with the flaws and unbalance.\n\nFor return players, give a try and enjoy the old time and memories then.\nFor people who are new to it, I suggest wasting no time and cash. Honestly, this is just like a recycled game. There are thousands of far more interesting and cheaper games on Steam, whose developers deserve your courage and money.\nIf you really enjoy this type of fighting controls, go get Urban Reign to play with your friends.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197967073385", "last_played": 1486623931, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 1135, "playtime_forever": 7147}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1486724562, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486729136, "recommendationid": "29821086", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
