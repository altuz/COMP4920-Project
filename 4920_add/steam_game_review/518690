There's obviously more to it, but I would encourage anyone looking into this product to first do research and maybe along the way educate yourself on how computers work. It's only then that this software will seem less scary.\n\nIt's worked for me on some levels, and this is not a one size fits all as apparently results WILL vary from pc to pc... but it did what was advertised for me and allowed me to have more control over my computer.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044441888", "last_played": 1491950510, "num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 80, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1492044230, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503583", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1492044230, "recommendationid": "31107597", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Starting at the top - I'm not an expert, and you should vet any software like this independently. I\u2019m only reviewing this because I could barely find any information myself, so consider all of this anecdotal at best. Also, apparently the developer provides trial codes - I didn't realize this myself but I did buy it in the Steam Summer Sale at half the list price.\n\nEDIT: The playtime apparently only refers to the installation, which says I have 0.1 hours - at the time of writing I've used this for exactly one week, so take that into account. I'll update this review if anything changes significantly going forward.\n\nI had excellent success with both the \"PC Security\" and \"Gaming Accelerator 2\" elements of this package. The security element is more or less an automated \"whitelist\", allowing you to SPECIFICALLY allow or disable individual programs and processes, and will let you run programs or processes in a \"sandbox\", thus preventing them from accessing most other elements of Windows or your storage devices. This may or may not be what you, personally, are looking for, so be aware of that going in. It's not a traditional antivirus utility, and won't scan your PC in advance. I personally ran Malwarebytes in combination with an antimalware/rootkit boot disc, in addition to keeping Windows Defender updated; as best I could tell, I went into installing with a clean system, but someone with more experience might know of a better approach. \n\nThe \"Gaming Accelerator 2\" element, as far as I can tell, disables any non-essential startup programs and Windows processes, giving you more headroom for games (or any software, actually) to play around with, and was very Steam-friendly. \n\nIn my case, I used this software on three different systems - an older HP Pavilion desktop running Windows 7 64-bit Home, a Lenovo Thinkpad T430 running Windows 7 64-bit Pro, and a very old desktop running Windows XP 32-bit Home. In each instance, running the \"Max Boost Preset\" option (which requires a reboot) in the Gaming Accelerator gave me slightly better framerates, less CPU usage, and less stuttering. Just for fun, I tried intentionally infecting the old XP system by downloading and trying to run obviously dangerous junk, and the security element blocked everything from launching or running processes. I wasn't gutsy enough to try that on my \"good\" systems, but Seventh Knight does have a video on their Youtube channel which appears to be a successful block of an instance of \"Wannacry\".\n\nBoth desktops booted to Windows and launched programs significantly faster (10-30 seconds as opposed to up to two minutes; neither has a particularly clean install of the OS). On multiple occasions the Seventh Knight menu would launch several times on boot, and need to be manually closed. This only happened on the desktops I tried - the Thinkpad had no issues at all.\n\ntl;dr - If you already know how to configure Windows to eliminate bloat and use another sandbox utility, then this software might not be what you want, but I found it to be extremely easy to use, and it appears to do what it says it does. Hope this information helps others trying to get a better feel for the software!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197981240053", "last_played": 1498694484, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 392, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1498761443, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486391", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498761618, "recommendationid": "33004198", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great improvement in my top graphic games (almost everything ULTRA at 60 fps in ARMA 3, GTA 5, The Witcher 3... little drops to 55-50) with an I7 4790k, nvidia gtx 970 and 16 gb RAM.
