This one really reminds me of arcade shooters like Time Crisis, which is a good thing. A lot of weapons and unlocks, a nice variety of levels and locations, and decent graphics that won't blow you away but are still quite good. Not too much variety in modes, but the turret levels are very cool as you really feel like you're manning a large mounted gun.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004410106", "last_played": 1501628772, "num_reviews": 136, "num_games_owned": 576, "playtime_forever": 509}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505774176, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505774176, "recommendationid": "35054128", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
