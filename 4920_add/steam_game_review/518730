You are stuck with 1 layout for the entire game and the only thing new is the zombies but some are so similar to others you don't really have a hard time beating them.\n\nHeck I beat the game 100% without using any of the items in my backpack and that includes losing no hearts on the final boss. It is not a hard game and you can beat it 100% within 1-2 hours.\n\n\nFor that I say get it when it is on sale and not full price. Even at \u00a31.59 it does not really have any replay value unless you like endless mode but that is really up to you and how you see how much money you would spend for the hours given.\n\nBut it is not a game I would return to even if I had not 100% it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198167173649", "last_played": 1505125123, "num_reviews": 87, "num_games_owned": 203, "playtime_forever": 155}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505125363, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503141", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505125746, "recommendationid": "34880090", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[u][b][h1] Worth purchasing at full price. [/h1][/b][/u]\n\n[h1]Zombo Buster Rising[/h1]\nIt's a defense strategy game where you defend your base from waves of zombies of various types. You start with a single hero and gain two more shortly into the game. Each hero are static and can't move and each has their own unique weapon and you're given three special abilities to assist you in your defense. I completed it and obtained the 24 achievements after 2 and a half hours of playing. I were moderately engrossed in the game while watching a movie, so there's not much thought required to play the game. I bought it with a 90% discount coupon for a mere 0.20\u20ac and I do consider the game worth the original 2\u20ac price tag as it's not a bad game. However, I wouldn't place it at the same level of other games here on Steam as it's more of a web Java / WebGL game. The game exists both on iOS [url=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1138713731]App Store[/url] and Android [url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.funtomic.zbr]Google Play.[/url] The graphics are cartoonish and the sounds are decent but slightly repetitive as the background music is on a loop. The game lacks any graphical settings except two audio sliders. There's no built in Windowed Mode. However, you can somewhat force this by using the Windows shortcut [Left Alt] + [Enter].\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI'm recommending the game to anyone who wants to consume some time without much thought and anyone who wants a cheap game for achievements and Steam badges.\n\n[h1]Feedback[/h1]\nPosting your own experiences with Zombo Buster Rising whether good or bad assists newcomers in making their decision in whether to purchase the game or not.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 152, "steamid": "76561198000825911", "last_played": 1506466285, "num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 395, "playtime_forever": 152}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506465859, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507020587, "recommendationid": "35231632", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
