I often even forget the fact that I\u2019m looking for achievements in the game. And, for a gamer who enjoys the thrill of capturing every single achievie, that\u2019s a big deal. It is the total world immersion that makes the experience of COTW so impressive. I\u2019ve only been playing for 3 weeks, but at the time of writing the review I have 60% of the achievements and almost 200 hours in game. I am already the \u2018Hero of Hirschfelden\u2019 and \u2018Lord of the Lakes\u2019 because I\u2019ve explored the total area of both maps. (*Mumbles to self in monologue-ing voice: \u201cI like that. Yes I like that very much.\u201d) The missions are challenging enough that it will be awhile before I finish them all. So, time in game is almost unlimited. I can\u2019t see a stopping point yet.\n\n[b]UPDATE: Edited to remove problem with using 2nd monitor, since the latest patch 1.11.2 this works just fine. Thanks EW for the frequent updates & for listening to the community needs.[/b]\n\n [b]Story Lore/ Music & Sound:[/b]\nI often think of the game as a mountain climbing sim with hunting opportunities. Of course, that\u2019s because I\u2019ve often wished for a sim for climbing mountains. And, the challenge of discovering all the sights modeled after real-life geographical landforms: archipelago, butte, canyon, gorge, volcano, and much more, is all very alluring. But, many natural points of interest are integrated into the maps, providing a history or lore to these fictional maps that matches their real-life counterparts. You are able to climb every mountain in the game. You can explore totem memorials and abandoned ruins and collect artifacts. The sound effects immerse you in the outdoor world, and the music is lovely. Every area of the map is crafted with painstaking detail that provides eye-catching splendor to each sunrise and sunset.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nMuch of the fun gameplay comes in with tracking the animals, for hunting and for photography with the cinematic camera in the controls. The controls are all very simple, and can be keymapped for ease of use. I like the run toggle so you don\u2019t have to hold down W. I changed the E use key to mouse 5, so that when I\u2019m tracking I can run toggle and use the mouse to navigate and click to read the tracks as I\u2019m running. The overlay provides mapping and a codex that stores all your accumulated knowledge of the world you\u2019ve discovered.  \n\nThe day/night cycle is 4 times the speed of in real life. So you have 3 real time hours of darkness to immerse in the nightlife of the woods, as well as those daytime hours. Many outposts are scattered throughout the maps, and provide access to your storage, the in-game store, and a sleep point. Sleeping allows you to move time ahead in hours. Setting it to 18:00 for example, would make it sundown if you want to hunt at night. But, each time you sleep costs in-game money, making it a bit more of a challenge. \n\nYour character and your atv can take damage. Creatures stampede and can hurt you. But, \u2018death\u2019 only resets your character at a sleep point & you lose nothing. Atvs are unlimited. Abandoning one at the foot of a mountain is nothing. You can retrieve it at the next outpost, or even pitch a tent, and summon one up. Tents have a limit that seems to be about 7 or so on each reserve. With fast travel, you are able to move from tent to tent if you wanted to be in another location to hunt at dark. I like to explore in the daytime, and hunt at sunset, sunrise, and nighttime. \n\n[b]Tracking and missions[/b]\nThroughout the world you come across animal need zones and tracks. These can be \u2018read\u2019 to give information about when the animal species was last there and often how many animals were in that location. Returning to that spot at the same time will allow you to encounter that species, whether for hunting or photography. Multiple arcs of missions are imbedded in the single player to allow the option of structured gameplay, for those who want more than just simple run and gun type game play. Of course, even the most hobbit-like adventurers like me, who love to wander around the countryside seeing all the sites and animals, love to find a cozy spot on a rock overlooking a canyon and accumulate a few carcasses down below before climbing down to harvest them all.\n\n[b]The Shooter Experience:[/b] \nCOTW has a range of weapons that you feel sufficiently motivated to collect for hunting every species. Of course, more is always better, when it comes to weapons in game. More would be even better. It also has lures, ammo, and other gear for hunting. Scattered around the countryside are woodpiles for building permanent ground blinds using in-game currency. These provide more experience points for the skills & perk trees as well. The skill & perk trees provide a good range of skills to work toward increased hunting experience for the current 60 max of levels. These add abilities such as gauging the weather, and improved tracking skills. \n\nDLC expansions added ATV\u2019s and tents and ground blinds. I\u2019m not sure, but it looks as if these can be purchased eventually with in-game funds as an alternative, though it would take a lot of time. Either way, 4 bucks is the cheapest expansion dlc I\u2019ve seen. And, the ATVs are an awesome part of the hunting and exploration. And, the tents allow portable base access; functioning like the permanent outposts throughout the maps. Personally, I\u2019d love to see the addition of boats and fishing. But, that is just a wishlist item. I see no cons to this game.\n\n[b]The Diversity of Animal Life:[/b]\nThe game is inspired by the book, Call of the Wild by Jack London. Like the book, the game reveals much about the lives and behaviors of animals, and the great outdoors. Many species are integrated into the world of the current two reserves in Germany and America: Black Bears, Roosevelt Elks, Red Foxes, Coyotes, European Bison, Wild Boar, Moose, Red Deer, Fallow Deer, Roe Deer, Whitetail Deer, and Blacktail Deer. Besides the typical colors, several rare & albino furs appear randomly. The upcoming dlc expansion will add a third reserve in Siberia: Medved, with snow and an anticipated new selection of animals such as the already revealed Lynx. \n\n[b]Multiplayer[/b]\nI was in Scouting myself at an early age, and later an Explorer\u2019s Post as a young adult. I\u2019ve enjoyed the fun of group campouts with my sons in the cub scouts over the course of a decade & the numerous camping trips with families & friends over the years, and even group & solitary hiking & camping experiences. But, I\u2019ve never been hunting myself. As great of an experience as solitary hiking & camping can be, friendship is a huge part of the outdoors. COTW provides a smooth multiplayer experience, where you can either create your own server game, or jump in with already created servers. All outposts & locations unlocked in singleplayer are also available for quick travel on the multiplayer maps. You can join your buddies for group cooperative hunts or compete in challenges. \n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nI get 60fps steady & can play mp with crappy internet. No problems at all. Second monitor & the Steam overlay works great with COTW. You can even open vids in the overlay and listen while you shift/tab back into the game, which is really nice while sitting in a hunting stand in the dark waiting on the animal herd to arrive. \n\n[h1]Call of the Wild is a truly spectacular real world experience that takes all the quality of life improvements of computer video gaming and makes the outdoor life even better. [/h1] I highly recommend the game for animal lovers, fans of shooters, open sandbox, and sims. The devs at Expansive Worlds have made a high quality game for everyone to love.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 211, "steamid": "76561198154425859", "last_played": 1506275422, "num_reviews": 65, "num_games_owned": 1020, "playtime_forever": 15780}, "votes_up": 91, "timestamp_created": 1505389996, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631466", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1506113003, "recommendationid": "34946995", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I've never written a review for any game I've bought because I feel like the community usually does a good job of laying out the pros and cons.

Cabelas sells great gear.... but lets be honest... their hunting games are the worst... But anyway... one again thank you guys for making such a great hunting game and bringing the hunting genre back to life after the deer hunter series died. Sincerly thank you!!!!

Then trying to figure out what item it is that you just pulled out takes getting used to as you cannot see the name of the item anywhere on the HUD. For example you can pull out one of the calls or scent sprays, but you have no idea which one it is until you get very familiar with it's appearance as there is nothing anywhere that tells you what it is you just pulled out.\n\nThe animal AI is anything but realistic. It's like there was  little to no research that went into behavior patterns of different species. And if there was, it was very poorly implemented. \n\nThe gameplay mechanics are a total joke.

The ambience of the soundtrack will make you feel totally immerssed in this hunting simulation style game. The wildlife feels, at first glance, realistic enough with their calls of mating, warning and pathing. It gives you just enough tutorial to throw you straight into the game to understand it's basic mechanics without overloading you, however, just too little to teach you how to play the game properly. \n\n\n\ntheHunter: Call of the wild [Maps]\n\nBoth the Lake and Hirchfelden maps will take your litterally hours to traverse around the borders of them with a variety of areas such as mountains, rivers, lakes, plains, and forests to explore for animals. So whether you are taking pictures with your ingame camera or hunting you'll have no shortage of beautiful terrain to walk through to do so.\n\nOverall I'd rate the maps a stunning 8/10. While these maps are quite beautiful there are only 2 maps at the time of this review. If you spend any real amount of time in the game, you'll learn them like the back of your hand. They are not gigantic maps but they are big enough.\n\n\n\ntheHunter: Call of the wild [Progression]\n\nIt seems to be a growing trend in newer titles to have some form of progression system. Now while this works perfecly well with their leveling, skills and perks system it falls flat on it's face with weapons progression. To unlock higher end weapons you must use lesser weapons and their optics in harvested animals. Meaning you do not get the experience for your shots unless you track down your animal. It makes sense from how they implemented it but not why. There should be no need for progression on weapons. If I have the cash I should be able to purchase the weapon of my choosing regardless of the power of the weapon or view distance on the optic.\n\nOverall I'd rate the progression system a solid 5/10. It's completely average with no real innovation though it does needlessly lock weapons behind a seperate experience system which to me is a negative.\n\n\n\ntheHunter: Call of the wild [Stealth]\n\nCotW does have an intricate stealth system that works very well. You make noise as you move through grass, shrubs, bushes and trees making stalking prey a nice challenge for bow hunters and other close quarter hunters. It feels good to sneak up on your prey and take it down from stealth. Hiding in trees, bushes and tall shrubbery will also reduce your visibilty to animals making it an effective ambush location if you choose your spot well.\n\nCotW does NOT have camoflague clothing that works with the stealth system. This means even if you buy the camoflague clothing, for a high price I might add, it does nothing but change how you look to other players as you play from a first person perspective. So unless you want to play CotW barbie dressup edition clothing does nothing for you and that is a real shame. If I'm hunting in real life, which I do, I buy camoflague to increase my chances of bagging that trophy whitetail. There is already a visibility reduction statistic built into ground blinds that could be attached to camoflague clothing. To me this is a simple and much NEEDED fix to make immediately.\n\nOverall I'd rate the stealth system a very good 6/10. It's above average and does everything you'd expect it to. I've docked this from being better for the lack of real hunting camoflagues. A characteristic found in the much more venerable title of the same franchise, theHunter Classic.\n\n\n\ntheHunter: Call of the wild [Weapons]\n\nCotW suffers from a serious lack in variety of weapons. You have 2 shotguns, 3 pistols, 3 bows, and 7 rifles. It's really quite pathetic. This compounded with the fact that each weapon of the same type has the exact same effective range is a complete joke. Every single rifle has the same effective range of 150 meters, that's it. As a military veteran of the united states army I can quite easily tell you that their .338 rifle has an effective range of over 500 meters and has confirmed hits at over that range. It's unacceptable at best. Weapons also suffer from poor audio balancing. When firing the .357 magnum pistol for the first time while wearing headphones at an average or above average volume level it will give you quite the startle. Where as the .223, .243, .270, and 7mm rifles all have a good balance of sound. The ammunition choices seem acceptable at first glance until you shoot a .270 round into a white tails lung and it fails to come out the other side or penetrate both lungs. I've had 1 shot using the soft tip ammunition penetrate both lungs in easily over 100 rounds fired into lungs. In real life soft tip expansion rifle rounds more often than not go clean threw the animal. They don't stop because they hit the shoulder bone either unless you're hunting something above the rifles weight class like a bison. The accuracy stats on these rifles is all over the place. As an example one of the lever action rifles has over 800% better accuracy than a BOLT ACTION .338 LAPUA MAGNUM! Have these developers done any weapons research whatsoever? Apparently not.\n\nOverall I'd rate the weapons a lazy AF 1/10. There is no real weapon variety. The audio balancing is poor. The same range on all weapons is BEYOND lazy. The lack of realistic bullet penetration is pathetic and the accuracy ratings on some of these weapons is mind boggling inaccuracte.\n\n\n\n\ntheHunter: Call of the wild [Animal Artificial Intelligence]\n\nCotW suffers from some of the WORST animal AI I have ever seen in a hunting game. As a former game developer and with a little exploration I was able to come to a logical conclusion. \n\n|||\nThe following statement can be construed as hearsay as I do NOT have access to the games coding. \n(I believe the AI to be run on a pathing map placed below the real map that the players walk on. I have seen this blank map and have reasonable suspition to believe that the cause of some of the horrible pathing of the animals can be attritubed to this.)\n|||\n\nSooner or later you'll find animals that seem to walk completely in place without moving. Other times you'll find them running blindly into the same tree and sometimes for over 60 seconds. It's quite bizzare to watch an animal you've just shot at run at full speed, going nowhere, into a tree. I have also witness \"sinking\" animals where animals occasionally clip into the terrain. A bug common in theHunter series and still seems to be affecting the later titles as this bug is common around hills in both classic and CotW. \n\nI've watched animals return time and time again to an area in which I have fired a rifle, shotgun and pistol in harvested the animal and watched them return to me without callers. We had believed animals to avoid hunting pressure areas but that does not seem to be the case 100% of the time. In fact it happens so frequently that I've managed to at one point harvest 6 animals within 50 meters of where i first shot 1, then the second, third, etc.\n\nOverall I'd rate the Animals Artificial Intelligence at a 5/10. It's workable but could use some improvement.\n\n\n\n\ntheHunter: Call of the wild [Final Verdict]\n\nWhile the game runs great on it's maximum settings and has very high quality ambience the game suffers from illogical design choices and lazy programming. The lack of working camoflague in a hunting simulator is unacceptable. The animals AI is servicable but needs work. The stealth system works good enough and is acceptable. The weapons system is a complete and utter joke.\n\nOverall I'd rate it 5/10.

My buddy and I were on the fence about purchasing this game.  Since the hurricane has messed up our weather we decieded to enjoy the virtual outdoors.  All I can say is WOW!  So we played the original \"thehunter\" eariler today and we were inpressed.  It was a blast just both of us hanging out in the tree stand.  Talking about life, women, guns, etc.  Using my bait call and he was lookout. Once we saw some deer come out the tree line and cross the road we got so excited. Took the shot!  First deer went down right away. the second deer ran off, I know I hit her I saw the hole and blood come out.  After 20 minutes of tracking foot steps and blood we found her laying peacefully in the grass ready for harvesting.  So because that experience we purchased the new one \"theHunter: Call of the Wild\" and we were amazed of how beautiful the graphics are, makes you really think your in the woods.  The wind blowing through the trees.  The sound of animals in the distance.  We were in virtual hunter heaven!  We both purchased the game and all the DLC's.  I mean for 30 something bucks it's really not bad.  Well time to get back to my game, btw I typed this up while we both are in our new tree stand waiting for night fall.

I am however going to keep this short as super long reviews aren't my fortae unless i'm getting paid for it.\n\nWell what can I say about this game. It's very realistic. This is to say its realistic coming from the eyes and ears of someone who has never hunted IRL. The game feel and looks and sounds exactly how the wild actually sounds. The wind blowing through the trees, the chirping of distant birds, the dripping of rain during a storm, and of course the echoing shout of a gunshot and the thrilling thud of a deer hitting the floor. All the sounds make me feel like I really am in the German wilderness.\n\nThe graphics are extremely beautiful. I have taken more screenshots of nothingness in this game than I will of interesting things happening in other games. You will be walking along, minding your own business when all of a sudden a vista framed in trees calls to you. It begs you to take a picture. It makes you feel as though you truly have stumbles upon a sight that no one has ever seen before. It is as thrilling as the hunt.\n\nThe gameplay is not perfect at this time. Sometimes when you are tracking the calls of a Roe Deer, you hear the thumping of hooves only to turn around and see a majestic creature running continuously into a tree only to take 4 point blank shots with a .243 rifle with soft point bullets and still run. The bugs are here but are getting less and less apparent as time goes on. \n\nOh dear... this has already gone on too long. My poor little fingers are aching and if I type one more paragraph someone is going to have to give me lots of money. I will however say this, the game in my opinon is fantastic and a great improvement over the classic. Get this game and stop reading (assuming you havent already stopped....I would have)\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044858929", "last_played": 1505895424, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 257, "playtime_forever": 495}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505761616, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503065", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505761616, "recommendationid": "35051245", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "First off I would like to say this is a great game. The graphics are some of the best out there, and gameplay is amazing.\n\nHowever, if you would like to own all of the game, get out your wallet because the 30 dollars this game costs isn't what you will pay. With the announcemenet of the new map, I became very disappointed. I already bought the game, why can't I enjoy all of what it has to offer without paying for DLC? The reason I paid for this game is because I wanted to experince all of its content, now and in the future. But, because they are making you PAY for updates in DLC, I cannot. The reason theHunter Classic has such bad reviews is because of its annoying microtransactions, and limiting meberships. They are slowly falling down the same slippery slope as theHunter Classic did. \n\nTo the devs, if you are reading. Don't continue to charge your fan base for updates. I understand, its hard to make a profit as a game studio, but is it worth turning your audience away? Is it worth angering the people that make your game and your studio a success? You know how to boost your Steam SEO -- by getting good reviews. If you want good reviews you will have to make your audience happy. That means stop charging for content that should be part of the game itself.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nGreat game, even better graphics. However, the devs are fallilng down the same slippery slope as Rockstar did.
