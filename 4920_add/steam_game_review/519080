In other words, there is G.I. Joe then there's M.A.S.K.. There's Transformers then there's Go-bots.  There's Thunder-cats then there's Silver-hawks. There's TMNT but then there's Street-sharks. There's Batman The Animated series then there's Disney's Gargoyles. Er,you get my point!\n\nSoda-Girls embodies the above conundrum. With iconic characters that look like they're the \"cousins\" of all-time-great gaming Divas like Tron Boone(with assisting mech),Samus Aran,Nightshade, and Jill Valentine it's obvious the developers are pretty honest about wearing their inspirations on their sleeves. Furthermore, the graphic style bears more than a slight semblance to Skull-girls.Viewtiful Joe, and some of our nostagic favorite kids shows from Cartoon-Network. None of this feels sloppy though as the little details and in-jokes show how much the developers cared when making this game. There's a difference between \"entirely ripping off\" an idea as opposed to being inspired by an idea and putting one's own twist/embelishment on it. Soda Girls fortunately does more of the later than the former.\n\nOn the surface some might mistake Soda Girls to be a \"mindless brawler\" with some platforming segments in which you must navigate police-woman Jacey (Your first character in story-mode before you help to liberate Jacey's friends) thru small contained 2D danger zones of falling debris, electric panels,sinking foot-steps,and various exploding propane cannisters. Luckily these same hazards can be used againt the enemies too forcing you to strategize. Unlike other brawlers, enemies in Soda Girls come at you in smaller numbers though they tend to be a lot more formible. Aka a couple of zombie hippy girls or zombie weiner dogs can still fuck your shit up if you go into a fight with bad timing. (Sorry I failed to mention there's a zombie apocolypse going on but now you know!)\n\nBosses start off easy peasy but by the time I got to \"The Cess-poll\" there was a Junk-rat looking psychopath giving me issues as he eventually eats the huge mutton chop he's beating you with (restoring his health) THEN he brandishes a friggin shotgun that can fire in three directions. This means yeah,you'll probably have to grind to level up whilst farming for better weapons, farming more bottle caps to purchase additional perk-items (Or level them up as well), and pick up more attacks to mix and match in your various combo strings. I can see how some might get frustrated by this but for me it's just a chance to improve and loot which appeals a bit to my OCD-laden tendencies!\n\nOddly enough, one character can even improve the performance of enemies. I'd advise against this until you're very skilled and prepared but if you want greater risks and greater rewards the oppertunity is definitely there.\n\nFurthermore, reviewers that complain there's only one attack button miss the point. Aka the whole appeal of soda-girls is unlocking \"new attacks\" that you can place in any sequential order on one of three equipped plan sheets. Yes, you are pressing one button rapidly to do combos but those attacks are ones you can put into any order you want. This once again plays into the strategy of the game as you'll need to experiment with the sequential order of different moves to get the best and flashiest results. I feel as if people out there read a few bad reviews about Soda Girls being a \"mindless button masher\" and never bothered to clarify whether that was true or not. It's really not and the challenge always feels \"just right\" though if you're in a jam all the characters can be \"leveled up\" and also be equipped with additional charms and ornaments that can increase strength,speed,immunity to certain kind of attacks,and even the rate at which you attain bottle caps (currency) or experience points.\n\nThe only qualm I can level against Soda Girls is it's still an early acess game though in its' defense it seems to be an early acess game that's \"almost\" done. Aka, there's already a lot there but the developers have talked about adding more characters and more stages. I'm hoping they do just that though I understand how it can be discouraging to put together such a good game only to have it be a \"flash in the pan\" as far as its' public impact is concerned. Aka, I feel with the right marketing and the right e-celebs doing let's plays Soda-Girls would have really \"taken off\" as it taps into that same nostalgia as Skull girls,Viewtiful Joe, and Senran Kagura.\n\nPros\n\n+Good cast of unique characters\n\n+ Nice colorful and outlandish \"punk noir\" enemy designs\n\n+ You get to custom create your own combos\n\n+ Levels tend to be well designed with a decent balance of enemies and environmental hazards. (Which if you're smart enough can be used to your own advantage. Kicking a propane tank into a pile of slumbering zombies is always fun!)\n\n+ Appealing art style\n\n+ Is deeper and more layered in complexity than it initially seems\n\n+ Injected \"something new\" into the beat-em-up genre which is not something I see done too often\n\nCons\n\n-It can be easy to get caught up in \"cheap juggles\" from multiple foes.\n\n- Some bugs remain. In one area I could literally \"walk on air\" and I'm sure that was not intended.\n\n- Still \"early acess\". We can only hope the developers are stalwart enough to see this one through and finish their work.\n\n- Soda Girls had a \"flash in the pan effect\" which may have discouraged its' creators even more. Still, a somewhat recent update suggests not all hope is lost!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067228539", "last_played": 1503683643, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 127, "playtime_forever": 278}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503687733, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499948", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1503687733, "recommendationid": "34487722", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
