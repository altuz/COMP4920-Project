The giant ape wouldn't stop turning off my lights and wacking off behind my doors. But, there came a point where I was put in a maze that I don't recall ever installing in my basement. The elevator also seemed a little off but we'll save that for another time. However, a point arose where I needed to go full on Putin and hack the pants off three computers. Luckily, my hacking skills are top notch and I only needed to press one key. But, alas, there was an obstacle. This absolute mongoloid fresh out of the thunder dome kept chasing me. But, with a few masterful manuevers I was able to put the slimey ape on skates. His ankels looked like he was fresh off the boat from somalia after I was done with him. His career was absolutely ended. Along with this tard's inability to perform proper defensive technique, he also struggle with shooting the gap between door frames. On multiple occasion my persuer was halted at least six times because the gosh darn bunglard couldn't squeeze his thunder thighs through the \"slim\" doors.
