What you see int he video is what you will do for the first 35 game days until you finally start generating enough money to sustain yourself.  Then you'll start saving for upgrades.  But if you buy any upgrade that increases the rate you gain EXP, it breaks it.  A number of things don't work.  There is NO sound in the game.\n\nI figured I'd check it out since I play so many incremental games and stuff but after I get my refund, I honestly wouldn't pay $0.05 for this game.  Sorry Dev.  Not sure how you got this onto steam but it doesn't belong here yet.

No clear objective, no pop-ups that explain anything that's happening. The \"gameplay\" is so minimalistic, even for a \"managing tycoon\" game. It has about 40-50 minutes of gameplay value, and the time you put in the game feels more like a chore than a experience.\n\nThe graphics in the room are decent looking, like a decently made flash game. But the ingame ui system is basically made with paint alpha version. And no text, you dont understand the menu system until you hover over each part, and even then it's hard to understand since nothing is ever explained. \n\nOverall it's a pretty shitty game, hard to understand how it made it through the greenlight. Feels more lika an alpha version of something that could've been great, but the developer obviously doesnt really care about the game, otherwise he would've never realesed it in this state.",
