And for a game with such a price, it does come off as a pretty good game. But of course, that doesn't mean there isn't any lack of bad things in the game. \n\nThis game tries to be very realistic and I love that but there definitely should be a limit to that. The shooting mechanics in this game is what frustrated me the most. Much like real life, It is damn near impossible to get a headshot from even a small distance. Even with the strongest sniper rifle in the game. So, if you wanna ambush someone, throw a grenade. You will have a much better chance at killing them. (Btw buy the grenade, chances are you will never stumble across it in the game) Now don't even get me started on the leaning and aiming. No, you can not lean and you can not switch to left or right sides while aiming. \n\nThere are factions in this game. You can choose to be either a Civillian (Good guys) or a Looter (Bad guys. You will still probably end up choosing this one anyway) If you kill any member of your faction you will become a Traitor for about an hour and a half in the game. Meaning you have committed a grave sin and everyone you see is gonna F**k you up. It brings some balance into this game. \n\nAnd I'd absolutely hate to be stabbed in the back by a guy I thought was friendly.... *Cough* Was a Traitor just a few hours ago *Cough*.\n\nThe main map isnt anything that interesting. Its smaller in comparison to many games out there as well but the developer had just added a new map in the game and I believe they will keep adding more. \n\nThe basics need for survival comes by without much of a problem. Its less likely to die of hunger or thirst. You don't have to do much to get yourself all loaded up with gear as well. Even if you have been killed and then looted of all your stuff, it's not gonna be that hard to get them back (Trust me, have died more than you think)\n\nThe game without a doubt, is very enjoyable despite it's horrible shooting mechanics and small maps. There are plenty of missions to keep you grindi-err I mean entertained. Becoming the baddest of the baddest with the gause gun in hand is an experience thats going to stick around. From running wildly while being covered in fear to walking with style and blowing your enemy's head up... You're gonna love it all.\n\nIn the end, it is a very cheap game that is not at all horrible. It does have some issues but it is still in development and can obviously become a much better as it finishes. \n\nBut of all the things...\n\n...Its costs ten bucks. Ten Bucks.\n\n\n\n \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2280, "steamid": "76561198212450055", "last_played": 1507097161, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 3143}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506947866, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502491", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506947866, "recommendationid": "35413960", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Definitely buy it if u want good survival game \nLovely stalker feel no zombies lootable npcs\ni would say Dayz + Stalker - Dayz bugs There are some bugs but they are pretty funny like we got car run over a bear our car did 360 flip 10/10 with friends its definitely best multiplayer survival game and funny as hell \n\nRecommended 99% there isnt that much of a content but enough locations a lot of weapons but its still early acces so definitely buy it for 8.99 or wait for sale 4.99 and u will have the best cheap game", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 368, "steamid": "76561198158299797", "last_played": 1506170881, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 2454}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504721603, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490385", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504721603, "recommendationid": "34780529", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "7/10\n\ngraphics may not be that good,they are some bugs in the game cuz its only early access.they have more to fix so please wait. \n\ngameplay are awesome as you choose between 2 faction.\n\nkilling is fun RECOMMEND TO BUY", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1252, "steamid": "76561198167183217", "last_played": 1506861484, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_forever": 2016}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506131394, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503398", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506131394, "recommendationid": "35141706", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I enjoy this game.

We need more confrontational missions. More reasons to engage opposing faction players, not just NPCs. On all the servers i've played, maybe 3 times i've seen a civvie come to bereski. Perhaps getting rid of the secondary looter camp would be better to promote confrontation in a city landscape.\n\nEdit 1: The new map is awesome. Definitely adds a challenge with the military camp.
