KKBB takes place in a floral hellscape, a dystopic alternative reality where the only path to freedom is the completion of endless Sisyphean tasks. The only remnant of society is that of the callous worms, who idle their days away in relative wealth, engaged in pursuits like hot air ballooning. I can only imagine the tragedy that caused every single inhabitant of this world to loose their arms and legs. (Perhaps a prequel will answer that!) However, kitty doesn't afraid of anything. She (?) transcends the existential torment and succeeds again and again, despite the onlooking worms - even if it means standing on a pile of her foes' skulls! Well, at least until level 28, where kitty gave up and started playing a different game, because level 28 is freekin' impossible.\n\nKidding aside, play this game if you like puzzles.
