Of course I do not appreciate blatant cash grabs or two minute experiences but I do not think this game is one of those.  It is clear to me that this guy has built and contributed his own labor of love and you can tell from the price that he knows that it does not stack up against a polished title.  From playing this game I can see some of the mechanics are flawed such as hitting the ball hard as a right hander and the friction of the ball on the surface can seem a bit off.  But what I can tell, especially from their youtube devlog, is that this person has tried hard to build something they can be proud that they have done themselves and are willing to share with the community for a trivial price.  It reminds me of the old C64 days where it was all a new frontier and it was all about just being a part of it.  So try not to look at this as a professional title on the steam store - compared to others it certainly does not hold up.  But looking at it as a hobbyist contribution, it is a worthwhile attempt and I certainly enjoyed the nine holes.  Of course there are many issues and problems with the game in early access and I will log these in the discussion section, but if you take the time to see their devlog you will see this is an honest attempt to provide a simple vr experience and I do feel that I have got my $2 worth - especially if the mechanics issues continue to be worked on.  Not everything on steam has to be of the highest standard, as long as the price is right and it is clear that it is not a deceptive or cynical submission.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971195243", "last_played": 1495160083, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 692, "playtime_forever": 104}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1475880595, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502998", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1475896666, "recommendationid": "25913558", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Wow great job on the update!
