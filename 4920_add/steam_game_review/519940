After building a brand new VR system i gave it another try (from intel Q9450/GTX 980 ->intel 6800k/GTX980) is was playable (still just barely).

The controls are intuitive, though much like Tetris itself you have to be a bit careful how you try to place the blocks -- if you're not paying enough attention, you'll place the block in an unintended way (this is not a slight on the game, it's part of the inherent difficulty of the puzzle).\n\nOne of the biggest things I like about this game that sets it apart from Tetris is that you can rotate the blocks around to place them in 360 degrees, which makes it quite a bit easier to place blocks on the grid -- for example, you can take a right-facing L block and rotate it in 3D to a left-facing L block; the two \"types\" of L-blocks are still color coordinated (purple and orange), but functionally they are the same block.\n\nAll in all, for $4 this is a good addition to your VR library, especially if you're wanting to introduce VR to people because everyone's already familiar with Tetris and this game does a great job of showing how VR can expand/enhance gaming.

Moving in a 3d space, you can turn those pesky z-blocks around to make them s-blocks. You can also fill holes left so long as the shape will fit it.

In Kubz VR the rate increases automatically but does reach a maximum.
