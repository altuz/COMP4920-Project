There is considerable focus on scoring, and as the seasons progress your score becomes much more dependant on luck than skill.  It gets increasingly frustrating, as you are denied the three-star score for either failing to use one of each colour and shape to fill the grid, or for getting stuck at any point.  This would be tolerable if it were actually always possible to 'win'.  It is not - you can fill the grid without ever being offered a shape / colour that you need.  The massive ramp up in probability of failure in Winter is especially frustrating.\n\nThis game feels at odds with itself.  If it wishes to be relaxing, it should drop the score and the achievements (and put something in their place, as the game feels a little empty as it is).  If it wants to be a puzzle game, it should eliminate the luck component.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970692817", "last_played": 1481142158, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 288, "playtime_forever": 302}, "votes_up": 38, "timestamp_created": 1480256671, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567945", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1480256671, "recommendationid": "27835461", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It could have been a good game...
