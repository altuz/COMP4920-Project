This is perhaps the most punishing and cryptic game you will ever play. There are a lot of problems with glitches and game design which you would have to overlook to enjoy it. Overall Your Star was a chore to play through but I feel that originality of this game alone could possibly make into a cult classic. Saying all that do not buy this game if you not very forgiving toward unintuitive mechanics and puzzles. \n\n[b] Technical Issues [/b]\n\nI was experiencing a lot of game breaking glitches that kept resetting my progress. Developer fixed some of the issues so I was able to get though the game eventually. You will likely run into some bugs that may force you to reload save files such as invisible text. I am sure there are more problems to be found but I think Developer is very proactive if you can help him identify where bugs happen.\n\n[b] Immersion and psychological aspect [/b]\n\nPerhaps my favorite thing about Your Star is a psychological aspect of the game design. Your character has 3 resources which are mind, light, and will (basically health, ammo and armor aura). I think Mind is the one that drains overtime as in your character is going insane (even if you just stay still) The game sort of implies that crazy events have the effect on the character and it also impacts gameplay. Your Star has a very unsettling atmosphere as a horror game should. I experienced loneliness and sadness playing this game with some relief toward the end. It is very easy to get lost in the mood.\n\n[b] How hard is it? [/b]\n\nNearly everything you do and don't do slowly kills you. So basically the game is timed and if you not quick enough you will eventually die. There are enough items to barely get you though assuming you not using the guide. Without a guide, you will do a lot of backtracking which slowly kills you so you will need to leapfrog on your safe files. Enemies toward the middle of the game respawn few second after you kill them so you have no time to fart, let alone explore the area. I am somewhat experienced with these games so I managed to pull through by the skin of my teeth. Not exactly casual game. Made even harder by some design problems and dark environments.\n\n[b] Gameplay and cryptic puzzles [/b]\n\nIt is kind of like a wird mixture of Silent Hills and Witch's House. There is some combat, resource management, and obviously puzzles. I had to use pencil and paper for some of the riddles that require math so don't expect it to be straight forward. About 60% of the game is logical and the other 40% is convoluted, to say the least. There is a neat alternate world mechanic where things are different. You will also find different kinds of power-ups, some of which hidden in secrets and side-quest.When you kill enough enemies you will even level up your attributes and get items. Very weird game which is why I kinda like it.\n\n[b] Story and replay value [/b]\n\nYour star has a mature story that was well paced and explained toward the end . There are side quests, secrets, and even several endings.  I am a little skeptical that someone would make the effort to beat this game several times just because you so happy to even beat it once. It took me 8 hours to beat the game without a guide but do to glitches it was closer to 14 . So with several endings I would say game has about 15 to 20 hours worth of content .\n\n[b] Hand drawn backgrounds and animations [/b]\n\nYou have to give credit where credit is due. Not everyone can make RPG maker game with their own drawings and I appreciate that . It is a pretty dark game so it might be hard to tell where things are. The tone overall suits the story so I did not really mind it. Not exactly a gorgeous game but I dig the gloomy art style and gore .\n\n[b] Music [/b]\n\nUnfortunately, I think this is one of the weaker attributes of the game. I did not find soundtrack very enjoyable and the sound was not used particularly well when it was needed. You will probably find that a boss song feels very out of place for example. There are many areas that have no music. Perhaps you could argue that horror game can get away without music but I prefer something ambient in all places.\n\n[b] Verdict 7/10 [/b] I really debated with myself if this game was worth for someone who is not as masochistic as I am. Normally I would not recommend a half-broken game but there is something special here . For $4 this game was worth in WTF moments for me at least .\nYour Star has a lot of good elements and combination of those that you will not see in other games. There is a good Core idea but it needs a lot of glitch fixes and more intuitive mechanics. Some of the things will hopefully get fixed but I still see it as a cult game which only the most persistent RPG maker fans will enjoy .\n\nUpdate: Developer fixed some of the problems and added extra features that I asked for (like gamepad and better inventory) so I bumped score from 6 to 7... I plan to beat the game for another ending and I appreciate that developer still puts time into this old game .", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995669628", "last_played": 1494624917, "num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 597, "playtime_forever": 984}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1491449499, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510326", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1494545383, "recommendationid": "30972540", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I'm only just starting out, but so far, this game is amazing. The combat isn't too impressive, but that's not the point. The atmosphere, the mystery, the puzzles... that's what pulls you in and keeps you wanting to play. There are points where guidance is limited, and saving is disallowed in some places (and costs resources when you can save), so you should fully expect to have to repeat some sections.\n\nI will be playing this game almost nonstop until I've beaten it. \n\nStrongly recommended to anyone who likes dark, gritty mysteries (fans of Amnesia will most likely really enjoy this).\n\n--------------------------------------------\nUpdate:\nAs much as I liked the game at first, the more I played the more the issues were made apparent. I think what initially drew me in was the mystery-oriented game in the vein of a classic SNES concept with a feel of Amnesia. But the deeper I got, the more difficult it was to proceed. I realized I was forcing myself to like the game in the last bit of play, because I really wanted it to be something I could love. The guidance is more limited than I thought, to the point where some of the puzzles are trial and error rather than something that can be clued together and figured out. Besides all that, what I think finally did it in was when I realized I had to cut my lights out to be able to see the screen, and even then I had to strain to make out some details. That made me pull back and objectively look at what I'd been playing more critically.\n\nThe game is a still a beautiful concept, but the design of the puzzles needs work, a brightness/gama option for players to customize their experience would be a huge help, and more interaction with the player outside of major story events.
