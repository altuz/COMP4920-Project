Look at the amount of time I have spent in this game - you will likely have anywhere between that and double that as of this version.\n\nAs it stands, the game definitely boasts some pretty fantastic promise. I was able to quickly envision the characters in a series, easily. The main character seems a tad too comfortable with the situations she is placed in, however I feel like this will make more sense with more of game being released.\n\nThe visuals are fantastic and every aspect of this game is refined, for what little there is. I bought this title because I see a lot of promise in the dev, and for what there is out now, it is most certainly a well placed belief. This game feels like the next Starfox 64, but in VR. That said, the gameplay and style are very consistent. \nIn terms of gameplay though, some kind of variation in weaponry would be much appreciated, and perhaps a better use of the touch pad and grip buttons, as they are wasted Vive Controller revenue at this point. \nAt this point, buy the game to support the Dev, or if you've read the Early Access notes and are all right with them. Huge thumbs up from me, but it's up to the dev to really kick things into gear and continue to release content.\n\nI really like what I see so far, and I know the VR world is tough right now, so if there's any way I'd be able to help, please do not hesitate to reach me, I'd be willing to invest time in this project of yours.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198052665462", "last_played": 1496353234, "num_reviews": 32, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1496353462, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515350", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496354262, "recommendationid": "32116059", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I had fun with the first two levels and excited to try more.  I love the way the music makes me feel.  My only suggestion is I'd really like to see you incorporate translations of the headset to manuever around as opposed to just the head tilt.  The problem with using the head tilt is I can't fly in one direction while looking and shooting in a different direction.
