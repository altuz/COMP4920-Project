It looked like it would be awesome but it didn't make a very good first impression on me.  \n\nIt's supposed to be like having an array of virtual monitors to display all of your content Instead what I was met with upon loading it up was a mostly black screen (some stars too so it's not an error) and then this tutorial window pops up.  I look at all the stuff you can do according to the tutorial and it seems to work ok.  After the tutorial I see an infinite mirror of everything I'm doing and I have to question why.\n\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/107354018504271602/B1AF03D37B0AF770CE2E2AC65CC48B8F14136DC3/\n\nThat's a huge turnoff right there.  I tried to turn that off and then there was nothing to do but look at a severed hand floating around in front of my face. Where's the ability to open a window? Do something like they show in the video?  It's very poorly explained.  \n\nI remove the headset and look at my monitor and apparently that's showing me on my 4kTV everything that I'm doing, and bringing up the desktop is showing me that over and over.  I couldn't get it to minimize  so I could see my actual desktop.  I had to remove the headset, load up a page in my browser, then make sure it was on top of the fullscreen view of what was going on inside dreamdesk, then I put the headset back on, watched a video with TONS of lag.  Audio came through 1/3rd of a second before the video. \n\nEverything was horiibly aliased and hard to read (Virtual desktop sorta suffered from this problem as well).  There were no options to increase the resolution.  I think it was basically taking a crappy resolution and then upscaling it poorly to fit the virtual screen.  All in all it was a wreck...a disaster. A dream? No, a nightmare... Ok, no it wasn't that bad... but I felt like it was a waste of money.\n\n$15 for the promise that this eventually won't suck...I don't think I have that kind of patience.  I'd rather pay $25 for something that doesn't suck now than $15 for something that might not suck later (or might suck worse).\n\nPros:\n[list]\n   [*] It has a lot of promise if they can ever live up to it\n   [*] Everything the tutorial promised I could do was pretty easily doable, though it still requires a mouse and keyboard\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n   [*] It's horribly unpolished\n   [*] It is confusing to try to get some real use out of it\n   [*] Laggy \n   [*] Poor resolution so that text is hard to read unless you zoom the screen up to a huge size\n   [*] Clunky interface with the half-assed vive controls \n[/list]\n\nIf you have faith and patience, go ahead and spend $15.  If you want something that works well right now, then look elsewhere.  These guys need a lot of work.
