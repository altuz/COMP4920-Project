I'm now 50 and no longer a hardcore gamer!\nThe two-layer battlefield is a good idea. Nice 3D-stereoscopic effect, perfect for what I was looking for: something to easily test my hardware (3D monitor with \"vintage\" NVIDIA 3D Vision 2 glasses; support of the  Microsoft 360 controller is OK). And, oh yes, I actually noticed the sprites are 3D too! ;)\nHoping some more ambitious features will follow (at least more alien waves) but nice work anyway.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046235281", "last_played": 1500576556, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 10, "playtime_forever": 101}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1500160476, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500189399, "recommendationid": "33572084", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
