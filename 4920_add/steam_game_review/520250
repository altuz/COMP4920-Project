It would seem that our hapless farmer hero has purchased a spot of land, most likely near Area 51 by the looks of it, but the nearby aliens have escaped their enclosure and are wreaking havoc.\n\nDisclaimer: I honestly bought this game solely because of the derpy, bald, one-armed screaming guy in the rocking chair that shows up within the first few seconds of the video. Seriously. I don't know why, but that made me laugh every single time I stumbled onto the store page. When I found the guy in-game? Priceless, simply priceless. His scream is just so derpy that it's the most entertaining factor of this entire game. Anyway...\n\nYour main goal is to of course defend the farm. You do so by picking up dynamite and placing it on the large alien eggs laid about the farm, all the while dodging aliens of various types as well as the ever-looming UFO that will abduct you if you happen to wander under its spotlight. The waves are separated into days, and by the end of the fifth and final day the farm is completely overrun with spider-like creatures, gargantuan blue-light stalkers, and regular looking aliens.\n\nWhile Visitors can provide some fun, and a bit of replayability thanks to the in-game trophies and VHS tapes that can be found, the entertainment that it holds is an hour's worth at best. The graphics and sounds aren't anything to boast about, and the enemy AI follows set paths with no deviation. If you die, or quit out of the game, you start back at the beginning of the current day that you're working on. The optimization is surprisingly fine, with no dips below 60 FPS on an i7 6700k/GTX 1080 combo. It's not a terrible game, but it's hard to believe that it's being sold at a price of $5.49 CAD when it's a $1.09 game at best. If you do come across it when it's on sale, only get it for the derpy scream guy.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]2.0/5.0[/b] - It's not awful, but it's not great.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork#curation]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049701098", "last_played": 1495886626, "num_reviews": 203, "num_games_owned": 2338, "playtime_forever": 14}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1495997859, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510303", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1495998199, "recommendationid": "32026700", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This gem is king of shit.
