It's more arcadey dungeon crawling than action RPG. You spawn in unarmed, and monsters swarm you immediately. The procedural generation seems a little shallow in this regard - there's really no time to look around and explore your surroundings without trying to fight off a mob. \n\nThe crafting isn't really crafting as much as a little weapon tier system/loot drain. There's a list of all the things you need to upgrade your weapons and armor (i.e. 1 silver sword + 3 gold bars = 1 gold sword) I didn't find any special abilities/perks and afaik there's just one character to play as so far. While the videos show a lot of tactical one on one combat, I didn't see any of that in my 5 or so deaths and gave up on the hack and slash.\n\nI wouldn't recommend the game, but if you're into procedurally generated hack and slash pixel brawlers, where you can make your sword a bit stronger and find armor and stuff, you'll probably dig it.

It is understandable that Underworld Dungeon is not for everybody, and reviews such as this will allow the team to improve the game so that more people will be able to enjoy it. I will have to ask you however how you only seem to have found one character to play as thus far, as there are currently four playable characters in the final game, three of them being available from first booting the game. If this appears to be a bug or error, please contact me immediately.\n\nThanks,\n\nPanda Games.", "recommendationid": "34942569", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
