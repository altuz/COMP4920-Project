Not so great gameplay.\n\nWas really hoping to like this game, as it looked funny, and more of a movie car stunt simulator than anything, if you go based on the trailer video.\n\nThe controls are atrocious, turning corners is more like a suicide mission, and when get some air time, these little wings come out of your vehicle.\nUnfortunately, they are not practical, and are nothing more than eye candy.\nSo if you were expecting to fly the camper in this game... Forget about that idea.\n\nThe graphics & sound are on par for this style of game, and it is entertaining, but since this is a driving game, the driving mechanics should function properly, and I personally find they do not.\n\nFor that reason, I cannot recommend a driving game, if the driving is not that good.\n\nDon't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzTHVEBeHSM&index=65&list=PLGCO4EfbVB6XXoAnQMUJjoEh3c2BLfHx8", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198281484746", "last_played": 1484129096, "num_reviews": 46, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_forever": 111}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1488390584, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514635", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1488390584, "recommendationid": "30264306", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Lost its charm after about 20 minutes of playing.

Sure, your vehicles control like a nightmare.  And yeah, sometimes you may go flying randomly.  But it's all part of the charm of the game.  It's not game of the year or anything but I definitely feel the few dollars paid were worthwhile.  Though I do think adding multiplayer would take this game to a whole new level.
