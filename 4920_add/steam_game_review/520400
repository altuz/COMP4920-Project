I've played all the Forza's apart from 6 (felt weird and too gimmicky) and so on and this game's not for me or you if you're like me.\nThis game I feel is for the Trackmania crowd/type of gamers, it lacks in proper responce as far as the thumbstick goes and you can't (not without changing some settings at least) use the D-pad instead so I do think that the KBD is the best way to play and that you need to know how to use it properly to enjoy it.\nSo that's why I give it a thumbs down, not due to it being a bad game but due to being a game I didn't expect it to be and made for people who aren't like me so I do wish Steam had up/down/Not my kind of game...\nYeah, come to think of it, let's end on a positive note, it did run very well on my Phenom II 955/8 GB RAM/R9 285 box @ 1080p, I did put the graphics to the highest setting.

I couldn't play this with my controller. The controls for this . I should remap my buttons. The keyboard controls are also confusing. There is no gas button to go on a controller.
