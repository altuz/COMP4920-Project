VR opens up so many more possibilities for immersion and music. There are music driven games out there that can really pull you in, and VR has the capability of taking that and pushing it to the next level.\n\nThis game is okay. It's not the best, I wouldn't say it's next level material but I did get that hyped-up and happy feeling from playing a few of my favourite songs. Your surroundings are bright, colourful and it dances with your music. I found it fun to even stand and look around, let alone bust out some drum moves.\n\nI won't lie to you, I held back a bit seeing as I was banging  imaginary drums like a moron to no music in the family dining area. If I would have been alone I think I would of gone in on this a lot more enthusiastically and gotten my rave on. With that said though I still found this to be a very enjoyable game.\n\nWhen I booted up the game I was a little concerned that I would have to download some music for it to go from or be forced to use some lame sample music that music driven games tend to provide. The fun in these games for me comes from being able to put my own music tastes into the game. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can actually pick some music from the SoundCloud top 50 (so of course I had to get on that Despacito bandwagon).\n\nThe only thing I thought might make this game better was if hitting the drum actually did something. I mean, it does something, it determines your score and all. I just thought that it would feel a lot better if when you hit it, it actually made a sound. \nIf you loosely compare it to guitar hero, in guitar hero the music will play as long as you're playing it properly. Hitting the notes will continue to play the song and if you miss it you get that horrid noise that breaks the flow and makes you feel like the worst musician ever. Then when you actually hit the notes correctly you feel a lot more accomplished and it gets you more hyped up during the song. \n\nThat was my only fault on it, besides that I enjoyed it and would recommend it for someone that might just want a chill jam on the virtual reality drums.\n\n\nTL;DR : Not the best music driven game ever, it might not take advantage of the new possibilities VR provides, but it's still an all around sound game to jam out on.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035655574", "last_played": 1500059973, "num_reviews": 145, "num_games_owned": 1082, "playtime_forever": 50}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1500064909, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511101", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500064909, "recommendationid": "33544368", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So I was only going to play the game a few minutes to get a feel for the game.  I spent the next hour playing just random songs on Soundcloud.  I love that this game has several difficulties options so you can just enjoy your music or challenge yourself, it even has a \"jam\" option, where you can just play a normal drum machine to the music.\n\nYou can also play your own music.  Out of all the rhythm VR games, this is my new favorite.  It just lets you enjoy your music.  I hope that this game adds more options for stage visuals (there seems to only be one) and customizations for the sticks and scoring visuals (there's only a few).  It would really be cool if you could record yourself too, especially with the jam option.  I also don't think they have updated the multiplayer songs in a while.\n\nRate 9/10 (just needs some fixes and it would be 10/10)\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1506265095, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 140}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503635471, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503635471, "recommendationid": "34473500", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
