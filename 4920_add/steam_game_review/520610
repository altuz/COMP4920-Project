Playing as the Germans, you'll walk into the battle and roll over the early Soviet units, and then all of a sudden everything turns sour and the Soviets start pushing back. I play it because it's fun, but I don't see it as a historical game, which is a bad thing since this is literally called \"Drive on Moscow\" and based on a historical battle. Soviet cossack horsemen will beat your Panzers 8 out of 10 times, which probably isn't realistic. In my opinion, there's way too much RNG in the game, which makes sense if you're trying to make a balanced wargame, but this isn't supposed to be balanced. The Germans are supposed to steamroll the Russians and then only get beat once winter comes around. This RNG also means that halfway through the game, your units will be fighting constant battles over and over with the same group of Soviet units with no outcome, because there's always woods or buildings or something that absorb hits and at the end of the day, no one dies and no one moves. I play the game in school so I don't die of boredom. \n\nIn a nutshell, you will move your units twice, and then never move them again because they'll get themselves into an eternal stalemate. \n\nGood thing it's only ten dollars.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "steamid": "76561198144448112", "last_played": 1506435959, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 46}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505839435, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505839435, "recommendationid": "35068100", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
