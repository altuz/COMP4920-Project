A bit satirical, it is a blast and deals with some of the usual tropes. A guy goes out to do a good deed, returns to find his friends dead (at what might have been his own assassination), and decides to go off and find the culprits and bring them to justice. Along the way, he has to deal with own insecurities, and the possibility that his brother might be out there... waiting...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "last_played": 1501132772, "num_reviews": 362, "num_games_owned": 440, "playtime_forever": 91}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501133713, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501133713, "recommendationid": "33824808", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I seriously gave it a lot of thought if I should recommend the game or not as I like games by John Wizard. Unfortunately, I just can't get myself to enjoy this at all. This has nothing to do with the story line but rather the game play and concept of fights. If you like rpg maker games and a challenge, you should pick it up as it's not expensive at all. Now to why I can't enjoy it:\n\n- Monsters get stronger as well whenever you level up or get more party members.\n- No healing after level up.\n- Hard to outrun enemies which makes it nearly impossible to escape the battles.\n- Attack is mainly focused on one character because of the percentage.\n\nOverall, I have to use healing items a lot or I keep dying every second fight. I am a very casual player and want to relax while playing, not getting frustrated. I am not saying that it is a bad game though. It's just not the type of gameplay I enjoy in a rpg maker game. In my opinion it would be better if there was an easy mode that would give the player an edge over the enemies or let you at least heal whenever you level up.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198231262176", "last_played": 1505943224, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 164, "playtime_forever": 903}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504378424, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505086", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504957156, "recommendationid": "34692654", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
