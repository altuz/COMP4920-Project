So I'm down for anything that makes my PC run faster for 15$.  I installed it exactly as instructed, and rebooted.  Then i told it to boot into gaming made.  I got an 86% increase!!  I play alot of Warframe, and I was able to turn on all the special fancy effects, and turn all the qualities to medium with 8x aa and Med Filtering, and got 50-70 FPS!  i normally run on lowest with only 2 or 3 fancy options to get 50-70 FPS.  It was as if i actully upgraded my graphics card.  My PC is not a monster by no means.  I hand built my computer with only brand names i like.  My specs are Intel i3 G2030 Duel core-8 gigs Kingston Ram 1333- Nvidia gt 740- Asus mother P8H61-M LX.  Some of my parts were just lyeing around, and i bought some parts at a wholesale computer parts store.  This product works, and it works well!!! BTW to write this review i had to let the app run for 5 minutes, but it turns out all that steam actully runs is the installer.  So i had to run the installer for 5 minutes on the very first thing it said, then close out the installer, and write the review.  Hope this sheds some light on this product.
