Will update once English release is available.\n\nWhy oh why aren't there more Chinese historical dating sim games like this? Please make more!\n\nI originally wanted to wait for the English release but I'm too impatient and it gives me an excuse to practice my Chinese... lol and I have to say I really enjoyed it!\n\n- The voice acting: \nVoice acting is so on point... especially Zhikong. I'm in love with his voice. Like seriously I don't even care he's a weirdo and a little shit, I'd listen to him talk mantras all day. haha I wish the main character was also voice acted because I'm lazy and I want someone to read it for me. lol\n\n- The music: \nThe title song has been stuck in my head for the past few days!!! Ahhh~ It may be because I'm partial to traditional Chinese music but the use of traditional instruments in the bgm is just perfect for the setting. \n\n- The setting: \nSpeaking of the setting... I LOVE THE SETTING! Like I said I wish there were more games set in ancient China released in the West. I hope more developers think about releasing Chinese games in the West. The game goes a bit into some buddhism-inspired philosophy in some routes (hello they're all monks) which I find interesting. The religion depicted here is fictional (draws from inspiration from buddhist principles) but is not actual representation of real Buddhism. It's generally focused on the relationships and less on the religious doctines. I think most people should still be able to enjoy it even if you aren't religious or buddhist.\n///\nTo provide some context for those who may not be familiar: In order to become a monk, one must give up worldly desires including love/romance/carnal pleasures. To have attachment to earthly things/person is to be tethered to the mortal realm and thus preventing one from attaining nirvana. (Similar to real Buddhism) The temple and monks serve mostly as a backdrop for the story and this conflict of detachment vs. romance is one point of interest explored in the game.\n///\n\n- The story:\nI think the game delivered a good balance of humor, romance, and angst. Some routes definitely extroted more tears than others. I didn't feel the writing was contrived or cingey (which is a problem I have with most otoges). Typical of historical Chinese stories, this did a pretty good job at evoking a sense of nostalgia and beautiful melancholy... if you ever watched C dramas you know what I mean. \n\n- The love interests:\nFew brief descriptions on the male leads:\nZhikong: serene, aloof, obsessive, possessive, a living contradiction, dat voice dayyyum\nHuihai: a precious sweet cinnamon roll, basically perfect, so smart and yet so dumb\nZiqing: childhood friend, tsundere, infuriating and endearing, is a lil shit, actually pretty thoughtful\n\n- Main character:\nI liked that the MC is capable and intelligent and isn't a total pushover (unlike some other otoge where the MC is a weak potato and/or immature brat...). She can be silly, sassy, smart, self-depricating... you know, more like a real person and less like a paper doll. Why is it so hard for other writers to give the girls a fucking personality?\n\n- Value:\nI felt the game wasn't very long compared to some other titles and only has 3 routes but considering the price, it's definitely worth the buy! I liked it so much I wish the game was longer and/or had more routes. I think you get more than your money's worth even at full price.\n\nI'm looking forward to the English release. I may play through it again on the English version to get a comparison.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198076193616", "last_played": 1493194889, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 91, "playtime_forever": 858}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1493409746, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527913", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1494473105, "recommendationid": "31423919", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "nice game i need to learn more chiness :d", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198172821031", "last_played": 1502642353, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_forever": 102}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1495733822, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496131", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1495733822, "recommendationid": "31956247", "votes_funny": 5, "voted_up": true}]}
