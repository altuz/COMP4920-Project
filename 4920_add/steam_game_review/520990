It's an improvement in most ways, only major detractor are the daz models I suppose. The puzzles were fair but some of the item usage had me utterly bewildered. The flow felt stymied compared to the first, which struck me as odd since when I (inevitably) had to google how to use some items most seemed to comment that the first game was harder.\n\nThere's comments on bugs in the forum but they all seem cleared up at this point, I did not encounter a single problem in my playthrough. I applaud both the non-linearity of the game and the fact that it seems to play into the b-horror'esque nature of itself, but at times I feel like I should have brought a grater.

Mysterious atmosphere, soothing sounds, great and warm graphics (no 3D, so no motion sickness with this one, yes), nice music, relaxing gameplay (no rushing), the familiar voices (Lucy Reubens ....well no I mean the voice actress Emma Harry with her mesmerising beautiful voice).  The challenge to escape this mysterious environment, the folklore, legends, history, background, the characters, the exploration of abandoned surroundings, the investigation, ... I could go one.  Just everything in the game attracts me, like all their other games.  I just love \"the Shadow tor studios/darkling room team\" for all the work they've done till now.  This is a click and point adventure game with a soul!\n\nAnd an absolutly 'must have' for all the fans!\n\nI you like this kind of game, don't forget to check out their other games:  Darkfall series 1 to 3, Barrow hill: curse of the ancient circle, The lost crown (my favorite), the last crown midnight horror.\nAnd coming soon:  \"Bracken tor\" and \"the last crown\".\n\nMuch love to Wincey ;)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198022747793", "last_played": 1503160771, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 114, "playtime_forever": 505}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1501261557, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501261557, "recommendationid": "33860443", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
