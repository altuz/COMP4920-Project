Funny relaxing songs fitting the region you are trying to beat.\n-Gameplay: Everything is the same as in the geometry dash - you have levels to beat, you have hard to pick up special objects, you can customize your character if you grind enough coins (but why would you waste your time on this game on the 1st place?). Every level takes its place somewhere on the world map. That's all. \n-No steam achievements - no reason to waste your time here.\n+Steam cards - if you happen to get this game on sale you can cover the price with steam cards. Or you can simply buy this game anytime and refund it right away.\n\nDespite the low price, this game is a waste of time.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835548531", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198028673669", "last_played": 1483655903, "num_reviews": 320, "num_games_owned": 5466, "playtime_forever": 210}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1483656400, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522346", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1489189916, "recommendationid": "29046590", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very fun and addictive game was worth the \u00a32 could do with some more levels in the future but i reccomend it if you want a cheap addictive game", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198282220100", "last_played": 1474835100, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 33, "playtime_forever": 405}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1473608840, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "4.976792", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1473608840, "recommendationid": "25464899", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I love the game. I think its definitely worth the price thats put on it. It's original and its very fun. The thing I like most about the game is that there is only one checkpoint in the middle of each map and it only lets you retry once. Some of you in the future will probably say something about this being a bad game because it doesn't have checkpoints but if it didn't how would it be challenging? To sum it all up, its a fun challenging little game thats worth the money its put up for. Keep it updated developers! ;) Also a racing multiplayer game mode for all the maps would be fun as well.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961359124", "last_played": 1499053023, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 55, "playtime_forever": 2263}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1473289092, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499032", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1473289270, "recommendationid": "25403610", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
