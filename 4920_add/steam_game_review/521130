I used to play this game a lot on my phone/tablet like 4-5 years ago. I was expecting almost same game from this. But unfortunately, this is not that case. That android game was amazing, great animation, nice soundtrack, everything was smooth, options as well, and for phone game really amazing, one of my favourite. Easy to play, hard to master, especially more difficult levels. So, why is THIS game bad? Well, when you finish the level, you have to wait 2-3 seconds for animation to continue. Also, mechanics are pretty bad (like, really? in my android version - definitely not this developer - you had exact way how to complete level. I mean, every path between dots had only one solution. Why? Because it was clever. If you had smaller board, you had less colors. But when you started like 10x10, there were more colors. In THIS game, it is so broken and annoying, that you can connect all dots, and you still have some unused space on board. It would be better to have less levels, but every level would be top quality. In THIS game it is like, 1 good level, 2 bad levels, 1 good level, 2 bad levels.)\nAlso, animations are boring, not sure, if there is any soundtrack (if yes, then mediocre). There are like 6 different themes, which is good, but you need coins to unlock them. And after unlocking, you are disappointed, bcs they are mostly awful. But you earn coins by playing the game, so they are free.\nOh, and there's also tutorial. But really annoying, because instead of explaining the game mechanics, there's really annoying mouse cursor, which is showing you how to complete tutorial levels :/\nReally, i am trying to find something positive. Well, achievements and trading cards maybe?\nAs i said, quality > quantity. And this game is just not good, just too many levels, which are boring. Not worth 2\u20ac. Go to android store and download FREE and BETTER version of this game.

For the price I'm surprise at how many puzzles you get.  I'm use to maybe 50 to 100 for this price.  There are 480 regular puzzles and 30 tutorial rounds.  The games range from obvious to complex and the time increases with the size of the board and the complexity.  There's a windowed mode add you can choose which board size you want to play.  You don't have to start at the small and work your way up.  There are 60 levels for each board that you do have to work you way through to unlock the higher levels and an achievement at the completion of each board.  It's a good deal for the price and well worth it if you can snag it on sale.
