After playing 10 hours, I was able to unlock all of the research and essentially start building up money. End game?\n\nAs more content is added, this game definitely will be worth the buy. \n\nThings I would like to see added:\n\n1. More dynamics related to what items are offered and how people react to them (Expand on Needs tab)\n2. Layout dynamics - customers react to sizes of buildings and more parking lot reactions (IE - how far away customers have to walk\n3. Atmosphere development - have customers react on how they spend money based on the atmosphere. \n4. Staff development over-time is tiered in various areas. (Have events where staff quit, get stressed out, show up late etc so you to make the choice as to whether you fire staff. \n5. Research can include levels of quality on products as well.\n6. Introduce managers  - this can relate to number 4 as well. They could prompt you with time related situations where you choose whether a staff member can be forgiven for an action. (IE. Crisis management events - \"Flu Season\" tons of staff call in sick type of events)\n\nI am looking forward of course to see what the developers come up with - I hope these thoughts help!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198045204756", "last_played": 1505883139, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 194, "playtime_forever": 643}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505962873, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505962873, "recommendationid": "35096229", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "No update, look abandonned...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198012985926", "last_played": 1498516362, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 86, "playtime_forever": 448}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506898415, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506898415, "recommendationid": "35398612", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "biggest waste of $13.\nonly had the game open 30 minutes.\n25/30 of those minutes was probably me afk throwing up into the potty.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198152976267", "last_played": 1483490171, "num_reviews": 55, "num_games_owned": 69, "playtime_forever": 31}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506969697, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490724", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1506969697, "recommendationid": "35425934", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Amazing game and i have two screenshots with stores that have -666% and -69% :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "steamid": "76561198046158506", "last_played": 1506628581, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 1307}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504572461, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484946", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1504572461, "recommendationid": "34747031", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I have to say that I really enjoyed playing this game for the short amount of time I was able to play.
