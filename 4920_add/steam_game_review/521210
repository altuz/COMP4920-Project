This game takes less than an hour to complete. Therefore, I recommend that this be purchased only when on a 75% off sale. $7.99 is way too much for what this game actually is. \n\nWhile I didn't particularly enjoy the first Timore, I actually liked this one. It was really straight forward. You walk through a house and get jump scared. After all the crap I've been playing recently, something so basic was actually a very welcome change.\n\nA couple of my problems with this title are that you have to do a LOT of backtracking and that you are unable to run. Luckily, the backtracking isn't too bad because the house is pretty small. But it can still be a bit aggravating. \n\nI wish that the story had a bit more to it. I also wish that there was a story behind the creatures that torment you in the dream.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997678124", "last_played": 1502196357, "num_reviews": 89, "num_games_owned": 911, "playtime_forever": 48}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502196912, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502196912, "recommendationid": "34102815", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
