It is a brawler game where you set up your formation of different minion types (warrior = melee, hunter = ranged, shaman = healing) on the left side of the screen and fight the computer's minions on the right side of the screen.  There levels (individual battles) with every 10-15 levels a boss fight.  You win resources with each fight (food and wood), which you then use to recruit more minions, level said minions up, promote them to higher tiers of power, and buy them equipment to use (weapons and masks).  For a nice twist, once you beat a boss, you \"capture\" it and can now recruit it to fight on your side, being able to level it up and so on, as above.\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]: Gameplay is simplistic and casual, but not without depth.  Each level will have a best set of minions you can deploy to beat the scenario, and a number of levels have had me switching quite a bit of stuff around and scratching my head for other combinations to use.  During each battle, your minions stand there and automatically attack.  The primary interaction for you is that each minion has a special power with a cooldown.  You can see the minions' special attacks and cooldowns at the top of your battle screen.  To activate a power, once it's available, you will be shown a shape that you have to draw with your mouse on the screen.  It's not always easy to get them right, but the algorithm for detecting if you have drawn it correctly is quite forgiving.  They key to winning is pumping your special abilities out as quickly as you can.\n[h1]Progression[/h1]: The game does get quite grindy at times, as this genre of games is want to do.  You can go back and play previous levels for ~20% of the original reward, and I've found myself grinding a level over and over, getting those few extra resources to level up for a needed boost to fight that next level.  At times, the game feels very simple: I'd like to see some better level design: there's nothing wrong with easy levels, but there was a range of missions in the levels of teens to mid-20s when I won a level with a team and that same team, with no level up or change of equipment, just aced through 8-10 levels without me doing much of anything.\n[h1]Replayability[/h1]: None, really.  The levels are fixed, so once you've played them, that's it.  The inclusion of a level editor and Steam workshop access with a simple SDK would have pushed this to another level and I'd have gladly paid a few extra bucks for that.\n[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]: There's nothing that will tax even on-board graphics most likely, but the textures are nice, and it has native 4K support.  Even at 4K the textures are crisp.  Just don't expect anything stunning here.  Your minions are mostly static, with a few weapons flying back and forth across the screen.  Nothing bad though.\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]: It's a great game for some relaxation, and is very much (for me) in the casual gaming genre.  I think the price is very much spot-on for value.  The game plays very much like a mobile game, and has the same feel.  My rating is 3.5 stars out of 5: the game is a solid 3 that occasionally reaches a bit more, but fails to hit any high notes.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019974064", "last_played": 1485513971, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 1006, "playtime_forever": 216}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485507352, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485507352, "recommendationid": "29517234", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "it's a very good game, and can be very tough at times.
