Not over the top like \"Fruit of Grisaia,\" but comprehensive and really easy to understand.\n\n[u]The Characters[/u] 9/10\nFor the most part I found the cast rather enjoyable as they are consistent with the bio given on the store page/ kickstarter. What really got me to like them was the chemistry between the characters. The dialogue felt natural and not at all forced. The mannerisms and habits of talking felt in character and rarely strayed out of it.\n\n[u]The Story[/u] 10/10\nAs I stated before I have yet fully watch the story unfold as it is being released in sections, but from I could gather it does a good amount of build up. Keeping the suspension of belief as to how the characters act to upcoming developments. It doesn't feel like they were necessarily \"railroaded\" into the plot and came for their own will or due to their personalities.\n\n[u]The Artwork[/u] 8/10\nWhoever the artists were did a fine damn job. The backgrounds are easy on the eyes. The character sprites are crisp and clean; with the nice facial expressions turning the potentially bland girls into waifu material. My only misgivings was when it depicted a certain someone with the intention of being somewhat scary. I doubt I will get any sleep with that on my mind >.> Mythology is some scary stuff for sure.\n\nMy own misgivings: I have yet to see too much in the way of romance. But this section is a good segway into the upcoming arcs.\n\ntl;dr: Anon can't set this review in stone since it's not all done yet. It has good writing, suspension of belief and doesn't feel forced. Waifu material is present due to good qualities listed above and good artwork.\n\nNote: I played this as soon as it was released.
