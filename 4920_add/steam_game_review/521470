The characters were not too cliche (despite, of course, still maintaining their specific trope traits) and they interacted in fun and engaging scenes. I was pleased that the Protagonist wasn't annoying or bland as most protagonists in otoge tend to be and I definitely recommend this to those who enjoy otoge!
