I thought it was going to be a lot more slice-of-life, but it ended up being a fantasy-themed romance VN with a lot of depth. The common route kind of \"tricks\" the player into thinking it is a lot more lighthearted, but once the character path develops, heavier topics are discussed/shown. Oddly enough, this is a ebi-hime game, and it is fairly different from their other work. Regardless, I highly recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067189801", "last_played": 1499373722, "num_reviews": 91, "num_games_owned": 248, "playtime_forever": 2293}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1499377443, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522899", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1499377443, "recommendationid": "33325343", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
