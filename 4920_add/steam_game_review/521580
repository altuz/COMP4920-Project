Meaning you have to have friends with you, in person, to play it with others. By yourself, this game is pretty boring. With friends however it's not too bad. It's got a different look to it than most board games and the premis is nice. Enemies and events are varied enough so it doesnt get predictable. Something i'd have liked though is more characters and/or boards. Also, playing for long periods of time will end up boring some but I'd suggest this to anyone who likes a good board game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198050031998", "last_played": 1499175179, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 195, "playtime_forever": 73}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1498849666, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506325", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498849666, "recommendationid": "33051610", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "What seemed like a fun tabletop rpg turned out to be quite boring. The idea was good but...\n\n[b]Lack of multiplayer[/b]\nPerhaps I didn't understand this right, but when I read \"co-op + local co-op\" I assumed I could at least play with people who live nearby. I'd select 'human' at the beginning of a match and the game would automatically scan for other players who want to play with humans. But that's not what happens; selecting human just means you get another character to play with. So this co-op feature works only if you have a friend over at your place and want to share the mouse to play. This is completely useless for someone like me, who lives alone. lol\n\n[b]Repetitive[/b]\nI played 3 games and I was done! The hard map feels excessively long and the easy one should be a tutorial/quickplay. It would be interesting to see new maps available either through an update or innexpensive dlc. Maybe have a feature where players can build and share their own boards?\n\n\nSadly, those are major turn offs for me, so I've requested a refund for my copy of the game.\nMy friend also requested; since we can't play together.\n\nI currently don't recommend this game unless you just want a quick steam trading card. As previously mentioned, the idea was good, so I may be tempted to try it again if there are updates + real multiplayer added.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198128658183", "last_played": 1492835724, "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 108, "playtime_forever": 69}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1492876465, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503055", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1492876561, "recommendationid": "31299846", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
