There are two different campaigns to play through, each with story missions, bonus missions, and training missions to choose from.  The story missions are fully voiced with a lot of flavor in the banter between the different characters.  Even the tutorial (which is completely optional and can be skipped entirely) is fully voiced and sets up the characters nicely.\n\nThe game offers three difficulty modes so it can appeal to veterans of the genre and newbies alike.  I don't play many tactical turn-based games, so it's nice to see that I can ease into the game on easy mode while veterans can dive right in without having to wade through loads of too-simplistic missions from the get-go.  The game does not have a manual save function, however, so any mistakes I make in a campaign I have to live with, without the safety net of a redo.\n\nThe story missions drive the campaigns forward, but players can choose up to two bonus or training missions inbetween each story mission to gain additional experience or resources.  Training missions do not award any resources, but they will not have any lasting negative effects (like loss of ships) should they turn out poorly, and are useful for gaining experience.\n\nThere are plenty of ship types for players to choose for their fleet: some with high firepower, some with scouting abilities and little firepower, etc.  Selecting the appropriate ship types to purchase and deploy is vital to the success of the missions.  There is also equipment to add onto ships for further customization and better tactics.\n\nThe meat of the gameplay is pretty standard for a space map, turn-based strategy game with a few exceptions.  Instead of the player taking a turn with all of his ships in whatever order he chooses and then the computer AI taking a turn with all of its ships, each individual ship gets its own turn in a randomized line-up each phase.  The player can only act with the currently active ship, and the active ship rotation is different every turn.  This adds an extra level of strategy required because the optimal turn line-up of a player's fleet probably isn't going to be an option.  Also, space terrain (asteroids and the like) play an important roll in the strategy as positioning a ship near an asteroid for cover can be a key tactic in defeating an enemy fleet or become a hazard which can destroy a ship unit.\n\nAll in all, this is a nice solid entry in the tactical turn-based genre.  There are plenty of choices for players to customize different strategies with.  The game is well polished with detailed graphics and great voice work.  And yet there are some key differences with other titles in the genre giving this game a unique feel all of its own to gameplay.  It's more of the same great turn-based tactics, without just being more of the same.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1305, "steamid": "76561198122163777", "last_played": 1506383613, "num_reviews": 46, "num_games_owned": 1530, "playtime_forever": 1305}, "votes_up": 43, "timestamp_created": 1506058898, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557885", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506142238, "recommendationid": "35121014", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "What an unexpected pleasant surprise this turned out to be.  \n\nSolid hex based tactical combat, polished graphics, and almost the entire game is voiced as well.

Good turn-based tactical games are not overly abundant to start with, so I decided to bite the bullet and buy on a whim. Something I rarely do, but boy am I glad to have done so.\n\nThe game is all about the tactical missions. There are two main campaigns, which apparnetly can take around 100 hours to play through. No multiplayer or skirmish mode.\n\nMissions bring you varying quantity of one of the three main resources (\"material,\" \"fuel,\" and \"research\"). The first allows is used to buy new ships or components and repair battle damage. Aside from being required as well to purchase new ships, the second resource is an all-important balancing mechanism. Since each ship class (and modifier components) alter the cost of deployment for each mission. Take too many expensive ships too often on missions, and you will run out... which will probably end your playthrough. The last allows investing in upgrades to each ship class, or to research new and more efficient modifier components.\n\nThere are five ship types to start with for both campaigns, with more unlocked as the game progresses. All the ships, for both factions, have their unique niches and abilities. While in general \"bigger is better,\" if only from survivability point of view, the deployment costs favor using lighter ships if you are comfortable in their handling and performace. There is certainly plenty to pick from, as you will likely end up being able to afford much heavier force than what can be reasonably supplied with \"fuel.\"\n\nThe ships themselves can be further modified by equipping additional components, though I have yet to find use for anything other than shield upgrades. The drawbacks to other equipment types seem counterproductive to my style of playing.\n\nThe missions are varied and randomized enough not to be overly repetitive, although there does not feel to be too many types of side missions. Luckily, all the campaign main missions are hand-crafted as to avoid tedium. I do have to agree with something another player pointed out - the side missions actually do detract from the pacing of the campaign. On the other hand, you will need the resources they bring... as long as you can afford the deployment costs.\n\nIn the end, it's all about the combat. Ships move in a semi-randomized order based on their Initiative. Unfortunately, as of my writing this review, there is no option to delay the use of a specific ship. It is a minor thing, but something that would have come in handy a few times.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid and entertaining. The small scale engagements mean each mission does not take too long to complete, which makes for a handly downtime title for work days evenings.\n\nThe graphics are crisp and readable, the sound is GREAT (excellent VO artists, and a kickass soundtrack along with plenty of satisfying combat sounds), and the gameplay engaging, with sufficient difficulty curve on Veteran to make things challenging.\n\nDefinitely recommended for anybody with a tactical space itch to scratch.\n\n[strike]Edit: Something that apparently should be mentioned - the game uses \"Ironman\" save style to ensure ship losses are permanent. At least on higher difficulties. If that's not your thing... well, I'd still give it a go. There's always \"Easy\" difficulty where you lose no ships :)[/strike]Edit 10.01.17- The most recent patch introduced manual save option, so the above no longer applies.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 3112, "steamid": "76561198079797439", "last_played": 1506915835, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 272, "playtime_forever": 3112}, "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_created": 1506214667, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527878", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506877968, "recommendationid": "35167501", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Initial thoughts after a couple hours:\n\nAncient Frontier is a strategy/tactical turn based sci-fi game with some RPG elements (ability to improve your ships over time).

What you can't tell from the store page is how slickly done it all is, especially for a game from a very small company, or that it's fairly addicting and has some nice replay value.\n\nThings that stand out to me as positive:\n -Fleet development. Building up my fleet, losing ships permanently (think X-COM in space), researching the upgrades I want for the ships I like to use most - this means I get to play my way, and that every decision (e.g., whether to go on one more optional mission) has meaningful risk to it. I tend to fall into \"just one more mission\" mode, which is a good feeling.\n\n-Graphics/sound/music. The game looks and sounds very good, closer to a game from a more established developer. It runs well on multiple machines (one pretty new, one six years old and getting a bit ragged) for me.\n\n-Story. This may surprise you if you read a few reviews mentioning cheesy dialogue and voice acting. Yes, it's true - the early missions are lightweight, focusing on slightly saccharine relationships between a few characters. Ignore that. Blow past it. Once the real shooting starts, the story gets much richer, the enemies get more fun, and there's far more at stake.\n\nThings that stand out less positive:\n\n-FIXED by patch, 9/27.\n\n-It's possible on certain escort/protect the civilians missions to lose on turn 1 before you can do much to save them. This is mostly a matter of bad luck, and it should be infrequent, but is a little annoying when it happens. Edit: Should happen less due to patch, 9/27.\n\nOther notes: \n\n- The two campaigns really play differently from the start. Strikingly so. Tactics that work with the Alliance don't work with the Federation, and vice versa.\n\n- Small balance and quality of life changes and patching seems to be happening quickly right now (less than a week since release). Obviously that can't continue indefinitely, but it's nice to see things that needed a quick fix get it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1175, "steamid": "76561198023006259", "last_played": 1506640636, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 129, "playtime_forever": 1175}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1506309150, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512162", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506523332, "recommendationid": "35195376", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's.... okay...\n\nAt it's core you have a hex based turn based space combat game and that isn't too bad. Your different types of ships handle differently. Some fighter class ships for example get given three move actions during their turn, allowing them to race in, shoot with admittedly small guns, and then use the last move actions to run away again. Bigger ships may have only one move action, meaning that once they move during their turn they are committed.\n\nNice enough game mechanic and once you get your head around it you can develop some very effective tactics around this.\n\nThe battles are linked by a perma death campaign system which I believe defaults to Iron Man. If you want to scum save go play Life is Strange. You play your battles, collect the three base currenties of 'material' (for repairing and building ships), 'fuel' (which allows you to send your ships out on missions) and 'Data' (which you spend to unlock the tech tree). Your ships also slowly level up. This gives each ships a minor boast to their stats each level but there is not individual skill tree.\n\nSo all that is relatively straight forward and the big love/hate thing is the storyline missions. There are two campaigns where you follow either the 'Empire' or the 'Rebels'. Each side gets different ships to select and has different characters to follow, each of which is voice acted.\n\nSo... the voice acting and the plot... Yeah... It is either deliberately ironically cheesey to play up to the tropes, or it is just cheesy bad. There may originally have been an intention to animate the characters in proper cut scenes but instead with get portraits with dialogue boxes, broken up with what seems to be the original direction notes from the shooting script. If you like playing visual novels/dating simulators you might enjoy it more but having pages of dull dialogue broken up with [he turned and closed the door behind him] directions every single time you start a story mission can get grating.\n\nAs for the actual story? Dunno. Something is happening which the story is building up to but the pace is pretty slow. Normally between each story mission you get the option to do 'bounty missions' to gain loot and skill up your crews, but this is capped at three missions before you have to get back to the plot. The problem is you do a plot mission which hints that 'Mysterious Plot Things' are happening, you finish the mission and bang, straight back to the 'bounty missions' screen with no story based cut scene to tease and tempt you as to what actually just happened. In some ways the story is not as much unfolding as suddenly waving itself in your face just when you start to get settled into some good old space ships thumping. I am not sure if as the story progresses you are given more freedom to plan your stragetic moves but the first five or so story missions are strictly scripted and linear.\n\nThe other problem is you are given a 'hero' ship which nominally contains your 'main character'. This hero doesn't go on the 'bounty missions' which means he levels up a lot slower and also when he does turn up you have no real emotional attachment to him.\n\nSo... it's not a great game. It's not bad enough for me to give it a thumbs down but I can see myself forgetting I even have this installed within a couple of days and never going back to it.\n\nSo yeah, it's 'okay'.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 536, "steamid": "76561198017975705", "last_played": 1506177123, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 91, "playtime_forever": 536}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1506085278, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509211", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506085278, "recommendationid": "35127255", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "great game. unlike many games that encurage save scumming, i have the feeling that my decissions realy matter, and the deployment costs make me think about how many forces is should bring to a battle instead of just crushing everything with total overkill. the two campains are quite long, so it has plenty of content. \nthe difficulty i think is spot on, tho the save system can be quite unforgiving, you can afford to make a few mistakes.\ndefinitively worth the price if you like space ships and hex strategy games.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 500, "steamid": "76561198030051819", "last_played": 1506596257, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_forever": 500}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1506515588, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507953", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506515588, "recommendationid": "35240766", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This turned out to be a nice surprise.

Your forces are persistent (you keep and grow your army mission to mission) and there's a bit of a meta game with the resources. The research tree isn't deep but it's very broad with trees for each ship type.\n\nThe game is not necessarily hard in individual missions but the challenge comes from shepherding your forces throughout the full campaign (Panzer General kept popping into my head).\n\nOn the bad side the writing and acting range from bad to ok. It's not a fast game, missions can take a little while and there's a leisurly vibe to most as you clear out a small section at a time (xcom style so as not to wake other groups of enemies).\n\nIf you like traditional turn based combat on hexes you will enjoy this.

You can tell the the developer has put a lot of work into the title and it's quality shines through. I enjoyed being able to zoom in and out and pan around the world with fluidity throughout, giving you a different perspective of the map with each pan. I'm looking forward to  playing this game more in the coming days and, with extra side missions and simulations, I would think it will keep me entertained for many months to come.

Still, that style of turn based play is easy to engage. You start out with decent enough ships to progress but getting the big boys later on make a huge difference. The AI is a pretty good opponent though at times, they seem to have the advantage of making shots you can't make and most certainly seem have better weapons in both range and punch. However, good probing strategies with ambushing withdrawl tactics works well in this game. \n\nIt pays well to level your ships with the side missions to either level up at no damage cost regardless of what happens in game which is a nice feature. Gearing up your ships is limited to 2 slots of add ons and so far that never changes, what does change amongst the classes is the weapons that the are base outfitted with. There's some customization, but with two slots you quickly find only one or two groups of two items that fits your playing style and stick with it, so the rest is just stuff you won't use. \n\nThe mines on the playing field are challening and offer a great defensive concern and an offensive one since torpedoes in the game can be launched to clear them and anything dumb enough to get close to them. There's not much different in each of the missions that you play, the game play can get pretty boring if you are not a tactical TBS  nut. It's a small studio game and it really shows. No fancy graphics, good modeling of the ships and animations of battle, but the rest is pretty slim. \n\nI have a love hate relationship with the hard written storyline - I don't like the character we are playing in the game and you get no personal data control - except to rename your ships. That's it. The supposed love interest between officers that \"chat\" with you much like an adventure story is a bit too contrived and overtly smug. Sadly though, that's the only thing that adds change to the game once you can build the big ships.  The depth of the game is about ankle deep. \n\nIt's a fun little turn based strategy and true, there is a real void in the space game genre for a game like this - I just wish that deeper pocket big company would have taken on something like this though these two guys did okay for what is a very limited budget.  I bought it, I played it, I might mess with it if they upgrade depth or dcs it. If you can afford to toss the coin it's worth a gander if your like me and have 100+ titles in your libraries. If you have to be picky about laying down coin, you might might not want to jump in just yet - unless like these authors, you really want any kind of entry into this turn on space play.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1794, "steamid": "76561197993344431", "last_played": 1506927215, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 120, "playtime_forever": 1794}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506812777, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506812777, "recommendationid": "35357074", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great game on v1.01 but latest patch has introduced a few little bugs.
