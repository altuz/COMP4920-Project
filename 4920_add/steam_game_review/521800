Great to finally see them on Steam.\n\nThere are literally hundreds of WW2 video games. So why should you care about another one? Well Command Ops 2 does what no other game does - puts you in the shoes of a real commander in highly detailed scenarios set in different theatres of the war. From the German invasion of Greece, to North Africa, Malta, Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge and on to the Westwall.\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n[list]\n\n[*]Unlike traditional wargames (and Civ 6), this game gets rid of hexes and turns and models everything in pausable real time on an open map, making the gameplay more dynamic.\n\n[*]The AI. If you're sick of dumb units who couldn't pathfind themselves down the Yellow Brick Road, this game has no such issues. You can order units to take the quickest route or safest route to a goal. They will probe, attack, fall back, bunker down, rout, regroup and defend as the battles ebb and flow. The game also models pretty much everything about each company, from morale and cohesion down to the number of bullets they have for each gun. The upshot of this detail is it gives your units a personality in how they behave. Weaker units (or poorly thought out attacks) will fail. Stronger units and organised planning will result in the enemy going away with a bloody nose or worse; \n\n[*]Although you can micromanage every unit, Command Ops uses automation to let you delegate tasks to subordinate brigade and company commanders who will attempt to carry out your plans (and do a reasonable job). A neat twist to this is the game also models the delay that would occur for your orders to travel from HQ down to the front line. So the game rewards careful planning and anticipation of events, rather than twitch based responses to new threats. In other words, it is a strategy game with real strategy.[/list]\n\n[b]The Not So Good.[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]Yes, this is a wargame. That means your units are just small squares with numbers on them. Two dimensional wargames are a definite niche that most people (justifiably) pass over. The graphics are functional, but dated. Same with the game sounds.\n\n[*]The game makes few concessions for newcomers to the genre. There is one tutorial mission (which is in the demo), but after that, you're left with a series of complicated scenarios and a 200 page manual. There is no grand campaign that gradually introduces you to units and strategies. You're sent straight into battle where you're expected to know the difference between a Sherman Tank and a Panzer Mk IV. [/list]\n\nSumming Up: Funnily enough, the game that Command Ops most reminds me of is Dark Souls. They're both games that focus on providing a certain 'old school' type of gameplay and unapologetically ask the player to make an investment to discover the solid gameplay mechanics at their core. That's an investment that has repaid me many times over.\n\n5 Stars.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197977157702", "last_played": 1499170154, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 468, "playtime_forever": 64}, "votes_up": 39, "timestamp_created": 1487241079, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553696", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1487241079, "recommendationid": "29959292", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A real treat for all the armchair generals amongst us. A great WW2 strategy game on an operational level. \n\nThe cool thing about Command Ops 2 is its command structure. Every unit you get is part of a hierarchy, ruled by HQ's. Let's say you want to capture a small town. You can just detach one of your brigades from your division HQ and order them to attack the town from a certain flank. The brigade with all its companies will deploy itself and move out in a coordinated fashion.\n\nIf you have bigger objectives you can coordinate with multiple brigades. The AI (both friendly and enemy) does a good job of actually reading each situation and reacting to it. Don't like what your subordonates are doing, intervene and give them new orders. It is also possible to micromanage and give orders to each of your companies individually. This is only ever useful in smaller scenarios or some specific situations like deploying fire support units or using recce units.\n\nDaunting at first, but really enjoyable if you persevere. Also, this is a hardcore military sim and will definitely NOT be for everyone. And finally: Command Ops 2 is only a shell with three scenarios (including the tutorial).

I haven't played it until now for various reasons the main ones being: 1) price, 2) I like lots of games and it just kept not being at the top when I made a purchase and 3) it is so ridicolously grognard I was scared of it!\n\nNow that I am finally played it I confirm its fantastic!  I also confirm that it is ridiculously deep as a game.  As far as game play goes its not nearly as difficult to get into as I percieved.  However watching the intro video at panther games or at least some of the lets plays that are starting to be produced is a must to get any idea of how to play.  Then unless you want to be frustrated to the point of rage quit keep the manual handy to refer to.  After all this is not an arcade game.\n\nWith those caveats and a little effort I can see this 'game' (or more accurately a game like military command sim) will reward manyfold.  Despite the abstraction of the unit icons and this stripped back graphics this game is very immersive giving a very real feeling of how command may really have worked in WW2 combat and the impact down to company level.\n\nPS I really like the maps and unit graphics....perfectly suited for operational planning and command!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "steamid": "76561198074738628", "last_played": 1505907232, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 91, "playtime_forever": 2265}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1487401220, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500496", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487401220, "recommendationid": "30001772", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a great wargame.

Of course, if you want to issue orders to every unit you can, but where this system shines is in its ability to translate your general orders (attack/move/defend/probe etc) into meaningful actions on the ground.\n\nIt doesn't always get it right, or rather, it will sometimes put a plan into effect that has you scratching your head and wondering why it had chosen to carry out your orders in such and such a way, but that's part of the fun as well - reacting to your subordinate commanders' decisions and re-planning gives an idea of the sorts of challenges senior commanders faced in the field all the time.\n\nI had some trouble initially getting the game to run, but Dave and his team at Panther Games went above and beyond to get it fixed, so a big thanks to all the guys at Panther Games for their excellent customer service.\n\nAs far as the actual game goes, I've got a couple of bits of DLC downloaded for later play, but at the moment I'm focusing on the St Vith scenario and re-acquainting myself with the game engine - trying out variants, getting used the streamlined interface and the like.

It's by far one of the best WWII operational wargames I've come across. The graphics are spartan - essentially you see a map similar to the ones a commander like Patton or Rommel would have seen in his field headquarters, and use it to issue commands to your subordinates. Depending on their situation, supply, morale and fatigue, and the inevitable orders delay, your plan will either play out or you'll be forced to adapt as contact with the enemy leads to more accurate intelligence, and the fearsome A.I controlling both the opposition and your own commanders kicks in. \n\nThe research, map accuracy and orders of battle (down to detailed T&E listings for each unit) are staggering and although the scenario packs may seem a little pricy compared to other games you'll get a nail-biting experience in accurate simulation second to none.

I also highly recommend the developer's introductory video tutorials (for an earlier version of the game but still an invaluable guide to the system and packed with useful tactical tips).
