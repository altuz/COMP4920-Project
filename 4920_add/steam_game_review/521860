Based primarily on this, I'd recommend picking this up. It's nice to see this stuff  work how it's supposed to.\n\nThis is not a full game. It's a single level of a game with almost no replay value.  It only took me 23 minutes to see everything this has to offer and I was taking my time. \n\nThat said... this is hopefully going to support a future vr developer. Use the game as neat little demo for when you're showing vr off.\n\n** Game Stuff **\n\nThe game has you teleporting down streets of a city. This part of the game looks pretty good at least. The overall atmosphere is decent. It's kind of like House of the Dead if instead of being on rails, you are teleporting down the street. \n\nActually, it's suspiciously like house of the dead....\n\nThe bats that swarm you and the special effects when you shoot zombies are darn near identical.
