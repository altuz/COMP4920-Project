Here you can create anything simple like probably a child would and also that's a good opportunity to learn about the tiles, since this one is very hard to understand, at least for me.\n\nTo tell the truth this program was my first RPG Maker that i ever touch, but the same time this is very old and it's not recommended buy if you already know how to do the things in the program. Since RPG Maker VX was released almost 1 year before VX Ace came out, yeah it's expected to not find almost any scrpit out there, almost none, so be aware of that.\n\nBut yeah, like i said before, this software is very good when while you're learning how to use the program properly... But here some things that you can do and can't do:\n\n[h1]You can't do: [/h1]\n\n- Modify Tiles (I mean you can put some extra tiles, but they will just replace the existing ones)\n- Change Resolution (For especific reasons the program just accept 640x480, if you're searching for Full HD just go and buy RPG Maker MV already - Also available on Steam :] )\n\n[h1]You can do: [/h1]\n\n- Basically everything you can do on RPG Maker VX Ace, but that one of course is more complete than this one...\n\nP.S.: I was testing some scrpits here and for some reasons sometimes works and sometimes doesn't and i dunno the reason, probably is because the memory itself is very limited, but again, if you want to do something very complex, go on and buy VX Ace, since it's based in the same language programming.\n\n[b]Just buy this if you're new or have old projects to access like i have, if you aren't included in these 2 situations i don't recommend to take a look...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066951681", "last_played": 1504328622, "num_reviews": 44, "num_games_owned": 377, "playtime_forever": 3832}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1497836208, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484906", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1497836208, "recommendationid": "32554566", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
