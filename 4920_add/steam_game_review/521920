At least I think that's what's going on.\n\nIf you've ever played any kind of bat & ball game before then this will be immediately familiar to you, with the possible exception of the playing field taking place within actual habitable environments rather than a mere screen full of blocks. This adds a lot of personality to the game, along with the creatures and obstacles that threaten your progress, and this is what I think really helps set it apart from other, similar games. Various forms of enemies will try to move down the screen towards your character and must either be avoided or eliminated with the ball, though there are a small number of power-ups you can collect to make things easier, like being able to make the bat wider or spiked or sticky, or having a flame ball or a ghost ball or multiball. It also helps that you can speed up or slow down the movement of the bat at will, and that you only need to knock the ball through the exit of each stage rather than clear away all blocks.\n\nIf I'm being honest, there isn't a massive amount more to the game than this. There's a nice variety of different enemies and locations; one moment you could be confronted by panicked burning victims in a furnace area, the next you could be in an arena battling warriors or in the sewers being grossed out by poo monsters - and I especially appreciate having boss battles in a Breakout style game. But aside from these, there isn't anything that's necessarily going to blow you away or keep you glued to the game for too long once you've maybe explored some of the multiple paths and endings or gotten all the achievements.\n\nTo its credit, though, the game does seem as though it might possibly be something of a work in progress at the moment since new content has been gradually added over the past few months for free, with signs pointing to more coming in future (like a more robust level creation system as well as the ability to upload your own stages and play other people's as well). In the meantime, this is a fun little time-waster that's presented and plays well while offering its own interesting twist to keep you busy enough for a few hours.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198093220384", "last_played": 1501058504, "num_reviews": 114, "num_games_owned": 1284, "playtime_forever": 500}, "votes_up": 19, "timestamp_created": 1501060883, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548887", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501060883, "recommendationid": "33804724", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's a good gag gift. The gameplay is good but everything else is bad in my opinion.\n\nThe writing is dreadful... nit sure if it's tranlated but you'll read stuff like \"Har ! Har ! Y - Your so stupid Har ! G - Giant\"\n\nThe graphics are also terrible, but at the price I guess that's a given. Still, doesn't excuse it.\n\nThe gameplay itself is alright...\n\nFor a Breakout clone, it's unique because it's set in a horror universe. Lots of cool power ups but seems like the game was written to appeal to the kids with raging hormones.\n\nCool tower system reminiscent of games like Mortal Kombat. You move upward as you progress. Not bad.\n\nI can't recommend it... not even for $0.99 Sorry. If there is one thing I can't stand, it's badly written dialogue.\n\nWill I play it again? Maybe.

Other reviews are used to help stress my point across but are changed in such a way to make the review in my own wording [/h1]\n\nDeath's Hangover is a game developed and published by Retro Army Limited, the game is a sort of arkanoid style ball 'n' bat game with some unique mechanics\n\nThe game mechanics offers lots of innovation to the genre and is both exhilirating and annoying in terms of sometimes you don't intend the ball to fall through and making you start all over again. You have to really pay attention when playing\n\nAs to other Retro Army games, this game is fully of comedy, jokes and goofs that are really funny and well played and plays well with it's nice retro art style and making the overall game fun yet challenging to play\n\nSome of the sound effects and the soundtrack is a bit shallow but nothing to complain about and I have little to no complaints about Death's Hangover\n\nIt is a little gem of an indie game. If you want a fun, innovative ball 'n' bat game with a retro look, Death's Hangover is the game for you and especially during sales, this game is a steal!\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]", "received_for_free": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198062813911", "last_played": 1502736924, "num_reviews": 543, "num_games_owned": 540, "playtime_forever": 313}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502737743, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502737743, "recommendationid": "34241589", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "nice little arkanoid clone with a theme \n\n+ decent gameplay\n+ cute graphics\n+ fitting sound effects\n+ multiple paths\n+ create your own levels\n\n- bad dialog fillers", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025195712", "last_played": 1500437803, "num_reviews": 89, "num_games_owned": 799, "playtime_forever": 291}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499666226, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501789", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1499666527, "recommendationid": "33423188", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Isn't an agnostic just an atheist without balls?", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198008303595", "last_played": 1490961465, "num_reviews": 405, "num_games_owned": 623, "playtime_forever": 244}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499711809, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484251", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1499743891, "recommendationid": "33437685", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
