It's a wolfenstein-esque style engine with less colors.  However, some more attention could've been given to the way certain sprites billboard and how they scale in the distance to prevent it from becoming an unreadable mess. Unfortunetly, the controls are even worse, and not suited to the fast paced gameplay it demands.  There's a difference between old school, and poorly designed. Wolfenstein controls much better. The music is good, however if you want to lower it's volumn, you do that by lowering the 'graphics' slider and not the 'music' slider. Just another example of some of the poor quality on display here. The music and interesting style don't make up for this game's faults.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197982293787", "last_played": 1502505774, "num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 1063, "playtime_forever": 19}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1502506291, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502506291, "recommendationid": "34181965", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "this game is awesome! it's like the love child of tron, the matrix, and above all wolfenstein 3d. the grafics arent the most suffistocated and i wouldn't recamend it for a long playthrough, but a few laborynth passages at a time, deffinately.\n\ni would, HOWEVER, recamend that you draw a map. the level design is quite laborynthine, and there are only so many different types of ctr punk blue textures you can look at before they sort of start to blur together. more colors get thrown in as the game continues", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198144159089", "last_played": 1502429675, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 192, "playtime_forever": 59}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502000971, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1502000971, "recommendationid": "34053831", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
