I hate repeating myself, but this game is following a similar pattern with his other titles, it's the best one so far but unlike Nomad's other titles, this one is actually not all that bad.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nGameplay in Autumn Dream is virtually the same as GDNomad's other titles. The game plays primarily as a horror game along with some puzzles added in different sections, even if they're pretty unnecessary, they're still rammed into sections of the game.\n\nLet's talk about the horror segments, the horror has actually improved drastically from Nomad's previous titles and I'll say that out of all of Nomad's games so far, this is the one that does it the best. There were 3 really good scares throughout the game and in the second half of the game, there was actually a good feel of uneasiness and had me tense up at times. Do all the scares have a good impact, no. Nomad once again relies upon jumpscares primarily to deliver the experience, despite maybe 70% of these jump scares not being effective, I'll give him props on actually developing a pretty scary environment. Hell, the ambiance throughout the game is actually really good, when you start the game up, you're met with a calm peaceful environment in front of a house and within ten minutes, most of that nice calm and scenic fell devolves into this hell hole of a clinic full of horror. Now usually, if this sort of thing were in your typical horror game, I would say that this wouldn't really be good enough to carry the game, however in Autumn Dream's case, taking the length of the game into consideration, the horror actually is good enough to carry out through the whole experience, which is a nice change from Nomad's other titles.\n\nI wish I could say the same for the puzzles though. Like the horror, the puzzles are better than the previous games by Nomad, however, unlike the horror, the quality of the puzzles haven't changed as drastically. Out of the 4 titles I've played from Nomad, 2 of them had this puzzle system implemented, but the puzzles were designed in a manner of which you had no clue what it is you were doing and the game gave you little to no help regarding what it was you were actually meant to do. 1 of the games scrapped puzzles entirely and tried to focus primarily on the horror, but it still didn't work out too well. In Autumn Dream's case, the puzzles are back and they're the typical Nomad puzzle of wiring electrical circuits together, trying to get the right ones connected to each other. Now to this game's credit it actually semi-explains what it is you're meant to do with regards to these puzzles. In previous areas of the game, there are notes to pick up which gives you the answers to the puzzle, but since there is no inventory system in the game, you can't go back and view these notes, you get 1 view of the answer and that's it. Even when these notes are in, the puzzles just feel more pointless. Making notes to explain the puzzle is fine, but if you're just literally going to write the answer out on a piece of paper then there isn't exactly any challenge there as people can literally just take photos of their screen (like I did) and just pass through these with ease.\n\nSo despite the horror being pretty damned good in the game, the puzzles continue to be bad and feel useless throughout the experience.\n\nAnd additionally, since this is a game by GDNomad, there are still spelling errors and grammatical mistakes throughout the game with the notes, text, introduction etc. however I will say this, the game still successfully gets across what the basic idea is, so unlike Nomad's other games, the spelling/grammar is still bad, but it isn't in the territories of the other games where at times it was illegible. It still isn't good to have this sort of thing in your commercially released product, however, it doesn't have too much of an impact on the experience since it still gets across what you have to do\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThe story is that you have inherited a woodland house from your aunt, however, the inheritance has a twist in which you don't get to claim ownership of the house until you've stayed there for a few days. There are additionally 2 warnings that come with it, don't go outside into the yard of the building at night, and don't go into the building's cellar. Like you'd expect, the main character doesn't abide rules, does both of these and finds himself trapped in a horror filled clinic, it's up to you to get out.\n\nThe story unlike other Nomad games actually develops as you go through it, and this is something I'll talk about in the replayability section, but there are some notes that give you further backstory and it's likely that you may miss some of these notes on 1 play through. You start to learn further of a lab in there where some apparent experiments were done down there and you can choose to uncover more about that, or just focus on getting out of there. While the story is heavily developed throughout and some parts of the story as they develop are pretty good to listen to, the basic premise of the plot and it processed as a whole is pretty average. It serves it's purpose and possibly goes slightly ahead with the developments throughout the game, but doesn't totally impress me.\n\n[h1]Graphics/Sound[/h1]\n\nLike the majority of GDNomad's games, the graphics and sound are really good, and this one is no exception.\n\nThe graphics in Autumn Dream are pretty good with Nomad showcasing yet again his talent of lighting effects and actually showcases good ambiance sound and actually used correctly instead of using a good sound department and placing them in the wrong places and using them at incorrect times like his other titles. You'll see reflections of light in the floors of the clinic, you'll see great spectacles of rays of light outside of the house, you'll hear bugs coming up to your ears outside, you'll hear eerie sounds in the clinic, basically overall a pretty damned good graphics showcasing and sound.\n\n[h1]Play Time/Replayability[/h1]\n\nThis is probably Autumn Dream's biggest fault, and that's in regards to it's play time and replayability.\n\nThe normal play time, if you're talking about just completing the game, you're talking about the average time to complete a GDNomad game and that's around 20 minutes, however if you're wanting to take your time, examine the notes and wanting further insight to what's going on with the facility, then you're looking around 30 minutes, and in regards of play time to go back and try to find notes that you may have missed, it'll really depend on the player. If for example you're intrigued by the story that I explained in the review and you want to develop it to it's extent, then you'll probably be willing to go through the game a second time, and probably get a total play time of 40-50 minutes. However, if you're the kind of player who isn't intrigued by the story, then you'll probably not get as much out of the game as others may and are probably just looking around 20 minutes of play time.\n\n[h1]Final Recommendation[/h1]\n\nI'm happy to say that Autumn Dream is the first title by GDNomad that I can actually say I enjoyed for what it was, and this kind of experience for \u00a32, you can't go too wrong for it. The horror is pretty well done, it isn't great but it's okay, the graphics and sound design are a spectacle, despite the game having at times useless puzzles, grammar mistakes, and a possible lack of replayability factors.\n\nPros\n+Good horror elements at times\n+Good setting\n+Developments into the story's background\n+Good graphics\n+Good sound\n\nCons\n-Bad puzzles\n-Bad grammar\n-Story as a whole is pretty average\n-Short\n-Lack of replayability factors\n\nFinal verdict: 6/10\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews]My Steam Curator[/url]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018006511", "last_played": 1492263062, "num_reviews": 47, "num_games_owned": 1011, "playtime_forever": 374}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1492295271, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519920", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1502968487, "recommendationid": "31166130", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
