As with level length, the developer states later levels are much longer. This game is good if your graphics card can handle it\n\n[h1]Galactic Storm is a great top-down space shooter that pretty much is what it advertises, but I can't recommend it[/h1]\n\n[b]TLDR: Too short, and too much lag to enjoy[/b]\n\nThe main reason I can't recommend this game is because of the way it runs. I have 8 GB of ram, with an i7 Processor (nothing special, but way above recommendation) and the game lags massively (I get around 10FPS when playing). \n\nOf course there could be other reasons, but what bothers me is that the only option available in the option menu is to change the pre-set control schemes to mouse, keyboard or controller - no options to change quality, and no options to change the button bindings, let alone sound or anything else.\n\nThe other place it falls short on it levels. From what I've seen, the game comes with 4 levels, but if the first one is anything to go by (got up to the first boss after ~4 min, you could beat them all in 20 min if you are good.\n\nI would only recommend this to people with good computers, who don't mind playing the same 4 levels over and over again.\n\n[h1]Notes to the developer[/h1] If you added in more settings, especially ones to reduce quality, and more levels, I would happily give this game a thumbs up, but in its current state, I just can't do that", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198072128905", "last_played": 1474112128, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 20, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1474112916, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1474122090, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498520", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1474159883, "developer_response": "Hello vanasten2, thanks for Your review.

The visuals are amazing and well put together. The weapon upgrades and collectables are enough to keep you going and keep it interesting.
