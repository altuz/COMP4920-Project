Smash fans will appreciate the unique hide-and-seek twist on the classic genre. I've watched this game grow from it's infancy as a game jam project, and this latest build is definitely the best. Dynamic environments, great roll dodging mechanics, and kick ass visuals make this a game I'd definitely suggest to a friend for 5 bucks.\n\nPros: Perplexing at times, easy to pick up for quick sessions, gnarly art style. Blind Blades is a great, cheap local multiplayer fighting game.\n\nCons: I think some faster sword play or perhaps combos would make this game a must-have for every fighting game player. One map in particular seemed to favor black.\n\nAll things considered, I'd give this game a solid 8.5/10. It's good to see indies tackle such a hardcore, established genre with their own twist. Keep up the good work.\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067747389", "last_played": 1482017264, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 118, "playtime_forever": 35}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1473384323, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513755", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1473384323, "recommendationid": "25419401", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I ran into some difficulty with controllers when starting up the game. At first it would work, and then it would stop working before I could start the game. I discovered I had to unplug and replug the controllers in order to fix it. Somewhat frustrating because I thought it was broken.\n\nThough after finally starting the game, it is fun to play to with others. It is quick to learn and matches end fast. I think it is a game everyone can play. When fighting against my brother, we would kill each other in seconds and usually it was funny because it wasn't always clear who died first due to the black and white style. Each of the levels are visually interesting.\n\nI do have some criticisms however. If a match lasts too long, the music stops playing and does not restart until the game ends. Either the music needs to be made loopable or a time limit should be in effect. Another issue I found is when you land upon a player's head. You can't strike downward in this position and yet the other player can strike upward. Seems unfair?\n\nMy main complaint is the bomb move. It just doesn't seem to help and can actually hinder the player who uses it since you have no idea where you are. Now, if the multiplayer mode worked on separate screens, I could definitely see this working. The player could see while the opposing player could not. My suggestion is, since this is only local multiplayer, replace the bomb move with something else like blocking?\n\nOverall, I believe this game is worth playing, especially with friends and family. I hope to see future updates to this game to make it even better.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198083668717", "last_played": 1477865159, "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 4442, "playtime_forever": 144}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1477271839, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503886", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1477271839, "recommendationid": "26192245", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I had this game and refunded it. Do not buy this game, the controller support does not work. I had to remap my controls every single time I wanted to play and it became so tedious.

If they fix the controller support I'd happily play and give a good review as the idea is there, but the basic esentials needed to play are far far away. IF you are willing to use a keyboard, go for it. It's a good buy.
