It's a promising concept that actually could weave a cheesy sci-fi title, but in the end it's a less technical 'Geometry Wars' style game. In fact, it's pretty bare bones and insanely boring beyond the \"what the fuck\" factor in the initial impression.\n\nThe goal is to defeat the waves of enemies and rack up stars. Stars are you in game currency. Spend them to equip vatrious weapons in one of the gear's four slots to take out your foes and earn experience so you can upgrade your gear and become stronger to survive later waves and boss battles that have no sound indication as to damage being inflicted (just red upon striking it). In that regard, the game is barren, though the battle score sounds pretty good.\n\nBut, after five minutes and the first boss wave, I felt like I experienced everything the game has to offer. Even for the sale price of $1.39, I was completely unsatisfied and felt as though I was sold a \"complete\" gamejam project that isn't actually finished.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025037510", "last_played": 1472703029, "num_reviews": 109, "num_games_owned": 3292, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1472709978, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513033", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1472710267, "recommendationid": "25280749", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "this was not that good of a game, it be good for a free game. my issue is you made a story, but didnt put it into the game! not to mention the horribal graphics and the fact that..idk...
