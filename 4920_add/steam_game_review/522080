I also had trouble with a lack of progression, There's nothing to spend money on since I couldn't figure out if it's possible to upgrade anything, though it seems like the mechanic is in the game.\n\nThe bosses are very cool however and the various level types are unique feeling, would love to see more environmental differences. \n\nOverall I think the base game is good but it needs fleshing out a bunch.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972626310", "last_played": 1505512472, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 216, "playtime_forever": 131}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1498504065, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510338", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498504065, "recommendationid": "32826778", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "First of all, I really loved how this game pretty much only uses ASCII symbols for its graphical design. Very retro-y, while still visually pleasing for a modern game. It was nice seeing variety in level designs and mechanics, and I think the enemy mobs are cute.\nThe movements are smooth, and the weapon aiming is very responsive. I also really liked the variety of weapons and how you can combine all of them with different types of ammo.\nSo overall it's a pretty good game and I'm happy with my purchase.\n\nI almost don't have anything negative to say, but one issue is that it seems to freeze and crash at random. This unfortunately removes all the progress I made while in the caverns, but whenever I return to the surface it seems my things are saved for good. It doesn't happen too often, and it's mostly easy to catch up, so it's just a minor issue.\nOne other thing is that the levels with the swirly mist effect make me kinda dizzy and uncomfortable, but when I get those I just rush to the other level and all is fine again, haha.\n\nWhat I personally hope to see in this game in the future is difficulty settings. I felt it got really easy at some point, and I got through the game (minus collecting all the gems) in less than an hour. It didn't take away much of the fun, but still, it would be nice to test our skills on a higher difficulty. One thing I found out is that once you get further, you can practically collect infinite money and buy infinite health kits to stack your health up so high that a horde of mobs isn't really a threat anymore. \nThere could be more feeling of progression. Collecting gems and saving up for items is still nice, but it ends up feeling like you keep doing the same thing just to collect all the things. Maybe you can make some kind of levelling system so people can slowly earn their stats instead of buying temporary increases, among other things, like unlocking weapons or something.\nAnd otherwise it would just be nice to see more content in general. Maybe also a story around it, for more immersion and to build up interest.\n\n(I hope this doesn't sound negative, cause I really liked it and wish you the best!)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024017295", "last_played": 1499448042, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 165, "playtime_forever": 141}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499292566, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499292566, "recommendationid": "33292809", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
