It requires you to stay facing one direction and use the trackpad or analog stick to turn and even press a button to crouch down. If you are \"standing\" in the game and crouch down in real life it actual says you're outside of the play area. It feels so claustrophobic. \n\nTo give you an example, imagine there's a switch 70 degrees to the right and 5 feet away that you have to flip. You turn to face the switch, the screen goes black and tells you to look forward. you hit the rotate button, the screen is still off center and you have to walk 5 fieet to the switch. You walk forward and you are now too far to the left of it because you didn't rotate to perfectly align with the switch. you rotate again and you're now looking perpendicular to the wall with the switch. Moving forward, you run into something in the environment and the switch is just out of reach. you step forward in real life to be able to reach the switch, the screen goes black and tells you you're out of the play area. This happens for every little thing you have to do in the game. It's infuriating. \n\nIf they added 360 roomscale movement it might be a great game. The story seems pretty interesting so far and it runs well and the character models are pretty good.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197979998129", "last_played": 1498104052, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 292, "playtime_forever": 46}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1499379016, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510293", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499379016, "recommendationid": "33325898", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
