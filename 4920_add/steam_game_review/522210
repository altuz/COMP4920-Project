The art style and quick-yet-tactical pace immediately evoke comparisons to [i]Hotline Miami[/i], which is one of my favourite games of all time. While [i]Serial Cleaner[/i] doesn't have the same depth of story (being quite straight forward and fairly predictable), the gameplay is as enjoyable. It plays like a mashup of [i]Hotline Miami[/i] and [i]Party Hard[/i], while also being different enough to stand apart.\n\nEach level has its own style, the soundtrack is amazing, and as the game progresses over the course of years, the difficulty really ramps up. It can be quite frustrating, and the random generation on each level can impact the difficulty quite drastically, but there's something so fun and addicting about it all the same. There are collectibles which unlock costumes and bonus levels (each based on different films), as well as a challenge mode.\n\nCreative, stylish, and a whole lot of bloody fun.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197978881191", "last_played": 1505061717, "num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 694, "playtime_forever": 442}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505062511, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502841", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505062511, "recommendationid": "34866462", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
