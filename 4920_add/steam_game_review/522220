It has you collect and activate emotions, and those intersect with some decisive moments in a career path (\"Destiny\") to determine whether you advance well or not. It also punishes you for \"wrong\" answers, like being disgusted by crime as a police officer, preferring profit over charity as a businessman, or as a Senator, not choosing political activism and campaigning for poor students. These choices are also framed as being the result of negative emotions (\"Disgust,\" or \"Anger,\" while Leftist positions are done because of \"Joy,\" or \"Interest\").\n\nSome of these ridiculously cartoonish \"wrong answers\" end up with you in prison or addicted to drugs. Most end up with you simply failing at the \"Destiny.\" A voice straight-up tells you you've done it wrong because you had the wrong emotion. It's actually kind of remarkable how blatant it is in pushing \"Liberal\" actions as good and resulting in good outcomes, and punishing more traditionally \"Conservative\" approaches, and stuffing you in a jail cell. \n\nI'm very glad I vetted this out before letting any of my kids take a try. Don't be fooled by the cartoon graphics or the description that says this is \"scientific.\" There's about 3 seconds of \"science.\" The rest of it is a simple (and boring) shooting gallery game obviously meant to brainwash kids into Liberalism.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970859560", "last_played": 1502082932, "num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 680, "playtime_forever": 30}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1502083673, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478993", "votes_down": 20, "timestamp_updated": 1502084397, "recommendationid": "34075164", "votes_funny": 11, "voted_up": false}]}
