Anyway from the time I have played so far here is my experience with Quick Draw.\n\nIt is something different, there are a lot of games for the VIVE where you just stand and shoot.. boring right? Quick Draw is well, that but it adds something new to it with the wild west setting and the fact you have to draw your weapon at the same time. \n\nI was immersed into this game, even putting on a fake accent and physically pretending to be in a move or something (I'm a streamer, not a crazy person). Anyway it was a lot of fun to play and something I have never tried before.\n\nThe game is not perfect though, after a while it can get repetitive, this is because of the lack of gamemodes in the game, at the moment there are only 2 gamemodes. A shooting range time trial and the 1v1 quick draw, there will soon be an online feature which I am very excited for but at the moment the game is very limited. I would say for the price it is OK but not perfect, I would love to see more features in the game at a later date, maybe even some missions like a Saloon gunfight or something (I understand that will counter the name of the game being Quick Draw but it would still be fun, especially with the cartoony graphics which I have happened to fall in love with.) Anyway, if you have some money to spend and want to try something new give this a shot! \n\nRATE: 6/10 (for now)\n\nNOTE: Will update this review when the game leaves Early Access.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198087232830", "last_played": 1492018433, "num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 153, "playtime_forever": 46}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1475934338, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504760", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1475934383, "recommendationid": "25925536", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "https://youtu.be/lewal9JtyOY\n\nWelcome to the VR McCree Simulator, where it's always...

Sometimes they act like they're a balloon and the air has been released. Although this did provide some comedy moments for me :-D\n  [*] Ambient sound is almost like being in silence, could do with either some low western style music in the background, or more ambient sounds. Also could hear the ambient soundtrack stop and start with a gap in between, should loop seamlessly.\n  [*] Instead of the eagle noise being the start of the round when shooting the ruffians, maybe the ruffians could shout \"DRAW!\" Obviously the depth of the sound would need to be accurate.\n  [*] When using the pointer whilst holding the gun, it would be handy if the gun didn't fire, would have saved me accidentally quitting the game >.<\n  [*] The scrolling is super sensitive when using the pointer, was hard to scroll through and find my name on the leader board. Would be good if the leader board had the number for your position next to the name as well.\n[*] Not sure if allowing people to spam reload whilst shooting was intentional or not, seems too much like cheating to me.\n\nHere's a video I did showing an overview of the game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5kvl8PN7s\n\nLooking forward to more updates :-D", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198075749547", "last_played": 1492350093, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 81, "playtime_forever": 60}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1475221194, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502708", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1475221449, "recommendationid": "25777860", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Cartoony graphics work well \nOption to change height of holster\nFun now but will be awesome with multiplayer.\n\nIt's not apparent how to reload your guns.\nAudio effects are lacking, looks but doesn't sound like High Noon yet.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002872077", "last_played": 1478919509, "num_reviews": 75, "num_games_owned": 214, "playtime_forever": 84}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1474369803, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500223", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1474519316, "recommendationid": "25601165", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Nice game with a lot of potential.
