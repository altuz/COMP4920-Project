Wonderful. No need to say which parts the best. Twas like taking a grand tour over Britain =D Making Ghost Friends! And they FIGHT for ya! Vanquish your enemies! E.g. Possessed pugs! Robot Springers! HILARIOUS!\n\nMatey ain't that lovely!\n\nEdit 2:\nBeat the game fort the 1st time. Thus 'going back to Manchester'. =D This game gave you no hussles at all like some other pixel games with elaborate grindings and lvl-ups i.e. simple and sound decisions during critical moments in a battle will have save your character. You don't need to go back to previous places to grind up your levels like many other old school rpgs which compared to this game seem really a bit dated in concept. This is one BEAUTIFUL and FLUID game.\n\nIts got all the elelments of a good rpg/rougur/adventure, yet it DOES NOT hurt your feelings with over complicated techtree and stuffs.\n\nAnd, I've got 4 more campaigns to go.\n\nThought I was gonna lose this campaign at 1st but beat the game.

The central story feels profoundly unfinished, with five semi-interlocking 1-hour \"campaigns\", all of which introduce aspects of the broader metaplot and then completely abandon them at the end. One is just a straight up survival mode with a thin veneer of plot over it, and the other four range in quality, depth, and tone from wacky and brisk to relatively serious and immersive.\n\nThe pokemonlike elements feel a bit incomplete, too, and they can clash pretty heavily with the roguelike elements. Example: your ghosts level up as they fight, and every two levels they get to pick a stat boost. AFAIK, they have no stat growths on their own, they just grow as you boost them. You can buy boosts from stores as well, and you need to, because wild ghosts and ghost trainers all scale with your (level + how many stat boosts the game expects you've bought by now). Money is a limited currency, harvested from fallen trainers and wild ghosts, and healing is expensive and scales with your level, so if your run starts off well, you end up literally unstoppable, and if your run starts off poorly, all you can do is constantly swap out your wounded ghosts for wild ghosts until eventually you knuckle under.\n\nFurthermore, combat isn't *too* much more complicated than \"hit enemy with correct element\". There are dual-type ghosts, and you can teach any ghost any type of move, and there may even be STAB bonuses (they're not mentioned in any tool-tips, and I wasn't able to satisfactorily test for this, but I'm willing to believe), but all attacks pull from a single energy pool that refreshes slowly to a very low ceiling, and this means combat usually flows like this --> weak move, weak move, CLOBBER THEM, weak move, weak move, etc.\n\nThere are some status effects, mainly increases to attack or defense or buffing your own energy pool, and there is a burning effect that is a massively underpowered temporary poison, but strategy is pretty limited. Either one of your three total ghosts has type advantage on the enemy and you have enough speed to go first/enough attack stat to mow through their obnoxious tank-levels of defensive stats, or the battle is a grindy long-animation-time slugfest.\n\nNow, it may seem like I've just been relentlessly ripping on this game for these past few paragraphs, and I have, but look at that first sentence in the review.\n\nDo you see how tasty it is?\n\nI want this game to be the best that it can be, because that concept is absolutely amazing. \n\nAt ten dollars, even with its flaws, I think Ghostlords is a reasonable buy. On 50% sale, it's definitely worth snapping up.\n\nBut don't go in expecting it to be perfect. It's a diamond in the rough.\n\nOne that I sincerely hope its creator will follow with a more carefully excavated sequel.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198029904609", "last_played": 1502233524, "num_reviews": 69, "num_games_owned": 364, "playtime_forever": 320}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502235678, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500135", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1502235678, "recommendationid": "34114291", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
