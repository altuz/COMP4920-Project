Reminds me a lot of Pac-Man and Diner Dash. The pixel art is great, and the music fits well too. The game can get a bit difficult on Arcade mode, but other than that there's not much else to be said. There are cutscenes now and then as well with some story elements, but overall I feel this is a gameplay-focused game. And for $3, it's pretty reasonably priced. Definitely pick this up if you can!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198112283312", "last_played": 1500079525, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 86, "playtime_forever": 23}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1501939954, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502678", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501939954, "recommendationid": "34038276", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
