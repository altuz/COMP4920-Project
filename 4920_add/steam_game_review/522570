It goes for a third person style like Uncharted, but didn't get the camera to work quite right. To get to level select you have to complete a tutorial-esque prologue that is way longer than it needs to be. The plot might be good, it's just too cliche and the text is harder to read than it should be. I would say that, unless all you care about are trading cards, don't get this game. It really isn't worth what it costs and should be a F2P IMO.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198354786688", "last_played": 1505423994, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 59, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505424314, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501992", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505424314, "recommendationid": "34958091", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "games form 1990 are better than this", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198332152484", "last_played": 1503368050, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_forever": 17}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506284326, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501868", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506284326, "recommendationid": "35190024", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
