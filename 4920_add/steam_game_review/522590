The first has a deep cut on his leg. It looks kind of vicious but there doesn't appear to be an infection. You can say with some degree of certainty that he will recover and enjoy the use of that leg for the remainder of his days.\nThe second guy brings you his leg in a bag. It is in two pieces, one of which a dog has partially eaten while the other half is not part of a leg at all. It is a desk lamp. The stump that used to hold his leg onto his body has turned black and become home to a cluster of flesh eating hornets. The man cheerfully asks you to fix his leg.\n\nSome Early Access games are not going to get better and it's usually painfully obvious which ones they are. I'm not saying the developer intended for this to be a cash-grab, even though every component of it stinks like one with its five minute playtime and assets unimaginatively dumped all over the bloody place like the only effort that went into [b]Near Midnight[/b] was renaming it from the original [b]Spooky Mansion Template[/b].

Something I don't mind paying $.89 for. As I understand it used to be $3. Something I may not have paid at the time for this. The game has promise, however. That is provided the developer contnues to actually work on it. That stated, I'm not entirely confident this will be in proper early access by December. We shall see though. Now, I'll list the pros and cons and then explain my review status afterwards.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat backstory\n\nGood setting\n\nDecent atmosphere\n\nPartial controller support (quite a pleasant surprise for me)\n\nCons:\n\nLooping intro sequence\n\nTexture ripping\n\nPoor lighting\n\nAnnoying sfx\n\nNoninteractable items, save for one solitary pistol\n\n\nSummary:\n\nYes, I'm giving Near Midnight a recommend and a positive review. Why? Simply put, because it has promise if it is worked on.\n\nI did not include the length in the pros/cons because that information was privy to anyone willing to spend more than a second looking at the store page. There is a dev announcement for September 5, 2016 that states they know the game is short and not fully developed. A warning that is ready for the masses right there on the store page. So I will NOT be holding that against the game because I was warned about it before purchasing. I full well knew I would have between 1-10 minutes with this. \n\nI did appreciate what Near Midnight is trying to accomplish here. This game does have promise provided we see these guys continue to develop it and are not trying to nickel and dime us here. And I, personally, felt $.89 wasn't such a bad development \"donation\" for continued development. I spend more on a candy bar that is quickly digested. I'm not upset about the purchase. I like the backstory. I enjoy the fact that it takes place on a rural farm and that the daughter is seemingly possessed by a spirit or demon. At least, that is the assumpting I made based on the background text. I absolutely love that there is at least a rudimentary native support for controllers already. My Xbox One controller easy accomplished all thing I required for interacting in the game world. It was a very pleasant surprise and I appreciate that it was included. I also like the house itself. There were a few logical fallacies I found with it, but I'll go into detail about that below. The house is a great setting for the game. I just hope there are more rooms in the future or a spooky mechanic that extends the play area later on. The girl is downright creepy and I appreciate that. The actress has done a great job conveying this girl. I like that there is no HUD or UI. It added to the horror factor by not showing us how many bullets were in the gun. Keep the lack of UI present. \n\n\nWell that was the positive paragraph. On to the gritty stuff.  DEVELOPER, consider this a personal note to you as well.\n\nRight off the bat I noticed something negative. The fact that the intro sequence continually loops itself until you click on \"Skip.\" That needs to be taken out as soon as possible. The intro needs to be voiced over and once played, go directly to gameplay. None of this looping nonsense. As soon as I entered the house I looked to my right and noticed a texture tear between the first and second floors. I could see the light blue of the sky between the two. Throughout play I also spotted quite a few of these texture tears running vertically on a number of the walls. The second thing I noticed about the textures is that the house is way too destitute for what the backstory provides. From my understand we are arriving to inspect noises after a recent double homicide. There is no reason why the house interior should look like it has been left to fall apart for over 20 years in the wilds. I imagine these attentive and caring parents also upkept the house fairly well. Something the dev might want to consider. I get going for atmosphere, but at the cost of immersion is always a bad decision. Some of the sfx are a little....much. The awful bong sound that exists with every spooky change just kills the immersion for me. Just use the laughter or weird sounds that accompany the bong sometimes. Some sfx that is relevant to the room or house at some level. Cut that bonging sound out of the game. It is horrible. Absolutely horrible. There is a point where we hear dripping after coming across a note about a bathroom. It makes no sense. There is no tub anywhere or a bathroom that I found. So that was just poorly done. Expand the house to accompany what you're going for here. The lighting needs to be fixed. As another reviewer stated, it looks nothing like the video on the store page. If the lighting were like that and we had a flashlight, this demo experience would have been a lot better. The abrupt ending would have been a bit more intense if we had a flash of something hitting us or the girl rushing towards us and blacking the screen out. The sudden cutoff and return to the menu screen is disappointing. More so considering we can't restart or close the game because the mouse cursor fails at that point. \n\nOverall, the game has promise but is full of flaws. Keep on developing and see this vision come to light.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nPROS\n\nGreat backstory\nGood atmosphere\nPartial controller support\n\nCONS\n\nLooping intro sequence\nTexture ripping\nSome bad sfx and lighting\nUnsatisfying abrupt ending\n\nConsidering the pros/cons, I still recommend the game. For $.99 it is worth investing in for the continued development of the title. Something that could genuinely become great as long as the developer continues developing. I'd much rather promote support of a project that could be good than to squelch creativity entirely and shut down an endeavor.
