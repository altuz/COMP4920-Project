In itself they aren't too bad, maybe a little bit on the simple side with some few puzzles being unnecessarily difficult to get clues on.\n\nDue to the fact that the entire story just leads into nowhere due to the discontinuation of the episodes, there's little point in buying this and playing it. Additionally, the asking price is way too high for the measly four hours of playtime this delivers. Four hours, which additionally aren't that great or interesting to begin with.\n\nThe gameplay is very linear, animations are very basic, after room traversal textures take several seconds to load and even after loading, they look very blurry. The sound is almost nonexistant except for minor chimes and background noise that probably is aimed at being creepy but ends up being annoying at best.\n\nBasically nothing more than an unfinished broken product.\n\nStay away from this and neither waste your money nor time on it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969749884", "last_played": 1504819905, "num_reviews": 753, "num_games_owned": 1384, "playtime_forever": 363}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504805309, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504985", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504805309, "recommendationid": "34798836", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
