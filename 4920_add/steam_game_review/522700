No, not the shite-arsed promo pic with the garish red writing, but the twisted photographic style in the game itself (resourcefully used as an alternative to finding an actual \"artist\", one presumes). Unfortunately, this is still a text-based adventure, and while the writing's vaguely passable, the story certainly isn't.\n\n   You know you're in trouble when one of your first decisions as a player is to use the elevator or the stairs, and choosing the former just gets you insta-killed with no foreshadowing whatsoever. It would be a tad hysterical to call this game \"bad\"...but, y'know, I'm not gonna go outta my way to call it \"good\", either.

There's not much to it, even for a text based game. There really aren't that many choices. The art is frustrating because  its all so blurry. If you wanted to improve this game, add more choices and less pointless dialogue. You don't need 6 pages of \"........\" and \"zzzzZzzz\" when you're taking a nap. Add some more infected art or art in general that isnt so out of focus. I'm not saying that everything has to be crystal clear, but is the main characater just fucked up the entire time? Is he an alchoholic?  Did he lose his glasses? I'm not being funny, I think that would be an interesting game mechanic for a text based game and you could then justify the blurry frames. For EVERY frame tho, it just gets old. Also, the \"action\" bits are the highlights of your game, so you need to intensify those. For example, add a contrasting flash on screen when there are gun shots. Also, maybe you could add a faint ringing to represent shooting a gun without hearing protection. Also, consider adding a \"silent\" timer on certain events. Such as the gentleman on top of the armory, or the woman on top of the walmart. If you don't answer them in a certain amount of time, the player should have a response given to them.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198029640083", "last_played": 1474759705, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 375, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1474761169, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501500", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1474761169, "recommendationid": "25681222", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "surprised to see no reviews for this yet. played through it and it was pretty cool. like a cooler/mature choose your own adventure with good dialogue choices that let you be good or evil at will, a good number of ways to die, (which surprised me when first i died) and a suprisingly simply yet effective art style that kinda looks like a snapchat filter that blurs the fine details in all the pictures. It works because it leaves those finer details to the imagination, and are as individual as the reader. The only minor criticism I can leave is that the grammar and cadence of the writing can take some getting used to as it would seem the author implements english as a second language. and like i said \"minor criticism\". wont stop you having an enjoyable experience. 9/10 \nhope to see the story continue", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198020359436", "last_played": 1474127961, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 926, "playtime_forever": 117}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1474167948, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507654", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1474167948, "recommendationid": "25560813", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
