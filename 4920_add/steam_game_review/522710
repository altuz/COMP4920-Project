It took me a bit too long to figure out one of the puzzles, but I'm glad I persisted.\n\nMy only qualms with the game are: the player character tends to be really annoying in telling me that a thing I was holding was \"useless\" when I was exploring everything the first time through (though I was grateful for it later on when I was stuck). Also, the teleportation transfers the center of your play area to the point you indicate, and not where you're currently standing, which leads to some \"why am I not teleporting?\" and \"why did I just appear in a wall?\" moments.\n\nAlso, the story is unintelligable and completely ignorable. Not invested in the slightest, and it's hard to even tell the characters apart sometimes.\n\nOther than those minor quibbles, I recommend this for the puzzles.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198045474972", "last_played": 1479007253, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 580, "playtime_forever": 246}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1478451563, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508545", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1478451563, "recommendationid": "26460263", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "One of the most polished escape the room experiences on vive so far.

Appreciate that the devs take feedback and act on it.\n\nThis was a very good escape room with several neat puzzles that were all reasonable. The object interactions are much improved with the latest patch, although I did still find some objects falling through other objects.  Items can now be opened more easily.  Physics aside, the experience was pretty good, and I hope to see more like this.
