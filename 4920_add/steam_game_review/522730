Truthfully, every person that owns a Vive has clocked a fair few hours on the Lab's archery minigame (or should have). If you enjoyed that, this feels like a great upgrade. Instead of little sillouettes you are being overrun by a skeletal horde who have many different variations - some are just runners, some are real fast, some have helmets and sheilds, and once you get through a few levels the big guys come out. Flying monsters in development apparently, which will add a whole new challenge, along with a few new enemy types says the blurb. The game is great fun and the mechanics are familiar to anyone who has used the excellent Lab archery system, or has ever picked up a bow and arrow. The graphics are cartoony but well done and are perfect for the game. The enemies come on random varying paths, which means they sometimes veer away from your arrow after you've let fly, but that feels like a good variation (rather than just plunking arrows endlessly into enemies you know their exact path). Another cool aspect is that you get two towers to shoot from: enemies massing on your left flank? just switch over to that tower and show them what for. Finally, the four different arrow options are a good addition: when a giant skeleton is about to throw a goblin at you, it's hugely satisfying to bullseye him with an arcane arrow and go back to taking down the other varied critters.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198012005606", "last_played": 1501432710, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 81, "playtime_forever": 427}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1478871627, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1478871627, "recommendationid": "26536582", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It has potential. I'm a massive fan of The Lab arrow game but this feels sluggish in comparison. It doesn't quite have that same speedy \"punch\" that The Lab offers, with arrows gliding annoyingly (for me) slowly towards targets. Another issue is the bow, which is either bugged or is designed in a weird way so that it rotates with the arrow (opposite hand) rather than the bow controller. This feels really weird to me as the bow is at one angle while my hand is at another.
