Frantic and constantly changing, the one thing I do think this game is missing is 5-12 player multiplayer, and ideally 3 and 4 team maps/gamemodes. This game is a great start for an Early Access game, having waited for a better maturity before release, so you won't feel burned or incomplete on this one!\n\nWhile there is not a specific tutorial mode, the trials mode does a good  job prepping you for MP gameplay, although jump attacks are difficult to execute. The built in FPS counter is a nice touch, and the only time the game suffers lag is on the trial with 16+ enemies, which is only specific to a trial mode round, and not to regular gameplay. Playing far enough through trial mode unlocks a regular flag for normal CTF gameplay.\n\nWith the godheads, each one greatly changes the dynamic of gameplay, with some being helpful, others hurtful, and a few others both helpful and hurtful to the holder and surrounding players. Ones like Zeus help kill other players, while ones like Gaia impair movement. I would not nornally reccomend using Gaia on maps with lots of movement/jumping, especially with changing goals, as that could prove very frustrating.\n\nThe gameplay is fresh with each map, which is very unique with different layouts and mechanics. For example, the treasure room has boulders that can crush players, while the Greek City has 4 potential goal locations that alternate positions.\n\nThe creation of individual profiles for achievement and stat tracking is a little bit confusing, but the built in AI mechanics and multiple game modes is great for adding further customizations to gameplay either individually or with other players. This game though is of course best suited for party gameplay, especially with 4 players. You be default have a rb-attack that throws a pie at other players, although as the trials demonstrate, these can be deflected back with enough skill.\n\nOverall, I think this is a strong buy even for an Early Access game, and like Gangbeasts and Sausage Sports Club, I bet that there will be many more content updates in the future. The developers have been working on this game for approx. 3 years and are very responsive on Facebook, which is also great!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198140714299", "last_played": 1492148193, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 1215, "playtime_forever": 180}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1491513559, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510632", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1491569696, "recommendationid": "30986504", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
