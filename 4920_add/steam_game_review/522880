I am a HUGE Psycho-Pass Fan, especially of the 1st season and the movie, so I was really longing for that game. And I have to say: I am not disappointed. The voice acting is just great, with the same voice actors as the season... just wow. I am a fan so I defenitly loved seeing my favorite characters again - reading them and hearing them, getting a new adventure with them. The adventure itself? It was stunning, fitting the world of Psycho Pass and so exciting, that I played the first round in one all-nighter. But even if you are not familiar with the world, the game explains enough so you understand - so if somebody stumbles over the game first... hopefully that person becomes a big fan like me :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198039375452", "last_played": 1505596086, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 65, "playtime_forever": 2210}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504986082, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504986082, "recommendationid": "34845152", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
