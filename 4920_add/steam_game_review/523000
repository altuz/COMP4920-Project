Result: She became a general and married a cheerful, sociable knight. And also she hated me for making her train all the time. \n\nMost recent playthrough: Burnt by my last experience, I decided to focus on making sure she won the Art Contest at the Harvest Festival for the cash. 14 year, probably due to all the dance lessons I'd been sending her on for stamina and glamour her rival was the Dance Party girl, to my displeasure as I had a sure winner with the Advent of Angels painting. But I went along with it because I didn't want my daughter to hate me. I made sure she smoozed with the Minister, I beggared myself buying her a dress, I sent her dance class after dance class. She ran away during the month of the next Harvest Festival. She had to fund her dance classes with hairdressing that year. Result: Became a dancer and married the demon butler which I wasn't even trying for. And she loved me for cherishing her. \n\nWe make plans for our children and push them in that direction, but children will make their own choices and follow their own paths, parents plans for them be damned. That's why this game is an awesomely realisitic parenting simulator, apparent from all the fairy tea parties and demon feasts.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049035827", "last_played": 1505128397, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_forever": 7200}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1502804289, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504384", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502804289, "recommendationid": "34256210", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Loved this game on the DosBox, Love it now.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 476, "steamid": "76561198357151906", "last_played": 1507173122, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 7318}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1502242834, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501485", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1502242834, "recommendationid": "34115818", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "PBG led me to this game", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "steamid": "76561198085853413", "last_played": 1507145435, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 65, "playtime_forever": 1309}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502751262, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496565", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1502751262, "recommendationid": "34245129", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "As someone that had played the original Princess Maker 2 english translation by Softegg, this game felt severely lacking.
