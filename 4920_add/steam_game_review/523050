While I currently prefer the sculpting in this program to Kodon for roughly creating the initial shape of an object, it currently lacks the precision to sculpt in a precise fashion.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004196149", "last_played": 1477140411, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 467, "playtime_forever": 68}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1472872638, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1472872638, "recommendationid": "25317038", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is literally the future of computer art and design.

This is turning into a great little VR modeling application. Being able to walk around the model with the Vive controllers and do low-level edits to vertices, edges, and faces is a lot of fun. The developer added tools for extruding, merging vertices, creating/deleting faces, and inserting edge loops, all of which are a big help. Soft-selection grabbing of vertex groups and X,Y,Z constrained moving/scaling would be nice as well but there's already a lot to play with here. If you find Blender or Maya intimidating but still want to learn 3D modeling I certainly recommend giving ArtStage a try. The advanced mesh tools make it perfect for experienced modelers as well.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198292373479", "last_played": 1495870763, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 85}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1473581233, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1489548072, "recommendationid": "25457957", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "To anyone considering purchasing this program, I just wanted to say that the author(s) have implemented a great feature that I haven't found on any other 3D paint program (including TiltBrush).\n\nWhat this program allows you to do, is to import 3D models (I brought in a 3D scan using the \"sturcture\" scanner from structure.io) and then paint on it.  Unlike TiltBrush, it isn't creating new geometry that you can choose the color for, but it is creating the UV texture map for your exisitng 3D object.  I believe you can then export the model for use in another 3D program but I haven't tried it.\n\nWhat is especially promising is that when this import 3D model feature was introduced, the paint feature did not work.  However the author listened to the feedback on the discussions (I'm kimtheo) and seems to have fixed it.  Kudos to him/her/them.\n\nUnfortunately, the model I used didn't get the existing texture map impoted properly (but that may have been my problem).  Anyway, I have hopes that the author will be able to fix this as well.  I strongly recommend that anyone who wants to use this program for serious creative tasks looks into it; coupled with a 3D scanner/CAD model it could really be a useful way of seeing how your exisitng designs look in color.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025752346", "last_played": 1479124400, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_forever": 52}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1479201732, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1479201732, "recommendationid": "26612497", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
