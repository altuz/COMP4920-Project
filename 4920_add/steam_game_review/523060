Yeah, me neither... but look, here it is! Instead of pesky numbers, they use planets and moons. Smash like objects together and create bigger objects and keep going until you probably create a black hole or get bored, which ever comes first (hint: getting bored will easily come first).\n\nYou can use a variety of controls, but all I tested were the motion controls with the Vive.  You hold the trigger down and move the controller in the direction you want everything to slide, and then release and it moves stuff...sometimes.  Sometimes it moves it but moves it the wrong way.  \n\nDoes this game need to be in VR?  no... it could probably be done in similar quality on your phone using tilt mechanics to change the view and swiping or tapping to make it move.  There's really not that much benefit to playing this in VR.\n\nThere is no music, there isn't a whole lot of graphics other than the objects floating in a black void, and the sound effects are limited to swish sounds and generic explosions.\n\nThings I liked:\n[list]\n   [*] The planets actually rotate slowly as they sit in the grid\n   [*] the detail on the planets is ok.\n   [*] it'll keep you busy for 30 minutes or more if you don't get bored\n[/list]\n\nThings that make me want a refund:\n[list]\n   [*] It's not exciting to play at all\n   [*] It doesn't seem to be very challenging... I know it's listed as casual but you could just move everything around randomly for quite a long time before encountering any problems.\n   [*] There's a poor sense of scale as you go up in mass.  When you go from \"Jupiter\" to the \"Sun\" you're barely increasing the size of the object.  \n   [*] No music\n   [*] Crap sound effects\n   [*] The idea is not original at all\n   [*] The controls kinda suck\n[/list]\n\nI know you probably spotted this one as being crap from a mile off.   Well, this is your confirmation.  It's crap.  You might as well search google for \"2048\" and  play that, and just pretend the numbers are planets.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969913402", "last_played": 1485800894, "num_reviews": 149, "num_games_owned": 1966, "playtime_forever": 276}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1475808663, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518820", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1475808663, "recommendationid": "25895672", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I was going to demo this for 5 minutes before bed.
