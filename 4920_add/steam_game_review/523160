Hints are free and should be used whenever their cooldown allows. Time is not so much an issue because you can buy more time with coins, which are abundant in the game, as many times as you want during each level, as long as you can afford. Even though I'd rather complete the puzzles at my own pace, enjoying a more laid back and casual experience. But anyway, assembling those mosaics is still a fun experience. \n\nCONS:\n1 - Artwork could be more inspired. Photographic textures applied on the pieces is not exactly an exciting feature. Some anatomic aberrations and amateurish face depictions are also present. The gorgeous art style present in the cutscene at the start and the background menu only creates a discrepancy that aggravates the fact.\n\n2 - Some simetric / repeating shapes sometimes leave you guessing. They could fit 2 places on the board. I'm not talking about the ones that have subtle differences, those are present too and are discernible, I'm talking EXACT fits here. you need to waste a hint hoping it will tell you which of those 2 twin spheres fit that circular hole.\n\n3 - BAD achievements. Unfortunately a recurring mistake from game devs all around. Seriously, is it THAT hard to realize anyone can and will complete this game with 3 keys on each stage without being NEAR halfway through the stupid \"get 1.000.000 total coins\" thing?

One set is wood, next is cloth then paper and so on. I love the textures and they add a great deal to my pleasure in the game. So anyone who enjoys things like that should enjoy this game. \n\nThere are only a few peices show at the side at a time and this seems to be a problem for some people. On the other hand there are terrible reviews of other puzzle game with all the peices on the side and it is impossible to sort them out. This decision seems balenced with a 3 ACHIVEMENTS for using the HINT button.\n\nAbout getting ALL the achivements - I did get them all in Alice 1 on CASUAL, because I enjoyed the game enough to play through a couple of times. Anyhow not many people seem to really care about getting them all for most games. \n\nAnother point is that this is a game girls enjoy and I've bought extra copies to send as gifts to granddaughters. \n\nNo violence, no gore, no fighting - just beautiful clever puzzles in a well thought out game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198033102868", "last_played": 1500198499, "num_reviews": 45, "num_games_owned": 279, "playtime_forever": 610}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1499148304, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495737", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1499148304, "recommendationid": "33217000", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I love previous game.\n\nTime is running fast than I enough to put them all with using hints.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "steamid": "76561198049160248", "last_played": 1506718689, "num_reviews": 52, "num_games_owned": 180, "playtime_forever": 74}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506456198, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506456198, "recommendationid": "35229320", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
