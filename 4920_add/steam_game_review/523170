These were my initial thoguhts looking at the info :\n\n\"You can build guns\"\nMeh...\n\"Over 40 parts\"\nOkay, I guess...\n\"Pimp-My -Gun\"\nThat sounds kinda interesting...\n\"Revolver Sniper Rifles and 3 barreled AUG 20s\"\nThis is getting cool...\n\"A rocket launcher\"\nYou're close!\n\"Completely customizabe RPMs, recoil, and damage\"\nF*ck it! I'm playing this sh*t!\n\nPros :\n- Think of a combination of Minecraft and H3VR (Major)\n- Parts snap together with nodes making it easy to build. (Minor)\n- Completely customizable guns down to RPM, Amount of ammo, Precision, and Bullet Type. (Major)\n- You can make RPGs, Swords, and M90 Thumpers (Grenade Launcher), so it's not entirely about guns. (Intermediate)\n- Gunsword (Minor)\n- Actually shootable targets that will respond to the damage output accordingly. (Minor)\n- Saving guns feature (Major)\n- Good shading (Minor)\n- Visible Bulletholes (Minor)\n- Almost no noticeable glitches (Intermediate)\n\nCons :\n- The guns are just named random things like \"Sieck.sfwep\" or \"Caopolroh.sfwep\" (Minor)\n- The part grabbing is innacurate which can ruin an entire gun's build (Major)\n- No Tutorial (Intermediate)\n- The node-snapping is sometimes really off and can ruin an entire gun's build (Major)\n- Unrealistic reloading, for example, you don't have to pull a bolt after sticking a magazine into the receiver. (Minor)\n- Some barrels are too big for any receiver (Minor)\n- Cheap-sounding click Sound FX (Minor)\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "steamid": "76561198214299520", "last_played": 1506153439, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_forever": 1171}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487436536, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487436536, "recommendationid": "30013309", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
