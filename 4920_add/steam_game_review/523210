It\u2019s short, simple, and easy to follow/understand, however you don\u2019t really get involved with it as much as you do with other games.\n\n[h1] INTRO [/h1]\nIn all honesty, I didn\u2019t care much for this game. The design was simple, the playthrough was easy to follow and quite dull, and the only real reason I think someone would get this game (aside from the fact it has a LGBT+ theme/coming out story) would be because the achievements are stupidly easy to get. By all means, it has some good points with it, like the fact the art is actually neat to look at and apparently the music sounds good (of which I didn\u2019t listen to until I saw others doing so in the Community screenshots). The idea behind it is neat, however there are cons to these pros that I feel outweigh them in design of a game worth enjoying.\n\n[h1] PRO LIST [/h1]\n1. The art is rather decent and looks nice. It happens to blur a lot of faces that otherwise don\u2019t have a focus in the story (neat touch) and you can see that different pictures are colored differently to reflect mood (the pictures of the phone owner feeling \u201ctrapped\u201d are dark compared to pictures of the owner\u2019s true expressions ringing out which are lighter/brighter in color.\n2. The messages in the phone are easy to read and they added a neat feature that allows you to quickly scroll to the top of a conversation with a button press instead of scrolling your mouse wheel. It\u2019s convenient and comes with an achievement!\n3. It\u2019s short, simple, and requires little thought to figure out the \u201cpuzzles\u201d and \u201cchallenges provided.\n\n[h1] CON LIST [/h1]\n\n1. The game and community behind it are LGBT+ based and directed to that niche market, and as such, those who are against or would rather not deal with LGBT+ bullshit often skip over the game or return it after figuring out its origins. \n2. The game is so simple and easy to play (with such little content) that when you sit and read through every text message and complete the game, you only sat there for 1 hour. If you want the achievements (as all it\u2019s really useful for is adding another \u201cperfect game\u201d to your Steam list and returning it for your money back) it takes at most 15 mins. I only have 2 hours on the game because I left halfway through to eat.\n3. This is suppose to be a storytelling game where you, as the person who picked up the phone and looked through it, has to snoop around and picks up clues to figure out the owner. Find the story, follow it, and see it\u2019s conclusion. The Steam Store page for it makes it sound 10x more interesting than it really is. The story is flat, uninteresting, hard to get involved and otherwise placid and deadpan. When i play games, no matter what one, I try to take on the personality of the character I have before me (and God help me when I have to make my own and choose traits/class/race and such). With this, the whole premise is YOU found the phone and MUST look through it. I couldn\u2019t get into that because I wouldn\u2019t do that, so when playing, i tried to adopt a mentality that would make me want to play the game as realistically as I could. So I wiped the memory and left it behind, and got an achievement. \n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\nIn all honesty, if you are into a game that is short, simple, unemotional and you don\u2019t want to get attached to characters, then yeah, this game is for you. Achievement hunting is more like buying the dead animal from the butcher rather than hunting it. No challenge, easy, quick, and a helluva lot quicker. The LGBT+ gaming industry is something that could be explored in modest ways. Characters people can get attached to who aren\u2019t heterosexual, but it effects a scene not the story are good places to start (see Dragon Age 2 and Dragon Age: Inquisition for more information on how a game can have LGBT+ elements with the same issues and challenges other identifying genders/sexualities face without it being the focus of the game).\n\nIt\u2019s almost sad I give a game focused on the issue of transgender rights and trans-phobia a \u201cNot Recommended\u201d review, but you don\u2019t pay more for the whitewash on a canvas that will be painted over by something even better in due time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198116471154", "last_played": 1497308497, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 219, "playtime_forever": 133}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506977945, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506977945, "recommendationid": "35428463", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "nope.. i though it will be a fun interesting game..no..it was boring af refunded it before even finishing the game. dont be jebaited like me ..go buy some cs-go items with this money lol", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 51, "steamid": "76561198092356857", "last_played": 1506543095, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 76, "playtime_forever": 51}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1506543793, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501045", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506543793, "recommendationid": "35248853", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The original premise and concept is interesting, but the story and writing is not emotionally engaging enough to carry it through.
