For those of you afraid of \"just another bow and arrow game\", have NO FEAR!  It's actually quite the contrary.  Lord of the Stack has made sure there are elements of exploration, varying creatures (smaller trolls, overbearing crazy-big giant enemies, etc), levels where you have to jump on different moving planks in burning hot lava (Mario-like), magic portals, and stunning visuals and excellent physics and game-play throughout.\n\nHonestly - there is a lot to this game that I didn't even get to and it looks like more is being added as we speak.  EXCELLENT BUY for only $10 (really, IT'S A STEAL).  Honestly, for all the hours that had to be put into this game, it really could be priced higher because it's excellent quality and has great depth.  I'm likely going to buy another copy for one of my friends (after Christmas) just because I want to support the developers bc I know it's a rough gig out there and I really appreciate you guys making these quality VR games.\n\nSide note - everytime I lost to a wave of goblins and got transported to the throne room to fight inside the castle - holy smokes those goblins made me scream because it is so freaking intense when you get over-taken!!
