And i really qick found my way into it. It took me about 15 minutes to realize what to do and at the end of the day i had a fully playable card set of 50 cards. Cool. Now lets try them out in the Tabletop Simulator. Yes this works and without doing anything. Just render a card set and use the render TTS Files in TTS.\n\nOk but as allways there is something to complain about. \nBiggest issue is the text field and usabilty. Starting of with a lack of usefull features like cursivefont, outline or bold fonts which could save a lot of time in my two projects. But mostly annoying it the samll text field. There is basicly a window just big enough to show like 3 or 2 words. This means changing something is hard to do so, because you can\u00b4t click arround and need to move the cursor by the arrows key. Bad for  a big text. \n\nSecond annyoing thing is. Need to admitt only annoying because i needed a blueprint (the raw card design) serveral times little adjusted. There isn\u00b4t a copy option i needed to created each time new. \n\nCould allthough be possible that i am to dumb and new to find the requested features.\nMaybe in the future I will know.\nIn that case an update for this review will come.\n\nAt this state a clearly recommend it to this software if you search for an lazy solution and got tired of using photoshop.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 464, "steamid": "76561198113388537", "last_played": 1506767696, "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 1051, "playtime_forever": 1602}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505780614, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505780614, "recommendationid": "35055351", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A really handy and easy to use software for aspiring creators and game designers.\nI've been searching for such a program for years, as I am not proficient with Photoshop or any other designing programs.\nA thank you to the creators for the fantastic product and the amazing experience that I was granted by using it!\nTotally recommended for designers and tabletop enthusiasts!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 204, "steamid": "76561198030744532", "last_played": 1506407117, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 193, "playtime_forever": 542}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505868092, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505868092, "recommendationid": "35074842", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I love this tool.

My main gripe when I last tried it was that the output quality was extremely low, even on it's highest setting.\n\nI made a relatively simple deck that I'd done most of the grunt work on using photoshop and inkscape with, it was just compiling the images on to cards, which I'm surprised there isn't any way to do in a batch. Just doing this process the program crashed 3 times on me, making me lose significant progress the first 2 times, and then I basically kept hitting save after doing each card after that, just in case.\n\nThen I tried to export those cards I'd made, in order to see how the Tabletop Simulator exporting works, mainly. Well, the first time the program just froze, I left it for 30 minutes just in case and nothing. Closed it, restarted. Tried exporting again, it got 25% of the way through and crashed properly. Restarted. It got about 60% of the way this time and then crashed again. So I haven't actually found out how the Tabletop Simulator exporting is yet.\n\nAnd just generally, the program feels weak. There's no hover over info on features, so you're not sure what a button will do until you click it. There's no real in program help in any way. There should be a lot more features that should be available with a right click on elements that you're editing. Like being able to delete or copy an element. It's a shame because there is potential here, but it still doesn't feel in any way finished. I'm going to wait until v3 or even v4 before trying this again.
