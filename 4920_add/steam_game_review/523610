The Weapon handling is very hard on purpose but can be learned. Use single or brust shots most of the time and you are fine to go.\n\nIf the first mission is to hard, maybe try the single mission 'Trainyard'.\nIn fact this game isn't so brutally hard. This is just no Call of Duty, take your time and try a slow and tactical approach.\n\nIf you have some detailed questions on how to get into Beyond Enemy Lines or how to master it, let me know. I like to help you :)", "recommendationid": "33347707", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
