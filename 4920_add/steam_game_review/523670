I wanted to play a game that had absolutely no review on it, and do my part for the Steam community by writing a comprehensive review that will help inform others before purchasing. \n\nMy expiereince of Adventures of Fluzz:\nIn the world of FLuzz, not everything makes sense. YOu're not told all the controls (or even given the option to look them up) but that does add to the sense of adventure somewhat. It's also not quite clear why you are a luminous pink rabbit, running round collecting apples and oranges, rather than carrots....either way, I salute you for trying to break the stereotype of Rabbits always wanting carrots. You will also come up against dogs shotting tomatos, spynx's shooting lasers out of their eyes and mosquitos trying to defecate on your rabbit head. (also hedgehogs in the desert, but please let me if this is actually common IRL) \n\nDespite the somewhat strange concept of this game, it is quite and entertaining distraction and it borrows alot from classics such as Mario and Sonic. \n\nIt's not quite as polished as it could be (i had difficulty returning to menu etc when dying) but it was a relatively fun 45 minutes for the price of a large Mc Donalds. And who can say that's not good value.\n\nI also got to number 39 on the worldwide leaderboards! With some more practice and real commitment, you might even be able to beat Frodo, who is currently holding the number one spot. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this game for a fun light hearted 40 minutes - 1 hour, but would recommend that the dev lowers the price to entice more players. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198068311091", "last_played": 1474398839, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 60, "playtime_forever": 45}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1474399323, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507871", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1474399323, "recommendationid": "25608085", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is an exceptionally well done game. The attention to detail is outstanding.\n\nIt basically follows the 16-bit (SNES, Genesis, Amiga, etc) style of platformer except here everything is in HD. The levels are colorful, well drawn and most important there is a good amount of interaction.\n\nThe gameplay is very good! It's the kind of game that encourages exploration with the idea that if you die no big deal you've learned something so try again armed with the knowledge you just gained. That is old school. And here it is very well done.\n\nThe pace of the game is a bit on the slow side for my personal taste but certainly not so much as to ruin the game. The only part that I think absolutely should be faster is when you die. I don't want to wait for my bunny angel to rise up to heaven. Perhaps there is a way to skip that sequence but I have not found it yet. When I die I want to be able to immediately get right back to the start of the level and start playing again.\n\nBesides that this game is excellent! Oh another thing I want to mention is the music & sounds. Both are superb. The music puts me in a sort of fun lazy mood. The sounds are very effective at complementing the on-screen interaction. Overall the entire game is very well done and it is easy to see the developer spent a lot of care and time creating this game.\n\nHighly recommended if you enjoy platform games.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198188065497", "last_played": 1481314154, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 175, "playtime_forever": 71}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1480191466, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500176", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1480192306, "recommendationid": "27725556", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
