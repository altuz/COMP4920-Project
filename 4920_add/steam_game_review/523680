The fighter game aspect makes for an interesting take on the VN/life management genre.  Stat-building, etc. in these kinds of games can get pretty montonous sometimes, but I think the wrestling matches in Honey do a good job of breaking it up enough so it doesn't feel that way.  The writing is engaging, well-developed, and funny.  And of course the beautiful hand-drawn animation is the icing on the cake.  You can tell a lot of love went into the development.  Definitely recommend this one!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006721006", "last_played": 1477013032, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 85, "playtime_forever": 382}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504412381, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505129", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504412381, "recommendationid": "34702137", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
