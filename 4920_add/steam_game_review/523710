That's what this game delivers on. There's no plot or story here; this is nothing but arena matches. The art style isn't super high quality, but that doesn't matter.\n\nWhat does matter is the way you play this game. The sword physics feel real. Your playing area is limited and you have to wait for an enemy to come close enough before you swing at them. Some have shields. They have armour, and you can't hit their armour or your slice won't register. The game has different weapons with different stats, and depending on your fighting style, some will be more effective than others.\n\nIf you need a workout and you like swordplay, this is a very solid game, especially for its asking price. I keep coming back to this game more than any other VR game.\n\n(the skeleton spectators are ridiculous, though - I don't know what the dev was thinking)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976313504", "last_played": 1504516129, "num_reviews": 121, "num_games_owned": 721, "playtime_forever": 179}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504594169, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502059", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504594208, "recommendationid": "34751046", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "While the idea is good, I don't see why collision physics were not (properly) enabled for this game. I can solo all difficulties with rapiers by just holding them in the enemies' shields and magically I'm piercing them. Or I can just wiggle my sword like a maniac to parry and accidentaly slash the oponent. Or I can just wait until the enemies converge one over the other any I can stab 2 or 3 at the same time by letting them morph through one another. Sometimes I can knock their shields down/up with a meager jab, whereas full power block on their swords makes them somehow bypass my sword and inflict damage to me.\n\nWhile the price is only $9.99, I can't say that the game is playble enjoyably at the moment.
