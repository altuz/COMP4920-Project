I recently finished the yuri VN \u201cLove Ribbon\u201d which was a very positive experience. Love Ribbon has lovable characters, beautiful graphics, a well developed storyline and outcome. Sweet Volley High has none of the above. It was boring. The game has the illusion of giving the player the option to pursue a relationship with any of the girls, but realistically that\u2019s not true if you want a good ending. I wouldn\u2019t have minded if the character they fate you with was endearing. None of the characters are especially cute or appealing. The game really lacks character connection. It\u2019s easy to continuously lose interest and disconnect with the story while playing through.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 103, "steamid": "76561198424603157", "last_played": 1506155892, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 103}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1506156768, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514797", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506156821, "recommendationid": "35147872", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
