I played the first game and knew I'd have a similar reaction to the second, but I'd say the details caught my attention. I appreciate the effort the author had to build websites similar to those of the past just so we could have a deeper immersion. For me in particular, listening to \"Open Your Eyes\" when it came up was just great I never really stopped to listen to the song before, but doing so brought an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia, as if it had been with me throughout important moments of my life and I just didn't bother to notice before.\nObviously, the game wants you to feel nostalgic and immersed, it wants you to think you're back at that time when you could simply live a romance and enjoy your own innocence. I'd say that was well done.\n\nStill, I have some problems with it as well. First, just like the first game, it seems to be designed for a male audience only. You can put a feminine name and stuff, but some moments seem plain weird when you're acting like a girl, it messes with the immersion. Also, why not let the character interact with a male NPC? Or with someone else who isn't a possible love interest? I know that there are limitations, but doing it that way made me feel as if Evelyn was there mostly to compete with Emily for your consideration. Why love [u] has [/u] to be the main goal, as the game seems to suggest?\nAnother issue with the game, at least in my opinion, is the need of absolute consistency. I'm not a native english speaker, but I got my first (bad) ending not because I [spoiler] lied to Emily about not wanting a family, but because I interpreted it differently in each context [/spoiler], and so did my girlfriend. This [spoiler] \"I'll break up with you if anything you told her does not match what you told me\" [/spoiler] leaves no room for the player to explain. It should be harder if you messed up, but not impossible if it was just a bit. And besides, people can change their minds.\nBut I think what really bothered me was the fact that [spoiler] no matter which of them you end up with, it's about the same dialogue and reactions once you do everything right. Emily and Evelyn are quite different from each other, and that has to remain consistent [/spoiler].\n\nI think I wanted this game to go deeper, but it's not like I was expecting that in the first place.

Pfff nah man.[/b]\n\nWe all talk online nowadays as we are connected to anyone that has access to the internet and willing to talk to you or post something. When you\u2019re not with your friends in person, why not talk to them long distance so you can talk even more. This is what Emily is Away Too goes on during the years on 2006 and 2007.\n\nWe come in on our Senior year of high school and we made two key friends that we talk to during the course of the game: Emily and Evelyn. Once you setup your username and choose an avatar, it is time to hit them up. From the beginning, there is a sense of getting to know the other person and starting out as friends as conversations with both start up asking about little things like music choice. As we go on, they get more open to talk to us about their relationship troubles and ask for advice. There is a connection there that makes you want to hear them out and if they want to spill their troubles, there is a high chance you will want to be there for them.\n\nSadly, the use of having two girls to talk to, there are forced situations to make you choose one. There are situations that the game that does not want you to keep up the same kind of relationship you have with the other girl. One of the most notable ones is when both are in a vulnerable spot and want you to be there for both of them at the same time. The catch? [spoiler]They are both messaging you at the same time. Of course we must all be thinking that it is not hard to keep up two conversations, you might be able to do more with your own friends and well we were able to message them at the same time in the previous chapters, but this time we have a timer. Each time you try to juggle both conversations, the timer gets shorter and shorter till one runs out and either Emily or Evelyn gets mad at you \u201cnot being there\u201d. If you let the timer run out twice they will log off in a huff, even though you would be writing right before the timer ran out.[/spoiler]\n\nI do get what this was trying to do, but it just falls into being forced and it takes away from wanting to care about the conversation if you want to answer both of them. Especially when the responses you give are mundane. I do think this section could of been worked better, perhaps having you choose your answers carefully, not wanting them feel like you don\u2019t care or perhaps have something that you can actually mix up names. Or even be able to hook up with both and since you can easily guess they will [spoiler]meet up with each other someday since it is very obvious you three go to the same school and this plays a part in one of the endings[/spoiler]. \n\nThere is also the fact that they do overreact to seemingly small things and you can\u2019t explain yourself. They mention that it is totally okay to not have future plans set in stone and okay to change...but then you find out it\u2019s only for them. There is a situation when one of them does something out of character and say people can change, but when you change your own choices (or you interpret the different wordings of the questions differently) it is automatically set to you being a manipulative liar. No way to explain yourself as it is an automatic failure (dumping you) as early as chapter one.\n\nI often find that both seem too similar. They are fleshed out but not in a way that really separates the two. Their interests and how they talk are different, but they both have problems with another boy and both stories rely on which girl you choose and what response you told them. There are a few side characters, but they don\u2019t get any character other than knowing that they could of had any name, one time which I mixed up the names since we have no way to know who they are other than when they cause conflict with the girls. Perhaps this could of been solved with you being able to talk with these side characters yourself. There is also the fact that no matter who you end up with, both Emily and Evelyn will have the same dialogue and reaction with a few things being replaced with a choice you provided and names. \n\nIf you previously played Emily is Away, there is another huge difference that was added. Instead of being completely confined in the instant messenger window, there are a bunch of website links that were made just for this game. You will mostly get Youtube (YouToob) and Facebook (Facenook) page links during your gameplay, but there is a list of links available to see all of the websites..\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n+ Cool to see that a bunch of websites are available alongside the game\n+ Realistic writing\n+ More secret icons with few of them having secret conversations\n\n+/- Reusing text for Emily or Evelyn route\n+/- Emily/Evelyn overreacting over small things\n+/- Underdevelopment of side characters that relate to Emily/Evelyn\u2019s story\n\n- Forced sections where you have to fail\n- Some responses don\u2019t fit what you are roleplaying as (or the response changes to make it mean something else)\n\nIf you want to get more out of the free experience Emily is Away gave or interested in this way of storytelling, go ahead and try out Emily is Away Too. However, despite that this game made me want to care for both Emily and Evelyn there are a number of things that make the experience worse such as some of the force segments. Despite most of this review being criticisms, this game was enjoyable, but will overall provide a different feeling and meaning than Emily is Away. So I do also recommend playing the first Emily is Away game (it's free!).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 85, "steamid": "76561198280371208", "last_played": 1506419170, "num_reviews": 92, "num_games_owned": 379, "playtime_forever": 251}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506456645, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506121", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506456645, "recommendationid": "35229430", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "14/88 tore my soul apart", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198005576272", "last_played": 1504657766, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 181, "playtime_forever": 192}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504641252, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504641252, "recommendationid": "34763522", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "DM slidding Sim 2007", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198032632811", "last_played": 1504893637, "num_reviews": 153, "num_games_owned": 298, "playtime_forever": 209}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504806082, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504917811, "recommendationid": "34799076", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The first and the second game were awesome, i really enjoy the story!
