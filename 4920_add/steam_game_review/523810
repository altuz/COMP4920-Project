If you are a veteran of the series [spoiler] how many of us are left I... wonder[/spoiler] then this game is a must as it's a completely new experience while being nostalgic at the same time. If you are not, then this is a very good game to start as Wonder Boy is slowly coming back with both the first and the third game recently being remade as well as an official sequel planned to be released later this year.\nHowever, there are some problems I found about the game that hinder this game. First of all, as I was playing through the game the screen would occasionally spazze out for a few moments without a reason. In addition,  [spoiler] that's more of a nitpicking but anyway[/spoiler] the game does give you the ability to play as the retro 16 bit Wonder Boy but doesn't do so for the background or the music which is really a shame.\nOverall:  [spoiler] good effort, would play again 8/10 [/spoiler]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198056425588", "last_played": 1504446208, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 49, "playtime_forever": 126}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504178720, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501385", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504180092, "recommendationid": "34632294", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The controls make this game so difficult to play. I loved the original, and have clocked many many hours in it. And while I love the visuals of this game, I can't recommend it, because of the controls. They just feel lazy. When you attack, that is also your run button, so if you're in the air and you attack, you'll either go up faster, or fall faster, making it so much harder to plan for attacking enemies. If this weren't the case, and it didn't effect your jump speeds, then maybe I would be more okay with it.
