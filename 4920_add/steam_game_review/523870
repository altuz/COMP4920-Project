It's super fast paced and there's a lot of stuff going on, so it takes a while to get used to both the controls and the variety of options you have. But once you get the hang of it, it is really fun to try and beat everyone in a frantic race during lunch or a couple of quick goes after work. Funny style and look as well. Made me think back to Micro Machines and beating my friends in those races around everyday objects.

Best played with friends online using a gamepad. Both gameplay and graphics are simple at their core but beautifully polished, it's just really satisfying to play, use a power-up and beat jump to first position in the last second.\n\nFor the price of a pint of beer in London, totally worth it!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992865943", "last_played": 1497194228, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 66, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1497205764, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1497205764, "recommendationid": "32349144", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
