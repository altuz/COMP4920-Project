I'd love to say it's got a good foundation to build on but the game is so rough right now it's hard to tell.\n\nVR Graphics 5/10\nAudio 5/10\nControlls 1/10\nPerformance 3/10\nFun factor 3/10\n\n\nThis is not a diamond in the rough EA title. It's very early alpha gameplay. \n\nControls are not smoothed out and often fail to execute. (Climing, holstering, reloading, etc)\nAudio isn't that great. (overall quality)\nThe positional audio definitely needs more attention. Could not tell where sounds were coming from.\nGame balance and difficulty need adjusting and some things need a consistency pass. For example, same zombie model, same weapon, one takes 1 shot to the face and dies, the other takes 4 with no visible difference between zombies. \nReload speed is painfully slow. I could release 2-3 times manually in Onward in the time it takes to load one mag here.\n\nI wouldn't say it's worth the 19.99 or even the current sale price of 17.99. If you're looking for a game to play for fun and entertainment, I'm not sure I'd spend 1/4 that on the current iteration. Which is painful to say because I was really hoping this would be good, as you can tell by the start of the video above.\n\nIf you like being a part of an EA community and testing early builds, you may still be interested but I think for most I'd have to not recomend the game.\n\n\nHopefully DonkeyKwon can turn this around and I can update this in a few months to a much more positive review. DK was quick to answer my post when I was having issues starting the game and that seems to be consistent across the Discussion boards. He seems passionate about his game and open to suggestions which earns him my respect and I'll be cheering him on and checking in from time to time.

The game itself, while still very pre-alpha and unfinished, seems to really lack focus, especially with the design choices.

It would take more than that to grasp the controls properly. We're doing things that are different than the norm in VR. You must allow yourself time to adjust. Certainly before posting a negative review after only 20 mins! \n\nIt sounds like no matter what the game was or had or didn't have you were set on leaving a negative review for whatever personal reason. Considering the initial review you left was originally simply two sentences that stated, \"Lots wrong with game, bad song in death scene with beach ball has nothing to do with zombies\" tells us you didn't seriously play the game nor had any intentions of doing so. If your major gripe initially was the just the death scene song and extra mini games to play... then thats a pretty damn good impression of a game! \n \n I appreciate you taking the time to try and play the game, but in the future I'd suggest you stay clear of early access games in general. The controls in this game right now are VERY solid. I can preach that to you all day but I'm certain that you would find some issues grasping the controls without trying the game for longer than 20 mins.\n \n Hopefully you can calm down and open your mind up enough to try the game again and give proper feedback here and in the forums. If you choose not to do that, that's fine too, there's always office simulator for you :)\n\n-------------------------------------\n[b]As for direct responses to your \"issues\"[/b]\n\n***Low quality zombie models and texture systems***\n \n ------ already mentioned in the forums that more/better zombie models will be coming and reflect difficulty as well\n\n***Levels are pretty small and content wise not much to go on (Although it is EA)***\n\n------ actually the levels are quite large for VR, probably the largest of any game like this so far. And it's already been mentioned that more maps and larger maps are coming as well so not sure what the point of this comment really is. Most VR games have you stuck in place and what you see is the entire map. It takes 15 mins to even get to the end of the map on a standard play through of the first lone survivor area and thats only the first map!\n\n***During loading screens the game freaks out and becomes pretty dizzy***\n\n------ No on has reported this and we haven't encountered this can you please give more details on when this happens? If possible can you shadowplay a video? Would like to fix this\n\n***Strange menu system with floating balls at set distance (Not laser points or physical buttons?, other buying item systems are very unintuitive with the controls)***\n\n------ already mentioned in the forums that menu is being redone with proper graphics etc so THIS temp menu wont get much TLC as its time better spent on the game. We'll implement \"laser\" pointers since people do seem to want that. The orbs still look more elegant in my opinion :P\n\n***Buggy shooting (Guns stop firing and need to be emptied and reloaded constantly***\n\n------ this is kind of an outrageous statement. Guns stop firing when out of bullets and need to be reloaded...... uhm.. ok? Yes this is true. But no issue here... lol thats real life.\n\n***Poor animations and sounds (Guns just shoot with little indication and the muzzle flash is offcenter like 6 inches to the left of the gun) ***\n\n------ we'll take a look at the muzzle flash being off centre but... no indication? Are serious friend? There's a huge sound and its unique and accurate to the gun model. The muzzle flash as well as your hand has a finger pull trigger animation, the gun animation shows the gun cocks each shot while the trigger is pressed AND the controller vibrates! Further to this in the options you can even turn on bullet trails! Short of putting holes in your living room wall for real I dont see how much more indications we can give you! :steammocking:  Again I feel like you wanted to leave negative reviews for whatever personal reason but felt it difficult to find points to use.\n\n***Strange minigames for a zombie game (for example when you die there's really scene with bad singing and a beach ball minigame???) ***\n\n------ Yep... extra fun in the death scene area and extra games for people that don't like the survival real-time action and want to shoot and slice things still. We can't please everyone I suppose, but I honestly did not expect anyone to complain about having MORE content and extra mini games to play. I bet you tried at least twice to keep that ball up though! :steammocking: The singing is actually quite good, but maybe thats just a taste thing. But again it doesn't take away from any enjoyment of the game and considering when you first posted this was your ONLY con... I'm finding it difficult to take you seriously.\n\n***There's ads for the game, in the game itself? Maybe they ran out of textures to use***\n------ The game is in Early Access. There's lots of info on the discussions and in the news section about what this means. Please have a read. But in a nutshell we're working first on the game-play mechanics and secondly on cosmetics. If you have a business you want us to advertise for though, send us a pm and we'll talk about pricing and put your banner in :)  until we get more textures to use :P", "recommendationid": "25693327", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is headed in the right direction. though it  still has its bugs once you get used to it you want to play more and more. i will check back after each update just to see how its progressing because i want to play through entire game one day and dont want to ruin it for myself.
