The game is a bit gross at times, but still pretty awesome. At least enough to offer a near-instant recommendation after a relatively short play-through, with the Tutorial and some early rounds. Very responsive controls, and gaming that, though not too difficult thus far...still keeps one on their toes. There is fun in it, and subtle reminders of +Postal 2- type urine-as-a-weapon homage, but keeping a very fresh take on style, if 'fresh would ever come to mind in describing a gross-fest like this here game. If you like shooter/platformers with enhancements to the grotesque, this here's a no-brainer buy...at least what I can surmise in less than a half-hour in...and only doing so with the game very new, with very few reviews in...and I haven't seen one negative review at the time of my writing.
