The game is way more platforming-focused, since the bosses are a cakewalk compared to the platforming that becomes quite brutal near the end (especially when going for gold medals).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198056675549", "last_played": 1498583122, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 201, "playtime_forever": 401}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1498767853, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498767853, "recommendationid": "33008581", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you like hardcore platformers you will love this game.  It has all the basic elements you would want, tight controls, great level design, and a cool grappling hook mechanic that opens up lots of fun level designs.  It also has a cute story and well written dialogue that will make you chuckle from time to time.  \n\nThe game is divided into 4 worlds, each with 7 levels, one story segment, and a boss fight at the end.  Each individual level is further divided into several checkpoints, which is great, because even though you will die a lot you will never have to replay long sections of a level and there is literally always a check point after a tough segment.  The bosses are standard fare, you will die a few times learning their patterns but none of them are tough once you know how to dodge their attacks.  \n\nThe game took me just shy of 2 hours to beat, there are also leaderboards for time trials if you are into that sort of thing.  The game has a pretty good difficulty curve, the earlier levels teach you the skills you need to pass the later levels and other than an obscenely difficult last level, the game never feels unfair.  \n\nDefinitely worth a buy.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198116707297", "last_played": 1498275817, "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 1298, "playtime_forever": 106}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1498276712, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498276712, "recommendationid": "32709666", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
