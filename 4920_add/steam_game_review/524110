I'd love to see a group working together without the need to click on everything all the time. Moving units individually whereas in reality people would just do what they are trained to do. Sure I could pause the game and go full micromanagement, but that isn't fun to me.\n\nSo the virdict for me is, Emergency needs to not release the same game 10 times over, it's just not worth it and it makes people lose interest in the title. You need something really new with better depth and immersion to it.\n\nAn FPS game might provide this.
