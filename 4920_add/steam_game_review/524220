Game over, The End. xD\n\n10/10\n\nedit; Well, okay, maybe I should write a bit more than a thumbs up and a silly situation in the game.\n\nOne thing that really strikes out in a 3d action game is when it starts up as a side scrolling shmup. There are also transitions to side scrolling platformer, topview action and bullet dodging here and there. It's kinda funny to see more than one genre in a game, and it all seems to go pretty seamless.\n\nGame looks nice, and in the first portion of the game you'll see what generally gets thrown at you.\nSo... yeah, there's areal combat, in the form of a sidescroll shooter. When you exit the plane the close-combat fighting action starts. Ending with a giant goliath as boss.\n\nAfter that the story really kicks in. And you wake up on a space station, have to reporting for your second mission where you'll get to explore earth a bit more, meet many machine lifeforms, and uhhh... talk to them? I mean, sure you could kick all their rusty metal asses, but apparently not all of them want to fight. There's plenty of quests to do here'n there.\nWith a nice upgrade, you can also kick back and catch some fish using your Pod.\n\nAnd yes, you can die from eating a mackerel, apparently andriod bodies aren't human bodies. lol. I rather enjoy the numerous details in the game. Running like the wind, and stumbling over a rock or uneven surface. Also the mess some of the bots make from ancient civilisation. Even the music has some nice detail to it, fading out starts with the vocals when you're near exits of areas. The music also changes to an x-bit version when you initiate a hack.\n\nWhen you defeat the Eve boss, the game goes to a credit roll, but when you continue from save, you start the story again from 9S's shoes instead of 2B. \nThis gives a different intro, starting from his position, and there's some added scenes from the minor bosses. Gives a nice addition to the story, and a good reason to continue on.\nWith 9S you get the hacking ability at the cost of heavy attacks. But you can take over enemies with it, so that's even better.\n\nAgain after Eve and a credit roll later, you can continue the game again, and now the story moves on to the next part; An all out war against the machines, storywise things become quite a bit darker. And enemies become a bit harder too.\nRather than just sticking to 1 protagonist for the rest of the game, you'll switch back and forth between them.\n\nWhen you finish the game entirely, you get a chapter select and a few extra's.\nThere's also mutliple endings to make it worthwhile revisting the game.\n\n\nConsidering some negative reviews because of technical difficulties, I should probably add that I've had zero issues on my configuration; AMD hardware with Windows 7.\nKind of sucks it doesn't have a demo to give it a good testrun, so try it as soon as you buy it, and ask for a refund if you have too much issues.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010287383", "last_played": 1505485798, "num_reviews": 106, "num_games_owned": 2279, "playtime_forever": 2509}, "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_created": 1505008936, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527034", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1505996630, "recommendationid": "34851083", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The bad pc port makes it hard for me to like this game.\n\nI came back to this game recently to see if the port improve, sadly it didnt.
