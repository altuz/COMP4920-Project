Making it only usable for 4 people will hinder the ability for people to play as well has not being able to go online with it. The game has a nice design but it doesn't tell you how to move or what button is even start (its space if youre wondering but when you try to start a level it is 'u') and the cute art does not but any circumstance make up for the inablity to play. The description makes it seem as though it is an rpg and sadly it is not (not that only being able to have 4 players would make much sense for an rpg anyway :/) it is a fighting game like Smash bros or Brawlhalla but I couldn't figure out how to win even when I destroyed all the characters using one, and then using two, I could not test for any more as I did not find out how to move the other two. With only one action command the fight is limited and with no speed difference it comes down to tactic so. .-. If this game is changed to explain controls and make the game easier to use it could be successful, add some lore, a plot, explanation, something. Throw me a bone to keep my interest, I can't really play this game because I have one person whom I /could/ play with, 2 more in the same space using the same keyboard is not the best idea. I can see that this game had effort put into it. Rather a lot by the description and the art, the fightin concepts to win are also new and interesting. It adds a nice change to things. Make the game online acessable, make it so you can change the number of players, some of the keyboard commands and give some lore and this game is golden.
