Yes. Did I enjoy it, not really. Th biggest problem was that there were no actual choices, just guesses as to what would be most successful. Second biggest problem, WALLS OF TEXT EVERYWHERE!!!!! Seriously, there seemed to be about ten paragraphs worth of text between choices after chapter 3. Chapters 1 and 2 are fun because you are actually making choices frequently, but because I wanted to make choices more than reading, I found less to enjoy about this book.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198037101281", "last_played": 1498179688, "num_reviews": 46, "num_games_owned": 202, "playtime_forever": 465}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500165757, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499952", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500165757, "recommendationid": "33573426", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
