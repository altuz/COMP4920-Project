Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force is like an enhanced version of Fairy Fencer F but with more contents. The amount of storyline gets tripled and has numerous of endings. The combat system is same as always but you're able to add up to 6 characters in your party! However, all of the enemies have higher stats just for this occasion, some were too OP. The soundtrack is really incredible especially the songs from the ending of each routes. The story is somewhat predictable but it didn\u2019t bother me too much. Overall Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force is an excellent game with solid improvement over the original game that other JRPG fans will enjoy.

Today\u2019s enemy may be tomorrow\u2019s ally and it rarely feels forced.\n+Like many JRPGs this game introduces a ton of odd-and-ends sub-systems, but most are actually useful and intuitive!!\n+Unlike other games from Compile Heart/Idea Factory, fan service is at relatively low cringe levels. There are comparatively few moments you would feel embarrassed playing.\n+NewGame+ allows you to pick and choose what to carry over. Everything but items? Just levels, gold, characters? Mix and match!\n+You can quickly skip through cutscenes and battle animations if you wish.\n+Music is consistently excellent.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-While the artwork is nice, the graphics and some animations are pretty dated.\n-Some of the achievements are grindy.\n-Writing in some of the alternate ending paths isn\u2019t up to par compared to the main story line.\n\n[b]Meh:[/b]\n=English voiceacting is inconsistent; thankfully there is a Japanese option.\n=There is some end-game content/free DLC but I didn\u2019t feel much need to dive in after beating all of the story lines and getting all achievements.\n\n[b]Overall, FFF[/b] is a fun game and really seems like Compile Heart/Idea Factory are trying their hand at crafting a more mainstream experience.

That said, if you liked the origional, you wil like this one.\n\nPros:\n-Expands on the origional and changes a few things up.  Generally makes the product overall better.\n\nNuetral:\n-DLC content can make the game overly easy.\n\nCons:\n-I think 50 is a bit overpriced, wait for a sale.\n-They redid the graphics to add bloom to a lot of stages; personally I hate the effect and thought the origional graphics looked cleaner and sharper.\n-Had a graphics glitch that caused something like a controller command tutorial to appear on half the screen ocasionally during cut scences.

(They should stop selling the original and point people to this one IMO, since you cannot simply upgrade to this as they consider this a separate game...).\n\n- While the characters are cliched/typical JRPG in nature, our group of heroes does compliment each other nicely and make them likable.  It does a good job of pitching contrasting element against each other, like Fang's anti-hero nature vs. Sherman's \"pure/perfect\" hero mold.\n- Story is fairly well done... they raises and speak to various what if scenarios.\n- English translation is fairly well done... but just stick to the Japanse voice acting (There is full English voice, but I couldn't stand it for more than 1 minute).\n\nOverall, game is fairly enjoyable and fulfilling.  New game+ is also fairly well implemented.  \n\nMost grindy part of the game is maxing out personal challenges (e.g. use each character's unique ability 200 times, or persued a launch enemy 10,000 times, trigger an avalanche attack 5000 times, etc.).  Fortunately this is completely optional/no impact to story/no real need to max it all, as its purpose is only to help increase the characters' stat.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035230266", "last_played": 1505785093, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 63, "playtime_forever": 20921}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505455195, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505455195, "recommendationid": "34965104", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "CAUTION WRITTEN IN CAPS:\n\nDESPITE THE \"FIX\" PROVIDED by developer alot of users, including me STILL CAN'T START THE GAME, LOOK AT MY PLAYTIME.
