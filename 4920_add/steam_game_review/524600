I mention this because Briar Rose is well done, but has a few more flaws than the others.  I highly recommend playing it, however.\n\nPROS:\n+ story\n+ art\n+ music\n+ generally nice puzzles\n+ flows into the next game in the series\n\nCONS:\n- no trading cards and no achievements (if those are of interest)\n- the hidden object pages themselve seem almost too challenging at times and seem to rely a little too much on small pieces and hard-to-see colours than one clver placement (that said, the hint button works just fine!)\n- the \"morphing objects\" are really, really hard to find in many of the scenes (but you don't *need* to find them, so it's not bad\n- no quick travel between rooms and the map/movement is a little confusing\n\nOVERALL:\n* Despite the cons, this is a fun HOG/casual puzzle game and I definitely recommend it, especially as it is the first in the series and leads into the next game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198033388937", "last_played": 1501972363, "num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 370, "playtime_forever": 598}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502322214, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502322214, "recommendationid": "34135419", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
