It's worth it, just to support those guys.\n\n\n[h1]Playtime[/h1]\nIt took me 7.5 hours to complete it on the first difficulty. You could probably do it in 3h, but I got killed a lot.\nA second difficulty level is unlocked after that and there is one more to look forward to. I didn't play them.\n\n\n[h1]Comparison[/h1]\nIt's a hack&slash game, but don't think [b]Diablo[/b]. You visit one room/arena at a time, sort of like [b]Dungeon of the Endless[/b], but you're in control - you decide who and how to attack.\n\n\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\nThe story is set in Indian mythology. \nA king wanted to make a blood sacrifice to the Gods so he burned an innocent kid at the stake. The kid didn't die and was given special abilities by other beings (Rakshasa Lords). He turned into Asura (Demon) so he could get revenge on the king.\nYou have to go through five fortresses that were raised to stop you. Each one has an elite warrior (Maha-Yodha) protecting it. After you defeat one you get access to the next fortress and the king awaits in the last one. After you defeat the king, you unlock the next difficulty level and repeat the same thing all over again.\n\n\n[h1]Look...[/h1]\nIt looks very well for an indie game (no pun intended). The rooms/arenas are relatively simple, but if you take the time to look at the buildings in the background, you'll notice some great artwork. \nThe visual effects, the animations, everything looks really good.\nOne area that I didn't like that much is the UI, especially the inventory. The circle where you level-up and pick abilities looks good, but the one where you switch weapons does not. \n\n\n[h1]... and Feel[/h1]\nI played with a controller and it was a good choice. It felt natural to move around, roll and use different types of attacks. Aiming at enemies was simple enough (it's assisted), but when I tried to shoot arrows at some fire pits it wasn't as straightforward. \nThe menus were a different story - even the nicely looking one for abilities was erratic to navigate, not behaving as expected. I mean it's round and your analog stick can do round moves, yet it only moved from one ability to another and not based on the left-right and up-down movements in relation to the center.\n\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nVery good soundtrack, matching the Indian mythology theme. You can check it out on the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9OAAnnzVkM]official Ogre Head Studio's YouTube channel[/url].\nOne thing worth noting is that the game doesn't have an English voice-over, just subtitles. That's not a big deal, there's not much talking anyway, only in videos (about three of them). \n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nYou mostly run around killing enemies. But, with each enemy killed, you can choose whether you want to get experience [b]or[/b] loot. Progress your character or get more gold - that's not a simple choice.\nThe fighting areas are usually small, like rooms or chambers. Most of the time there's 2-4 enemies in a room. You get bigger arenas when you progress in the game, with 8-10 enemies in them. They're usually both ranged and melee enemies and there's an interesting twist to that - you do more damage to ranged enemies with your melee weapon and more damage to melee enemies with your ranged weapon.\nSo you run, kill, get new abilities and find/buy/craft new equipment. Once you kill everyone (or even before that) you fight the boss and move on to the next level. Do that five times and you start over on a higher difficulty level.\nThe official game description says it features \"heavy rogue-like elements\" and that's true. When you die, you lose everything. Everything. All abilities, all items, all gold, all experience. You then start again and the map is different and so is your ability tree. The only things that are kept between gameplays are the unlocked difficulty levels and characters - there are 4 of them, only one unlocked at the start. When you get the 4 main abilities in one ability tree unlocked during one play-through (7 level-ups required), you unlock a new character. They have different stats, base skills and starting equipment.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe first impression was great, I started to like this game straight away. Then I died a bunch of times on the easy difficulty (n00b), so I stopped liking it. But I still wanted to play more, so I did, and I started to like it again. \nIt's worth giving it a chance if you're into hack&slash games and you want to try something new. It doesn't take as much time as the likes of Diablo, you can literally complete the first level in 5 minutes. The further you go, the longer the levels get, but if you get the hang of it you could probably get to the final boss in less than 3 hours. \nIt's simple, it's fresh and it's got that something that makes you want to come back and play a little bit more.\n\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n- original Indian setting\n- hard choice between experience and gold\n- good soundtrack\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- progression could be more rogue-lite, not rogue-like\n- the UI (menus, inventory, ability tree)\n- levels, especially the first ones, could be a little bit bigger/longer", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198005127626", "last_played": 1501963542, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 1168, "playtime_forever": 455}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1504898511, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509421", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504898906, "recommendationid": "34821381", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A fun rogue-ish RPG.\n\nCombat is not what I thought, but ended up being better.

After that its just endless restarts upon restarts because of the \"unique procedural skill tree\".\n\nEvery new game you get a new skill tree, but there is no system, layers, tiers, groups, whatever, to differentiate passive skills from active. Or late game skills from early game skills. So what happens almost every new game is a skill tree that is completely unplayable. \n\nYou might get a really nice starting skill to build either a melee or ranged character, but I guarantee it won\u00b4t synergise with more then one or two other skills. And good luck getting a weapon to match. Good luck getting anything other then complete randomness at every turn.\n\nMy 5 hours of gameplay has given me 3 runs where things kinda worked out nicely. Not a single run where I felt overpowered for even a single room, or floor (first floor dosen\u00b4t count). Cant count the number of restarts. The constant feeling of underpowered due to randomness is a real fun-killer.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 279, "steamid": "76561198038550728", "last_played": 1506460730, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_forever": 314}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506254358, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497822", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506254358, "recommendationid": "35178905", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
