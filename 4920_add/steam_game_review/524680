It's basically a top-down, twin-stick shooter.  It runs great.  The animations and gameplay are good.  Better than some of these other reviewers are saying.  It's a fun game and you get to kill freaking NAZI'S! lol  I've played a lot wosre games for a lot more money!  I am happy with my purchase!\n\n\nEDIT: The developer just fixed some problems with the game and it now plays in full screen and support my PS4 controller!  TY so much Cronenberg!!!

These are game-breaking issues for me.  I feel like the real challenge of the game is figuring out how to proceed despite glaring technical issues that get you killed.
