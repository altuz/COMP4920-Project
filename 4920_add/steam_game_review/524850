The story is the game's strongest point. It's quite compelling and has the flavor of some other \"fairy tale gone dark\" games like Kingdom Hearts. Yes, that might sound like a strange comparison, but starting from the amnesia ridden protagonist, through the booming orchestral musical soundtrack, to the addition to references to other fairytales (Snow White and Hansel & Gretel, to name a few..) and the discussion on \"what's one's soul contain?\", it really seems the two games are rather similar.\nAlicemare is quite short and light on features, though, and while it uses an RPG engine, there's no combat or character progression. There is an inventory and it purely serves the purpose of the completion of puzzles. The game does have multiple endings though, so the story can be seen from multiple angles.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198073882231", "last_played": 1504738353, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 374, "playtime_forever": 588}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504740523, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504740523, "recommendationid": "34784967", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Absolutely loved this game.
