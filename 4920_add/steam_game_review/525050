The game is well organized and a little repetitive, but it's required to build up on stats and practically every game is repetitive so I guess it's to be expected. I love the art and the music (it's very cute), and the story was also well thought-out. The format of the game is similar to an otome game, but the purpose isn't as romance-driven and you are given a little more control over the character's life.

Working at night gives you a \"Midnight Oil\" buff which really fills up the progress bar a lot. But the trade off for that is a really high stress gain and the pretty much 90% chance of getting sick if you don't spend the following day sleeping for 24 hours. And if you get sick, you're forced to sleep in anyway. It's a really decent trade off that makes you think twice about pulling off those oh so useful all nighters but sometimes the punishments get annoying, especially since there's no way to subvert it (like unlocking a dress that allows for it or at least lessens the stress gain from not sleeping. if there is one, i have not seen it). \n\nThe social stats and friendship candidates are really interesting. It's pretty diverse in its choices though I wish you had a second female choice rather than just one with two male choices.\n\nOverall, it's really good for the price and general experience of the dev.
