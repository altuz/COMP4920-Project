Not to mention there is absolutley nothing different from 2012, except issues and debate dates. I suggest the Political Machine 2016 over this (it's a better version of the 2016 race and has more real candidates than this game) if you are a political buff I recommend President Infinity by 270soft or Prime Minister Infinity. It is fun to play once if you never played the 2012 version and that's it. It does have 3rd parties but no primaries. It does have all 3 debates but it's responses are limited and they say the same exact thing for each topic, which easily gets real boring fast. Whoever is the voice for Donald Trump is terrible. Yet again the price is double what it should be (that's what Eversim does) All in all I give it a 1.5/10. Should you buy it?

I expected to buy it, play it for a bit, and see if it's really worth a recommendation. I definitely did not expect to find the \"[i]The Room[/i]\" of election simulators. A game so poorly made, and so blissfully unaware of how godawful it is, that its many failures become entertaining. Sometimes.\n\nEversim is infamous for its ridiculous animated interludes. They are absolutely obsessed with the concept of having these horrifying and ugly 3D models talk to the screen when performing even basic actions. Every speech, rally, debate, and most pieces of news are done this way. It's absurd and pointless, and sometimes nightmarish.\n\nIt's not just the graphics that suffer, though. The voice acting is just terrible. It sounds like every voice actor is auditioning to be in the next [i]Birdemic[/i] movie rather than trying to portray world leaders. Every accent and style is so stiff and forced (if it's even attempted at all) that it's sometimes difficult not to laugh. You can even tell in some places where the actors stumbled over their lines and didn't correct it.\n\nUnlike the infamous \"so-bad-it's-good\" films, though, this gets boring quickly. There is something oddly mesmerizing about it, though - it's like studying every detail of the floor tiles while being held in detention. I can't recommend this game at all, especially not for $10. Looking through the forums, it seems the main reason people don't buy this is that they don't understand American politics.
