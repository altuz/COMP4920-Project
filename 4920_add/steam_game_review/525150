To spice things up you have one of eventually six pets to choose that do damage and a special ability (stun, steal resources, etc) or can be sent into battle with your robots, and up to 3 special abilities chosen from the list you have accumulated (about seven in all I think), with options such as mines, heals, slow down time, etc.\n\nIt gets fairly hectic at times, especially on the levels where you are running from some huge enemy and instant death scrap flies across the screen with little warning. Overall the difficulty is mostly moderately easy, although there are a couple of levels where you might not get 3 stars at first, but you can come back later when you have more pets/skills and have levelled up your skills more, and have an easier time of it if you get really stumped. \n\nThere was one level I found much harder than the rest (about level 11?) and took several attempts to even win, let alone 3* it, even the final level against the cat with 9 lives, and thus you have to do nine times as much damage as he does to get three stars, I did first time. Most of the losses come in the runner levels when getting too distracted to see the scrap coming and move out of the way in time.\n\nThe story is fairly light, and not particularly well translated to English, but the main thing here is the gameplay which is pretty good, so it is fairly easy to recommend this one.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971341065", "last_played": 1494799529, "num_reviews": 94, "num_games_owned": 2716, "playtime_forever": 581}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1495120369, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507202", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1495128634, "recommendationid": "31823320", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very interesting game, great gameplay, I recommend it to all who want to experience something new!
