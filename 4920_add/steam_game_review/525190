I have managed to get to about 80% of the main storyline I guess, I'm at the level right after the second boss battle. So far I would rate this game 7/10.\n\nI can recommend this game if:\n- You like these type of action-adventure-avoider classic games\n- You like retro like games\n- You like indie games\n\nThe graphics are quite fine to a small indie game, and the gameplay is also decent for those who like these type of games. The storyline is sometimes a bit tricky to figure out, but it get's much more clearer towards the end and once you get it you will love it, its really creative. The levels are challenging so this is no casual game at all, but I repeat if you like this genre it should be no problem, if not then do not buy.\n\nI have experienced no gameplay or enjoyment affecting bugs whatsoever, but there seems to be a minor bug regarding steam achievements, as sometimes you don't get them, sometimes you only get them when you exit to the main menu, and sometimes they are shown, sometimes not.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198330711697", "last_played": 1473933524, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 125}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1473934048, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491601", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1473934048, "recommendationid": "25508885", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Its a good game but it could be longer.\nAlso there are some glitches but nothing game breaking.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198105652546", "last_played": 1482995508, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 70, "playtime_forever": 187}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1475091280, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487246", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1475091280, "recommendationid": "25745009", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "these people managed to fuck up asteroids controls. the most basic control scheme in the world, which even i know how to make, and they fucked it up. if you brush along a wall you will turn to face it and then become stuck, like a dart trapped in an enormous dartboard if the dartboard was a space station and the dart was an indicator of how badly made this game was, or something like that, this analogy kind of got away from me but whatever it controls horribly and has awful weird inertia which makes navigating the instant death mazes they mistook for good level design tedious rather than difficult. tedious is not a good word to associate with your game!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198015075204", "last_played": 1473692736, "num_reviews": 344, "num_games_owned": 1358, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_created": 1473692872, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1473777354, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484370", "votes_down": 23, "timestamp_updated": 1473692872, "developer_response": "Thank you for your feedback.
