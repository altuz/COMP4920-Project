So far it is basically just sneaking down hallways and listening for goblins. You then distract them by throwing a ball and shoot them with a well-aimed arrow if they don't see you, and panic if they do.\n\nPros:\n-Light arrows look AWESOME, although they could use a unique sound effect maybe\n-Lighting design is creepy and effective\n-Kills feel satisfying\n-General scary feeling of not knowing what's around every corner.\n\nCons:\n-Only a couple enemy designs\n-You can hear enemies walking around when they are on the other side of walls\n-Slain enemies make a noise every minute or so while just laying there, which is terrifying when listening closely for nearby goblins.\n\nOverall: there are a few bugs and simple designs that should be worked out in future updates, but the game has a lot of potential and is still creepy fun nonetheless.

What I mean by that is that the game has it's pros and cons, but, to me, seems largely unfinished.\n\nPros:\n+ Strong dungeon-crawler-like atmosphere\n+ EXCELLENT lighting\n+ Good looking textures\n+ Stealth focused gameplay\n\nCons\n- Only two enemy types\n- Bow aiming is difficult\n- Hard to get the \"distraction orb\" to go exactly where you want it\n- Stealth doesn't always feel as \"accurate\" as it should be\n- Gets repetitive rather quickly\n- Despite it's strong dungeon atmosphere, it lacks \"scenery\" to make it feel life-like.  What I mean is it doesn't feel lived in.  These goblins are patroling empty corridors.  It would be interesting to see living quarters, a dining hall, a weapons storage room, torture chamber, etc.\n\nSo the game itself has a lot of things going for it in terms of it's visuals and direction but, in my opinion, needs several tweaks and additional content to justify a purchase.  Especially since I got bored rather quickly, I feel the game needs another dynamic to keep the game interesting (maybe traps, additional weapons, additonal enemies, abilities, etc).  \n\nIs the game worth it? That's up to you.  \nIf you think you can enjoy the game as it is, without caring about if future content gets added or not; then yes the game is meant for you.  \nIf you think the game could benefit from more \"depth\" and content then I would wait to see what the future holds.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009585222", "last_played": 1480541383, "num_reviews": 69, "num_games_owned": 193, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_created": 1480543563, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514414", "votes_down": 16, "timestamp_updated": 1480543563, "recommendationid": "28107972", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I think that the motion controllers on the Vive are perfectly suited for 'Bow and Arrow' games and while there are a wealth of them, this is one of the better ones, even in early access.\n\nThe game still needs some variety but what is there is quite solid...

The game is about escaping the dungeon by hiding, sneaking and trying to avoid detection from the evil and strong dungeon goblins and creatures. You are trapped in the deepest dungeon, with only a bow and shining arrows, and creatures are guarding the creepy place behind every corner! Besides the bow and light-up arrows, you also have the ability to fool the creatures by throwing light-balls to distract them. \n\nNock: Hidden Arrow is truly a beautiful looking game with amazing graphics, full HTC Vive roomscale support, motion controller tracking and the gameplay is just so immersive and intense!
