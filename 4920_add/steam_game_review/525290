The aesthetic. \nThe idea of rats waging medieval war on each other via tunnel system is amazing. I love everything about that.\n\n2. The art. \nIt's not a materpiece, but the spites look good and it looks like a lot of work went into them.\n\n3. The music. \nI didn't listen intently, but there are 7 tracks. I don't have strong opinions about music, but they are functional. They seemed to fit the theme quite well and I thought they sounded good.\n\n4. The price.\nAt this point the game is early access. It certainly isn't complete but the bones are there and assuming the game gets finished, $5 is a steal.\n\n\n\nWhat could use some improvement:\n\n1. The UI.\nThe game has a very Dwarf Fortress feel to it, especially in that commands are given via menu for the most part, but it also shares a similar learning curve. When you hover over an option, a description is shown in the top dialogue box, however that description isn't always clear and you're left not knowing what a lot of buttons do. Building workshops is easy enough, but whether or not they cost anything isn't clear. Resources seem to be spent or created at regular intervals, however there is no timer or window to see where your resources are going or coming from. I was out of food at one point, so I began producing it as fast as possible to no avail. I figured out that I needed additional storage rooms, but nothing indicated that to me.\n\n2. The combat.\nBuilding hordes took some trial and error. There is a helpful menu for creating unit types but I didn't see why not to max the stats of every unit besides a bit of a cost increase. Resources seem unlimited provided you wait for them. \nThere is also mention of \"unit type\" which isn't explained. I think it's for creating your own templates, but they have pre-assigned images which makes me think their type implies something about them. Weapon and armor choices don't feel meaningful, but I might attribute that to my lack of experience. \nMoving hordes didn't seem to actually work. The only options that made them move were \"attack the enemy king\" and \"go home\". I have since figured out how to move hordes.\n\n\n\nThings I liked but could also use improvement:\n\n1. Trading.\nI like the idea of trading and it really helped me out a few times, but I think it would be better if I knew who I was trading with and if I couldn't trade whenever I wanted to. As it is now, you can trade any resource for any other resource if you wait for the trader's inventory to change every couple of minutes, essentially giving you 4 kinds of currency. I would like it more if either coins were the only currency and you had to buy or sell from the trader or if there was a bartering system where you made an offer and the trader made a counter offer.\n\n2. Color palettes.\nI love that there are pre-made color palettes and they look really good. There are several color palettes that are blank white. I didn't look at it too long, but I think those are for making your own. It might be better if player-made palettes are listed seperately from the rest in the interest of removing those blank ones.\n\n\n\nPotential bugs:\n\n1. Digging/Building.\nApparently there are 3-ish undefined \"lanes\" in which you can build structures. I don't know if that was intended, but I think it would be better if you could build wherever you wanted.\n\n2. Unit action.\nIt might be a bug or user error, but sometimes seemingly randomly, one of my miners would just walk over to the enemy base and get himself killed. I couldn't figure out if there was a way to tell him to stop. He would even dig through walls to get there if he had to.\n\n3. Glitched walls.\nThis only ever happened with a single wall, but I could not tell my miners to get rid of it. I just had to build around it.\n\n4. Horde movement.\nSometimes units get temporarily stuck on each other in tight areas and take a while to move.\n\n\n\nSummary:\n\nOverall I think this game has amazing potential. I wish it didn't have as steep of a learning curve as it does. I think it would benefit greatly from a soft tutorial. Maybe introduce buildings over time as they become necessary rather than having everything available from the start. The game is listed as strategy, which seemed absent. I just built some hordes and sent them in to claim victory with very little resistance and was never attacked while I built up my own base. I was very much hoping to explore the pre-existing caves to find neutral monsters and loot that would give me an advantage over the enemy. I wish there was a way to achieve smaller victories without completely steamrolling the enemy in a single battle. I look forward to playing more of this game with more updates and hope that the community gets behind this one because it could be a real gem if we give the devs enough support.\n\nEdit: After playing a few more skirmishes, I realized what happened to me the first time was not common. Enemies did attack me in my base and I had difficulty taking the enemy base (Actually I was defeated).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024125122", "last_played": 1474354997, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 523, "playtime_forever": 134}, "votes_up": 31, "timestamp_created": 1474350655, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560413", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1474378577, "recommendationid": "25598814", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I got this game because I got a 33% off coupon when I crafted a badge for a different game. I liked the idea & decided to spend $0.66 on the game. Unfortunately, there are issues that kept me from enjoying the game.\n\nThe game has no tutorial & no direction other than to kill the enemy king. After you have figured out the basic controls for the game you then have to deal with the overwhelming task of setting up a defense before the enemy king sends his army after you. There are no building or unit descriptions forcing the player to aimlessly build until their resources are depleted.

Basically you command an army of rats and must kill the enemy army. You have to build your base, gather resources and train your troops, in pure RTS style. The aesthetic is amazing and you can create your own palette! The game is very fun!\n\nWhen you play it the first time, you may be confused, because there is no tutorial at the moment, only a help text that you can open pressing \"f1\" that teaches you the basics of the game. It would be good to have a tutorial. Also, once you have understood how the game works, it becomes quite easy (iron weapons and armors are really strong, they kill enemies very fast, protect from a lot of damage, and the AI use them rarely). I would like to have a more challenging AI, maybe on different levels (easy, normal, hard...). But the feature i REALLY would like to see in this game is the multiplayer. I think it would be amazing to play this game with friends or strangers and see all the rats killing each other!\n\nThat said, I think this game is very well-made, and the creator is talented and very kind. He responds to all messages and is open to suggestions. It's really worth 1 euro/dollar, at least at the moment, if other features, like multiplayer, will be added in future, I think it can be sold for more!\nGive it a try. It deserves it!\n\nP.S.\nThis is my first review in English.

Whats in currently (A Skirmish mode on a large randomly generated map between two rat kingdoms) is extremely enjoyable. I can only hope this is built upon and expanded. \n\nThe concept of the game is something i find to be rather unique and pretty awesome. The atmosphere of being underground is very much built through the games visual style and soundtrack- the former being customisible to a ridiculous degree as you can pretty much change every colour and shade to how you'd like the game to be portrayed. Small touches added to this, like the zone of light around your cursor that contrasts with the dark, and the fact that the level of darkness can be customized to the point that the small zone around your cursor is all you can see, lends to a very visually pleasing and 'real' experience (This is my view though, i quite like to get properly immersed in what i'm playing!).\n\nThe lack of direct control too is something i feel is a pretty good direction, you give overall 'comamnds' and let the wee rats go about their business fulfilling them. Not only does this make for some very interesting gameplay, but also gives a sense of how i'd imagine a rat colony to function (lots of scurrying). \n\nThe ability to customize your soldiers in armour and arms is awesome, as is the use of both range and melee weapons. Its small touches of detail like this that make this title shine. The economy aspect is also pretty nice, being complex but easy to get to grips with (a lot of resources, but a simpligied hands-off means of collection). \n\nI've by no means got to grips with this game yet (Indeed i get getting absolutely trounced by the AI- another positive being its difficulty and ability to fight effectively against a player) and look forward to getting back to trying to get my first victory.\n\nThings i would like to see improved upon would be the ability to perhaps have more than two kingdoms fight it out on a map, as well as more content (maybe a campaign or a few different game modes?). Basically just MOAR! :).\n\nWould thourghly recommend.
