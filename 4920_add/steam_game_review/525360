A beautiful 2D platformer game.\n( DONT PLAY THIS GAME IN OFFLINE MODE idk why steam won't update your achievement )\n\nPRO:\ndifficult is on point from easy to hard , control is nice, great ART, smoth action\n\nCON:\nmusic sucks.... sometime level design can be .... weird. ( Like you don't have a sense of achievement through the whole playthrough . sometime you discover a hidden level (super hard to beat) and after you beat the level the game rewards you nothing.... NOTHING!) \n\nOverall this game is 100% worth it's price. try it if you liked meat boy or other non action 2D platformer   (PS the action tag... why? where is the action?? jumping?)\n\n\n\n8/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173892127", "last_played": 1493972016, "num_reviews": 68, "num_games_owned": 754, "playtime_forever": 37}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1493988707, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513577", "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1493988707, "recommendationid": "31558466", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Shio is a difficult and innovative 2D platformer that will satisfy platformer fans who enjoy a more challenging experience.
