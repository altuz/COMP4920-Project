Has everything we could hope for; It's free, it has a real cause into it, and it's extremely fun to play. A simple 2.5D shooter that isn't pretentious, but fails on one simple aspect; Doesn't respect your time.\n\nI can't and I won't talk about the graphics, because we all know they're simple but very colorful. The gameplay is basic but has a few politicians to play with. No special moves per character though.\n\nThe game gives you 9 lives to start with. This means you can die 9 times in a level, but if you have hearts (up to three) you can avoid death. The checkpoints are actually really well placed, but even if you waste all your lives, it means the level start again.\nThis was very common in the old classic games, but guess what? Video games moved on. We came a  long way in this industry to still be attached to the most frustrating thing ever. Repeating a level must always be an option, this rule is essential to me, in any video-game. Therefore, my review could never be positive.\nIt is not a matter of difficulty, but of honor. Concepts, stories, and gameplay can be inspired by the past, but to bring back mechanics worthy of an arcade machine is not my ideal of a good time!\n\nWith unlimited lives per level, I might have put in the time to finish the game. I'm sure any hardcore fan of arcade games can learn to enjoy Gobernators, and have a great time.\n4/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198158196956", "last_played": 1485305996, "num_reviews": 45, "num_games_owned": 886, "playtime_forever": 77}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1485307743, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485307743, "recommendationid": "29473850", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
