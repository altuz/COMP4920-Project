Do not let that rating deter you from giving this game a shot, from my understanding when this game was released there were several bugs, such as maps that didnt work, save points which randomnly teleported you around the map, unfinished textures and other graphical bugs.  If I played the game in that state I probably would have given this game a negative review also, but all of these features have been fixed in the latest version.\n\nThe game itself is a standard metroidvania, but a very well done metroidvania.  Like most games of this type you have a decently sized map to explore and as you traverse the map you acqurie new abilities that help you access new areas.  You have some standard stuff like a double jump and the ability to breathe underwater, and a few unique items like spears which are a ranged weapon but can also be stuck to walls to be used as platforms.  \n\nExploring the world is fun, you are always finding new upgrades and new combat moves which keeps things fresh, your character moves fast, the animation is fluid, and the controls are perfect.  Your character and his weapons look awesome and the world is varied with a wide variety of enemy types to fight.  You also get a some moves that are used with street fighter style inputs which I had a lot of fun with.   There are a total of 4 bosses, all of which are fun to fight and present a nice challenge.\n\nThe game took me about 3 hours to beat, and I had an absolute blast playing it.  The combat is fun, the platforming is fast and precise, and the exploration is very rewarding.  If you are a fan of metroidvanias/hack and slash games there is no reason not to buy it, at full price it is $5 which is a steal.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 173, "steamid": "76561198116707297", "last_played": 1506742730, "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 1298, "playtime_forever": 173}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506743690, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502724", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506743690, "recommendationid": "35321861", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I haven't beaten the final boss yet because im a scrub, but i must recommend this game.
