All in the name of honest journalism, he tells himself. The public needs to be informed, he tells himself. \n\n   Fucking wannabe martyrs...\n\n   In all fairness, this is an interesting premise. Done with an appalling lack of effort, and an equal lack of talent. The dev should, in future, consider selling his perfectly good ideas to others, or at the very least NOT ASK MONEY to get \"feedback\" on his hastily whipped-up tech demos. \n\n   Oh, and for anyone tempted to write \"this seems more like a Flash game than something which should be on Steam\"...the game opens in something called Macromedia Flash Player 7, so there's really no need for you to surmise. It IS a Flash game, and graciously makes no bones about it. Case solved.\n\n   Basically it's an interactive novel, lasting barely three minutes, with a tiny bit of motion added to its jaw-droppingly ugly graphics. The uber-primitive, buzzing synth score is kinda charming, though.\n\nVerdict: 2/10 (1 point for the premise, 1 point for the soundtrack).\n\n(PS I can only assume I got the \"good ending\" when I chose to ignore my wife's pleas to wake up, found my family being stabbed to death once I did manage to drag my ass out of bed, then decided to flee the scene with the word \"COWARD\" badgering me on-screen. That IS the good ending, right?)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198048974498", "last_played": 1475507882, "num_reviews": 429, "num_games_owned": 1513, "playtime_forever": 46}, "votes_up": 32, "timestamp_created": 1475505037, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548383", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1475510426, "recommendationid": "25839102", "votes_funny": 14, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A 5 min game.
