The bold minimalist visual-style is what initially drew me in, and I was further excited by the reversed progression system.  I found myself very disappointed.\n\nFirstly, the core gameplay is very slow.  The character moves slowly, the environments are large (mostly empty), and every attack the player-character makes lags horribly after the button press.  One must wonder what the point is of having the player-character telegraph it's attacks so much.  Don't get me wrong, slow gameplay is not an inherently bad trait, but I find it almost unforgivable in an action game.\n\nIt's also unnecessarely punishing.  The checkpoints are few and far between, meaning death sets you back substantially.   This serves to slow the game down further.  Additionally, you lose max health on respawn.  It can be gained back fairly easily by farming enemies and returning to the checkpoint to refill your health.  This, however, serves to slow the game down further.  When you are hit in combat, you are stunned and lose stanima (which is used to perform combat actions).  These both, of course, serve to slow the game down further.\n\nOn a completely unrelated note:  why is there even a jump button at all?  There's effectively no platforming in the entire game, and the jump is pathetic.  It doesn't speed you up, it's not high enough to jump over enemies, and it costs you stamina (which seems ridiculous considering how useless it is).  Your hitbox is also complete garbage.  When you're moving, it juts out past your face.\n\nUltimately:  Some cool ideas, an awesome visual style, but a frustrating and often dull experience.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042956737", "last_played": 1500525794, "num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 418, "playtime_forever": 158}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1501050909, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500412", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1501050909, "recommendationid": "33802375", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
