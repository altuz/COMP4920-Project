For me one of the most enjoyable bits, besides puzzling out the true ending, were the absurd flashbacks of events that never could have happened that can occur when you make an erroneous accusation.   The plausibility of the \"false\" endings were quite clever, and I enjoyed never being sure if I had gotten it right or not.  A short play, but definitely worth half the price of a movie.

Unfortunately, during the proceedings, their host is murdered, and she finds herself being framed for the murder. It's now up to you to search the locations, question the other characters, and either find the true culprit or lay the blame somewhere else, before the police arrive.\n\nThe handful of locations can all be searched for clues, but this is where things go a little wrong. All background graphics use a washed out style where individual items are hard to distinguish from each other. That would work fine if their sole purpose was to be backgrounds, but it becomes problematic when you have to search through them. While the hotspots are adequately sized, there is rarely anything to really distinguish them from the rest of the blurry background. It doesn't really help that the locations can be side scrolled for an even larger area to sweep your pointer over in the search of a new hotspot. Reaching the end and finding out that you missed a crucial item is painful, as you do not want to go through the bother of mousing over all the locations again.\n\nMeanwhile, interrogating the other charactres is largely delightful, due to good writing and mostly solid voice acting. Character sprites are overall well done, with enough different poses and expressions to keep things from getting too stale. While it is by no means a large game, it's still impressive that the entire thing is voice acted, and aside from one voice actress' delivery, I was impressed by the quality. There is a bit of intriguing world building going on, but it's really only hinted at, which is a shame, because it could have gone a long way towards explaining the vastly different accents of the characters. As it is, the accents come across more as an attempt to distinguish the characters from each other, which I believe could have been done more elegantly than forcing a foreign accent on certain characters.\n\nSo, is the murder mystery clever and hard to crack? Not really. As long as you find all those darn hotspots, Miss Fortune does rather well in solving most of the mystery herself. You are required to make a few crucial decisions and present evidence, but your character may reach conclusions based on that evidence that you hadn't quite figured out yourself. Regardless, the true culprit and method of murder is not that hard to figure out. Therefore, it is a rather pleasant surprise that you can reach different endings by framing each character for the murder, building up a false case against them. This is actually where most of the fun comes from.\n\nWhile the engine (unity) is adequate for the task, one thing that's really missing is a skip function. Going though the game again is laborious when you have to click your way through the initial dialogue. Thankfully, the save system automatically saves to different files, and there are a few auto saves to help you jump to key places, but a true skip function would have been appreciated.\n\nIn conclusion, for the price being asked, this is a good, but short murder mystery, marred by poor location searching, but impressive for its dialogue and voice acting. I imagine that with one character's delivery being re-recorded, you could sell this as an audio drama at the same price, but here you get an interesting little mystery game as well.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042764519", "last_played": 1494067536, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 451, "playtime_forever": 265}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1493798799, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530112", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1493798799, "recommendationid": "31520076", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "MMM is a point-and-click adventure centered around solving the murder of an enigmatic man. As the cast attempts to solve the mystery, a clock ticks down marking the time until the arrival of the police...\n\nThe presence of the timer definitely made the game tenser, but I often found myself skipping through the text quickly to finish collecting everything before time ran out. Thankfully, there is the option to disable the timer which allows you to absorb the atmosphere better. The characters are voiced well, and I was delighted to hear the wit of Miss Fortune, her interactions with the high-class Comtessa, and the banter with the rest of the cast.\n\nIt was a bit hard to suspend my disbelief at times. The clash of old and new technology felt jarring, and Lia felt out of place, being the only technically inclined person in a very old-fashioned setting. She was able to casually hack the phone company records to figure out who called the house, and would have preferred to hack their private emails if she needed extra information. Technical capability seemed to fluctuate as Miss Fortune seems clueless about wiring and electronics, yet she immediately identifies the timer device and implies that she was able to wire one up in school.\n\nThe gameplay was a bit clunky from time to time. Although the backgrounds were clear and conveyed the atmosphere well, some of the interact-able objects were a bit hard to distinguish from the background, further compounded by the fact that you can rotate 360 degrees. Transitioning between rooms takes a bit of time, especially when you go between rooms frequently. When replaying the game to achieve all the endings, I found myself wishing for an auto-skip feature. However, it was nice that the controls were explained clearly and concisely at the very start of the game.\n\nThe artstyle was charming, and each character is given a unique color for contrast. I'm not sure what's up with Comtessa's right hand, though. Perhaps she's an amputee from the elbow down.\n\nThe highlight of the game is definitely chapter 3, where you can blame anyone and justify it. If you mess up and have the tables turned on you, the game gives you some clues, some of which are misleading. These small hints are beautifully executed.\n\nDespite criticizing aspects of the game, I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys adventure mystery games.
