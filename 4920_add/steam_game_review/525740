It's simple mechanics are fun, and the collection aspect of getting costumes that are both fun to look at and help boost your stats is great. However, I cannot recommend this game due to how badly it plays. \n\nThe game lags on my computer, which can play high end AAA titles with no hiccups. I've tried to troubleshoot the issue, but I can't figure out why this simple game is having so many issues. It freezes during load screens and the frame rate is attrocious.

Although there is a problem with it and that's that it keeps lagging out every time I click on something and when I load into the game, like the game freezes for a few seconds, not sure if it's just me or if it's the game.
