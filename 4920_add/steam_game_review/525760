There's a leader board for each course, but that seems buggy too. A guy with a faster time was underneath my time. I think the obstacles and grips work well. I'm a climber, and I feel like it approximates it well. You can switch between single and matching (both hands on one grip) holds. Locomotion is done by holding down the grips and swinging your arms back and forth. Holding one grip is normal speed, and holding two grips is fast speed. There are clipping issues, and the black countdown screen at the beginning of each course gets in your way, making it hard to see the start of each course, until you get past the screen, but it's usually right next to a wall, so you tend to get past the screen and then clip into the wall, unless you're careful with your arm swings.\n\nEDIT: They fixed the black countdown screen and scoreboard issues. Most clipping issues might have been fixed too. You can walk into a tall column and then end up on top of it out of nowhere though. Jumping from vertical pole to pole is very difficult. Maybe, some of the grips/poles need larger grabable areas.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972025376", "last_played": 1474927522, "num_reviews": 106, "num_games_owned": 475, "playtime_forever": 57}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1474632052, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496872", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1474904047, "recommendationid": "25649226", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is my favorite game right now, best replayability in VR for me so far, up there with Windlands.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197963833303", "last_played": 1481078403, "num_reviews": 41, "num_games_owned": 273, "playtime_forever": 215}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1475461908, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1475565425, "recommendationid": "25832322", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game could be good, but it needs a fair bit of work to make this \"that\" good.\n\n1: It is not kid friendly. Kids do not have 6 foot arm span, and cannot reach the grips never mind reach across and up.\n2: It needs better collision detection. climbing through a wall is frustrating enough without the hmd going black for a few seconds and then falling because you thought it crashed.\n3: Music.  People, add some energetic music to get the adrenalin going because at the moment, it is plain boring.\n4: sort out the leaderboard.  I'm all for being the most useless person to play, but I refuse to believe a course that would take a very very quick person a minimum of 15 seconds to complete... has a leaderboard score of 2 seconds????  No way, not even if you could fly through it, someone cheated, or there is a glitch.\n\n\n  I know it sounds like I'm ripping the game to pieces, but this really has the base work to be brilliant.  It just hasn't been done yet.  Devs, have a quick look at dorito challenge on xbox 360 to get an idea of adrenalin music, and colission detection.  \n\n  I'm going to keep coming back to this, as it's fun to play if you work around the bugs, and i also want this to be fantastic as it can potentially be!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198020804147", "last_played": 1482860773, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_forever": 55}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1476628806, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1476628806, "recommendationid": "26070821", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "TBH I havent read the full spec on early access, but my take is that its about buying the game early, helping fund and influence the developers, and seeing if you like the game enough to stick with it. If Steam allows a refund if you really hate the way it is or is going, then that seems great to me,  and the review during early access should be about the idea, main gameplay and major control systems.\n\nSo, with that in mind, I think this game has huge potential for Vive users, is a great idea, is well implemented, and has some bugs, like clipping etc, which is why its early access and not finished, I believe.\n\nSo as an early access game I think its worth buying, if you dont get nausius from the gameplay, and like the idea of a Wipeout style game.\n\nThe courses could be placed in locations I would hope, like above a shark infested water tank perhaps? It could be made to resemble a game show, like in RUNNING MAN or something too, or even made like FIFA with commentary to be like the total Wipeout TV show. Real potential I think, little rough, but that is to be expected, right?\n\nNot refunding this one, but have many others,", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197968638558", "last_played": 1474924895, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 187, "playtime_forever": 40}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1474938468, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1474938468, "recommendationid": "25718595", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
