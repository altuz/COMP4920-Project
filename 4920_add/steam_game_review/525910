This game had bugs in it. Literally. I played it one last time to make the video, and I did still get a little creeped out by the cockroaches, so you might still want to purchase this if you have a fear to overcome, or a frenemy to troll. I very much liked the environment though, quite drab. It's still just too basic to recommend if you're early into building a VR library. [spoiler]Gregarious German cockroaches show different behavior when reared in isolation from when reared in a group. In one study, isolated cockroaches were less likely to leave their shelters and explore, spent less time eating, interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them, and took longer to recognize receptive females.[/spoiler] http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=884481122", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961017729", "last_played": 1489637242, "num_reviews": 236, "num_games_owned": 2716, "playtime_forever": 57}, "votes_up": 32, "timestamp_created": 1482090136, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556275", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1489647877, "recommendationid": "28454226", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "another VR shovelware shooting gallery\n\n+ good jump scare the first few times when they fly up to your face\n- but they don't actually do damage. there is no health bar\n\n+ environment and cockroach & gun models look ok\n- environment doesn't respond to shots except some objects can be knocked over. lacks power-ups\n\n+ small haptic response was added when shooting guns. probably doesn't drain batteries much?\n- only one gun type. infinite ammo and no reloading. \n\nyeah it's worth about $2. maybe good for overcoming insect phobia because you can't die.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027189035", "last_played": 1494945177, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 654, "playtime_forever": 49}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1473594396, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515873", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1473594396, "recommendationid": "25461139", "votes_funny": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ya gotta help my mom!\nShe's in there with the radroaches!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997709125", "last_played": 1474494161, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 249, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1474509832, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512339", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1474509832, "recommendationid": "25628714", "votes_funny": 15, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Cockroach VR is short and simple but addictive.  It doesn't have any motion sickness moments, it runs smoothly on my budget rig, it exits easily, it looks great, it's immersive, and it's cheap.  Get it and enjoy it.  Play your own music to hype up the experience.\n\nSome notes to the dev for improvement:\n1. Guns don't need any ammo or reload mechanic.  This ruins the immersion a bit at first, but it's actually kind of nice as a beginner difficulty kind of thing.  Perhaps add optional reload mechanics.\n2. The roachs get too close to the player camera when flying around the player. Clipping occurs and shooting the roachs becomes a challenge at that point because the bullets spawn behind the roachs.\n3. Add some additional environments, like a hotel lobby or a courtroom or a breakroom or a bedroom.  I get bored of the kitchen.\n4.
