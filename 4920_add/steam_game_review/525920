I've now spent enough hours on it to say with confidence: it's not my fault...\n\nNot working well:\n- \"press the space bar to stop simulation\". 7 days later, it finally stops. By now, contract offers are gone.\n- Be a pro: DO NOT BE A SPRINTER. It will make you go mad. The worst breakaways (5 guys wit 64 Ryding and no stamina on a flat stage of 160k) are impossible to catch with my entire team (Ryders of 65-74-) going after them. Meanwhile, other teams with better sprinters than me don't even seem interested in catching the breakaway. So the breakaway that got 4 mins max is not caught. If however, on occasion you do succeed to catch the breakaway, and get a good train on the road, in 1  out of 3 times, the leadoutguy just doesn't even begin his sprint when pressing \"S\". Het just let's go mid screen and you lose 20 positions straight away. In other times when it does work, your sprinter of 75 in the shape of his life gets beaten by a nitwit with 68 sprinting, when you let him explode at the 1k mark.. it's rediculous!\n- Guys like Peter Sagan just keep following climbers with 83 climbing on a 10k climb of 8%. Impossible to win mid mountain stages with a climber.\n- I only win climb stages with the best climber in freakish climb stages (with over 50k of climbing to do) by doing the final climb on my own pace, not following any attack, and in the end catching up with the nutty attackers being dead 3k's before the finish.\n- Ever done a breakway in a mountain stage? Every single one of the guys in the breakaway thinks he can win the polkadot jersey, and attacks on every single climb to get the points. So or you do the same and destroy your riders yellow bar, or you don't and you're left chasing the breakaway until the next climb, where they attack once again. \n- I could go on and on, but it never stops.\n\nOverall, there's too many things wrong with this game when it could be that much more fun. It gets frustrating.\nThat can never be the intent of a game so I'm done.\n\nEdit: most errors occur in the Pro Cyclist mode. Career mode is playable, however sometimes the lead out guy doesn't want to start his sprint still happens.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 580, "steamid": "76561198397677655", "last_played": 1506630289, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 11256}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1504608351, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529873", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504807296, "recommendationid": "34753850", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "doesn't do triple displays -  max resolution is 1920x1080 sadly", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198075869838", "last_played": 1504861478, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_forever": 51}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504934298, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495827", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504934298, "recommendationid": "34829485", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
