The good news is that Just Bat blows KOS out of the water... the question is, does that make it a good game? The answer is Not Really, but it is still the only choice worth considering if you are interested in playing cricket in VR.\n\nI've played at least a couple of decades worth of actual cricket, so I can't help but compare any VR experience to the real deal. The bowling in Just Bat is OK, there is not a lot of variation but you can track the ball out of the bowler's hand and attempt to play a sensible shot, both of which were impossible in KOS. However, the measure of a game based on batting, (especially one called \"Just Bat\") is how good the batting feels, and it's here where the game lets itself down.\n\nEvery so often it's possible to latch on to a ball and see it go roughly where you intended, and when this happens it actually feels pretty good. The trouble is these moments are the exception, not the rule. Mostly you're left wondering what happened as the ball goes straight through to the keeper after playing an orthodox forward defensive stroke to a straight medium pace delivery, or alternatively goes flying over the fence for six after attempting to play an off drive along the ground.\n\nPressing and holding the trigger after you have played a shot shows you where the ball contacted the bat, this is a nice feature. Unfortunately it also shows up just how inaccurate the physics of the game are. I lost count of how many times I played a straight drive, knowing I should have smacked the ball straight past the bowler, only to see it go through to the keeper, or dribble off into the slips. Sure enough, holding in the trigger showed that the ball had hit right in the middle of the blade.\n\nGraphically this game is pretty spartan, the fielders look like sex toys and there is not much detail generally. The audio is serviceable, with music that you will want to (and, mercifully, can) turn off and basic sounds for events like when willow contacts leather or when you tap the bat on the turf.\n\nThere is not much actual game here, the best option is to attempt the \"5 Over Challenge\" where you face, unsurprisingly, 5 overs of bowling and try to maximise your score. If you make it through without getting out and have a high score you get your name on the Leaderboard. That is, pretty much, it.\n\nAt the end of the day, I don't care too much if the graphics and sound are naff, or even if the game options are lacking... all that would be forgivable if only there was a good batting model that behaved the way you would expect in real life. I understand that this is not an easy task, but that's what is required to make a genuinely great cricket game. Just Bat, while light years ahead of King of Spin, does not have such a model, it's basically a cricket \"game\", it can't realistically be called a cricket \"sim\".\n\nI'm still (a bit reluctantly) going to recommend this, mostly because it's currently best of breed (although that is not saying much) and is not a blatant overpriced ripoff POS like King of Spin. Also, on those odd occasions when a shot connected as expected, I can't deny that it felt pretty sweet, and I do sometimes find myself going back to it in spite of its shortcomings.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198133109927", "last_played": 1504423990, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 102, "playtime_forever": 202}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1473891184, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512595", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1473891184, "recommendationid": "25502266", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game has the potential to be really good, but as others have mentioned, the developers appear to have the work ethic of a narcoleptic sloth.\n\nWhile the batting is, at times, quite good, the ball will frequently pass right through your bat, and the distance hit often bears no resemblance whatsoever to the force involved. At times, a defensive shot will race across the boundary, or balloon out for a six. \n\nThe leaderboard hasn't worked for months, and the developers are fully aware of this. Sadly they would rather sit back and trouser the money rather than make even the most minor changes to their game.\n\nThis is essentially a product abandoned at beta stage. It isn't super expensive, but buying this is essentially funding the sort of slacker developer who spends most of the day lying in bed getting high, while casually flipping an upraised middle finger at their mug customers, in favour of actually doing some legitimate work to fix their buggy product, and providing consumers with a reasonable level of quality.\n\nI have mixed feelings over this game, as underneath the bugs and janky implementation, there is the basis of something good. It's just a shame that the devs can't be arsed to finish what they started. If there is any justice in the afterlife, these indolent wasters will be stripped naked, tied to an oversized wicket, and will face an eternity of neverending fast deliveries from Curtly Ambrose, pre \"one bouncer per over\" rules.\n\nNot recommended.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970409140", "last_played": 1493286419, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 4735, "playtime_forever": 136}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1480814378, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505184", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1480814378, "recommendationid": "28173733", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I am changing my review to positive after the long-awaited updates from the developer.\n\nThe presentation of \"Just bat\" is quite simple (for example, fielders are represented by assets which resemble punching bags), but the core mechanic which is simulating is actually really entertaining.

The former allows you to select the type of bowling you wish to face (pace, leg spin, off spin) and allows you to select the speed of the delivery and where it pitches.  The latter sees each over bowled by a different type of bowler, with the speed, line and length determined by the AI.\n\nDespite having much simpler graphics than \"the other\" cricket game for the Vive, this is much more challenging an overall a much more realistic experience.
