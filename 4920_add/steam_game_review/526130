It is early access after all and i seems to have a lot of potential. Ill give it a thumbs up, but if its a another early access that stagnates and they never add anything else , my review may change. At its current state, Unless you really want a new game or, you've got money burning a hole in your pocket maybe wait for a sale. \n\n6.5/10\n(where 5 is an average vr game) \n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "steamid": "76561198088840560", "last_played": 1506181847, "num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 319, "playtime_forever": 138}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1495065902, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505752", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495065902, "recommendationid": "31813675", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
