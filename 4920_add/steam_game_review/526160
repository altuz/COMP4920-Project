This game is brutal at times unless you rush the best materials, but if you don't want the game to be as hardcore with losing all your levels, play Explorer mode. It's equally as fun.\n\nI should also add that the developers are awesome. They clearly dedicate a lot of time to fixing issues people bring up. The desync issue with picking up items was the only complaint from me, which was as easy as leaving and rejoining to fix. But I look again and it's fixed.\n\nI love the content and it seems like a really fun game to work on. I envy the developer team and they clearly have a lot of passion put into this game.

Just surviving, levelling up and working up the tiers crafting new stuff is pretty fun in its own right, and delivers a very acceptable survival experience. However the game is also littered with various intruiging questlines that the player is free to advance whenever they like - and feel they are able.

All i did was die because it got dark so fast. What kind of game has day time so short what a joke. Ask for refund did not want to waste money on another game that is broken. The thing is all these games coming out never get finished or when they do they are not that fun or so many other issue that come up.. Maybe game play will change later but a day change from day to night so short is not fun. I have so many games that set their games on heard even on easy the game is heard and you die over and over. The old games had easy difficulty levels that worked and was fun to play. This is no more true in these days, they all but destroyed the fun game play today. Someone going to learn that a game can both be fun and a game that you can learn as you go until then i will not be buying a lot of games until I know for sure how the game works in a demo like the old days.
