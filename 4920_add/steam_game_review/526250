Can't adjust inverted Y either.\nCan't adjust controls at all so forget about custom key binds you wont find them here either.\nI don't play 3rd person shooters on PC with a controler, not my thing, never was. Why do you think I built a pc for gaming? It was because I wanted to move away from controllers for my fps/3rd p shooters.\n\nAudio is god awful with no way to adjust sound and voice overs, half of the time can't hear what the peaple is even saying.\n\nThis game reeks of mobile port all over it. Graphically, control and audio wise.\n\nKEEP MOBILE GAMES ON MOBILE DEVICES!

BUT it is (from what i have played so far) a fun little tank game where you are blowing things up. i have played very little (At the time of making this review) but it seems that you only have one tank, kinda sucks.
