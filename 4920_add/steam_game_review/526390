(if you ever played Quake - RQ=Real Quake; pre-QW, with a 250 ping you can sort of understand the way you have to think....)\n\n\"Music\" I did like, reminds me a bit of the ambient style of the original Fallout/s, so it's more of a sound mat than music but I do like that in games and when reading a book. (it's just present and non-intrusive)\n\nSo far there's been no way to fight the enemies (bats and some bug/beetle I guess) - there's also some flying \"Unmechanical\" lookalike, but it seems to get disarmed when you disarm the lasers.\n\nSo I've been running here and there stumbling over the key/whatever I need to continue and ran around some more to find the door/whatever I should use what I found on... (and gathered some health'n'stuff too)\n\nI wasn't bored, didn't hate it but...and this is where the beginning of this review comes back; I don't know what to think/feel about it...I guess I look at it a bit like I look at Minesweeper, there are a whole slew of better games but sometimes you just need a timewaster and it can fill that role.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198138101163", "last_played": 1478275374, "num_reviews": 81, "num_games_owned": 152, "playtime_forever": 24}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1478277893, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505658", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1478279992, "recommendationid": "26419096", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
