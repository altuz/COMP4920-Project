It's not really fun to play.  That's for several reasons.\n\nFirst of all, the songs are not very good.  I try to keep an open mind about that.  However, the song selection is mostly J-pop or K-pop electronic music.  There's only two songs that I had even heard of before and that's Want You Bad by The Offspring and Party Rock Anthem by LMFAO.  However, even those songs weren't really fun to play.\n\nThat's because secondly, there's 4 colored drums that you're banging on.  Except it doesn't feel realistic.  You can tell this is all rhythm game and no parts drum simulation.  The good news is that the drums did feel responsive, even if unrealistic.  But at the higher difficulties (there's easy, medium, hard, and challenging for most songs), the game wants you to do some hand gymnastics thare are done simply for the challenge and not because anybody would play drums that way.\n\nLastly, the VR environment is just awful.  The drums look bad.  The water looks bad.  Everything looks bad.  The UI is also pretty awful both in looks and in usefulness.  There are leaderboards, but very few players.  The good from the game is that I think the drums are responsive.  It ran well also, no bugs or jitters.\n\nRating 4/10 hey it works and it's cheaper than other VR rhythm games, but it's one of the worst ... do not recomend buying unless you love this type of music and don't mind the poor aesthetics", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1506148126, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 39}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505008895, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505327", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506148678, "recommendationid": "34851071", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great fun game. straight forward rythm game for VR drums. 30 (i think) starting stongs and already 50 workshop songs. a well constructed design that will go as far as the workshop creators will take it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 100, "steamid": "76561198079765149", "last_played": 1506476666, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 382, "playtime_forever": 127}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506477478, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504521", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506477478, "recommendationid": "35233669", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
