This is not what I expected. This game is supposed to be a hacking game when all it is is a puzzle game. It's based on A LOOOT of trial and error. I was constantly typing the same command over and over and over again for 10 levels straight! I then decided to give up and look up if there is more. Turn's out, there is A LOT more of the same thing. It's so unbelievably tedious and it's not even hacking. It's just guessing peoples' passwords through what they like (for example baseball). It's just assumuptions! The purpose of a puzzle game is to force the player into using logic. There's also NO POINT in putting an answer command. This makes this game incredibly easy and doesn't deserve the title of a 'hacking game'.\n\nSame for the other 2 games. It is just assumptions and doesn't force the player into thinking hard. There's an easy 'give up' button (answer command) you can type which no other puzzle games have. \n\nThese games are just password guessing games.
