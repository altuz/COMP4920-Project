You click on the person behind the door that opened to kick him or her out and send them on their way. Collect keys to buy new \"weapons\" (limited to a baseball bat, powerdrill, and a gun that doesn't need ammo) which are picked up from the store at the bottom of the screen. As you progress to the fifth set of levels the difficulty drastically increases and you'll need to rely on falling alarm clocks to slow down time and the three continues you are given. Each level requires you click a certain number of people which you only learn by hitting that number and turning it from red to green on the heads up display.\n\nThe music's bland, there's no real goal, cartoonish characters and the background look as though  they're from a British child's cartoon torn out of the 90's but flatter, and later levels are virtually impossible without a rapid fire mouse or auto-clicker program. If you intend to get all achievements, or try to enjoy more than five minutes with the game, then you'll need to download one or a worthy hotscript code. Check any clicker game forum on here and you should be able to find one without a problem (I found mine on a Tap Heroes achievement guide).\n\nThe only real point to own this game is to work on motor skills, reaction time, or hand/eye coordination for children or the handcapped. Other than that it has some quick achievements if you have an auto-clicker. Originally the achievement to kick the tenant and key at the same time does not unlock, but it has been fixed, so 100% completion is now available. But, if you don't fall in any of the aforementioned niche categories, you're better off just passing this one up.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025037510", "last_played": 1473620642, "num_reviews": 109, "num_games_owned": 3292, "playtime_forever": 56}, "votes_up": 83, "timestamp_created": 1473588468, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599686", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1473620767, "recommendationid": "25459638", "votes_funny": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Garbage mobile game, avoid this crap.

Sorry  :(\n\n\nDear Diary,\n\nI bought this because I'm an impulsive shopper and I also hate my neighbors! I thought, 'Why the f--- not? It's $0.59! I vacuum at least 5x that weekly when I clean.' Buyer's remorse and I often walk hand in hand.\n\nWhen you have neighbors as shitty as me and have the misfortune of living in California where everbody wants to hug idiots instead of beat them with a hose like we used to when I was a kid a game like this catches your eye. But I digress.\n\nI call my neighbors the Billy-Jim-Joe-Bob-Draculas. In the states it's common for hillbillies to have 4-5 first names. No I'm not making his up, I have a friend named Steve Arnold James Brian Mortenson III. \n\nIf you do anything at all and there is daylight out(doesn't matter if it's 9am or 4pm), one of them is gauranteed to open their window and shout, 'Some of us sleep during the day!!!!' They have even been known to yell at parcel people who deliver packages to the other neighbors here. Seems to be a weird Hills Have Eyes situation in that house and I really wouldn't be surprised(based on their usual behavior) if they actually had a network of tunnels under their home since there is about 15 people living in that little 2 bedroom condo. I would say that they are gypsies or something but they never move. Gypsies at least travel a bit and get some variety. \n\nAlas, this is all I know of them: They hate daylight and there are a bajillion of them. *shrug*\n\nBy now you're probably thinking, when does this stop being about her neighbors and start being about the damn game!? The wait is over! Here is my review:\n\nThis game was fun for a few minutes but after a while becomes near impossible to beat(for me at least, maybe I'm old and slow).\n\nIt's basically whack-a-mole with neighbors and doors. You can smack keys that fall down and buy upgraded weapons but the default one worked the best for me. At first it was a little fun-- The door would open, I would boot them in the head, they would run away, and I was victorious. Eventually though, there are more doors and they open and close faster than you can click them. Sometimes you get lucky and a small clock falls down that you can click and that slows them down, but you have to have some pretty good reflexes to advance to the end I think. \n\nI gave it a good effort for 10 minutes and I have to brutally honest and say that this really should be a free game. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997678124", "last_played": 1473689043, "num_reviews": 89, "num_games_owned": 911, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 21, "timestamp_created": 1473690848, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507338", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1473690848, "recommendationid": "25479571", "votes_funny": 12, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Now, normally I put at least 2-3 hours into a game and more time will be put in if required, however as of the time writing this review, I've only gotten 18 minutes into the game....because that's all the time required to complete the game and get all the achievements.\n\nGameplay in KickHim is basically what's expected once viewing the trailer. Characters appear from behind a door you kick them using your mouse and see how many you can kick in 1 minute. Do that 10 times and you've completed the game because by that time, you'll have gotten to the final stage, completed the final stage, unlocked all the achievements, unlocked all the characters and bought all (4) of the different weaposn that can be purchased from the store. Difficulty does increase during the game but even on the hardest difficulty, the game is still so easy and boring.\n\nGraphics are below average. The hand drawn city overview and stages are pretty decent to look at but the characters in the game have only 2 frames of animation. If you want an idea of what the animation is like, just imagine drawing 2 different animations on 2 pieces of paper and flip them past each other quickly while the animations are in 2 compeltely different stages. That's what the animations are like in KickHim.\n\nDue to the game being so simple, there isn't really much left to say. It's boring and there's nothing really interesting about it.\n\nPros\n+ Graphics are for the most part okay\n\nCons\n- Boring gameplay\n- Stilted animations\n\nFinal verdict: 3/10\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews]My curator Group[/url]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018006511", "last_played": 1488120512, "num_reviews": 47, "num_games_owned": 1011, "playtime_forever": 219}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1477864055, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515177", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1477864055, "recommendationid": "26324628", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyzc66hk1zk&feature=push-u-sub&attr_tag=34ndq_LAvyg-6", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198117012346", "last_played": 1500414521, "num_reviews": 53, "num_games_owned": 723, "playtime_forever": 18}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1486753249, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506514", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1486753249, "recommendationid": "29830239", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's pretty much just an early 2000's flash game.

The game eventually let's you buy a chainsaw instead of a boot to go assaulting people's doorways.  \n\nThe Good:\n- For achievement hunters, this game is very cheap and pretty easy to prefect out the achievements on, just make sure to do all the levels in one sitting because it does not retain your high level from the last play session.\n- For the price, the amusement value (especially on sale) is pretty high.\n- It's not a bad way to practice quick hand-eye coordination for mouse movements.\n- Since it has card drops, people who play with the steam market might be able to make back what they spent on the game selling the cards.\n\nThe Weird:\n- The music is a single track, and while not bad, does get a little old.  You can turn it off in the matches.\n- Apparently you're an antisocial psychopath, because you start out by kicking people when they come out of their rooms, and eventually can upgrade your weapons to a bat, a drill, or a chainsaw to go after everyone with.\n- You leave marks on the walls where you've clicked with the various weapons, but the doors always stay pristine.\n- You can give the people you're going after in the levels names. I guess so you can make it personal.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- If you have an issue with cartoony violence against random strangers, this is not the game for you.\n- The weapons can be a little weird to get used to where they are actually clicking, especially for things like the chainsaw and trying to get the clocks or keys.\n\n\nAll in all, it's not a bad little game for it's price tag.
