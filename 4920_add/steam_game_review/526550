I went to his launch party and I have to say this game is very imersive.  It relies on the world for build fear and not just jump scares.  This was my first time in VR so I also played a bunch of other games durring this party and this game has a game feel to it and not a demo or a wave shooter.  This game had everyone jumping and scared.  This is a very unique game from what i have tried.
