Total lack of voice overs and possibly less content.  Sure, hitting the other guy in the face is entertaining, but it's ever so buggy.  No body shots, no blocking properly with gloves, and zero sense of any progression.  Heck, even the fighters are more or less unnamed joes that you just beat up.  \n\nThe gym has 2 bags that you can punch around.  Gets old quick.  Maybe put a few mini games in there??  How many times in 60 seconds you could hit the speed bag?  Try to hit the ceiling with the heavy bag?  I dunno.  Something to spice up the gym a little.\n\nFor the price, I'm not too bummed out, but I still think there should have been a bit more to this before releasing.  If this had a bit more of a story to it, allowed body shots,  gave some sort of sense of progression and had a few bugs ironed out, then I would probably rate this very well.  Until then, I'm afraid I must give it a thumbs down.\n\nThis bug below is so bad, it's impossible to lose a fight since they can't hit you:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRH1wmjfBBk", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198088224397", "last_played": 1491629219, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 165, "playtime_forever": 41}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1477446726, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510547", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1477446726, "recommendationid": "26224316", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I really don't get it why so many of these VR experiences / games get so many positive reviews compared to the amount of negative reviews.

It's by all accounts shallow, silly and lacks any semblence of realism or overall effort. If you're looking for a boxing sim, or something with some substance, I recommend passing it up.\n\nThat being said, I knew all of this before I hit the purchase button thanks to some honest reviews, not that the half-assed translations or gameplay videos themselves didn't give it away. I bought it anyway because I thought what the hell, it's $5 and looks like a decent arcade experience. What you get is an endless wave of completely stupid AI with canned animations, unrealistic mechanics, but an addictively fun time knocking dudes out every minute or two. I found myself laughing at the different combinations I could slap together with the final killer hook, straight or uppcut making the AI go limp. \n\nWith regards to the actual mechanics, it's stupid enough to go as far as holding down the trigger while you punch to provide a power shot. You would think with VR, power shots would be determined by...power. Body shots are non-existent. Blocking is non-existent. Sometimes the hit box for the AI's head won't even register, seems to be related to certain animations. Movement might as well be non-existent because the enemy is glued at a fixed range from you and floats right with you if you cover any distance over a couple feet from your starting position. \n\nStill though, I'm entertained and it's yet another game to get the heart rate up, if only moderately. \n\nOnly buy it if you have $5 to piss away and think punching dudes unconscious with haymakers over and over and over and over and over is something you might get a little joy out of. \n\nIf you want an actual attempt at an in-depth boxing experience, and more importantly one that has a bright potential future with a developer who is constantly updating it, check out Thrill of the Fight.
