Reduction in price by a dollar, or a quality polish, or a small extension might make it more desirable. It's very harsh on the eyes, at least with that initial strobe light. The sound is also abrasive. The puzzles weren't bad, and I love having to duck/crawl and having the evil walls change on you. Yet, just as it seems to get good, it's over. If you just bought energy drinks and a $20 steam card at the drugstore, and you're on the prowl for escape room games, get the cabin sequel.
