(There is no ingame function to do this, and the alternative is losing over and over until you work it out.)\n-If blocks come in fast and land in the wrong place you lose instantly, no real way of avoiding it.\n-If a piece enters the board at the same time as another lands you lose instantly, no warning.\n-Seriously, losing instantly because of the computer dropping in blocks, when later levels drop them so fast and with move limits that mean you cant keep things entirely clear... screw that 'mechanic', the last level was literally a case of 2 in 3 games failing through no fault of your own.\n\nThere is a lot of problems, its kind of a mess, and in a bunch of cases Im fairly sure there are pretty trivial ways to fix the issues up. (Like change some of the damn colours.)\n\nYet, I gave it a recommend... because ultimately it kept me coming back for more. While all of the above can make it unfair regardless of your skill level, when things do go right then you noticably become far superior at polishing off levels. There is some real skill to this under all the problems, there is some really unique gameplay despite the issues with mechanics, and you do get a hankering for just one more game...\n\nId be tempted to give it a neutral if I could because Im really not sure if drawing me back in for hours on end is enough. You can make something addictive that isnt necessarily good, but there is enough to it that I think its worth most people giving it a shot, especially if you can pick it up on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197996964816", "last_played": 1496435995, "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 1496, "playtime_forever": 1361}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1496437664, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505338", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496437664, "recommendationid": "32138085", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "You gotta match the squares fast and precisely, it's very addictive and clever. You have to classify the squares carefully because every time you throw one an other appears, no matter if you made a succesful move or a mistake, so you can easily be overwhelmed by their number, and they can hide the layout. Also the levels are made so you often have to put blocks in wrong places to use them as holds for other cubes because you have to match them in difficult places to reach. Very smart game design and excellent gameplay feel with a gamepad in hand. The scoring is dependant of your ability to analyse, adapt, speed and overall precision and you can compete on leaderbords for every level. I totally recommend this game!\n\nPS : The last levels are incredibly hard and possibly frustrating. Sometimes squares falls into a place where they match but where you don't want them to match yet, blocking the way and giving you a game over without you being able to do anything, just contemplate game over after game over until the blocks stops falling into the bad places. There should be a script preventing that to happen because sometimes you are doing incredibly well into the hardest levels and then game over because a block falled into a wrong spot. There are so many blocks falling everywhere at each second into the last level that it is nearly impossible to prevent this to happen manually.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040056045", "last_played": 1495646836, "num_reviews": 36, "num_games_owned": 1007, "playtime_forever": 992}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1495031129, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495368606, "recommendationid": "31805573", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "RUINED! by Time Attack levels!\n\n\nI would love this game but the time atack levels just ruin any fun i'm having by turning it into just frustration.\nThe limited moves levels are fine, you have to think about getting it right etc but time attack and limited moves levels with annoying time attack just completely destroy any fun into controller destorying crap.\n\nPlay the demo and realise the last demo level, the time attack one isn't a rare occurance but happens level after level after level in a row!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198114628189", "last_played": 1497455589, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 140, "playtime_forever": 78}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1497455862, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506371", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1497455862, "recommendationid": "32413079", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
