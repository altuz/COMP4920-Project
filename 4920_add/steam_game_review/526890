Bonus if you can do it within the alotted number of moves, but it's not necessary. This gets challenging when you learn that you also have to pick flowers (and a berry bush for bonus), there are immovable obstacles, there are bears (who can be moved) that the girl needs to stay away from, fire that the bears can't come close to, and more -- you get the idea.\n\nThe game is quite well designed, and that applies both to the artwork, the interface, the available settings, and even the tutorial. It is simply enjoyable to play. I have logged 1 hour playing the first 16 of 60 levels, and it's fun shoving the bears hither and yonder to get the red girl to where she needs to go and not waste moves. I expect it would take beginners longer, especially if they want to catch all the stars, but you don't have to: I expect this game is quite accessible to kids (who are more likely to play it on a tablet, though).

Since my old computer died, this game was lost along with it. I am so excited to find this back on Steam! I don't know whether I would be qualified to receive the reward from previously owning the game, but even I am not able to receive anything, I still would 100% recommend this game to any one who enjoys cute graphic, lovely music, enjoyable puzzle and relaxing atmosphere. I can't wait to jump back into my advanture in the woods again like I was years ago. ^_^ How about you come join me, let's get in the woods! \n\nTo Dear Developers,\nThank you so much for making this little game allive again!

But there are restriction rules that you uncover as you progress through the game. For example, Little Red Riding Hood can't get to a hex adjacent to a bear, but if the bear is adjacent to a beehive full of honey, the bear gets distracted and LRRH can come close to the bear. Some hexes cannot be moved either, but almost all characters/animals can.\n\nThis game is really easy to beat, since you have unlimited moves, so it can be great for younger audiences. On the other hand, beating the pars and collecting berries to achieve 3 stars and ultimately a crown on each stage proves to be a really hard challenge that will make most adults feel like rage-quitting (or go running to see a guide).\n\nThe only con I can think of is that it lacks a level editor so players can share their creations with the community. But 60 levels are enough to keep you entertained for a while.\n\nLast but not least, devs were really responsive in the forums, providing quick solutions for issues that have arised. And this is always a great sign.
