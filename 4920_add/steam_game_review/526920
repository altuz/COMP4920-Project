That much is true. [i]SQUAKE[/i] does manage to pull off the feeling of a mashup of [i]Snake[/i] and [i]QUAKE[/i] fairly well. Is it fun? It's ok. To be blunt, it's not as good as [i]Slither.io[/i] - and I make that judgement because time-and-again I find myself over at [i]Slither.io[/i], while not so much here with this title. I do enjoy playing [i]SQUAKE[/i] to a certain extent, and I cannot deny that. [i]SQUAKE[/i] is much faster paced, and the levels are small. I am changing my review to positive because the title accomplishes what it sets out to do, and the dev team is dilligent about addressing criticism and are open to changing things. \n\n+The controls have been fixed\n+The hitboxes feel much more appropriate now\n+So far, reset trains have not been in questionable locations (ie. in front of a wall, etc.)\n\n-Sound effects are still 'meh', but that's probably a budget limitation thang\n-Powerups are still lackluster, but whatever\n\n[b]Will you get your five bucks worth? Sure, but just know that while doing what it sets out to do, [i]SQUAKE[/i] is quite small in scope.[/b]\n\n---\n\n[b]I was hoping that [i]SQUAKE[/i] was an upgraded version of the fantastic [i]Slither.io[/i], but sadly, it is much less polished and balanced.[/b] I do appreciate that the devs wanted to take the base idea of [i]Slither.io[/i] and create a more fast-paced game. That [i]idea[/i] is very cool, but the execution is quite off.\n\n[b]What they got right:[/b]\n+Interesting idea to make [i]Sliter.io[/i] a bit more fast-paced with powerups and meta-upgrades.\n+Unfortunately controller support here is poor - but it does exist.\n\n[b]What needs improvement:[/b]\n-I can only describe the controls as 'squirrelly'. If you are used to [i]Sliter.io[/i], you will initially feel like the game is in fast-forward. That part makes sense (ie. mixing concepts with [i]QUAKE[/i]). The problem I found was with turning. It just felt too sudden and too wiley.\n-After death, your train is often reset in really questionable locations - often I was directly in front of a wall. Yes, I could swerve right away to miss it, but why put me in this position? I had many, many deaths due to that. Questionable design decision at best.\n-Hit boxes with walls are a bit too liberal. Since the game is so simple, these small issues add up quickly. Near perfect design is what made [i]Slither.io[/i] so popular to begin with.\n-Sound effects are kind of annoying. The train sound is monotonous even after a short while. So how do we fix this? Remove those sounds or have them play intermittantly. I get that the budget is not unlimited for these things - again, look at [i]Slither.io[/i] for good minimalistic-ish game design. Sometimes less is more.\n-Power ups are a [i]great[/i] idea and would be a nice addition if they were a bit more inspired. These are as basic as they can get. By the way, the powerup that reverses your steering should be removed, in my opinion. Does it really add fun?\n-One of the coolest strategic design elements of [i]Slither.io[/i] is the ability to cross over your own tail. They have eliminated that here, and it dramatically reduces strategy. I get that this is in-part the [i]SNAKE[/i] component, but it simplifies things too much.\n-The levels or arena is quite small. Too small for this type of game.\n\n[b]I do appreciate the effort and investment in producing a good, purchasable [i]Slither.io[/i] here on Steam.[/b] I am also excited about various quality-of-life upgrades (ie. controller support, meta upgrades, etc.). Unfortunately, [i]SQUAKE[/i] isn't there yet - and it could get there if more TLC is invested. The price is cheap, but I'll stick with [i]Slither.io[/i]\n\nPeace,", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040884867", "last_played": 1487546517, "num_reviews": 618, "num_games_owned": 1196, "playtime_forever": 43}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1486217949, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506020", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1487854170, "recommendationid": "29694143", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
