One such game is beer pong, where you play beer pong. The problem is, every few balls, you have to drink a beer and it blurs your vision and makes the player view loll about uncontrollably. I have extremely strong VR legs and this made me feel ill.\n\nGetting started is difficult as there are only a few instructions which are written in broken english and don't give very good directions at all.\n\nFinally, and worst of all, many features shown in the video and screen shots are not in the game, particularly the ropeway to the skull door, which is one of the biggest teases that influenced me to purchase the game. This is definitely not cool, and is a good example of false advertising. If you don't have it in the game, don't feature it.\n\nI do not recommend this game for purchase, there's simply not enough there.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970518998", "last_played": 1474002930, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 379, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1474005111, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512043", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1474005111, "recommendationid": "25522335", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Wt?", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198139400506", "last_played": 1474706760, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1473923415, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473175", "votes_down": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1473923542, "recommendationid": "25507327", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
