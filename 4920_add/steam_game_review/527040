Graphics are shit, gameplay is terrible, can't read the cards while playing. Game is broken as well, wouldn't recommend this game at even $1, so the $8.99 price tag is way over-priced.\n\nIf you wan't a card game with a story then don't bother with this game. Really disappointed and feels like I just flushed my money down the drain.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198016733996", "last_played": 1475391858, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 388, "playtime_forever": 43}, "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_created": 1475392322, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1475561837, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535998", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1475392322, "developer_response": "Hello, it's unfortunate that you feel this way about the game. It is being updated to become better and better, and I've been working on it for quite some time. \n\nI must disagree however with your judgement as this game does have value.  If you can outline \"What\" is broken other than simply bashing it, I would be happy to address that issue in the next update.\n\nSimply stating that graphics are not the best does not tell me what the issue is specifically.  Is it simply the art style you do not like or is this not a type of game that you are use to playing?  What are you comparing the artwork to so that I can address that as well.\n\nI understand that you cant read the cards.  This issue I have already addressed and will be working on this in the next update and release.\n\nI do understand your price concern, but once again I must disagree with you on that.  When you look at the entertainment value that you get from the game, the price is competitive. For the most part players spend at least an hour in general if not more in my game.  I compare that to how much you would pay at your local movie theater.  The point is that just because you may not like the game as much does not mean it's a bad game.  Trying to generalize the game as horrible really doesn't do justice to the hours and labor that went into creating it.  Compare this game to others that don't have the graphics or the level of attention that was put into building this game.  Sure there are parts that need to be worked on more and those are definitely in the works, however I completely disagree that it is not worth money.  It is well worth the money.\n\nYou may not like the game, that's fine, I'm one developer who built it and I can only do my best to try and accommodate my users.  However compared to many other half-done games that really are bugged out and lack any form of dedication from the developer other than \"I made it in one weekend\", my game is quite good and I completely disagree with some of your remarks.\n\nSo to summarize:\n1. I'm here to constantly update and upgrade the game based on user feedback\n2. The game IS worth the value that you are paying for it, especially when you compare it to other forms of entertainment that most people drop money on without thinking about it.\n3. Simply stating the graphics/gameplay is not great (Your words were much more colorful), does not help me as a developer to understand where the issue lies.  What is the specific issue and is it something that I have the capability of addressing in the next update.\n\nI think this is an unfair judgement of the hard work and labor that went into making this game and I completely disagree with it.  I appreciate your feedback however and if you feel you got ripped off (Which I completely disagree with, it is a great game and has a great amount of gameplay and value), then please do connect with Steam directly to obtain a refund or to help you with your purchase.\n\nThank you for your review.", "recommendationid": "25815104", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Where do I begin with this?\n1. The graphics are horrendous and look like 90's CGI. I bought this in 2016 and the graphics are easily beaten by every other card game here on Steam. \n2. The price is way too high as I payed $4.99 for it on sale and it was way too much. If this were .99 then I wouldn't be writing this but due to the fact they have the nerve to charge $9.99 for this is unreal\n3. The game is a lazy port of the mobile game. Spinning the crystal is proof in that of itself\n4. The game is buggy and gives no real understanding of the game as they would rather flashback to the 2 characters staring at each other and grunting during the battle.\n\nThe only positive I have for this is the fact that they tried to make something new instead of being a Hearthstone or MTG clone. Good on you guys for that!\n\nIf you all can fix those 4 things than I will remove my negative review and make it positive", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198156540013", "last_played": 1483596576, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 638, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1483596593, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506741", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1483596593, "recommendationid": "29026822", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "nothing", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198400864427", "last_played": 1498681178, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1498689385, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494071", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1498689385, "recommendationid": "32962059", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
