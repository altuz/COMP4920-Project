I picked it up on sale and at first, I was underwhelmed.  I played single player for about an hour and with an hour left to request a refund, I decided to try an online game.\n\nTwo hours later I came up for air. Now I understand the complaints of lack of roomscale, etc.. and why it makes sence that those 'features' aren't in the game.  It's meant to be a seated experience and it Works!   The cross platform multiplayer works flawlessly and i can usually always find a full crew instantly.  The in-game avatars and the lip syncing really add to the immersion.\n\nThe more I play this sim the more i like it. Although I held off on paying full price initially for the base game, I would instantly purchase any and all DLC that comes out for it (at full price).
