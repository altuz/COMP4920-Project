Really.\n\n(No spoilers review)\n\nIt's World End Economica volume 03, where everything from the previous volumes goes up to eleven, including its economics jargon and its characters' ocassional bouts of stupidity. Welcome to the world's sweetest, most romantic explanation of the 2007 financial crisis.\n\n[b]Graphics: 8/10[/b]\n\nYet another improvement over its previous entry, albeit not as much as it was in turn over the first; character designs, backgrounds and CGs are all improved. Makes it somewhat jarring when screens from the first entry are used in flashbacks, but nothing too bad. Font handling doesn't play too well with the new in-game dictionary, though, but it's a minor point most of the time.\n\n[b]Sound: 8/10[/b]\n\nMuch better than its predecessor: still no voice acting but the music fits scenes much better, they flow into one another more smoothly, and I even found myself humming a couple once or twice. Full props here.\n\n[b]Story: 10/10[/b]\n\nLet's start with the worst: though they had been foreshadowed repeatedly throughout the entire series, some of the conflict on this volume still comes across as simply childish. I mean, seriously.\n\nBut the rest, oh boy the rest. This volume is simply brilliant, it hits your emotions even harder than the previous two volumes, and it's all mixed with a deep, well researched class on economics. The author pulled no stops on this volume, and it shows: it's evident from the start it's building up to an analogue of the 2007 financial crisis while weaving it very tightly with its character drama, and truly goes all the way: concepts such as securities, bonds and credit swaps are crucial in understanding what's going on, with the narrative often pausing to explain them using graphs and even an in-game dictionary for financial terms both new and otherwise, but it also shows the emotional impact of such a crisis on people of all walks in life, both within it and mere victims.\n\nAnother problematic point is that it's simply over too soon; after the climax there's barely any denouement and, though sweet, the CGs that float during the credits offer very little emotional closure. There's no plot threads left hanging, mind you, it's just... you know.\n\n[b]Longevity: 7/10[/b]\n\nAs usual, it's a kinetic novel with no choices whatsoever; but, it is longer than the previous two volumes, taking me over 7 hours of reading time, and I'm itching to get back and read it all again from the start.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nA brilliant finale for a brilliant series, fantastic from start to end. Like its own characters, the series is never flawless but it's smart and has a lot of heart; in the end, I'm truly happy to have come to know it, and I think you will too.

Well... It's over, at least. \n\nHere is a breakdown of my review - [i]Spoiler Alert[/i]\n\n[b]Stock Market Information - 9/10[/b]\n\nI learned quite a few details that I did not know before, regarding Market Derivatives and Securities.\n\n[b]Music - 7/10[/b]\n\nMusic is similar to Vol1 and Vol2, well done, well timed, but not special.\n\n[b]Art Design - 8/10[/b]\n\nArt seems to have taken a step back from Vol2, but is still pretty good for this type of VN.\n\n[b]Story/Taste in waifus - 1/10[/b]\n\nStory makes no sense; there are plenty of resources on the moon. I mean, mankind has a goddamn space elevator in this story, we can easily mine lunar ice, lunar He3 can be exported to Earth for hilarious profits, and lunar regolith (mostly sillicon/iron oxides) is a fairly decent 3D printer material for non-perishable bulk goods. Hell, you can manufacture PV panels by the ton and export clean power to Earth. \n\nWhat do you mean there's no reason to stay on the Moon other than low taxes?\n\nHow would the Moon compete with low-tax nations that already exist on Earth? Look at Singapore... It's basically the same success story as WEE, except that it's based on an island on Earth instead of needing a bajillion credits for a space elevator (or even more horrendously expensive - rocketry) to colonize.\n\nEven more enraging is the MC's taste in waifus. Hagana basically nuked the Lunar (and global) economy because she thought Hal was in love with Eleanor. What. The. Fuck.\n\n[i]And she continues her shittiness even after he throws away $30 billion in cash [b](and his dream to explore Mars)[/b] just for the chance to talk to her.[/i]\n\nEleanor had some incredibly moving character growth in Vol2, and decided to help Hal find his love after he rejected her. Holy shit.\n\nChris took care of Hal when he was crippled, and is now driven and strong willed individual that's about to take over the biggest Lunar Bank. It helps too that she's grown into a cutie as well.\n\nFuck, even Risa has a good case for Best Girl as well, but he has to pick the autistic girl that he thought cucked him with Barton.\n\nSeriously, I was so pissed I had to get up, punch the wall a few times, and take a few breaths before I could sit down and finish the series.\n\nUnfortunately, the story is the most important part of this kind of VN. As such, I cannot recommend the game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198076495316", "last_played": 1494463007, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 98, "playtime_forever": 276}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1494525573, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479414", "votes_down": 19, "timestamp_updated": 1494528281, "recommendationid": "31687517", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": false}]}
