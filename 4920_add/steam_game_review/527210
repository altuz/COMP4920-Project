There's a few bugs that will make the game unplayable. You have to completely back out of the match your playing and restart it in order to fix said bugs. The controls are also really strange. It's entirely keyboard controlled, which wouldn't be a problem except that it took me five minutes to figure out how to back out of a menu (hold down the left arrow, if you're stuck on that too). I also turned down the music and sound completely, but the game audio still played at an incredibly loud volume. Steam achievements also don't unlock until you close the game entirely. The entire process of playing felt like a hassle. It's a shame. The actual rock-paper-scissors style game is fun! If the controls were fixed and the bugs ironed out, I would definitely recommend Jarken Cards to others.\n\nEdit: Game developer replied to me with this:\n\"Janken Cards was designed for Nintendo Wii U but due to certain problems, including Switch's output, it was decided to launch the version for the steam, doing the portability to avoid reprogramming it again with the cost that entails.\n\nThe idea was with the money obtained in the sales of the game to reprogram it quickly, especially add the mouse, but these errors have been enough so that the video game did not have the expected sales.\n\nWe do not want to excuse or change your note, but you have to know that an indie company usually with very little budget often depends on your existence in sales of a video game if there are few sales dies, that is the reality of many of the video games that are on the steam.\"\n\nI would like to add that I'm aware that games on Steam are sold for a low amount of money. I regularly purchase games with low price tags from developers I'm not familiar with, especially indie developers. I like to promote and encourage new creators that are new and trying to bring their visions to the world. I also work as an independent writer. I know how fickle the marketplace can be. That's why the quality of content you create should never depend on the sales that you receive. As an indie developer, you should push for quality before your content is released, even if it is a port. Any bugs, glitches, or percieved negativity will damage your name and reputation. You will lose customers.\n\nTheir response came across as an excuse to me. I will no longer be playing this game, and any future games they release I will not purchase.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198120437431", "last_played": 1504945304, "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 391, "playtime_forever": 195}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504653146, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506109", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504995495, "recommendationid": "34766157", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
