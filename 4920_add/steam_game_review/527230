It takes a roguelike stance of providing a random world on each play through, while also bumping up the expected challenge through a time constraint: similar to what Pikmin 1 did or Faster Than Light. Movement on the overworld is tile based, and there is a certain kind of strategy and tactics formation that makes the game pretty fun... at first. \n\nAlso, as an aside, the graphics are pretty dang good and unique, while the music is a bit less impressive but still gets the job done. Perhaps the melodies are a bit too simple or similar to each other, and it wears a little over time, at least to me.\n\nHowever, I have to give the game a negative review for now. There is not enough choices for the player to make. Becuase the game is completely random, and the difficulty of the time constraint is so tight, there are very few actual meaningful choices you can make. The amount you move each turn is random, your damage is highly variant and random, the gold you receive doesn't create much oppurtunity. Every action you can make is completely random and very little of that randomness is based on any choices you can make, resources you can spend. Yes, there is a resource called focus that can bump up your consistency on rolls you choose to spend it on, but it doesn't cover up the problem nearly enough. I've completed the game on the easiest mode, and have taken a few cracks at the normal mode, but I end up getting frustrated at the form the difficulty in this game takes. I feel the choices you make are usually pretty obvious, but most of the challenge is artificially inflated by the fact that you have to navigate a completely randomized game world with a very tight time constraint, and very little you can do to make meaningful choices about the decisions available to you.\n\nIf the game were to change to reduce the variance from the random number generation, and put more control in my hands, while maintaining its current difficulty, I'd give it a good review.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040733451", "last_played": 1505473827, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_forever": 1394}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505474458, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505474458, "recommendationid": "34969427", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": " The people who are saying this is too hard, I think thats the point.

It's a great concept with a well-executed engine that is unfortunately plagued with horrific balance issues and unfortunate gameplay design choices that at present, make it disasterously un-fun to play.  I have hope that these issues will be addressed as the development continues, but I cannot in good conscience recomend it in its current form.\n\nFor the King is a \"boardgame\" style rogue-lite in which you are tasked with saving the realm from encroaching evil by completing a series of quests with a team of three heroes.  You start with four hero choices, and can unlock more as you accumulate \"lore\" on successive playthroughs.  The heroes are refreshingly versatile - All equipment can be used by all characters.  This means you can send your hunter into combat wielding a magical lightning staff if you want, but will he have the intelligence to use it effectively? You can move your team together to help with the tougher monsters, or you can spread them apart to divide and conquer.  This makes fighting enemies more difficult, but means you can take better advantage of other opportunities to earn perks and experience points before the lurking evil brings the curtain down.\n\nThe gameplay style is quick and fun - you jaunt across a randomly generated hex-map testing your attributes for fun and prizes.  Everything in the game, from how far you move each turn, to how hard you hit an enemy, to how likely you are to dig up a burired treasure, is accomplish by a skill check against one of your character's attributes - Vitality, intelligence, awareness, strength, etc.  Your attibute is a number from 1-100, which forms a percentage chance.  Every check is made by rolling a certain number of 100-sided \"dice\" and looking for a certain number of \"successes.\"  It's a quick, simple system that should be familiar to board game fans.  Several of the negative reviews I've seen about this game have been down on the \"Random Number Generator.\"  I have no problem with it.  It seems well balanced to me, and they've even given you an out: your characters have \"focus\" which can be spent to guarantee one or more successes on an important skill check.  \n\nThe Graphics are cute, and the overall experience is pleasing and bug-free.\n\nSo WHY, you're probably asking, is this a negative review?\n\nThe SYSTEM they've created for you to play this game within is very, very nice.  It's tight, simple, it's fun, it's light, yet it offers deep enough possibilities to let you really get into it.  Unfortunately, the actual GAME that you play within this system leaves a lot to be desired.  \n\nHere's the short version:  The game has terrible balance issues that dig your characters into holes from which no amount of good strategy will rescue you.  This means you will fail again and again.  On the surface, this seems in-line with the rogue-like style of game.  However, the game also has very little replay value, meaning that restarting feels pointless - knowing that you will be experiencing the exact same things as the last time.  The only reason to restart is a stubborn need to \"win,\" which is missing the point of a rogue-like.\n\nFor the TL;DR version, read on:\n\nFirstly, the game is designed to be played and re-played in the style of a \"rogue-like.\"  Unfortunately, you are given very little incentive to do so.  Although the map that you play on is randomized, the grand quest itself is identical each time, and you quckly memorize all of the stepping stones on this journey.  When you die (which is DESIGNED be frequent:  this is a rogue-like, after all), you are sent back to the start.... to do the same things in the same order you just did, starting from scratch.  It makes you wish they'd just abandon the rogue-like element and allow you to just save your progress before that boss-battle (identical to the last play-through) that has killed you an hour into your quest each time.  This lack of replay excitement makes it feel less like a rogue-like and more like trying to play through Mega Man II with no continues.  Take, by way of comparison - another recent Indie rogue-like game:  Battle Brothers.  In this game the map is rando, but additionally, the factions are rando, the enemies are rando, your OBJECTIVE is rando, the characters are WAY rando... And the replay value is through the roof!  After getting slaughtered each time, you just keep coming back for more.\n\nSecondly, while the combat SYSTEM itself is very nice (The RNG haters can shut up, IMHO), the ENEMIES you face are just disasterously annoying.  As a result, the combat (which is a centerpiece of the game) is a dreadful slog through a series of unavoidable debuffs, many of which persist even after the battle.   You simply can't get through a combat in this game without being set on fire, poisoned, cursed, and also probably bleeding out.  The debuffs are also waaay overpowered.  Some highlights of what I'm talking about:  \n\nA monster hits me!  I have alot of armor on, so I only take 1 damage from the blow!  Haha! take that, monster, I scoff at your puny attack!...which has left me bleeding for 8 damage in between rounds.  Before the battle is over I've taken 3 damage from being HIT by the enemy, and 16 damage from bleeding.  These are the little crunchy enemies you fight towards the beginning. Considering that your peeps start with around 30 health... this is a total WTF balance issue.\n\nPoison! Wait til you fight a gelatinous cube!  When the cube attacks, it poisons the character it targeted, and each character adjacent.  This means that if it targets the middle character, everyone's poisoned.  Poison does two things - it causes you to take 3 damage every round (game round, not combat round), and it also decreases each attribute by -5.  Also, poison persists. Game round to game round.  Until you die.  While slowly sapping your life force, the stat reduction makes everything you do to harder to succeed at.  But wait - there's more.  Poison is STACKABLE up to three times.  This means that you will frequently be suffering 9 damage each game round.  (Until you die.  Remember?  Around 30 health).  And your stats are at -15 each.  Now combine this with the curse (which persists) that you got from that ghost, and your starts are in some cases half of where they should be, meaning all you can do in combat is create a light breeze while your enemy tears you apart.\n\nNow, poison, curses, bleeding, etc, can each be removed by using a certain herb.  But here's the problem - they all require DIFFERENT herbs.  And these herbs are game-breakingly expensive to buy.  An herb to cure poison will cost you: I've seen it sold in different shops for anywhere from 9-28 gold.  A typical battle at early levels will earn you around 4-6 gold.  And now, get this - say you have 3 stacks of poison on you.  The herb will only remove ONE of the 3 stacks.  \n\nNow, add on the universal debuffs which seem to happen entirely randomly.  I was informed on game turn two of my most recent start that the ROYAL DROLL has arrived!
