In the early game, when the clicks seemed monumental, I felt overwhelmed. But, once I\u2019d purchased enough workers to semi-automate the cash flow, then the tools & backgrounds started unlocking. By the time I got the Kalashnikov rifle I was happy I\u2019d kept clicking. \n\nBut, then the late game opened up a whole new twist. [b]Secret messages and codes were discovered in the mine.[/b] I enjoyed reading the large enigma message hidden inside the game by the developer. He also added himself as a tool, and his face in the loot drops. It gives the game a personal touch as an Indie game.  \n\n[h1]Yes, I did every last click and couldn\u2019t quit this game until I had all the stuff! If you like clickers\u2026 I recommend this for you.
