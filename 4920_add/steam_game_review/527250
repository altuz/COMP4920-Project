The the music goes well with the game and swithces up a lot, keeping the ears happy. The music text and also seem to fit the 8-bit style. Speaking of which, the 8-bit designs used for the various sprites and buildings makes the game seem so simple despite having a good amount of detail. In other words, the graphics don't take away from the game at all and you can still tell what everything is, even from far away.\n\nThe gameplay istelf is very addicting and I find that the more I fail, the more I want to keep playing to see how far I can get. The random events that occur add to the flow of the game and make sure there aren't many dull moments. The goal of the game is to protect your village from different enemies every winter (cool that concept itself) and the fact that you can research things and improve your buildings and population makes it more complex than a normal survival game.\n\nAll in all, \"VilleTown\" is an unique, old-school looking tower defense game that keeps you playing constantly with real-time changing seasons.

You go three cycles building up your town, assigning citizens to various roles, and researching new abilities and structures.  During the fourth cycle, enemies will zerg rush your town, attacking every building in their path.  Your warriors and hunters will fight them and your builders will repair any damaged structures.  You can also help out by casting abilities that assist in battle.  After the cycle ends, life resumes for the next cycles until the next winter.\n\nGameplay is simple, yet engaging.  You must constantly pay attention to what resources you need, who needs jobs, what to research, and deal with occasional events that require the player to make a choice.  This occasionally got a little overwhelming, but once I got into the rythem of the game, I had no problem keeping up.  You just need to remeber to never let anyone be idle.\n\nAll in all, this is a neat little game and I'm glad I get to see the hardwork of my friends pay off.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198155245071", "last_played": 1474668477, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 65, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1474669346, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489352", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1474669346, "recommendationid": "25658947", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I love this game if you are not sure cheek out my youtube channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdQTASa6wNwj_B41ZgTQ8Pg", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198098358610", "last_played": 1483547816, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 20, "playtime_forever": 500}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1476798402, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1476798402, "recommendationid": "26101079", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "-Made a village\n-Assigned No one to defend it\n-Wolves came and destoryed everything\n\nOn the flip side it's fun\n\n\n\nWould rate str8 8/8 m8", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038052310", "last_played": 1475099698, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 171, "playtime_forever": 34}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1474772039, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489965", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1474772039, "recommendationid": "25683266", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not happy with the game.
