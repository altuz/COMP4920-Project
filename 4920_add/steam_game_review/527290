It is a game about fulfilling dreams and potential, with a strong message of \u201cit isn\u2019t the destination, it\u2019s the journey\u201d tied in for good measure.\n\nThe gameplay matches that aesthetic. From the very first step outside of your small, isolated town as Firis Mistlud, the world seems massive, daunting and full of wonder.
