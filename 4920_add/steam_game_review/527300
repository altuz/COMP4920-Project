Pretty simple.\n\nI would recommend this game if you have the money laying around but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it. It gets boring after about 15 minutes of playing because the game only has the one thing to do, which is fly and shoot orbs.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198135476858", "last_played": 1476673095, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 600, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1476673399, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512707", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1476673399, "recommendationid": "26081359", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}]}
