Not a game breaker and has been used in other VR games just reminds you that you are in game and breaks immersion.\n\nThat said I like the game and when in a section it can be pretty unearving (in a good way) \n\nI know the developers don't want to use trackpad movement as some peeps get sick but would be good to have the option for those who don't.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969613755", "last_played": 1478902146, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 384, "playtime_forever": 73}, "votes_up": 21, "timestamp_created": 1477952492, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510247", "votes_down": 15, "timestamp_updated": 1478030496, "recommendationid": "26344639", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Grave VR is excellent.
