I, for one, love these exploratory thrust physics shooters where the objective is as much about piloting safely through twisting caverns with cargo dangling precariously from your ship as it is engaging with hostiles.\n\nCaptain Kaon features satisfying twin stick shooting, doing away with a particular oldschool restriction where fixed aiming meant pointing your spacecraft squarely at your target -- not the simplest of tasks in cramped quarters with gravity's perpetual pull! It's a welcome, distinctly action-oriented modernization of the retro formula that Captain Kaon riffs on and, paired with frequent directions provided during any given mission, it makes the game far more accessible than its forebears. A non-linear campaign, an arsenal that grows progressively larger with completed missions, customizable loadouts that let you pick and choose your primary/secondary weapons plus a variety of ships to unlock all work to fill out the package quite nicely.\n\nThis was a day one purchase for me and I'm looking forward to playing (and inevitably replaying) the full set of Ceres missions! :)\n\nOn the Early Access front, my experience with the game included its fair share of bugs, rough edges and weirdness but nothing unpatchable. Captain Kaon, as of today, has been fully released but there's still a bit of iffiness with regard to controller support. Anyone hoping to use a favourite non-X360 gamepad would be well advised to run a controller emulator like x360ce as generic USB controllers, such as a Logitech Dual Action, aren't supported. Things get a little bit trickier then that, though, as it's possible to switch control priority over from mouse/keyboard to gamepad even while an unsupported generic USB controller is connected (suggesting that the gamepad [i]is[/i] detected), causing the mouse pointer to vanish and leaving no means to navigate the menu or revert to mouse/keyboard. This borked setting saves between sessions and it's only after a certain amount of blind clicking around that the game switches back to mouse/keyboard at the title menu. With all that out of the way, I'm happy to report that Captain Kaon plays really rather well with an Xbox 360 controller, although certain menus such as mission selection and loadout adjustment feel a bit clunky in their implementation.\n\nConfiguration is quite spartan at present, with display options providing a choice of windowed 1280x720 or scaled fullscreen, audio options nowhere to be found and no freedom to rebind controls. Default bindings are perfectly sensible for QWERTY keyboard users, though.\n\nNothing technical-wise here is a dealbreaker for me, but I must admit that the controller issues described above made for a bit of a rocky start. This is a super cool game and I [b]strongly[/b] recommend checking it out if you're craving something thrust-y.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057694897", "last_played": 1492226440, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 151, "playtime_forever": 117}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1479400490, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515018", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1492225673, "recommendationid": "26646374", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Retro style with solid controls, easy to get stuck into a 'one more level' loop.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197977973558", "last_played": 1487014066, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 182, "playtime_forever": 44}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1479553115, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493444", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1479553115, "recommendationid": "26688855", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Solar Jetwoman", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198135143088", "last_played": 1492138850, "num_reviews": 371, "num_games_owned": 556, "playtime_forever": 162}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1488862969, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485985", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1488862969, "recommendationid": "30366942", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great retro shooter, very satifying controls, thumbs up!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972357163", "last_played": 1480177030, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 275, "playtime_forever": 34}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1481886070, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478906", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1481886070, "recommendationid": "28402775", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
