The only reason for a downvote is b/c steam does not offer a neutral vote.\n\n[b]My downvote is simply for people looking for an ARPG to *play* who may be looking at this game in its current state. Dont buy it if thats your position. This game is not a full product and you'll just be dissapointed, write unfair reviews and may never actually play and enjoy the game on release. [/b]\n\nWith that said, if your happy with an ALPHA version which is still being worked on and want to be a part of the development, understand that things can and will change, your progress will be wiped and reset upon release and your still interested, jump on in. Just be aware this game wont be in a fully *playable* state for a few more months. \n\nWith that disclaimer in place, my opinions on the game so far.\n\nI love the premise of the game, the atmosphere is spot on for a 40k game IMO, the visuals are pleasing and updates continue to refine the visuals. Sound is not so good, some of the sounds seem out of place (some weapon sounds are off, again IMO, and I'm hoping theres still work to do in this area. The constant clanking when walking on some maps drives me nuts and could do with toning down some :P \n\nThe different weapons are great so far (I'm only level 10 so dont have access to all of them) and each time I think I've found a favorite weapon set up something new comes along and I'm changing things up. Some reviews have lamented melee as being poor in the game, I started as a melee crusader and had no real issues. You have to retreat at times to regroup and regen but over all I've not found melee on a crusader too bad. Melee on an Assassin is, more difficult, but doable. The evade system on the assassin needs work, having seperate keybinds for dodges is cumbersome and unweildey. I tried to bind shift+WASD to dodge, did'ent work ... hoping that gets addressed as it would make the assassin much more intuitive. Apparently function + action keybinds are not recognized by the system as of yet. \n\nI noted an appearance tab so have high hopes for colour and armor options in the future, atm armors, although really well modeled and fitting of the setting, get dull pretty quick with no option to colour / modify them to user tastes. \n\nLooking foward to more updates to test out and play around on including new classes (Hopefully they will eventually manage 5 or 6 classes to add to replay value) and new weapons, new factions, maps, etc, etc.\n\nGameplay looks slow on streams / youtube etc, in actual play though it does not *feel* as slow as it looks. Most abilitys have very low cooldowns and most cooldowns are skill based (Ie each skill has its own CD) allowing quick action. Your constantly making decisions on which enemys to deal with (AoE the weaker ones or big attakcs on the stonger ones) how to deal with them (Armor bypass weapons or attacks on armored foes, slows while you retreat, etc) while moving away from lobbed grenades and AoE attacks from them and ducking for cover when you can to regain some health/suppression to renew the attack. It makes for fairly dynamic gameplay and I'm really enjoying it.\n\nOverall I supported this game because of the developers previous title (Van Helsing) which I played and loved. This is NOT Van Helsing and does NOT play like it at all. Van Helsing is a more *traditional* ARPG which this steers away from. It was the Developers support of the previous title and the evolving story that hooked me, I'm hoping this game goes the same way with future content updates and DLC expansions which will keep me hooked for some time. The star map is expansive and assuming the Dev's can keep the ship on course and eventually fill that space with content and an evolving story I'll be happy for some time. The promise of lots of different mission types and expanding enemy factions to face should keep the game fresh.\n\nOverall I have high hopes and have put my money where my mouth is to support this game, /fingers crossed.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1579, "steamid": "76561198051556797", "last_played": 1506952581, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 58, "playtime_forever": 7440}, "votes_up": 88, "timestamp_created": 1505088925, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581590", "votes_down": 34, "timestamp_updated": 1505088925, "recommendationid": "34873734", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Hello here my review for Warhammer 40.000: Inquisitor Martyr\n\nFirst off the game is not released yet, it is in alpha state. For an alpha state it is quite playable. The developers said, that 60%-70% of all features are allready in the game. So now the problems begin. I played the game for like 15 hours, so i have seen enough to build a solid opinion about the game.\n\nOn the developer's website neocore.com the game is advertised as Open World and Sandbox. https://neocoregames.com/en/games/warhammer-40k-inquisitor-martyr for the people interested. It is neither Open World or Sandbox. \n\nDefinition of an Open world game:\n\nOpen world games are free-roaming, encourage discovery, have hidden secrets in the landscape, as you progress you can access more and more areas, all players are in the same big open world level, there are no loading screens to divide the levels into several instances.\n\nSandbox: You can do what you want to. You can craft things, play your style, the limitations and rules of the encourage player's to find their own playstyles and are not predefined by the game design. E.G for sandbox games Minecraft, Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies. You have player homes and can put furniture into them. You can modify the landscape, not a must. \n\nWar40kIM is not a open world game. You access levels over a text space sector map. There you can access the sector, from there you choose a star system on your level and the you get a picture of the planet or space station you are. You choose a mission and start your game. The missions are all randomly generated simple level structures. Some are open fields with borders you can not leave. The ice desert e.g. Most are just some corridors attached to each other.\n\nThe level variation is minimal. You have some tile sets now. Gothic space ship, Mushroom forrest, ice desert, Water planet with yellow water, Metal sky platform. That are all the levels i encountered in 15 hours playtime.\n\nThe monster variation isnt that great too.  \n\nThey are divided in factions: \nFaction Imperial rebells: So there are imperial gardists soldier, Armored soldiers, Captains Champion, Ogryns Ch., Bullgryns Ch. . Sentinels, AT-ST like walkers, Leman Russ demolisher, eradicator ELITE.\n\nFaction Nurgle, Nurglings, Nurgle melee, Nurgle ranged soldier, Nurgle flamethrower, Nurgle grenadelauncher, Sorcerer, Nurge Marines with different weapons, Plaguebearer, Standartbearer, Nurge Ogryns, Nurgle Dreadnaughts, Nurgle.-Apostel.\n\nFaction Space Marine Traitor': Cultists, Melee cultists, Cultits with different ranged weapons. Wordbearer Space Marines with different Weapons, Wordbearer Sorcerer, Wordbearer Chaoscybot, Wordbearer Minititan Destroyer.\n\nWarning:\nEdit: Now they are pushing their ingame currency FATE very hard. They even state that you can buy content DLC in the future per ingame currency. That smells like F2P mechanics too me. A full price game with F2P mechanics.\n\nOfftopic: The DLC of Van Hellsing another project of the developer's had no free DLC. As owner of the basic version of van hellsing and all the dlcs you had to buy the hd remake version again.  The VanHellsing servers were allso not available all the time during the lifespan of the game. There was a gap of 6 month were the online server and your characters were not available. And after the servers went online, all your characters were deleted. Sorrry guys, we made a failure, but your characters are gone. \n\nIs War40kIM a Sandbox game:There is crafting of items for your character. That is not enough for a sandbox game sorry guys. The game is no sandbox.\n\nWar40kIM is a pure dungeon runner with limited randomly generated levels at this time. If there will be handcrafted story levels with interesting things to do in the future i can not say. We will see.\n\nMission design: Now there are 5 mission types in the game. \nKill everything\nKill marked targets\nDownload Data\nPurify the shrines, side mission\nDestroy 3 Warpgates.\n\nAll missions use these 5 mission types now. That is very limiting. Will hopefully improve in the future.\n\nClasses: You have now 2 classes, Assassin and Crusader.\n\nGameplay:\nYou point&click on the map to run somewhere. You point at an enemy to attack them. You have melee weapons and ranged weapons. All weapons have skills on them. A onehand weapon has 2 skills, 1 singletarget 1 area attack mostly, or autofire on ranged weapons. 2hand weapons have 4 skills. You get one utility slot for grenades or force fields that block damage for a short time period. You have an armor skill slot. Each character class has 3 armor types.\n\nCrusader: Sentinel with a turret, Assault with a jump pack to travel short distances, and an armor with a rocket launcher that fires a salvo of missiles at targets. The cyclone launcher is buggy now. If you use it with a single hand weapon and a shield it only fires one missile. If you use it with a 2hand weapon it fires the full salvo1\n\nAssassin: Stealth suits, Time stopper armor, Holofield generator.\n\nStealth suit gives you invisibility. It does not work now. Monsters see you when you get in range. Even a ranged sniper assassin can not get into range under stealth without being detected. IF you attack the stealth breaks instantly.\n\nTime stopper is useful. You get a bubble around the location you fired the skill, in this bubble the enemies are slowed and your attacks do more damage, surprise attack mechanic.\n\nHolofields are somewhat usefull. You get 2 hologramms of yourselve that distract the enemy. But mostly the enemies keep shooting me, if i am in the area. The holo fields have no aggro mechanic. The enemy does only shoot them if you are not in the area in my experience.\n\nYou have a medium large, compared to path of exile, passive skill tree. You have to unlock most skill tree branches by doing heroic deeds, like killing 5000 enemies with heat or taking 1 million damage. All your characters share an account level. By doing normal missions you get account points. These level your account. For each level you get one skill point. You can put your skill point in your skill tree. The skill tree has amazing skills like 1,5 % more melee damage or 1,5% more ranged damage, or 1% crit or 150 more hp of your 4500 starter hp as crusader.\n\nAccount levels need a really long time to level. I played for 2 weeks and i am only account level 10 of 200. I hope you like grinding.\n\nYour character has a rank. You level rank through rank and tarot missions. Tarot missions cost Fate points. Fate points you get for doing heroc deeds, special world missions, like killing 20 elites. You get 5 to 10 fate points per mission. A tarot mission costs 90 to 100 fate points. So you have to do like 10 to 15 normal missions to do one tarot mission.  I hope yxou like grinding.\n\nGameplay variation is low. It plays like your first Action rpg regarding the tactical and deep factors.\n\nMovement speed. Putting skill points into the movement skill tree is mandatory. Without putting points there your crusader character in power armor will move like a snail. But hey it is fun to crawl around at snails speed in an ACTION rpg or isnt it?\n\nCover mechanic: You get improved armor and resilience in cover, You regenerate more hp in cover, enemies do far less damage to you in cover. Cover breaks instantly in harder missions. \n\nMy personal opinion: Cover mechanics are bad. They destroyed the FP-Shooter genre. Who thought it would be creative or even remotely good to put cover mechanics into the action rpg genre. IT IS CALLED ACTION RPG not Cover Behind Wall RPG  (CBW-Rpg).\n\nText got too long. i do not like scores. I would give the game a 6 /10 in its current state.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis review is based on the current alpha build of the game. I will change the review according to changes in the game. It is based on my experience of the game and my opinion.\n\nThank you for reading, i hope you found my review helpful.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 99, "steamid": "76561197980333161", "last_played": 1506112267, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 863, "playtime_forever": 1881}, "votes_up": 35, "timestamp_created": 1505229893, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555588", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1506022439, "recommendationid": "34903268", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "i was pondering for a while if i could recommend this or not, but the longer i play it the more i enjoy it!\n\nchances are pretty big, that if you are looking into reviews for a 40K-game, that you like warhammer 40.000, so that as a given you will most likely enjoy this. the grimdark people want from the universe is there, the violence and unforgiving world are on point. \nthe visuals are more than nice and the game still runs ok, if not brilliantly. i bought worse \"finished\" games ;)\nthe color-palette is of course rather desaturated, but not just grey/brown. the demonic stuff sticks out quite a lot. it is not too varied, which lies in the way the universe is always described. but since you can be planetfall or inside of spacecrafts etc it is not always just the same. some of the environments are desctructable to a certain degree and if you look for it, there are quite a few chances to benefit from that.\nsound is good, but not amazing. very fitting overall even tho a few lines of voice over are still missing. \nthe missions are fun but, and that is my main gripe with the game: rather repetetive. the whole game seems to be.\ni would normally say that is a bad thing, but if the gameplay is fun: more of the same good thing can't be bad. but be warned, things obviously won't change much.\n\nthe biggest problem i have with inquisitor martyr is that they keep advertising it as \"open world sandbox\". huh what? i may have a different understanding of what \"open world\" and \"sandbox\" mean, but this is not it. they are clearly used as buzz words.\n\nthis is how the main gameplay loop goes:\n\u00b7 start in your ship where you can do crafting, shopping, inventory management and leveling etc.\n\u00b7 then go to the starmap, look through the available sectors and missions, maybe pick some perks (when doing investigations) and then jump into said mission.\n\u00b7 play the mission untill you reach the objectives (sometimes you may keep playing to make sure you pick up everything or kill every traitor etc if that should not be part of the victory conditions.) the maps are fairly big and it will take you a while. be warned most of the time you are not allowed to die more than a few times before the mission fails.\nwhile playing the pace is most of the time rather slow and there is not too much emphasize on the A in ARPG honestly.\n\u00b7 recieve rewards and go back to your ship\n\u00b7 start over\n\nthis is NEITHER OPEN WORLD NOR SANDBOX if you ask me. it is fun and there is a lot to do, but not what you are lead to believe.\nmaybe i'm just being overly critical. or they will add more. we'll see.\n\n\ntl;dr:\n\ncons:\n- neither open world nor sandbox\n- rather slow paced for an ARPG\n- quite repetetive gameplay\n(- still some placeholders, 'cause early access)\n\npros:\n+ beautiful grimdark as it should be\n+ a lot to do, even if it is the same thing over and over, because...\n+ ...it will never grow old to blast heretics into bits, chop off limbs or explode dreadnoughts\n+ nice progression (account progression, not just the individual chars)\n+ the game is oozing with atmosphere\n(+ stable for an early access game)\n\n\nin short the game is halfway between Diablo and Chaos gate. in every aspect: pacing, variety, loot amount, leveling system. i'd say people who enjoyed both of those and are fiending for a good 40K-game: this is it!\nif that is worth the price they ask for it, is up to you.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "steamid": "76561197970687383", "last_played": 1506453142, "num_reviews": 45, "num_games_owned": 888, "playtime_forever": 1784}, "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_created": 1504627484, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524589", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1504628133, "recommendationid": "34759516", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you are a WH 40K fan, and enjoy games like Path of Exile and Diablo looters, this is the game you've been waiting for.\n\nWriting a review for a game that is in early access is strange, since you cannot really review it fully.

Not sure if this could change after alpha.\nCombat- On easier missions you will feel like a primarch, but on the tougher ones you will be tested and rewarded for tactical decision making, use of cover, and having an overall effective character build. Combat has a nice flow to it, with fighting-retreats being a valid and almost necessary component of your approach. \nSetting:- The 'hub' is the bridge of your Inquisitorial space ship, and each mission takes place on one of many planets. I feel like there are currently about 8 different unique map settings for the randomly generated missions. Manufactorum, mining platform, underhive etc. It feels right.\n\n\nCons:\n\nLeveling- currently kind of slow but that is said to change eventually. Can also be a bit confusing as to what activities are most beneficial.\nCamera- You can turn it but you cannot tilt it. Not sure if this is intentional or if tilt will be added later. \nStill in Alpha- There are lots of things that the devs will improve, but are currently not finished. The campaign consists of placeholder missions. Much of the crafting research tree is still unavailable. Creating your own missions can be buggy.
