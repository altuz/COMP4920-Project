I was always a fan of the Arkanoid games and block-breaking games in general, and this is a great game that draws from those games in it's own unique way. Please, keep working on this game; it has so much potential to become even greater than it already is.\n\nAfter typing, I realized that I got on and rambled. TL;DR I love this game, it has wonderful music, design, and is overall very replayable. 9/10, because I feel it could be so much more if the community asked it of the devs to add things to it.\n\nNow, on to the actual review, which shouldn't be too long.\n\nEM: Shader Attack is a wonderful game that draws from famous previous games such as Arkanoid to create a block breaking game that is quite enjoyable. If you ever enjoyed any games of that genre, you will enjoy this game, short as it may be.\n\nThis game has a beautiful art design, with all sorts of shapes that will appear in the background as you play, bounce the ball around, collect powerups... pretty much all of the actions and occurrences in this game will have some sort of effect on the background. It's so captivating that you will often lose yourself and lose a life if you're not careful. ;3 Along with this, you have the EM mode, which when activated changes the design of the background and the different parts of the game, making it even more intense and definitely meriting the seizure warning. The wonderful part of this is that there is a setting in the menu that you can use to reduce the imagery to a more basic form, which is still beautiful but is so much less likely to cause a seizure.\n\nThe actual gameplay is what you expect of this type of game: the simplistic moving from side to side and bouncing the ball off of different blocks, while trying to catch powerups. The paddle can be controlled using keyboard, mouse, or even gamepad controls if you feel like using them. Right now, there is only one gamemode, but there are many level designs that the game chooses from randomly for each ten level set that you play. While being simplistic, however, this does not imply it is an EASY game. Since the levels are generally easy and done in (at the most) 5 minutes, you would think that I've beaten the game multiple times in the 60 minutes shown. I have only succeeded once.So far, I have lost more than 20 times, and my beating the tenth level became hinged on one moment where I was blessed with a little bit of luck. For this reason, this game is so much fun and yet a great challenge; in only the short span of an hour, I became enthralled. Even better, this is the type of game that is perfect for when you need to wait on something, like a video or waiting for someone to arrive.\n\nAll in all, this game is great fun for the low price of $2, or whatever the price is in other currencies. In my opinion, the game is a 9/10, if only because I feel that more gamemodes could be added to increase the fun and challenge of the game. I have no doubt that the community (who voted this game up here) would have no problem with helping the devs create more maps for it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198174183209", "last_played": 1490671142, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_forever": 140}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1477615351, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491724", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1480301873, "recommendationid": "26254081", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is very well made and features the creavite and innovative customisation of such a simplistic game.
