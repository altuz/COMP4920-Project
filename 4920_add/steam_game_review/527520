However it is a decent enough low cost military FPS shooter. Very much like the old delta force series, it is best described as functional. Sadly it is let down by some bugs as well as twitchy mouse sensitivity. The AI also has room for improvement.  Graphics are also pretty low-fi. \n\nHowever for the cost of the game, it is a fun enough time filler as long as you don't expect a CoD killer.
