I have to say I was going to give up on it and get a refund.  But then I played the fourth level \"Hightower\", I think that's what it was called.  Defending the castle at night (second half of level).  When you have wizards casting magic against your enemies in the dark, it feels like being a kid watching fireworks for the first time.  I was going to give up on it but I'm glad I didn't.\n\n08/10\n\nCons and work-ons (updates please)\nTeleporting - it needs to be a one button thing, you shouldn't be penalized for not having a good shot while moving. 2nd level is an example.\nTutorial on setting up defenses - like step by step tutorial!\nEasier mechanic to switch hands with bow, I still can't do it.\nHands feel a bit off for holding the bow.  It seems like the bottom of the bow is closer to the body and the top of the bow is further away from the body - for a while I thought it was my hands, its not.\nAiming is a bit more off to the left than it should be.\nAdd a cross bow option, the mechanics can't be that far off.\n\nI loved it, otherwise.  Just beat level 4 before I had to quit, gotta do some wife time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 32, "steamid": "76561198041938845", "last_played": 1506567558, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 222, "playtime_forever": 101}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505017548, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505017548, "recommendationid": "34852968", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "One of my favorite VR games so far.
