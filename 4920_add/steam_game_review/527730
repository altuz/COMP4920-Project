This might be ok for a game priced so low, but there are much better games that are cheaper (free even) that do everything this game does and more such as Open Transportation Tycoon Deluxe (OTTD for short) and Simutrans. \n\nThe only thing this game adds compared to OTTD and Simutrans are very tedious gameplay elements such as having to buy different types of fuel for your busses, as well as MANUALLY repairing roads and setting up stop lights. The graphics are a little nicer than OTTD and Simutrans, the day/night cycle looks cool, but thats about all it has going for it. \n\nAll that being said, if OTTD and Simutrans seem too complicated for you but you still want to play a transportation tycoon sorta game, this might be the game for you as its much more simple to understand and play. Otherwise, just play OTTD and/or Simutrans, focus just on busses and you'll be having just as much fun or even more than this game. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961204400", "last_played": 1474654723, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 1339, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 35, "timestamp_created": 1474655535, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530499", "votes_down": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1474655535, "recommendationid": "25655091", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[b]EDIT:[/b]\n\nThis game was made in Game Maker Studio. (https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/bus-tycoon-nd-night-and-day-steam-greenlight.4120/) which explains the lack of Graphic Settings. Not that GM is a bad program, it's just a point to make that that's probably why the graphic settings aren't here and likely will never be there. Just something to think about.\n\n--\n\nBefore I start. I bought this game for three main reasons. \n\n1. I'm waiting for a huge back catalog of Porn to download from a server before I cancel my server. \n2. I like bus games. I like Tycoon games. And, the developer notes look like they were made in Google Translate. I'm excited. \n3. Looks to have quite easy to gain achievements and isn't going to make me want to end myself trying to gain them.\n\nNow for the review. \n\nIf you are running BullGuard, this game is going to flag up as a Suspicous File. You're going to have to whitelist the application for it to run at all. The reason for the false flag is BullGuard loves to think anything that has an Uninstall file is bad. \n\nThis game has no graphic settings or an actual menu system. Once you open it, your screen will go black and then just throw you into the game tutorial. It would be  nice for the game to have some basic Graphic Settings, such as decrease the UI size. The UI is extremely blurry FullScreen on a 1920x1080 23\" monitor.  It did, however look fine on my 18\" DELL piece of crap monitor. \n\nYou have to build the roads between the towns, place bus stops as well as place traffic lights and such. One thing I would suggest is definitely going through the tutorial at the start of the game. \n\nI didn't even realise there was one, so if you need to start it again (it does not restart your game, it's more just hints if anything else) just press the Settings Cog on the left hand side of the screen and it'll restart the hint tutorials for you. You're going to accidently place a lot of stuff as well. Why? You place roads with right click... but you also navigate around the map with right click. Werid. \n\nThe game runs nice, and it's quite a peaceful wee game, it does not have any background music (by default) however, so a lot of the time you're literally just watching some buses move without any music or anything, which can get a little dull. There's a guide though that shows you how to enable music. \n\nYou start off with two buses, both gasoline, and as you progress through the game you unlock more buses (diesel etc). One problem is though, is that the game doesn't actually tell you how you  progess to unlock more buses. Something I did eventually figure out though, was that if you purchase that type of Gas, IE. Diesel and have it in your Gas Station, you can then buy that type of bus. So from the looks of it, you have to purchase the gas type, to then purchase the bus. Which makes sense, it just doesn't tell you.\n\nOnce you have a few buses going, the game does start to go a lot faster and you do gain money quite a bit faster. The money that you gain *only* goes towards buying new buses though. You can place roads, bus stops and whatever else you like without having to pay. Which I thought was quite odd but I'm not going to complain since Buses cost between $750,000 and $2,000,000. Ouch. \n\nA small, yet very annoying bug, is that when you want to right click on the Service Station to purchase a new bus, you have  to be on the Settings Menu to do so, or it won't pick it up, as it thinks  you're wanting to place an item like a road or something. This also applies when you want to Right Click on a bus to change it's path, sell it or send it to the Garage. It seems like they need to add a specific button on the side of the screen that let's you click on these things. It wouldn't be an issue doing it with the Setting sbutton, but it flings a small menu out across your screen at the same time, which is a bit annoying. It does seem that at some points however, that you can click on buses & service station without having to be in the settings menu, again an odd bug, it seems like it doesn't always pick up the click. \n\nSomething the game doesn't tell you during the tutorial, or really anywhere, is that your buses run out of fuel and need to be serviced. On the top right of the screen there are some small icons, with numbers under them. (Some have locks when you start the game), these are how many barrels of that specific gas type the Gas Station has left. If it runs to 0, you have to buy more gas - by right clicking on the gas station, something the game does not tell you. \n\nOnce you hit 10 days of service, you get a reward of $750,000. Enough to purchase a new, cheapest, bus. This applies to each type you hit a new milestone, 20, 30, 40 & 50 days. \n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]The game fails to tell you how to do a lot of things. It's definitely a game where you have to randomly click to see how to do things. \n    [*] The lack of graphical settings is a huge bummer. It would be nice to be able to run the game in Windowed Mode to keep an eye on other things running on your computer, or even be able to watch a YouTube video or something at the same time. The game went very glitchy when I tried to do this with my second monitor on, as it just tabbed out the game. \n[/list]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n   [*] Very easy achievements to get if you're into that. Which I am. :-)\n   [*] Very chill game that can kill some time while you're waiting in an Airport or downloading Porn. \n[/list]\n\nFor just under 2GBP, it's a good game that I am enjoying. I'll probably only play it a few times, and then it'll end up gathering dust in m Library, but a good game none the less. It does definitely seem like it should be on Mobile, and not a PC game, which may explain why it has no Graphic Settings what-so-ever, however. \n\nIf you're looking for a cheap game to kill some time, I'd definitely recommend it - but don't expect this amazing huge game, because it's far from it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035138701", "last_played": 1474819213, "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 584, "playtime_forever": 64}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1474646782, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513967", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1474647500, "recommendationid": "25652771", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great little game!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198138468771", "last_played": 1502087171, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 76, "playtime_forever": 315}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1475285238, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497230", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1475285238, "recommendationid": "25791536", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great game, could use a few improvements to make gameplay slightly more tollerable, but really fun and elegant.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065753639", "last_played": 1477169583, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 396}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1475121764, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494455", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1475121764, "recommendationid": "25760190", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Easy game to understand, pretty fun way to kill a couple of hours at a time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198083773848", "last_played": 1474938191, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 249, "playtime_forever": 77}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1474918412, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494455", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1474918412, "recommendationid": "25715013", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's a nice simple game, however the price of \u00a31.99 ( i got it for \u00a31.69 due to a sale) is not worth it, a price of 99p would be much more suitable.
