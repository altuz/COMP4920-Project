The game gives me a headache because it's trying too hard to be old-school to the point that it barely even has options (you can'change controls or resolution). They just made an \"old\" game instead of an \"old-school\" game because it looks like it's made in 1993. And I don't mean that as a compliment. \nWhen the games that your game is based on are much better overall you have to ask yourself why you're even making the game. \n\nThe game is intentionally made this way (it can run on Windows 98), but I still don't think that old-school gamers would want a game with the same limitations of games from 20 years ago.\n\nIf you want to see what a real old-school FPS should feel like try GUN GODZ.

There is now a version of the game that does not use the Mouse, thank god! You can now play it like Wolfenstein 3D... BUT it's not in the base game! You have to OPT into the \"BETA\" to get the no mouse option. The game also recived some minor improvements, like the screen flashing red when you get hurt, and all enemies playing sounds... But the game is still the same, and still isn't very fun. It still has the same problems as stated before.\n\nI figured I'd continue off of my last save file, which was at level 4... but my save file does NOT transfer over to the \"No Mouse\" version, and I could not pull myself to try and sit through the first 4 levels again. I got half way through the first level and remembered why I hated it so much.\n\n_____________________________\n\nWell my first impressions of this game was not a good one. Having spent only CDN$ 1.64 on this... And not being able to play it right off the bat made me sad. In my original review I was not able to play the game without it crashing. Having to go though loops to try to get it to work, \t[strike] it resulted to me having to REMOVE a file which had the \"story\" for me to be able to play. Dev helped with the quick fix. [/strike] *No longer an issue.\n\nHaving spotted this on the Steam New Releases it quickly caught my eye, as I'm a poor sucker for retro/old school shooter games (as I was literally raised with games like Wolfenstein 3D and DOOM II,) and having $2 in my Steam wallet, I grabbed it to give it a shot...\n\nWell this game has some problems.\n\nThe first minor problem, the weapon graphics are WAY more detailed than everything else. While the game has the same graphical levels as Wolfenstein 3D and Operation Bodycount, the weapons look like they came from a Duke Nukem 3D mod. They just simply don't fit with the game.\n\nThe second minor problem, [strike] is the lack of feedback when you are being hit, [/strike] and how AI can hit you from pretty much around corners. You will just see your health start dropping, and look around to try and find who's hurting you, only to see an enemy on the other end of the room, just barely poking out from around the corner shooting you. I've only made it to the 4th level, and this is the common situation it seems.\n\nThe third minor problem, the levels are big and are easily confusing to navigate. The FIRST level is all brown and green, with tons of trees and vines. There is no map feature in this game, so you will end up getting turned around and end up wandering trying to figure out where the hell you are supposed to go.\n\nBut...\n\n\n*This is fixed with the \"No Mouse\" version, but as that is not included in the main game, and you have to OPT into it, therefore it's still present.*\n\nThe BIGGEST problem with this game that makes this a Not Recommend, needs to be explained.\n\nYou are FORCED to use mouse to look around and shoot. Why is this bad? Well when you try to look around with the mouse, you get a very nauseating screen tear that really hurts the eyes and very hard to focus on what your looking at. Now here is where it gets better... YOU CAN ONLY SHOOT WITH THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON!! There is no keyboard button for shoot, and you can't change controls either, cause there is no options menu. You can use the WASD to move, and arrow keys to look around (which does NOT have the screen tearing effect), but then you can't shoot. So you are forced to use the mouse, which has a slow and painful turn speed, when it works. Combine that with the tearing effect make this game 100% unplayable. I was only able to make it to level 4 before I had to stop.\n\n\n\nPROS:\n- Retro Win 98 game.\n- Good graphics.\n- Good sounds.\n- Good soundtrack.\n- Dev has updated the game fixing some problems.\n- Now has a \"No Mouse\" version.\n- Steam Trading Cards.\n\nCONS:\n- It's an old Win 98 game... Seriously.\n- Mouse look is game breaking terrible.\n- Mouse look causes screen tearing, makes your eyes bleed.\n- Levels are big and confusing. Can easily get lost.\n- No Map feature.\n- Only options is audio options.\n- No key re-binding.\n- [strike] Lack of hit feedback. Makes you feel like you are dying for no reason. [/strike]\n- [strike] Was not able to read the story, due to a game breaking crash/error. [/strike]\n- No Achievements.\n- Merger 3D has suddenly stopped working and has to close. Would you like to submit a report to Windows to help fix this problem?\n\n\nIt PAINS me to be giving this the thumbs down, but it's not good.
