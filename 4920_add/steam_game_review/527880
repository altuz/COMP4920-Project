I admit i was super excited about this game being in a haunted house and having to get around the spooks and from then ending of the trailer i had seen is what made me buy it, i wish it had more of that as that was what i was interested in, its hard to scare me and this certainly got me on the edge of my seat, however when that came to an end and i was outside i felt like i'd kinda was in a silent hill game with the fog and no one around and fighting monsters. I love the idea of going into first person mode when entering a house as it gives more suspense as to whats around the next corner and you feel like your more into the game than just a character. I like where this game is going but i loved being in the scarey haunted appartment more than the outside, it got me more on edge, i  hope it continues with the jumpscares as its rare to find good ones in games. I look forward to playing the full release.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "steamid": "76561198352311451", "last_played": 1506452920, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_forever": 72}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506453955, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503194", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506453955, "recommendationid": "35228565", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I personally thought this game was pretty nice.
