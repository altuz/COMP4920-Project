First of all no steam achievements (just in-game), second of all I know I spent many hours getting all the achievements yet it did not give me the achievement for \"reading each note at least once.\"  I have been through the journal multiple times and the achievement never popped.  So I thought well I will just go back into the bonus chapter and re-read each page.  NOPE!  You CANNOT replay either the main game nor any of the bonus/hidden chapters under the same profile.  You have to start a new profile to replay the game.  That means you have to redo EVERY achievement just to get the one thing you missed.  \n\nWhat I usually like about mad-head games is that they give you the opportunity to replay the HOGs and find all the morphing objects after you have completed the game.  Unfortunately, they don't give you access to the journal to read all of that after the game nor do they allow you to re-play the game. \n\nAs to the story line and the HOPs and Puzzles, it was \"Ok.\"  A lot of the puzzles were kind of silly and didn't take much thought.  The HOPs were plentiful and challenging, but several of them were just a lot of twigs or flowers that you had to count the petals or leaves/stems to find the correct objects.  Not my idea of fun.  The story felt jumbled and not that rich.  I did enjoy the \"hidden chapters\" as they were just short little puzzles that were kind of fun.  \n\nSo from now on, no more MadHead games for me unless they come with STEAM achievements.  Wouldn't take much for them to add them.  \nI don't recommend the game just for that reason.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198157036927", "last_played": 1485536862, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 393, "playtime_forever": 424}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1485452949, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525352", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1485452949, "recommendationid": "29506006", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Surprisingly good.
