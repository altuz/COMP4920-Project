I noticed a great amount of the in game assets... Are very similiar if not exact to the game this is inspired by (Star Wars Galaxies) such as the hairstyles and very much especially the skill tree which has nearly class by class and skill box for skill box resemblance. While I do hope a SWG 2.0 becomes a thing, there is a lot of work to be done, especially in terms of producing original asset content if this going to be the price tag of this game and it's MMO parent (Divergence Online). \n\nI wandered around for about 30 minutes and the world felt more like a tech demo to me than an actual Early Access game I normally find on Steam. I clipped through the ground multiple times, there appeared to be no spawns of any sort of lootable objects within the vicinity, even outside the starting zone. Clicking on objects is very glitchy, and apparently examining things doesn't work at the moment. Granted I did read the noob tip that spawning is currently haywire, so there is that to go with. However I cannot recommend somebody pay a steep 30 bucks for this, maybe in the future when it is more polished.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197968970574", "last_played": 1477126900, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 189, "playtime_forever": 31}, "votes_up": 28, "timestamp_created": 1477127689, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518295", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1477127689, "recommendationid": "26159815", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I bought the game with some reservations.

What follows is an honest accounting of the current state of the game -  everything here can be verified.\n\nBefore you seriously consider sinking money into this game, even on a speculative basis, you should look at ther reviews for \"Divergence: Online\".      Consider how many years have passed and led to the reviews as you read each one,  positive and negative, and decide for yourself if you have faith that either of these games will ever truly amount to anything worth playing.   \n\n[b]This is not a new game, just more of the same with a different skin.[/b]\nEffectively, what you have here is the result of taking the same base engine and UI, downloading an assortment of \"modern survival\" assets from the Unity Store, and rebranding D:O for a different audience.      While this sort of pivot isn't bad, in and of itself, the reasons behind this \"prequel\" are suspect considering the original game could have been enhanced using the original title.   Instead, the developer cited that the original audience for D:O was \"too niche\" to make further development financially feasible, so you end up with what you see here which is a fairly blatant money grab and no better as a game than D:O, which is the product of several years of effort.\n\n\nPlease do not buy this game if you expect, ...well.., an actual game.   \nThis feels more like your college buddy's experiments with a commercial engine as he puttered around and made some mishmash game which barely runs and every game system feels like a cardboard cutout storefront in a fake western town on some B-movie film lot where things may appear pretty from the outside but nothing really works.  The developers themselves, especially Ethan, are openly rude and dismissive.  Verify this yourself by simply reading their responses to criticism in Divergence Online reviews and  forums.    Support from the dev team on their first EA title or their handful of game support folks can take days or weeks, and that's if you find the support channel or forum they happen to be paying attention to that week and if you phrase the request in the precise format that leaves them with the fewest lookups - again, verify this for yourself on the forums.\n\n[b]\"Pay No Attention To The Man Behind The Curtain\"[/b]\nPlease don't buy this game on speculation, based solely on people throwing such words around as \"promise\" or \"potential\".   Those two words are the anethema to useful reviews as all they do is spotlight the shallow foundational shell of a game which really has more to do with the engine than the game itself, which is devoid of content or direction, and give zero consideration for the multitude of systematic flaws at the core of the game's immature and ameteur development team, broken developlent process, and questionable business/support model.\n\nInform yourself with even a little research on this game.  If, ultimately, you decide you want to support this game with your financial support, despite every warning online against doing so, don't say you weren't warned.   If you do buy the game, buy it through Steam instead of through the game's own web storefront.  If you do not buy it through Steam you will likely never receive a refund should you choose to pursue one.   Remember also that you have up to two weeks and cannot exceed two hours of \"played\" time if you want to return the game through steam.  Trust me, two hours is plenty to see this product for what it is.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018478390", "last_played": 1477426032, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 188, "playtime_forever": 41}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1477427850, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501668", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1477716257, "recommendationid": "26220904", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Alpha Smalpha!!!
