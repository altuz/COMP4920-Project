Difficult!\n\nThis game is hard as hell.  I haven't experienced any glitches or bugs in my time playing.\n\nAt the start I also was like 'bad movement, die too quick, enemies take a million hits to die' = poor game.  All of that was wrong.  I'm still not some legendary gymnast fencer, but getting experienced with hard and quick weapon swing timing plus the backstep, high jump AND LOW JUMP ('hop' in the controls) is game changing.\n\nA very cool part of this game is how it enforces being spoiler free.  There is virtually nothing out there on how win / find stuff / what the various choices you make do - the discussion forums on Steam are the best resource right now and they're not very spoilery at all.  \n\nHonestly it's just really good.  I'm writing this with 11.3 hours in - I don't know if I'll put more in as I am gated by just really difficult bosses now, but the journey here, now paved with many dead npcs, was very enjoyable.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198078230626", "last_played": 1504925753, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 699, "playtime_forever": 769}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504693196, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500454", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504869918, "recommendationid": "34772861", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
