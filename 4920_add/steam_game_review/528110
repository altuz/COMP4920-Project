There is a lot more to this game than first meets the eye. I'm really enjoying it, and getting that, \"I'll play just a little bit longer\" disease that we're all aware of.\n\nThe game seems to revolve around one character that you create, although you can sign contracts with other players too. You need to really think about how to develop your players properly. It's harder than it seems.\n\nThe only knocks I have on this game are that it seems really hard to make money (which you need to hire better coaches). Only the major tournaments seem to pay anything. Also for some reason the game ends when your created character retires.\n\nI also think 19.99 is too much for this content, even though the game does play well. I'd wait for a sale.\n\nThis is worth picking up if you like management sims.

Not all of us want to play ridiculously Hollywood-esque \"first person simulations\" where graphics and endorsement by, say, the world's top ten players only are traditionally considered to be essential elements of the game mix. And here is a game that takes a very different view, illustrating brilliantly that there are STACKS of very good players, thousands of tournaments and that to get to the top it is a LONG HARD STRUGGLE\nTo me it doesn't matter that the players did not endorse this, I think all the top 100 and more are based on real players anyway and it can be quite fun to work out who is who (pretty sure I saw Mark Venus in there, so the knowledge of the sport from the developer is top class)\nWhat makes this game so much fun is that it is unashamedly full of little details which can become crucial (for example if your player stops practising an element of his/her game he/she will actually get worse at it over time.\nI would be delighted if enough people invested in this so that one day perhaps there could be a version with the option of viewing matches in a slightly more hi-res format but it doesn't actually matter that much.
