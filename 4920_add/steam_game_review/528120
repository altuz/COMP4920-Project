I am very disappointed.\nI waited for this game to be on sale \u2013and I am glad that I did. From mine point of view it is not worth the money. Not even the sale price.\nThe story is somewhat okay for a HOG, but you do forget the story doing so many other none important and often illogical issues.\nThe puzzles are illogical/confusing and do not always connect to the story. The hogscenes are just plain boring: You just have to find the match to the silhouettes. \nThe worst part for me was the frustrating part of the map. After you are leaving a significant part of your life, you have to go back over again and again and again to find special objects. The map is so important to finish the game. The map is SO impotant.\nOh: And sometimes the map doesn\u2019t even make any sense. It opens places you haven\u2019t reached yet in the story. Intriguing\u2026 Confusing\u2026 Annoying\nI did finish the game, but only two of my several achievements are listed. In the thread, I can see that the game is also having a bonus but I can\u2019t see it. \nI may play the game again for a new experience, but it is not very likely.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198051697374", "last_played": 1503163952, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 186, "playtime_forever": 303}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499683995, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497537", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1499683995, "recommendationid": "33427867", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
