It looks nice and gets the basic gameplay down while adding an almost horror-ish element with many dark areas only visable through your flashlight.... which can only shine one direction at once.  Think \"Dead Nation\" if anyone has played that but replace zombies with..... alienish space monsters and some... space zombies?  Good enemy variety and 4 different classes- each with varying skill trees.  Nice variety of main weapons, usable items, class-based special abilities/items, and \"heavy\" items including the lovable Flamethrower, Charged-Beam-Type-Uber-Cannon, Explosive-Heavy-Launcher-Type-Deal.... you get the deal.  I've mostly messed around with the campaign (which would play a bit differently with other classes- so I'm looking forward to subsequent playthroughs) but there is a Survival Mode.... I've only messed with it a little bit but you are on a large map and are to do certain objectives in order to get an evac-ship.  There are defensive structures to build and all the campaign's weapons and goodies are present..... I believe you must have a seperate character in Survival Mode so your weapon progress and leveling up/skill trees would start from scratch.\n\nThere is some RPGish-ness here, too, which I LOVE.... you level up your ability with weapons.... so while the regular Assault Rifle might not have as much punch as the LMG, you might have enough levels into the AR to make it worthwhile over the agruably better LMG.  The skill tree has the basics such as more speed, health, faster reloading and whatnot- but there are some cool gamechangers... I can't speak for all the skill-trees, but the Assault Tree has a Cluster Bomb ability that would replace your \"Main\" class ability, beit the Enhanced Ammo or Crazy-Fire-Explosive-Mine.... you can upgrade the Cluster Bomb to explode over a larger area, do more damage, and cooldown quicker to allow for more usage.  You have a drone companion that houses some of the more unique features of this game.  You have a \"threat\" meter.... which is pretty self-explanatory.  Different actions can increase or decrease the meter.  I believe it slowly goes up over time but you can have your drone go collect supplies for you in exchange for an increased threat meter.... the drone can also put down an energy shield to stop/slow enemies and place a SUPERHUGE bomb that can wipe out huge areas.  Your last ability, Taunt, decreases the Threat meter BUT will immediately spawn enemies based on how high your Threat meter is..... so it becomes a balancing act of how far you can push or what locations you think you can hold off a hoarde and thus use Taunt.  It's a neat system that, once you understand it, can greatly help with both enjoyment and survival.  \n\nWhen done correctly I tend to enjoy Twin-Stick-Shooters..... especially when they have some RPG-elements.  Solstice Chronicles: MIA gets the gameplay down and adds enough little twists to make this quite a fun and potentially high-hour game.  I'm looking forward to finishing my initial campaign as the Assault Dude and then playing through as a Demolitions Guy and the third class..... which I believe is a \"Slow but Heavily Armored\" type.  The 4th class is unlocked after you beat the campaign on a certain difficulty and I don't know much about it.  Highly recommended if you like Twin-Stick Shooters.... I really LOVE Dead Nation and this is a game I'd put up there with DN.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198186812151", "last_played": 1505776270, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 254, "playtime_forever": 502}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505703022, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500190", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505703022, "recommendationid": "35037596", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Really fun game, when you like soloplay (no online Multiplayer):\n-Cool Art Style the different classes look awesome\n- The setting is amazing\n- Combat feels very satisfying\n-The Campaign is more like different missions you can replay all again\n  and grind for experience points for new skills etc.\n its not like you played it through and ur done.\n\nI would suggest the game for everyone who likes top down shooters .\nBought it at full price and dont regret it at all.\nThumbs up for this indie team!\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970990427", "last_played": 1505506647, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 148, "playtime_forever": 1061}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504977865, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497726", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504977865, "recommendationid": "34842422", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Nice base ideas in gameplay and aesthetics, but the numerous technical problems and bugs make it very frustrating to play.
