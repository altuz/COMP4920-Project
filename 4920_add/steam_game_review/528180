The interface works well, all is quick and clear. You can easily access the different screens and find information: your farm, the main board with  the different actions (just click on them to see what they do), your adversary's farm. The tutorial is good. I also wanted to see the written rules, so I checked the board game manual on the net. For the moment, I'm still a beginner and I played against the AI (three levels of difficulty). The game is fun, not too difficult to learn, with interesting strategic possibilities. This adaptation is essentially the same than the mobile version (I think), including the extension.  I just have minor nitpicks: it's written \"tap\" on the first screen, and there are no tooltips for the first menu buttons (at the beginning, I was wondering how to continue a game in progress - second button on the right). The graphics are nice enough, close to the board game, and the music and sound effects fit well with the theme.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198099639387", "last_played": 1487171358, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 1178, "playtime_forever": 135}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1487174089, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522859", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1487174400, "recommendationid": "29944138", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Agricola is a very good two player game and I like it very much. It is a low priced game that could entertain you for hours and hours in competative game play or just a few minutes per game to beat the AI or your best friend. It\u00b4s up to you.\n\n\"Agricola: All Creatures Big and small\" is a good port from the board game to the digital world. Digidiced did it well to stay close to the original board game from Uwe Rosenberg. The game introduce you in the famers life by build up stables and pastures to gather and breed different animals. All rescourses living and natural have to be chosen wisely step by step as there is an opponent farmer on the other side of the fence that will go for their own good or constrain you in your effort to get your farm up and running. Watch out carefully what he is doing on the other side or follow up our own plan to win the match.\n\nThe game itself is divided in 3 steps per round and 8 rounds per game where you are able to choose to pick from different rescourses like wood and stone and wool or grassland or animals for breeding. Just a few samples - there are more available - you will figure them out easilly by playing the game. If you are stuck you could as well read the tutorial.\n\nIt could be played against another player in ranking style or by free game just to enjoy it. Matches against other players could be played right away in direct play or asynchron what will give you the time to play it over the day in any break or by free time in between. I really like this possibility!\nYou could play as well against 1 of 3 different AI\u00b4s from easy to difficult. If you are a rookie in the game the difficult AI will challenge you in different ways and tactics. Watch out what it is doing.\n\nThe game is including the first addon what give you the possibility to play with more than a dozen different buildings (4 by each game which you could choose by pick upfront or randomly by surprise) to bring up new tactics and possibilities.\n\nThe upside down of the game could be this asynchron play type that you could choose. Some people would like the way to play a handfull or more games simultaneously and are able to do it that way others won\u00b4t. I don\u00b4t think that it interfere the quality of the game itself what is really high and very well.\n\nJust my two cents. Hope this review help you and I see you around for a farmers challenge. :-)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006596494", "last_played": 1487404976, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 106, "playtime_forever": 2410}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1487408425, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513054", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1487408425, "recommendationid": "30003549", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A very good port of the 2-player Agricola board game focusing on animal management. This is a worker placement game in which you only have 3 workers and during a round each player takes turns choosing a market space to place one of their workers. Each market space can only be selected once during a round, so you need to weigh out what you need vs. what your opponent might need and sometimes it's a better strategy to deny your opponent a critical resource space rather than advance your own needs. At the end of a round there is a breeding phase and if you have enough farm space, you increase your livestock count. Any excess livestock that can't be accomodated, are lost.\n\nBuilding your farm involves placing workers on market spaces that give you building abilities such as fencing in pastures and placing various building upgrades to hold more livestock. Scoring is based on the number and variety of animals and building types and pastures you have at the end of 8 rounds.\n\nThe game features multiple levels of AI, a tutorial, and online multiplayer. I started an online game and had an opponent in just a few minutes. The multiplayer utilizes steam turn notifications which makes running multiple online games a breeze.\n\nThe game comes with a free game dlc.

Play at home wiht buds and even a group that plays it a lot. This will play so differretnly from the vibe you get playing online. Where the play is not the thing, but more reaching the game end and determining a victor as time efficently as possible. I just belive that only a speciffc group of players is as into the endless grind of nameless faceless oponents one after the next, for a turn based board game watching their ELO.\n\nWhile the larger chunk of board gamers, who keep game collections and a tagle to play on. Are going to enjoy the play of the game and the social  aspacet of table top games, as a intresnic part of the game experience and pleasure sought. Which gets lost in the PC translation most days.\n\n\n\nOk so while the board game is a good one, this is a handheld presentation as is for the PC.\n\nBasically the title screen simply says \"tap to continue.\" \nAnd in general i find the interface to come off as if no one really considered what a  PC is vs. a tablet.\n\nI do not want a refund. The company that makes this actual board game is great. I want this sloppy hack job presentation cleaned up in a way that says, PC market is not a shamless cash grab.\n\nProbably not out of line for the handheld market expectations.
