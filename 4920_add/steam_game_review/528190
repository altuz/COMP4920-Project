I hit an abrupt glass ceiling where I was not really able to 'learn' or make any serious progress.\n\n[b]I am chatting with the developer to see where I am going wrong, but at this point, I cannot recommend this to my friends.[/b] Peruse the forums to see our fairly lengthy back-and-forth. I am in love with [i]Dead End Road[/i], so I gave this a try. [i]Carpe Deal'Em[/i] certainly has that gritty indie love, but I fear  that while the dev may be brilliant at creating atmospheric indie games, they may not be great at building a card game. Building a well-balanced FUN card game is seriously difficult. I mean, props for even trying.\n\n[i]Essentially, this game is a life simulator realized through a card game similiar (IMO) to [i]Dominions[/i] - not exact, mind you, but in that realm.[/i] I guess it is safe to say that you are trying to minimize/control how many bad random events happen. You manage your hand, which is usually comprised of life events or ways to modify life events. You earn money and have a family.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Really neat idea that could work well given enough TLC\n+Interface and artwork is all great\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-While I'm not going to go through every gritty little detail, I will just say that the card game needs both balancing, and less randomness. Many cards have little function at this point (or as far as I can see nearly 2 hours in). From someone that has moderate experience with deck-building games, I can't see a whole lot of depth here, either.\n\n[b]Look it's cheap, so if you want to the support the dev, by all means grab it. Otherwise keep this on your watchlist, and let it bake a bit more.[/b]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040884867", "last_played": 1477241900, "num_reviews": 618, "num_games_owned": 1195, "playtime_forever": 191}, "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_created": 1476826219, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541817", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1476826294, "recommendationid": "26107219", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Hardware: i5 3570, Windows 10, nVidia GTX 1070. Runs great.\n\nBought it because: unique concept.\n\nA card game that looks like an old black & white movie, you against a skeleton dealer, with an old-timey piano soundtrack playing in the background. You're dealt 7 cards to start your turn, must discard two, and then play anywhere from 2-5. If you play fewer than 5, the dealer adds more from his hand, so it's in your best interest to play anything good you have.\n\nYou start as a baby; each hand is one year in your life. You have various stats (health, popularity with family, popularity with peers, etc). The basic cards you play are \"have something happen to me\" cards, such as having a bad dream as a baby, that force decisions, such as whether to cry for your parents. Outcomes from your decisions can be good or bad that affect your stats; some cards just apply effects with no decision possible. You also have cards in your hand that can force good outcomes for these events, or change the rules, change your card loadout, etc.\n\nIt's easily to learn, fairly basic and fun, and is the kind of game you play in short sessions. \n\nThere's a game shop where you can buy additional cards for your deck (using game money you earn as you age and start to earn a salary) to improve the virtual life you go through during the game.\n\nFull price for this game is $9.99. It's fairly casual and I would recommend a lower price point, $4.99 or $2.99, to drive sales. I also think it would do much better in sales numbers as a tablet game, and recommend the devs port it to iOS or Android.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198130948719", "last_played": 1498981714, "num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 1448, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1498982545, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495495", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504755032, "recommendationid": "33119964", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
