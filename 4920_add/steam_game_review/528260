You'll see I'm at 26 minutes and a good 8 minutes of that was sorting out some technical difficulties. For the amount of content I would keep the game at its sale price, because is just a demo. Though a REALLY GOOD DEMO. Two more difficulties to work through, so I'm sure a lot more time will have to go into besting them. \n\nPros: \n\n- The combat was exciting. \n- The second level required going back and forth between melee and range, and it required some brain and coordintation to rapidly switch between the two.\n- I'm drenched in sweath. Bosses constantly throw attacks at you that require a lot of bobbing and weaving. \n\nCons:\n\n- Just the amount of content. Three five minute levels. They're not charging a whole lot, but I'd hope that more levels are on their way, or I'd feel a little short-changed.\n- A little bit choppy on the end boss. Running a i7-6700k 4ghz and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070. The graphics are pretty epic, so not sure if what I have is still \"good\"\n\nOverall: 8/10   Exactly the kind of VR genre I want to see developed more. A fun, action packed adventure that takes real skill to beat, and also gets you a six-pack along the way. This game isn't everything I hoped for, but it's an exciting step.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988533180", "last_played": 1496223156, "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 353, "playtime_forever": 37}, "votes_up": 36, "timestamp_created": 1493351351, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570834", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1493351351, "recommendationid": "31407714", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "One of the most enjoyable VR experiences I've had to date, HOWEVER, this is NOT a full game. \n\nI just need to get that out of the way first, because I know a lot of people are going to be sour over shelling out $9 for something that can be completed in full in about 20 minutes. This game is essentially a teaser for what the final product \"might\" be, if the developers continue working on it and actually end up adding more content to it.\n\nWith that aside, let me talk about the game itself. Titan Slayer is hands down, one of the most intense and exhilirating VR \"fighting\" games I've ever played. The controls are fluid and your movements are reproduced perfectly in the game world. The amount of space that the game requires is also very modest, and I was able to enjoy the game fully in a 1.5m x 2.5m space without accidentally bumping into or hitting anything, or even needing to be cautious or aware of my surroundings. I feel like this is a hugely important mechanic when designing a VR fighting game, and one that many developers seem to overlook. There are a lot of games out there that encourage or even require overly exaggerated movements in order to perform what would otherwise be regular movements in the real world. This leads to all sorts of problems if you're playing in a confined space and are concerned about breaking something in your room or breaking your Vive's controllers. This however, is a non-issue with Titan Slayer. Thumbs up for this.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic and as soon as you hop into the main hall at the beginning of the game, you'll instantly get a strange but familiar feeling, like you've been there before. I like to call it the \"Dark Souls\" vibe, and no word of a lie, it looks exactly like you've been plopped right into the middle of a Dark Souls game. Of course, the actual mission levels are different as you're fighting off waves of enemies that eventually lead to a boss fight, and this is where Titan Slayer really shines. One of the main selling points for VR adopters is the desire to feel a sense of scale that simply can't be reproduced on a monitor, and booooy oh boy, will you feel it with Titan Slayer. It's honestly an amazing feeling to look up in front of you and see a humongous snake ready to swallow you up whole, or a giant fire breathing demon 100 times larger than you slam his huge fist right down, shattering and destroying the ground around you. It's simply brilliant. Thumbs up for this, too.\n\nThe game also features skill progression in the form of unlockable weapons that you obtain as you progress, and that you can switch out before each battle in order to ensure you have the perfect load-out for the titan you're about to face. Though the game is currently very limited in content, it features swords, shields, pistols, huge revolver-like shotguns, machine guns, a bow AND a grenade! There's a lot to pick from for a game with only 3 stages (currently), but I feel like there's a decent amount of replayability to be had if you wish to try and complete each of the missions on every difficulty setting. Thumbs up for the progression and customization.\n\nOverall, I was happy with my purchase and won't be refunding it, even though the amount of content is very small at this time. It's a great game to hop into and immerse yourself in a fantasy battle against ogres, serpents, knights and demons. It's also a really cool game to show off to your mates. I do hope that the developers continue to work on the game and don't just leave it in its current state. It has a lot of potential, and I'd like to see that potential expanded on in the form of more stages, enemies, and customization options etc.\n\nI put together a brief video of my time with the game that you're welcome to take a look at if you're interested.\n\nCheers.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_FuI8wHNt9A", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993302934", "last_played": 1494686372, "num_reviews": 34, "num_games_owned": 919, "playtime_forever": 266}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1493753520, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513760", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1493787700, "recommendationid": "31512167", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Content is leaning towards the short end but the rock-solid gameplay and the phenomenal visuals/presentation more than make up for it.
