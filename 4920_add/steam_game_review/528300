In concept, this would be great for a linear platformer that has you going from start to finish, and that is something Soulless tries to push you along to do. However, This NOT acceptable when secret passageways to collectables, and ever important switches for various devices in the levels are ALSO painted in the same black silhouette as the environment. Checkpoints are fairly placed, but some areas in the game are buggy if you die, forcing you to restart the last checkpoint you encountered just to get the mechanics of the game working (This was most proment with the actual boss of Act 2). Some dialogue boxes are broken, mostly with the Guide of the story.\nThe time invested you see along with this review was playing the game from start to finish. The game boasts three endings, yet in the time playing, I was only ever able to see two of the three; the third ending requires you to \"remain pure\", which you have given no indications of messing up the route for this ending until you've basically beaten the game, nor are you given any indication of where you messed up, forcing additional replays of the whole game, rather then being able to make use of the load checkpoint feature on the main menu to simply see the endings back to back (which IS possible to do with the other two endings: complete one, reload checkpoint before the choice, make other choice).\nI wish I could recommand this game, but unlike Algebra, puzzles require all the pieces to be known and accounted for, otherwise they're not puzzles at all. If you feel bold enough to try it out despite the issues listed above, I encourage acquiring the game while on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198060070835", "last_played": 1501087798, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_forever": 115}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1500442928, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519023", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500442928, "recommendationid": "33645080", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
