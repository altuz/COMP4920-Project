Calling this game a \"run and gun\" in the detailed description is extremely misleading. While I remember guns overheating in games like Metal Slug, I never remember them causing an extreme pause to the gameplay experience like it does in Wells. Retreating to cool down and restore your health in Wells takes away from the \"run and gun\" and makes the experience more like \"retreat and fire aimlessly\". On the subject of aiming, the \"full controller support\" is a complete sham as the triggers as well as the analog support for the game constantly fails using an Xbox360 controller with similar unanswered complaints on the forums. While I am glad the game has extended platform support, the Linux version is garbage with graphics glitches throughout.

Good tutorial on the go at the beginning - you start to run and learn controls as you kill your first opponent - saves time and gives that \"on a mission\" feel.\nAs a bonus it have linux port so I can play it on my Linux PC.
