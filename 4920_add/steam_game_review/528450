A lot of the utility items are underwhelming. With the friends I played with, it was just a rush to figure out what weapon worked best against the right monster and to bash everyone with it. Out of our approximately 10 games the monster did not win one, and none of us really had an idea of how to play that role. Some of the monster abilities seem much more useful than others as well.\n\nThere's a great game somewhere here, and the art and sound is quite pleasant and thematic, but the game itself feels very unbalanced. Monster needs a buff, and the items need tweaking in my opinion. I love hidden role games, but the game feels unpolished.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198048293596", "last_played": 1495347972, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 206, "playtime_forever": 668}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1487903524, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505785", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1487904104, "recommendationid": "30132038", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "24", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So....Free to play, single player....really?\n\nDon't be fooled by what they claim, I'm sure that you can join games if enough people buy the \"full version DLC\" but if noone does you'll be stuck looking at the intro screen as there's no single player or free to play game available.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198138101163", "last_played": 1487877881, "num_reviews": 81, "num_games_owned": 151, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1485813835, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456599", "votes_down": 35, "timestamp_updated": 1485813835, "recommendationid": "29593819", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
