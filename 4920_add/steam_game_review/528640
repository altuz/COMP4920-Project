Do the developers even play another manger games? Very difficult to navigate, no tutorials or help, tactics is a joke, no way to properly pick a team, finding new players is very hard, gameplay makes no sense at times on why players do certain movements, no way to communicate with players or staff. Anyone who recommends this is clearly wrong. Was hoping for something a little better but this a steaming pile of bull turds.
