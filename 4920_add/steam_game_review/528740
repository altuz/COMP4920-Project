Fight aliens and other people, build up resources, make better stuff. your basic wargame. \n\nNow where most people say that its a bad game due to buying the premium currency (shards) its not that bad, you can get free shards from some actions, and the events give you all the same things that you can buy. learning the tricks of the events is very big.\n\nNow just like most games that are similar, the game gets longer and longer as you progress. you will burn through the speed-ups you get for free, so the real reason to stay becomes the community, the people are great, unlike many similar games.\n\nOnto Support:\n\nNow this is where most wargames end up failing hard. something goes wrong they simply shrug and tell you to suck it up. NOT SO WITH OPERATION: NEW EARTH! \nI lost access to my account randomly due to an issue with something. Not only did they get me back up and running, they did it within 30 minutes of my email. and followed up with a message in game to check that everything was running smoothly, As well as sent an email confirming the fix, and asking to be informed of any other developments.\n\nThey take care of their players, and seem to be actually happy to help!\n\nTL;DR\nGame is a decent wargame, With Exceptional Customer Support, and a great community.
