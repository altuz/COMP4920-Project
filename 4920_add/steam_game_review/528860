It\u2019s a side grade.\n\nIt\u2019s not frantic at all. It\u2019s not that deep and there is barely any lore or content.\n\nHowever if you want a computer \u201cHacking\u201d game that isn\u2019t out to overwhelm you this is it. It\u2019s more about how you complete your missions than how fast you can do them as password hacking is always the same no matter the difficulty level.\n\nThe interface is significantly more usable than uplink mostly due to the comparative simplicity. It is almost completely one button mouse controlled. It looks nice and retro. You never need to click and drag tiny bars to get things done as the commands are in a drop down menu.\n\nOne of the key game element is simply not ever getting a trace on you while on the job. If you try to race the clock you are almost going to lose. Why? The game goes not let you multitask, your computer is decidedly not advanced  which also means it does things slowly one. at. a. time. You are almost always better off disconnecting and aborting the job instead of trying to complete one racing the trace.\n\nAnother very nice thing is not having to deal with proxies like Uplink does. You don\u2019t have to string a web of proxies to build up time for your hack. That was easily the most obnoxious part of Uplink. Here you upgrade and buy more proxies to extend your trace timer. If there is ever a sequel or a scriptural one to uplink this has got to be fixed.\n\nThe game over isn\u2019t all bad, you get to keep your money in the bank so you can leapfrog from your last attempt getting you to higher levels faster.\n\nHowever the bad part is it is a little too simple and has nearly no lore. There is no reason to ever hack just for the sake of hacking. There is nothing to read, no bank accounts to pillage(Uplink went wrong way with this allowing you to break the game in 15 minutes), no jokes or call backs. There is a single thread story which surprisingly went in a different direction than I expected but there is no post game content.\n\nHowever if you want a hacking game that is bordering on relaxing this is it. Once you hack in without setting of a trace you can take all the time in the world. But beware of the lack of long term content.
