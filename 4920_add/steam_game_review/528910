Any chance we could chat to see if we could get to the bottom of the issues you saw? I cannot reproduce the falling through the floor bug and would like to get some more information if possible. It's incredibly strange because the player does not have gravity or physics and cannot fall. You can test this by hitting a ball and then teleporting to it in mid air, you will just stay there. I'm wondering if we are having a communication issue which would make it impossible to find the source of the bug.

ABYSMAL.\n\nYes this title is in early access. Yes it is competing in the relatively underdeveloped \"VR Market\".\n\nThat said, I have a problem when the backlog of \"VR-TEST\" Unity projects on my hardrive have a higher level of polish than what I am paying $20 for. The developers are obviously still getting to grips with the Unreal Environment.\n\nThere are a lot of things wrong with Golf Pro VR. \n\nIt essentially looks like something a high school student might put together for a weekend. \n\nThe models are mostly basic shapes, the terrain is using low quality textures, the \"art\" assets are freebies from the asset store, the water features are using some very poorly implemented version of the free water from Unity, there are clipping issues, there are framerate issues, the Canvas object has not been implemented properly, the Tooltips are accessible only from the start screen, the course is devoid of detail, the lighting was added in as an afterthought, the skybox is a freebie, the UI is a default and the ball physics are pathetic. Apparently you can only throw a golf ball a couple of yards away.\n\nIt really has no place on the Steam Store. I hope everyone who purchased this product is aware of the ability to refund.\n\nPerhaps I am being overly harsh, but when you sell a product you sell a product, and I feel like the product description should reflect the above \"issues\".\n\nIt is hard for me to gauge the reasons behind such a premature release. There may be legitimate business logic in putting out something so under cooked. \n\nIt is of course far more likely the developer is simply taking advantage of the market and hoping there are sufficient folks willing to hold off on refunding this a\"effort\".\n\nIf you are working on a Golf Product, good for you, just don't release your in house demo as a $20 purchase and expect to not get noticed.\n\n$20.
