And the melee attack looks ridiculous.\ncouldn't find any kind of map\ngame really needs a starting base where player can get an idea of what they are meant to do, and get quest.\nImprovement I graphics would be nice, but I would rather play a good game with bad graphic, then a bad game with good graphics.
