The good thing is that it all works out in a nice way. It's pleasant to read and fun to fly.\nThe game itself isn't really that difficult, instead it takes you on this yourney to actively experience what you read. Sometimes through action and sometimes through choice.\n\nThere're some small writing errors during the novel parts, but nothing game breaking and they don't really matter because you know what is meant.\n\nThe art is nice, the music is okay, the controls are easy to master and the story is fun and well developed.\n\nSo far this is the most fun I've had since a long time with any new Steam game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197982837520", "last_played": 1499467732, "num_reviews": 129, "num_games_owned": 807, "playtime_forever": 677}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1498348761, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516449", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498515924, "recommendationid": "32748540", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I played this game in Early Access so I've played the first 3 chapters as of right now.
