The good news is that they have plans to work on some of those improvements to give us all a better experience.\n\nIf you enjoy games that have a cultural background as well as fighting games, I'd recomment it. \n\nNOTE: This game is fcking hard to grasp, and even harder to master. So, if you're looking for a challenge, you're up for it.\n\nGOOD LUCK IN TRYING TO WIN YOUR FIRST MATCH \n\nPS: Hey devs, that should be a good achievement to implement, haha!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197979263676", "last_played": 1490908447, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 241, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1491301814, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1491301814, "recommendationid": "30939672", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Neat party game, 2D rocket league+super smash bro\n9/10 one point deducted for the overwhelmingly \"strong\" bot", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198072158954", "last_played": 1490853443, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 204, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1490863174, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503524", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1490863174, "recommendationid": "30829106", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fun fastpaced party game.\nThe game is player-friendly and extremely fun. \nA creative way to mix basketball and dodgeball\n\nThe AI can be challenging even in a normal difficulty.\n\nGameplay - 9\nGraphics - 9\nMusic - 10\nControls - 7 if you use a keyboard.\n\nFinal Score  9/10\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004851067", "last_played": 1491316334, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 203, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1491231095, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1491231095, "recommendationid": "30924289", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
