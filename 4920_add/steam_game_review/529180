The game looked and played beautifully at first, with the promise of quests and a huge skill tree for my friends and I to enjoy. Little did we know that no matter where we decided to settle down, a level 80+ monster will come down to obliterate us.\n\nThe first area we chose was literally right outside the main dwarf city. Every single night and day, a dark wraith would spawn and cause any progress we had would be made completely irrelevant. We eventually moved further down, to where we saw an endless valley of panthers and predatory birds ranging from level 50+. We decided against this, and farmed our way to our first armor set and level 15ish. We tamed our first boar and road off towards the mountains to explore.\n\nThat may of been the most enjoyable moment, but it also lasted the shortest. When we rerturned from our trek, we noticed there was a panther lying sidewise sleeping, but it was following us sanic fast. We got off our mounts, and noticed the little z's above his head. His AI had forced him to follow us home (mind you, we had travled across the world). My friend couldn't move his boar, as the sleeping monster had merged into the model. We shot at it, which caused the level 130 panther to destroy my friend and I and wreck our houses. \n\nTo combat this, I sacrificed myself and led him down towards the dwarf town. To my surprise, the beautiful AI had caused the panther to bug into the mountain. If we got near, he would attack from a distance and instant kill us. Amazing.\n\nAfter this horrible moment, we wanted to just quit. Why would we play a game where outside the starting area, high level dark wraiths would kill us at every single moment? I convinced him to carry on, and we found a new base where only longhorns and bunnies spawned. This seemed like the perfect place for maybe a day or so (realtime).\n\nSuddenly, the spawns drastically changed to high level wolves and panthers. The boar I had tamed so many in game days ago *roughly 17* had become stuck in the model of another panther, killing him instantly. This almost got the best of me, but once again I convinced my friend to carry on.\n\nI created 2 more troughs and 2 more boar saddles, and we made a rune to teleport back to the main city. As we spawned, a level 90 wolf appeared and mutilated us both instantly.\n\ntl;dr, drastic balance changes need to be made. I don't need to hear that \"we don't want to learn the game\" or that we need to \"get good\", as we both spent hours researching what to do in this very early game. I understand the game is still fairly new, but to my understanding it was made by the same developer who created ARK, a fur superior (yet surprinsgly much more boring) game.\n\nI haven't even mentioned the bugged quests that refuse to turn in, items that are literally placeholders on patch release, hit detection (the dreaded arrow bug from ARK is in this one as well folks!). I really wish I could like this game. I really do. The short time I had was fun. But for $30? I wish I could get my money back.\n\nHopefully in the future the game becomes something worth investing time into.

Well it is very mixed.\nWhen it is playable which sadly seems to be less and less it is the most enjoyable thing\nThe graphics is fantastic, the animations allright, the nature is sort of epic and I find myself enjoying being in the world just looking around the terrain. Always finding new places that I want to move my house. So many choices so little time.\n\nBut I still find myself not recommending the game. Throughout the production of Dark and Light Snail games have been less than forthcomming with information. Guarding their game a little better than the Pentagon in US.\nAnd even if they now have a reasonably large community to deal with in their EA. They have not changed their policy of crowd management.\nPatches are here and now, same goes for bug fixes and new content. In a game where you often have to undertake tasks that take several hours, you are most often only given 20 minutes notice to logout when they want to patch\nAnd curiously weekends seem to be when they want to update. Which is also when most of us have time to dedicate to gaming and maybe looking forward to a nice fun long game session. Bang your gaming session turns into a nightmare of updates that don't work, rolling the server back to some point that you will be forced to sit and instant login once your server comes up to avoid dying and loosing mount and gear that propably took you days if not weeks to acquire and train.\nSo far content has been added twice, or large amounts. And both times they have failed horribly and the community has suffered for it.\nI find myself writing this review today. I sat down this morning to play and was going to have a nice long gaming day. Suddenly pop up, 2 hours maintenance and it has been like 10 hours since that happened and the server has been online for the last 7 of those. but noone can join it due to whatever they did to it during maintenance.\nAnd yes we tried other servers no problem.\nAnd absolutely no communication from Snail games. And that is despite since sunday a very large patch was rolled out with new content. That failed horribly, they rolled back and no communication about it so as it stands they are still advertising the game as having the added content and seem to be bug fixing but they are not talking to the community at all. So when/if our server will be playable is unknown to us.\n\nAnyways it turned into a rant. But maybe that is for the better because it illustrates why I cannot recommend a game that when it works is kind of fantastic. The company behind it just manage it and us, the consumers horribly. Even if we all are prepared for the EA bugs and changes.

A few weeks ago the lag and desync were pretty bad so I can understand the poor first impressions but its been fixed and I dont have any issues.  Keep in mind that in this game just like Ark, the official servers are time wasters from their settings and lag.  Servers save every 30 mins so you can anticipate that hiccup when its going to happen and finding the right server is the difference between having fun with friends on this game or complaining it sucks.\n\nDefinitely find a decent unofficial server and make some friends. The default settings are so low it makes the game too grindy imo and customizing it is the way to go. Getting on servers with 60 people will make the game laggy and annoying.  I feel the exact same about Ark which I put 1000 hours into and people that dont find a good one before investing time are just wasting their time.  Fortunately there are a ton of servers available so it shouldnt be an issue.\n\nI have had a good time building and have made a large boat shaped base that was decked out and pretty sweet on one server and on my new server I have what I can only describe as huge  parking garage with a mansion and stadium attached.  Gardens and spell tower defenses and lage bays for all my tames to be organized in have kept me busy and enjoying myself.\n\nThe mob diversity is nice without a whole lot of the \"One new dino to rule them all and render your others obsolete\" problem that plagued Ark so much.  Many of my different tames have a purpose and prove useful even when I get a better land combat or flying combat mount.  There are a few tames that seem pointless but I think of them more as starter tames or just fluff to flesh out the world. The nidhogs, cyclops, panthers, elementals, dragons and goblins are all pretty badass and will keep you searching for better versions when you are happy to have just one bahamut and unicorn to serve their respective purposes.  The fact that certain mobs are found only in certain places is done well and encourages exploration.  The invasions are awesome and Im so glad they are actually difficult now instead of an easy farm for magical loot.  The ascendant system with elites is awesome but way too slow for me.\n\nThe spell casting is pretty fun from casting the wall spells and rain spells along with the different bolt spells to dps stuff from afar. I like the research and progression system as well as the graphics on their spell system and I think the various buff and utility spells are a nice touch.  Since the melee desync was fixed in patches a few weeks ago I am really enjoying their diverse weapon choices.  The hammer, the ghost scythe, the goblin club, and the two handed sword are all carried by me still and their secondary attacks add a bit of style and usefulness to them.  The ranged bow/xbow combat is pretty lackluster damage wise even with all the specialty arrows but I enjoy it for the tame mechanics.  You basically shoot things with a giant fishing line attached and either anchor it or drag or get dragged around by the mob.  Repeatedly doing this exhausts them so you may tame them.  I find it fun especially against flyers or goblins that you can drag.\n\nI tweaked my modifiers and levelling curve on my custom server with the stats that are increased over vanilla for myself and dinos and I find it has better balance and is easier and more fun to play.  I think they should mod these as default as I find the regular settings too grindy and boring much like I did with ark.  My longest tames are like an hour max and I dont have to spend too long harvesting to build sizabale and impressive structures.  I wouldnt enjoy this anywhere near as much with the default values vanilla servers have.\n\nI have a decent computer and other than early on I really havent had any problems with lag or overheating or video quality.  I havent run into any game breaking bugs but there are still some areas around the human area where you can fall a short distance under the map and it is frustrating.  I avoid the land bridges there when I start untill I have the recall spell at least.\n\nThe lands and terrain are pretty diverse from the floating islands, the forests, the volcano island, the faction cities they from an interesting map that i enjoyed exploring.  Finding a good spot to build is pivotal in games like these so dont plop down at the first spot and force yourself to continue until you find a good one.\n\nThe biggest detractors from the game for me are.\n\n1. netcode.  big servers with 40+ people are going to lag with this engine. its a shame but its what the engine delivers. play with 20 or so and enjoy yourself.\n\n2.The currency system.  While its not needed it is a pain and boring to grind.  Goblins drop so little gold and running around punching barrels is boring.  You can turn in stuff for gold coins but it is only once per game day so i feel they need to add more ways of getting coin.\n\n3. Vanilla Values.  A lot of people will not like this game if they start out with the low values on a high pop official server. I cant convey this enough. It will be laggy, grindy, high competition and you will be griefed.  Find a good server before you get into it very far to have fun.\n\n4. The ascendant system for elites. Certain elite mobs will ascend if you are around them long enough morphing into new powerful creatures.  Its a cool system but takes way too long and I havent figured out how to speed up the process to a realisticly fun amount.\n\nI think this game is definitely worth the money for what it is and I have already gotten my moneys worth.  I look forward to the content they will be adding in the future and look forward to the day this will be a full release.

Nobody cares about your big plans if your smalls ones don't work to begin with, I get it's early access but damn guys, stop sprinting into EA hell, at least leisurely stroll there....*\n\nLonger:\n\nThere seem to be a bunch of really interesting design ideas that the devs are trying to implement but little attention is being paid to the actual mechanics of these ideas.  I get that games are buggy when they're in EA but these seem like systemic mechanical issues rather than actual bugs.  Please see some examples below.\n\n\n\n1)  Base building seems pretty cool at first, the models are nice, they snap together well enough but buildings have an absurd amount of hitpoints, the first tier of buildings (shoddy straw buildings) have a half a million hit points and the weapons out of the same tier do about 10 damage to buildings per hit.  Apparently base building is for everyone but raiding is only for end game characters?\n\n2)  There are a good dozen or two really cool mounts in the game, but most of them are so sub optimal there is zero reason to tame them unless you like the way they look.  There is a big moose that looks super cool, all of it's stats are worse than a boar of the same level.\n\n3)  On the above two notes, there are flying mounts, why on earth would I bother breaking down someones walls when I could just fly over them?  Walls can have upwards of a million hitpoints from what I've seen, it seems like it's going to take all day to knock a single one down, that time is probably better spent going out, finding and taming a flying mount and just laughing at your enemies walls as you fly over them.  There are defensive turrets that could act as AA guns but they all appear to have a finite amount of ammo, just run their ammo down and conduct your airborne raid.\n\n4) The proposed world map seems ludicrously large, if the map was sliced up into portions equal to the current playable portion you could easily make the argument that the devs are intending to make 20 something expansion packs or DLC, one for each portion of the world map.  Let's say they go for $10 a piece, welcome to DLC hell and a ~$250 game.\n\n5) The current playable map is way way too small.  It seems big at first on foot, the amount of hostile mobs laying about waylay you enough that running anywhere takes a decent amount of time. However, on any mount you can cross the map in about 15 minutes, god only knows how short that is on a flying mount.  Now imagine trying to cram up to 70 people into this playable area.\n\n6) Some areas of the map have truely beautiful but buggy terain. If you fall into the wrong crevice you're stuck, prepare for suicide and an inability to get your gear back.  This is common enough that I've already found several signs people have put up to warn other players of specific pit falls.\n\n7)  Not all mobs were created equal, which seems intentional but poorly implemented?  A level 110 Bargesh is zero threat to a level 3 player, you can walk backwards flinging knives at it till it dies, a level 8 Panther will absolutely mercilessly hunt down a level 25 player and rip it to shreds.  Don't get me started on reapers....\n\n8) Craftable gear can be super expensive to create and super easy to lose.  Prepare for wholesale resource extraction.  Also on that note, some skills are only reasonably leveled by harvesting specific resources, gird your loins because you are going to deforest areas larger than the Amazon. RIP Lorax....\n\n9)  There doesn't appear to be any official code of conduct, if your server has one it is likely enforced by crazy fascist players or carebear consensus.  Also, on this note, this is a recipe for a griefing engine, do you want another Rust?\n\n10) I could go on, and may do so later, but I have to get to work, please vote with your wallets...\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035571315", "last_played": 1505369935, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 204, "playtime_forever": 2671}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505426905, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500074", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505426905, "recommendationid": "34958706", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}]}
