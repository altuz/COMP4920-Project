Very confusig UI with no help to understand how to do things.  \n\nThe art is split.  Some is good some is worse then a lot of the FTP idlers.  This one also has an in game shop despite being a purchased product, which is another bad sign.\n\nI played the game for about half an hour, read the forums and learned to really progress you need an auto click script.  This is a turn off for me, as I like games that don't demand a ton of clicking on and on.  But the more you progress, the bigger the benifit of clicking rather then idling, which is totally against the idea of an idling game.\n\nEven though I got it on sale for 2$ it's not worth it.

To think I paid money for this, me buying this is like me paying money to buy milk thats been expired for 2 years. Im wasting my money on something disgusting. Do not buy this trash, I don't care if you like clicker games or not, show the developers how downright disgustingly bad their game is by not buying it, thats the only way to get it through their thick skulls.\n\n\nI am aware this in early access, that doesn't change anything. A Prestige system should already be in place due to how important it is for this type of clicker game and the fact that they want money for you to even play this clicker game, and one that is still in early access and is also a pile of garbage at that?
