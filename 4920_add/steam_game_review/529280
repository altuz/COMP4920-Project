But the game is only 1.99$ so why not try it out? Well, have you ever wanted to be in a game commercial? Now you can. This game starts off with a trailer, and also ends with a trailer whether you win or lose. In the middle you have a short game where you fight off zombies from a truck until you\u2019re able to escape. \n\n[b]The game trailers are over the top and intrusive, and it looks like a lot of time and effort has been put into it. The actual gameplay on the other hand is nothing like the trailers.[/b] \n\nAs the first trailer ends the game starts with a cutscene and the game warns you not to move. This is because your head tracking is somewhat disabled at this point, and moving and looking around simply makes you sick because of it. [b]I think every VR developer should experience this part just to see why you shouldn\u2019t do a \u201ctypical\u201d cutscene in a vr game.[/b] \n\nThe graphics are decent by VR standards, but currently there\u2019s only one zombie model and it feel like someone pressed Ctrl+C and made a couple of Ctrl+V and voil\u00e0: a zombie horde! You have a great amount of weapons to choose from but none of them feels satisfying. You have to hold down the grip button at all time or you\u2019ll drop the weapons. Weapon aim is done with giant laser sight. And the sound in general is not good. Several times the enemies got stuck in my character and I had to \u201cshoot myself\u201d to kill them. I could go on but let\u2019s just say it feels very unpolished and cheap, even by EA standards. \n\nMy interpolations of the game\u2019s description tells me that this is actually a demo of a game that\u2019s coming sometime in the future. First of all you should not charge anyone for a demo, especially if the demo is spammed with trailers/commercials. Also a demo should encourage the gamer to desire more gameplay and story, rather than more alpha testing..", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198029982617", "last_played": 1475268868, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 179, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1475279346, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511292", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1475279346, "recommendationid": "25790502", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "extrem super short....playtime 2-5 min", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970589782", "last_played": 1475271344, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 385, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1475271387, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503685", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1475271387, "recommendationid": "25788946", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I've played for maybe 10 minutes. \n\nLooks very good. \nPlays well. \nSounds good. \n\nThe enemies are too aggressive during the tutorial stage.
