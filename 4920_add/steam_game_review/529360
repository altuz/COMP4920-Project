They either run up and attack you, or they float around and shoot at you.  It doesn't change how you respond to them, so it doesn't really matter.\n\nBecause the only substance to the game is the rpg loot progression vs enemy scaling, to the point that aiming and dodging are hardly factors at all in comparison.  You point in the general direction of the enemy and shoot.  Your dakka is either sufficient or not.  If not, you'll get money and some random weapon drops off the attempt, upgrade, and try again until winning dakka is achieved.  The variety of weapons is exciting at first, but wears off quickly, once the scaling factors overshadow most of the effect that shooting styles has in the beginning.\n\nAnd the levels are excruciatingly slow paced.  It's a good 15 seconds or so between enemy wave spawns.  They spawn in at such a distance that you can't hit them with anything that doesn't have homing (none of the weapons are hitscan), and take several more seconds to move into combat range.  Ultimately, you'll spend 15 minutes on a level, but maybe 5 minutes of that actually doing anything.\n\nPlayed just under 2 hours and asked for a refund, because I found myself getting impatient and bored waiting for the last couple levels I played to just be over with.

Gameplay, progression, audio, immersion. \n\nEvery gun feels and shoots like a pea shooter, From what I experience, they all make a \"tink\" noise when the bullets hit just about anything. \n\nThe progression system is completely broken in the sense it feels like I had a cheat code turned on that I couldn't disable. The price of weapon boxes seem to scale with your progressions in level. But from what I experience, you can sell the weapons you get out of a box for more than what you spent on the box 80% of the time, the other 20% you get most of your money back. Ultimately I started off with a few thousand moneys, and ended up with 100k in a couple minutes just selling the stuff back. \n\nI eventually found myself with a homing shotgun not to long into my box-opening journey and upgraded the crap out of the thing. I did a few levels closed my eyes and aimed my homing shotgun at the spawnpoint and pushed the trigger as fast as possible and deleted everything that thought of spawning. (~10 pellets from a shotgun all homing on 1 target is basically god mode -- even against bosses)\n\nAll up until I hit level 4, where the boss appeared to take no damage, and moved over my \"character\" blacking out my screen and making me invulnerable. I would have backed out to the menu and restarted the level, but it seems like a menu wasn't even developed either. \n\nJust play Space Pirate Trainer. the only \"innovation\" this game brings is a progression system, but it's incredibally imbalanced and needs serious tuning before it is truly innovative. It boils down into the user just getting weapons that deal rediculous damage and you don't even need to aim. Destroying the aspect of skill required in a shooter and eliminating all sense of a challenge. Space Pirate Trainer plays much smoother, the weapons are much funner, they feel good, and the enemies / projective are better conveyed.\n\nThis game feels like the developer kind of experimented with something as part of a side project and threw it on the market without any kind of finishing or refinement.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010142791", "last_played": 1494740342, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 179, "playtime_forever": 32}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1494740992, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1494740992, "recommendationid": "31740321", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Wow!
