It also a adds to the hectic kind of feel, when you have waves of kitties, coming from multiple points which you have to defend. \n\nThe physics are great, and effects the strategic approach to where you place your towers great, for example where you have to place the gatling gun to make most effect of it. This does though also limit where you can place some towers, and at certain spots, both the laser, gatlinggun, tesla, and a few others are almost useless. This can make some toweres \"forced\" to be placed at those spots as they are the only once that can do anything. this does in some sort limit difrrent kind of stratigics, but not in a huge manner. \n\nTHe graphics are great, and so are the difficulty, some levels are easier than others, and it does require, management of your money and strategic placements.\n\nThere is no mazing in this TD, which is something i usally love, but it is not missing from the game and the feel it has. maybe in the future it could be a part of it, inform of barricades  which some kitties have to avoid, and others might attack? just an idea i had as i love mazing.\n\nAll in all it is a great game, for people who love tower defense, with a fun approach. and plenty of hours to have fun.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197998074718", "last_played": 1479324485, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 53, "playtime_forever": 278}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1479327479, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503801", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1479327479, "recommendationid": "26634902", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not much to say about this since the best was the image from the storepage, so recommend you to save your money and look for something else instead ;)\n\nthe game is very bad balanced and tower placement are really messed up!\nas if they just was smashed down quickly right after they completed most of level design + many times towers wont fire at enemies when they are in range & each time you restart a map and build the same it's not same result you get each time = messed up somehow\n\n(should be in early access if you ask me)\n\nedit: This comes from a real TD player and not some casual pleb \"there screams OMFG Kittens then its good no matter what...

It will provide a challenge but nothing that'll make you rage-quit (unless you've already had a bad day at work).  Nice point; graphics are clean and has a fun story (the tutorial will train you to kill (alien) kittens lol). So far, even with so little time played, I'm loving it.. and I live for a good TD with actual strategy and polish. 8.5/10\n\n\nSo the long version of the review. I actually have more time played than what it shows above, as is typical of Steam updating. I've seen a reviewer say the bonus objectives were too hard. Guess what, if it was easy it wouldn't be fun.. and that's why they're freaking [i]Bonus Objectives[/i]. My 4th try on the 2nd level I hit all bonus objectives and let no kittens past.. it's a challenge, but really, it's not *that* damn hard. \nAlso, some have said there is no function to speed up the game.. the key bindings show there is one but.. I don't seem to notice it doing much.. I dunno if it's broken, not implemented yet, or if I've had a few too many 'beverages'.\n\nSo for the good... \n-There actually is more strategy involved than you might think by the cutsey looks and name of the game. Tower choice and upgrades are super important to consider and you may not realize your set-up is off until late into a level.. but that's half the fun.. doing well.. but not purrfect. Try again.\n-The game has a 'decent' campaign and a skirmish mode (yeah.. really.. a skirmish mode). \n-The graphics are clean and look very good.. surprisingly good! Cutsey though some sections may apppear.. it's actually very well rendered and runs super smooth.\n-The controls and not hard to master (it's a TD after all). In fact I've noticed more options and controls than most other TDs (hint, they actually want to you to zoom in.. and check out the detail).\n-There's a fairly cute story.. good humor adds to the atmosphere (kittens using cardboard boxes as shields lol).\n-This game allows you to examine enemies and it gives you full details including weaknesses, etc. Standard function, but one that many TDs overlook. This one didn't :) \n-When you zoom in on the invading lolcats.. the damn things actually meow.. cute kitten meeeoow! Yeah, lol.\n\nAnd the bad... (warning - I'm grasping at straws and being picky about what are really, truly, very minor flaws).\n-You can't speed up the game (that I could find, yet, as noted above perhaps it's in-progress). For the moment, the mission bonus objective for level 2 calls for you not to spend over $10k.. which you do by wave 12... now you sit and watch 8 waves.. may as well grab a beer and spend some 'quality time' with the wife while the level finishes. It's not a *huge* deal but really... this is a basic TD function and it's just not here. Again, this appears to be in-progress to be added however so.. take this gripe with a grain of salt.\n- You can release the next wave early.. but.. there's no motivation to do so.. it doesn't appear to impact your score or income so... why even have it? \n-The story is comical and fun but.. I have yet to understand why the kittens want to get into a central pod, or what it does. Again, not a big deal.. but really.. what's in this pod.. a big ball of yarn? A laser pointer? What?\n-The amount of content is not bad but.. it's not amazing either. It's fine, really, it could be slightly more though.. DLC should fix that. Yeah I'm actually complaining that the content is only 'reasonable for the asking price' lol. It's the [i]replayability[/i] side of the content that I have concerns about...\n-The only other gripe I have with the game is minor and silly... you can zoom waaaay out.. but there's nothing almost outside of your maze to see. I mean like, literally.. you can zoom out to a huge planet-like scale and typically just see.... nothing.. it's as if the devs left a blank cloud in the background and said \"Fahk it, good enuff!' It kind of kills the immserion a little. But only a little.\n\nAll in all, it offers more strategy than the cutsey name and art implies. It has great polish and very minor picking points about it. I've put in hundreds of hours in Defense Grid 1 & 2 and I don't see this being too much different if they add DLC and other game modes. Definitely an 8.5/10 if not more.. A great game that's even better when you catch it on sale.\n(Edits..
