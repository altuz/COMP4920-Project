In each level, you must traverse a map from the front to the back, which is full of mines, and like the original, you will hit a mine if you are wrong. There are a number of powerups to buy before your trip or collect on your way.\n\nIn campaign mode, you have a limited number of lives, but more can be earned by playing the other modes to earn money. \n\n\nCons: \n\nReplaying a campaign level does not earn you money, so you can't upgrade your 'star' performance.\n\nThere is no save button, which means that during survival mode, a game lasting several hours will have to be trashed simply because you can't play any longer. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035680861", "last_played": 1488310009, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 2457}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1492206116, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500381", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492206116, "recommendationid": "31144120", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
