The entire development process was one long pun chain of purposely (or not) getting the Beautiful Game wrong. Every furious correction sent in by someone who wasn't in on the joke ended up spurring the developer into zanier and more purposely wrong territories; Premiere League being the lowest one (obviously it's the one you Premiere in), the Offside rule being a side of the pitch you're not allowed to stand on. An oval round pitch a hundred meters in length, and the game split into two divisions with variable scoring based on how far away from the goal you were when you did it. It purposely ignores anything remotely connected to serious research. It wallows in it's own ignorance and subsists on the grinding of teeth from people who treat sportsball too seriously.\n\nAnd we love you for it Dan. Never change.\n\nAs for the game itself, a quick action game with a passing similarity to football. Quicktimey tackles, power meter charged kicks, uncontrollable and incompetant goldkeepers and an extra time mode that requires picking up actual extra time. A story mode that forces you to learn the abilities of the game piecemeal (and a tutorial mode that tells you off for not playing it), and a quick match mode with disturbingly way too many options for such a small game.\n\nBest football game I own.

And the first league is great fun to play through, but this is where things change, and why I wouldn't be willing to recommend the game just yet. \n\nThe difficulty curve, if we can call it that, suddenly takes an enormous jump. Aside from the ocassional glitches that are still in the game, the AI suddenly remembers it is a computer and can kick your sorry meat-arse without even trying if it wants to. And it does! Quite suddenly the ball is being passed around the pitch from player to player at such an incredible rate you'll be lucky to know where on the pitch you even are any more. A bit of speedy silly play does fit in with the theme of this game, but it reaches such an insane speed it is literally untouchable, borderline un-seeable. At present as well, you have to get used to successful tackles somehow resulting in their player not losing the ball, your defenders refusing to ever be behind the halfway line in some games, the auto-select of players (for you may not do this yourself) is often very unhelpful, either not selecting anyone near the opposition with the ball, or randomly changing your selection when you want to tackle to someone who is not in a useful position, and then the game won't let you try and tackle again for quite some time. \n\nThis game will be brilliant, I don't doubt that, as long as it keeps being updated and improved. I just don't know how long we will have to wait for these things to be improved on, because at the moment they are taking the silly fun this games offers and turning it into an infuriating affair that is best described more as a video than a game, because all you can do it watch, and feel just a bit humiliated as the AI keeps passing the ball across your goal at 200mph because none of your team are even in your own half...\n\nI'm looking forward to changing my recommendation to yes, because I feel confident it will happen, it's all there!

Then I made the mistake of winning a few matches; that's when I discovered that the game's difficult scales based on the assumption that you're able to bring in loads of money per goal, so that you can train your team to come at least vaguely close to keeping up with the AI. Alas, even after all the matches I've won and lost in the weeks since I bought this, I still score lots of 0/1 pound (note: not sure how to abbreviate pounds sterling appropriately, sry) goals, with the occasional 100-200 goals. I think I saw one for about 750 once....maybe. I may have imagined it. But since training is expensive, I quickly found myself in a spot where the AI was making laser-like passes and goals, stealing the ball from me at its whim, while I would apparently fail to even gather the ball after running right into it. While I'd love to take more of the blame for this, I fear that there may also be an issue of clunky controls that aren't nearly as responsive as this game needs them to be.\n\nDespite having grown frustrated with the game early on, I was going to give it a positive recommendation....until I saw the patch notes for the 1.5 patch. The developer claimed that this patch addressed some of the negative feedback about this game, so I fired up the game again to see how different it felt. With my team in 17th place, the AI once again manhandled my team and I ended the match without bringing in a single penny. In 18th place, winning was too easy, but I didn't bring in nearly enough money for even a single upgrade to my team.  But goal scoring still feels just-managable enough that I don't feel like I can start doing whatever the game expects me to do to bring in more money when I finally score. In other words, same old poor scaling.\n\nEven after the improvements, I still had a major problem: The automatic selection of which player you control. I can't count the number of times I've wanted to control a player who was actually near the ball (but couldn't, because the computer decides who you control), or the number of times when I've been charging in for a tackle, only to have the computer switch players so my slide tackle is done by someone neither near the ball nor even facing it. This, perhaps more than anything else, is what made the game frustrating for me. (A close second is when the computer starts intercepting every pass that comes near it, while my players do nothing of the sort. Or when the computer starts stealing the ball even time it wishes, while my attempts to steal are far less predictable.)\n\nWhat mostly pushed me over the line toward a negative recommendation is the dev's statement of \"it's supposed to be a difficult game.\" Upon reading this, I concluded the following: This isn't a difficult game, it's a poorly-designed game with awkward controls and a lack of attention to difficulty scaling. (Not to mention that the game does next-to-nothing to show the player how to succeed at the game's most important mechanic, that of maximizing money earned per goal.) Hearing the dev suggest otherwise sounds arrogant and out-of-touch to me.\n\nAlso, I've grown sick to death of the opening music, and button texts and match win/loss notes seem about as vacant as the typical meme...but they just keep showing up. In other words, I've quickly grown tired of this game's tedium and I don't want to fire up the game any more.\n\nTo be fair, the first couple hours with the game were quite fun, so if you think the price is low enough to see if you also enjoy it -- either at first, or possibly for much longer -- then, by all means, give it a go. The game certainly feels like it has loads of potential, when you first start playing.\n\nAlso, note that the game gives a strong (in-game) recommendation to be played with a console-style controller. Perhaps if I'd done so, I've be having an entirely different experience with the game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198014384587", "last_played": 1502055981, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 257}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1502057047, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503631", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1502057949, "recommendationid": "34069780", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
