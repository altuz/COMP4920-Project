I played this game with my daughters for 2 hours, loving every minute of it. Then got to the very end of the game and... died... I had no idea what killed me or why. So now I have to restart the whole game (no saved game!) a replay *all of it* if I even just want to find out what killed me, must less try to beat the game and get one of the good endings. Not likely to happen. \n\nTo the devs: I will redo my review if you fix this problem. Or point me to how to save the game properly. \n\nTo potential buyers. Other than this, this really is a good game. I actually think it's scarier and more fun than Paranormal Activity (well, pros and cons to both) though not as good as A Chair in a Room: Greenwater, though that is a really high bar to compare to.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198102212320", "last_played": 1502334288, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 123}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1500259226, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500413", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500259226, "recommendationid": "33599017", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
