After playing around 10 or so games, I like the game quite a bit, but it has a few issues now that I am hoping the development team fixes. \n\nWhat I like:\n[list]\n[*]The voice acting doesn't feel stale, sure you'll hear the same joke 6 or 7 times, but it fits well. It doesn't feel like it is being forced to be edgy.\n\n[*]The teams feel different. I've played most of my games with the Microhard Mutilators and you can see where the running back is a second or third option. On the other hand, playing with the Midway Mutants, your quarterback is slow and bad, so you want to not rely on the QB that much.\n\n[*]The halftime show is a nice bit of novelty that spices up the single player and can really make a difference if your good player gets killed in the 2nd half. (I do kind of miss throwing exploding footballs at the aliens though.)\n\n[*]Balance between the teams is there, but I wish there were an equal number of star players per team.\n\n[*]There is a reward for playing defensively, running out of bounds instead of getting your player killed can be a good strategic move. Throwing the ball away to negate a defensive dirty trick can help turn the game.\n\n[/list]\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n[list]\n[*]The fields felt totally unbalanced. The field hazards in Mutant League Football were nowhere near what they are in Mutant Football League. If you end up with the line of scrimmage being on top of one of the saws, you can count on 1 or 2 of your linemen to just die. Also, the AI is not smart at all when it comes to the non-stationary hazards. They will just run into the path of a saw blade or spikes or just stand still and get eaten by a space worm. It can be very frustrating in season mode when you'll have 1 play that kills pretty much your entire defense.\n\n[*]The time after plays feels a bit long. It's not hard sometimes to kill the opposing team's running back because he's just lying there letting you jump on him. It worked in NFL Blitz because there wasn't the punitive danger to your players.\n\n[*]When you leave resurrections off in season mode, it feels a bit unfair that the team you're playing against is always at full strength, but you have 5 or 6 guys that are dead from the start of the game.\n\n[*]There seems to be some kind of input lag when throwing passes. You almost have to throw the ball a tick before you actually want to. This can be hard when playing with a team with a non-mobile quarterback.\n\n[*]I wish there was a happy medium between no resurrection and immediate resurrection. Maybe have the players resurrect at the half.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, it's a fun arcade football game. As long as you don't take it at all seriously and understand that some of your star players will be dead by the end of the game, you'll have a good time playing it. I'm excited to see what the future holds and what the developers will do with the game.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 284, "steamid": "76561198003423959", "last_played": 1507173353, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 240, "playtime_forever": 284}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506993638, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502809", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506993638, "recommendationid": "35432192", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Mutant League Football is BACK!!!!
