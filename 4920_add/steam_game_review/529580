Coins you need to collect all to unlock lore also secrets, blue time coins give lives.\n\nGraphics and animations in the game work on a simple level there is nothing world changing here. I found the jumping animation to take too long for the level of response the game gives you. This messes with the pacing of the game and the layout of the levels are set with intense moments always followed by boring one, bottlenecking you in parts of the game and switching you off inbetween makes for a horrid mix.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are as simple as puzzles can be the 3 you will find are: Hit targets in orders, push a crate, and shoot a rope. This simple level of puzzles contradicts the difficulty in the game and adds another level of boredom and the secret to doing most of them is patients again messing with pacing.\n\nGame offers bosses which give you a different challenge to the levels, but each boss as a random aspect built in and the extremes that can be achieved are ridiculous offering you a challenge of just standing still to having to jump like a mad man in the same parts of the game. The mini game is based around a QTE system off hitting buttons at the right time, but an added extra spin of having to switch between characters give this part of the game substance and I found enjoyable.\n\nA lot of saves for some reason have extra lifes just after them, offering no challenge as you can just keep collecting more and more lives.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994868319", "last_played": 1477472881, "num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 334}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1477424443, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505262", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1477424443, "recommendationid": "26220082", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
