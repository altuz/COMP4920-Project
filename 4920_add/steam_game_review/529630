To be frank I'm a bit jaded because I am an alice fanatic and one of my dream games is an alice in vr. Trying to divorce myself from my bias, the game is rather simple there are a few puzzles in a small room that you need to solve with alice mechanics. Shrinking, growing, eerie music and the like are some of the alice staples and they are all thoughtfully included, with an added dash of sinister undertones thrown into the pot. At first, I could not recommend the game because of some minor issues (which become greatly exaggerated in vr) there was a lighting problem, which made the game nearly pitch black on my vive. On top of that the addition of motion controls brought with it a joystick specific solution to head rotation. The Yaw rotation (or mouse/ right joystick on gamepads) was mapped directly to the touchpad. This made the game extremely uncomfortable to play. However, after voicing my concerns the dev patched these issues within a week showing they care about feedback, with that said I can recommend this game whole heartedly.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043447148", "last_played": 1501536924, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 147, "playtime_forever": 89}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1496621220, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496621265, "recommendationid": "32187991", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
