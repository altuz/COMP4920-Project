From the moment I started in the room where you choose your locomotion mechanic, I was hooked. I've played it a number of times since, and thoroughly enjoyed the feeling of the hairs on my neck as it unfolds. I'm running it on a G1-1070 and it looks sweet, although the black elements could do with a little work as the HMD has a strange grey output in full black which feels like diving through barely visible soup\n\nThe only negative is the full locomotion option - it took me time to work out how to avoid simulator sickness, making sure to face forward whenever moving, and also rocking my head slightly from side to side to trick my vestibular system into thinking I am walking - its crude but works, and helped me enjoy this game (and other games with full locom) without suffering any nausea effects. \n\nThis is a very effective piece of work, and the complimentary demo shows great potential for the full experience.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197996885673", "last_played": 1488445204, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_forever": 37}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1488178395, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1488178395, "recommendationid": "30214444", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
