Then I saw that it was some weird puzzle game and not the RPG game some dude locked himself in a room for.\n\nDoing some looking into it, apparently now bob's game\u00ae (the rpg) is about making bob's game\u00ae (this puzzle game) and is still slated to come out soon\u00ae. So yes, this is the bob's game\u00ae you're thinking of, but not totally the bob's game\u00ae you're thinking of.\n\nBarring that confusion, I think bob's game\u00ae (the puzzle game) is a pretty cool idea wrapped in this weird half assed veil. But not the kind of half assed where it feels like the developer didn't give a shit about it, the kind where that same dev who's passionate about his game ran out of time, money, or inspiration, and instead of canning the project just decided to randomly release it 65% complete.\n\nI played through an entire \"run through\" of bob's game. The premise is this: you play a puzzle game in a screen space that's sort of similar to tetris, but whenever you \"level up\" by getting enough points, you change the rules of the puzzle game completely into another puzzle game. This is all happening while words and random sentences are flying at the screen like \"Wow, I've never gotten this far before!\" and \"SEQUENCE LINE BREAK\"\n\nI played some sort of weird campaign because it was the default option- it basically was the core premise of the game but randomly after I played long enough it yanked the controls away from me and said \"YOU WON!\". It's not even like that was the point I cycled through every game, as I saw repeats. I have absolutely no clue how multiplayer on this game could even work, and couldn't find anyone to play with (not surprising). \n\nI think the idea is that people create minigames, petition to get them added to the base game, and they get added through popularity vote. It's kind of similar to the game \"Move or Die\", but if the minigames were automatically patched into the game but the artist took the day off and just made everything spheres. This forces the players to constantly try and figure out how to play these user made games and score the best for leaderboard purposes.\n\nI actually really love that base idea.\n\nThe major problem with this is that your creativity is locked to the format of a falling block game, and there really isn't much room left for interesting or new falling block games as all of the good sane ones have already been made. This is backed up with the fact that I recognized 85% of the games that came packaged with bob's game\u00ae, and that makes me assume the other 15% is just stolen games I don't recognize. Sure you can just port good games that already exist to bob's game\u00ae, but all you can do from there is reskin it and put arbitrary scoring/powerups into it. And because of that, the leaderboards (if there gets to be anyone actually on them) will just be a test of figuring out how the scoring is stupidly different than the original.\n\nThe minor problems are the weird flashing backgrounds, the annoying music, the sensory overload, and the menu controls. But those are all so minor they only play into a small fraction of my opinion for bob's game\u00ae.\n\nI really don't know what to review this as- if steam had a \"Meh\" option to choose that would be it. I'm a solid 50/50 on bob's game\u00ae. On one hand it's a solid concept that if advertised well and made by somebody who is a bit more sane could be a great multiplayer game. On the other, the level for that creativity is limited which could cause people playing these made up games to be tedious. That and the fact that the creator of this game is somebody who got so mad at nintendo for not accepting his \"brilliant ideas\" that he tried to make an entire console to start competition.\n\nI think overall I'll rate it negatively as I feel like execution is more important than the base concept.\n\nEDIT: Realized that i'm stupid and the fact that it's open source means that technically any game can be ported into bob's game, not just drop puzzlers. I think that I will stick with my review as the execution is still not up to what it should be. (also if you have a million different types of puzzle games in one play session that would be disorienting as hell)\n\nEDIT of EDIT: Realized a day later that if you edited the source code of your game the only way to add it is to send it to bob and hope he merges it with the base game. The conflicting reviews above with the creativity this game could possess will then depend on how interactive bob is with this game in the future.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024976479", "last_played": 1488105387, "num_reviews": 115, "num_games_owned": 339, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1488106952, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522409", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1488178150, "recommendationid": "30192722", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "EPILEPSY WARNING: THIS GAME HAS FLASHING LIGHTS\n\nIt has potential, but I can't recommend it game right now.\n\nFirst things first, if you wanna understand this game, you need to know his shenanigans (google \"bob's game\"). \nDespite all that, the game is... Interesting.\n\nThe game is basically a \"crossover\" of several puzzle games, like Puyo Puyo, Columns, and Super Puzzle Fighter. You can either select them individually or play it on a set order, each game being its own \"stage\". That's a quite solid concept, but there are quite a few tecnical problems in this game\n\nFirst, visuals. The neon pieces are quite nice, but the problem lies outside the puzzle grid. There is a huge cluster of information concentrated outside of the grid on the left side of the screen. These  are huge lines of text (for an UI) with precise statistics. Things for a casual viewer, like number of lines, whith also numbers I've only heard being used by hardcore puzzle players, like current gravity and lock delay. I don't mind the quantity of information presented on screen, but I can see someone having a problem with that not being presented in text. It kinda looks like a debug build, Just text, mind you, nothing even remotely close to the aesthetics of the rest of the game. It's ugly and distracting. It is completely possible to have these statistics displayed in a more aesthetical way than this games shows right now. There there is so much text and information that,  if you're playing in the default windowed mode, four of those options will be hidden (I'll get to that in a second). \n\nMy second biggest problem is actually ironic, considering the last paragraph. This game has the habit to not telling what are you supposed to be doing in each segment. It probably helps that I played most of these puzzles, but there are a few games that are not self-explanatory (notably Super Puzzle Fighter). There are items on the game that I don't have the slightest clue on how they work. For example, the Pacman icon. What does it do? I have no clue. It doesn't work like in Pac Attack, because I can eliminate all the blocks present, and even then Pacman doesn't move (btw, Namco might sue you for using a Pacman, there's precedent for that). There are a few items on the first puzzle that I took a while to understand what they were doing, because the name of the information flashes rapdily on screen, giving me not enough time to process. \n\nThere's also no training mode, or any other outside of \"marathon\" or \"endless\", which... Actually, I have not that much of a problem with that, the quantity of games inside Bob's Game is a lot of content already (I kinda wish there was a \"random\" mode, with a randomly generated order of \"stages\"). \n\nAnd I will not try to use multiplayer because... Come on, Pelloni, you're asking too much from me. People are questioning the validity of this game enough, and you're asking people to register for online multiplayer? Come one, man.\n\nBut I would urge the author to not worry with extra features right now. Because this game is, above all,  collection of tecnical misteps. The game behaves differently based on the size of the windows, with information either missing or being relocated (and, need I remind you, this game opens in a small window by default). The transitions between games are very clumsy, without any kind of warning. The game loves using flashing lights as substitutes for more elaborate animations, which oh boy do I have a headache right now. Trying to vote basically softlocks the game with an error informing me the game cannot connect into the server. The menus are clumsy and look really bad. There's a wall of text on the title screen, with the author shilling his Patreon and other information (I'm not against Patreon, I'm against wall of texts polluting the UI). Scrolling is a mess, most notably in the tetris attack segment.\n\nWith all that said, this game has a lot of potential. The game sure needs a lot of work into it, but it is very possible to turn itself into a excellent puzzler. \nAnd its playable at least. That's a lot more than I can say about, for example, Tetris Ultimate.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "steamid": "76561198026258753", "last_played": 1506985306, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 1512, "playtime_forever": 68}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1488224153, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509473", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1488388801, "recommendationid": "30226379", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I downloaded this game to play multiplayer with some friends witch we could not manage to do.
