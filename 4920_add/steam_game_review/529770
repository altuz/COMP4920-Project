The story is short and it doesn't take more than 30 minutes to finish. i like the game concept but the graphic and artwork could use more work. the gameplay is nowhere good enough, i think it's a bit hard to control.

Iwas expecting something around 4hour gameplay. Took more time to download it than actually finishing it (50mins). Also, the game seems too \"heavy\". I have a computer that run most games on \"medium\" quality with pretty decent FPS, and this game did not achieved a decent FPS with all setting on LOW.\nPros: The idea and concept of the game is fantastic, the cutscenes are very philosophycal. The gameplay and mechanics are good (except for \"battles\"), making me experience a good freedom.\n\nObs.: I did not collect the 20 crystal, so I don't know if there's extra content after that.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067497149", "last_played": 1487788553, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_forever": 53}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487789004, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489510", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1487789004, "recommendationid": "30104799", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ley Lines is a free game that allows you to use an archer who can manipulate gravity, time, levitation and make bridges with her arrows.

You can even fall off platforms that you are riding on.\n\n4. Introduction\nToo Long Didn't Read. The introduction voice drones on at a really slow pace.\n\n5. Bad Tutorials\nYou need to tell the players where to shoot. Highlight the specific point they must aim at.\n\n6. Graphics are Boring\nIt's meh.
