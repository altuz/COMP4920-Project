It has as a great creepy atmosphere, and good art. Some of the deaths you can get here can be funny or vary scary, mostly scary. Now this game does not have a lot of sound, witch I would have liked, to have more of and one or two puzzles, can be a bit tricky but nothing too hard. And it can be/feel a little short, but its ok so all in all disturbed is a great scary little game. And witch I cannot wait to get/play the upcoming sequel too it.
