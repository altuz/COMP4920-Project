Again, it's short but it was very fun. It does remind me of Dark Souls/Souls series type games but that is not a bad thing for me. It is a first person variant to the challenging RPG, which feels innovative and fun. Looking forward to more. \n\nWell worth the 9 dollars.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197965982231", "last_played": 1504836586, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 226, "playtime_forever": 231}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1494020390, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511922", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1494020390, "recommendationid": "31567761", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Indie Breakdown with horror flair, not a roguelite but death is punishing and evokes a similar feeling of tension.

I figured that it may just be an earlier build and the game itself was improved, right? I bought it on sale and gave it benefit of the doubt after my thoroughly shit demo experience. Nothing changed in the full game, though. \n\nBefore I rant any further I'll list the game's positives in headers.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nFrom the hour that I experienced combined with the full game and demo, I did get some taste of combat - it's solid but unpolished. Dodging feels very nicely done. Using fists in a combo can be quite satisfying. Trying a new weapon (only found a kitchen knife) was refreshing as all the attacks and combos changed. I have to say though, the animations are sluggish and slow, like you're fighting every enemy underwater. It's very hard to get used to. Plus, the counter-attack timing is ridiculously precise. It gets to the point where you just get lucky if you ever try to counter, which you'll find isn't worth it when you're taking massive damage.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nIt's pretty standard Unreal Engine 4 stuff. The lighting and reflections are really nice though, and the motion blur kinda helps convey the ferocity of some attacks. Textures are pretty clear. You can see your character's body as you look down too. [spoiler](( NEXT GENERATION  ))[/spoiler]\n\nAlas, I gave up hope. The positives end there, simply because there isn't a way, or at least a [b]FUN[/b] or [b]REWARDING[/b] way to progress. The first area is a corridor with about 3 rooms branching off and an exit guarded by some fuckface attached to the door with infinite HP. There's also a boss, absolutely no warning to it, that will likely kill you in 2 hits. I never got past the first area. \n\nMy problem with this game is that it's unrewarding and ridiculously difficult, these two qualities do not mesh when making a good game. Why make enemies so ridiculously hard to beat when you can't even get some kind of hint towards progression or even a nice item? The first area just ends up being a loop in this way, constantly dying or, if you live, you can \"level up\" using \"essence\" from anything you've killed. Turns out that levelling up increases your power by a miniscule amount - you'll end up in a vicious cycle of going to kill the same enemies, levelling up, and then closing the game realising that there's no way to actually find enjoyment in this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000824730", "last_played": 1494444480, "num_reviews": 44, "num_games_owned": 453, "playtime_forever": 30}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1493829029, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493339", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1493829029, "recommendationid": "31527111", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
