It's not a finished product, and I doubt it ever will be.  It's purely a multiplayer experience, but I was unable to find players at all (not even one), so I just entered practice mode.  Unfortunately, entering and exiting practice mode is not a streamlined experience, and you spend a lot of time waiting for a 'match' to begin just to switch characters and try out different powers.\n\nI think this type of game could be fun if it was polished a bit more with better hand models and more moves per character.  Hell, I'd settle for flying and other/better locomotion options!  (Teleporting doesn't seem right for this game.)  Some bot matches and difficulty options would be nice, too.  Unfortunately, as is, this is barely a game at all, and I would rather classify it as a toy.  Give me some single player content and some quality of life features, please.\n\nFor 49 cents, I won't be refunding this game.  It's really not worth worrying about.

I love the concept but the execution might need work...\n\nIt's very Early Access and it shows. I was very wrong in my video when I said it was only a couple bucks. This is a pretty expensive game for VR especially for what it is. It's a game that's going to live or die by whether or not it can entice permanent players to fill the match making queue. It's not going to do that at $14.99. That would be a good price for the final product but in its current state i can't recommend that based on price alone with the current content.\n\n\n\nVR Gameplay 7/10 (could be a bit faster with shorter rounds. Fighting the same opponent for 15 minutes gets on the dull side atm.)\nVR Graphics 7/10 (Nothing to write home about but acceptable in this situation. Some of the textures feel like they were ripped right from DBZ)\nAudio 5/10 (Not much going on and what was there was soso.)\n\nLocomotion 7/10 Complex two hand teleport with movement restricted by the same energy you use for combat. Literally Fight or Flight...\nThere are no locomotion options at the moment. -1\nThe default locomotion is teleport. -1\nThe teleport is complicated by a second hand controlling rotation where most games that allow you to select your direction do it on a single controller. -1\n\n\nNot recommending purely on the amount of content for the current price. If it were $3-4 or less, I'd recomend it because it is a neat concept and something unique and will probably touch a childhood fantasy for a lot of us.
