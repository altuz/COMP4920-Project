It's one big enviroment with little rock islands that you can jump from/to, also a ship that you can use to explore more. Every difficilty level is time limited, but I did notice that when killing enemies the countdown progress bar (red) decreases, so I guess you can gain more time this way! The attack style is actually pretty cool, I naturally thought, that I would have to aim somehow but when fired it seems to attack the nearest target... which is useful because you can just focus on dodging, that really brings you points, one dodge seems to be one point. The minimum difficulty is really slow and easy, but the DOOM (last one) is mental! No one can dodge that! The second or third difficulty levels are kind of where I feel comfortable right now. This feels like a game where you can bring a bunch of friends over and compete with each other, I'll give it a go this weekend! Also, I tried playing it standing and sitting and I personally prefer standing. Played it with Oculus Rift and used Oculus Remote. My friend has a Vive, we'll try it out in the next few days and see how that goes, but overall it's a really nice competitive game!\n\nUPDATE 23.09.2016:\n\nWorks on Vive the same as on Oculus Rift.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198263031762", "last_played": 1474484829, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 27}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1474487056, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510380", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1474616334, "recommendationid": "25624715", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This was a really neat experience and it\u2019s pretty nice to see a VR game that has something more to offer. It\u2019s so realistically made, the feeling of standing there in the middle of a huge ocean and trying to survive each plasma attack is awesome! Dodging the \u201cbullets\u201d and then especially striking back gives you so much satisfaction \u2026 yeahh, alien dude, you been owned! The attack is nicely done, by the way, when you don\u2019t have to actually aim precisely at the enemy to hit it. That would be pretty impossible cause of your own dodging and all the dynamic, too. I played with Touch controllers, so I gotta say the shield on your arm to protect from plasma bullets is a nice touch to the game. I used it as a last resort only and a bit more on higher levels (those are seriously crazy!), it\u2019s a sweet perk! A big thumbs up was the score showing on these hand monitors of sort, cause you don\u2019t have to lose time and focus to look around you to see your score. Also I must say, thinking that sickness level would be off charts was totally wrong. Teleporting is very smooth, even on the ship and when the waves get big I didn\u2019t get sick at all. Steering the ship is really fun, and that fortress area you can teleport to has a proper view! I checked the master sheet that comes with the game (you can obviously make a serious strategy for playing), so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get bored of it any time soon. For now I just had a lot of fun with the game, playing casually, but even dodging and busting the enemies gives you enough exercise for the day! This is definitely one of the most dynamic and immersive VR games I played so far.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198289513362", "last_played": 1481989479, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_forever": 81}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1484503263, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505562", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1484503263, "recommendationid": "29279535", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
