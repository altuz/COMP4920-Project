There are so many bugs, and not just random glitches or crashes. But I have a list of reproducable easy to find problems that I could report to the developers to fix. Menus and dialogs clumsy in a way it felt like it wasn't playtested. \n\nBut is was still worth a play through. The map is large and it felt rewarding to take the four characters through the same areas and solve the puzzles differently each time.
