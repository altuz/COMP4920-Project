But that is it. For 5 minutes... The trailer is misleading aswell. You cant fire up to ledges or from ledges making strategic placement a joke. It wants to be C&C, Dune 2000, KKND but it fails on all levels. There is one tactics. Beeline to Cannon Tower. Build 5 of those and the AI cant get past. Doesnt matter if its infantry or not. Then you can in your own time build up your doomstack and just waltz right in. The campaign is a joke. Its basically the same maps on boths sides with them doing the opposite. All units are the same with different models. The graphics are good enough but there is plenty of hit detection bugs where units are pushed out over an edge and just stands there glitching up and down. The UI is good enough, to few indicators (like no deploy mouse cursor when moving an MCV), some tried and true staples. It works good enough. The healthbars are overly big for some reason. It hits some tropes and nostalgia and what makes an RTS great, but it misses out on the majority makin this the most mediocre 6 hours of RTS ive ever played. Go back and play the old ones instead.

I really wanted to like this and support a developer working on a classic RTS style game, but this simply isn't worth it even on sale. The basic mechanics are there and the graphics and music are ok, but it just feels unfinished and lacking - only one background, poor AI (it just keeps sending small waves of troops at you in the exact same place at regular intervals), slow movement, very limited upgrade options for buildings or vehicles (which seem to make little difference anyway), can only repair one vehicle at a time even with multiple factories, no ability to build second bases (might have been possible later in the game but I'd given up before then). The missions themselves are dull, and the story is presented in quite possibly the worst drawn and written comic book-style panels I've ever seen. The game would literally be better off without them and their inclusion makes it feel very cheap and amateurish. Considering that C&C3 can be had for less and is better in every single way by a big margin, it's impossible to recommend this.
