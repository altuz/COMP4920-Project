Proof of concept, I was running a lone SD40 and having to hold it at notch 6 to maintain 50mph with zero slope. In ts2017 and real life, you would be alternating between lower notches. For something touted as \"ultra realistic\", getting such a basic tenant of locomotive operation seems baffling, especially when considering the same developer has been getting it right for years in ts20xx.

It's a diamond in a rough, yet something you shouldn't get..... yet. Not unless you have a VERY beastly computer (above & beyond) and into serious train simulators, yet you'll still find many horrible simple errors with the game to facepalm over. I have yet to own a proper train sim game, thus trying to fill in the void with this game. You need a super computer to run this game, something that I find silly when it should run smooth even on a very low setting. It runs the same on low, medium, and high that something in the background isn't optimized properly. Yes, this game is highly complex, meant to be the 'next-gen' train sim, yet isn't appropriately optimized. What's the point of having a next generation train simulator when you can't even run it, or struggle to have it run. You still need to make sure it runs on as many computers as possible to gain profit to fund the game.\n\nI managed to enjoy the game when it ran smoothly, such as in the tutorials, and once with the coal run in Heavy Haul. I enjoy it, yet the game is so damn rough around the edges you feel it barely being held up on its supports. You can find numerous people venting about the FPS, yet nothing is being done. The forums is a toxic place to be on... The community is a toxic mess that they whine and moan about anything under the sun that everything is a nasty mess. When asking quentions nobody really wants to answer any of your replies, only resorting to childish trolls.\n\nI enjoyed making a character for the profile, yet there needs to be more customization option for that. It's a nice foundation needing to be further expanded on. The leveling system needs to be broken in more by being attached to the various things you can, and can't do. The discoverables is a nice system, encouraging you to explore the highly detailed maps. The trains run very realistically and heavily, something I've enjoyed a hell of a lot. A shame the FPS ruins it all. I absolutely love realistcally starting a train, getting it rolling, having it lock into a row of coal carts to then get going, load the coal, and uncoupling. That's where the fun is at. \n\nGreat Western Expansion is also awesome. The enormous amounts of detailing placed there, the platforms, the trains. Being able to be as a passenger is awesome. Everything is awesome, yet it also goes without saying both this & heavy haul need to be further expanded on to be larger. There's lots to have fun with thanks to the 'services' & 'being a passenger' options, yet it's all hindered by basic bugs & glitches, as well as general FPS issues that numerous amounts of people also are complaining about. \n\nThe priority for this game should be to fix the FPS issues others & myself are experiencing, something trolls shouldn't defend saying that we magically have garbage computers. FPS should be priority one, more so when trains warp & glitch when passing your train in 'Western Expansion' DLC. There's just so many careless & lazy flaws left in the game that it's upsetting with how high the price tag is..... Common, DTG, don't be this lax with your products......You only have yourself to blame on simple carelessness. \n\nThe game also needs modding support, map making support, and support in adding 3rd party trains......FPS issue however being number one.\n\nIf I made the frame rate issues, the train warping, and sound glitches type errors to occur in a stricter workplace (one I'm in now) I'd be hounded to the point I'd fear coming to work.....I would need to see a doctor for a mental break down for allowing such errors in TSW to be allowed in public.......\n\n(I\"ll delete, rewriting this review to be positive when DTG decide to finally address any FPS errors.)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "steamid": "76561197973954932", "last_played": 1506297081, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 318}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1506020192, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503109", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506020613, "recommendationid": "35111455", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So, this is the successor to Train Simulator, made by the same developer. It has potential, but IMO it still is an unfinished product that should not have been released yet. The developer is known to release things half-bugged. Sure, the graphics are fancy and being able to walk around is funny (although I personally do not consider it core gameplay).\n\nThe main problem is this game is currently lacking content, which is because it's new, and the developer needs time to develop content for it. Makes perfect sense, but that means that you're getting less track for your bucks. If you're already familiar with Train Simulator, than you probably know what to expect of Train Sim World. The core gameplay is basically the same.\n\nIf you're new to train simulators and not sure if this is the type of game for you, I'd recommend to look at the older \"Train Simulator\" series first. Sure it looks less fancy, and instead of walking around the train you can only sit in it and control one (which is what it's all about, IMO), but the core gameplay is practically the same. Train Simulator has been in development for quite some years, which means a lot more content is currently available. Both official DLC, third-party content, and user created content. You'd get more routes, and more diversity, for the same amount of money. Especially if you wait for sales. \n\nBy buying TSW now you are funding the developer to develop the game further.

Unreal Engine 4 has transformed Train Simulator, and breathed a lot of character and life into the environments. Trees and grass sway, and people and vehicles roam the land.\nThe weather effects are amazing too, with rain finally impacting on the environment with puddles and reflections, emphasizing the glare on trains' headlights.\n\n\nYou can do a lot more too in CSX Heavy Haul. No longer are you a prisoner in the cab. You actually have legs!\nYou are free to roam about the environment on foot, moving between different locomotives, actually refuelling your own trains, manually uncoupling your trains and switching tracks. \n\nAs well as the tutorials and scenarios you would have come to expect from Train Simulator, there's a new Service Mode too. \nHere, trains run on an authentic 24-hour timetable. You can choose a time, season, weather and the location and can either experience AI trains running the lines on an authentic timetable, or take control of services and drive them yourself. This mode will no doubt shine in its' busier DLC routes down the line, as the route included in CSX Heavy Haul is rural (and therefore not that busy).\n\n\nContent wise, on it's own, CSX Heavy Haul won't give you a lot of bang for your buck, with very few scenarios being included. Then again, it's designed to be added to with what will no doubt be a vast choice of DLC routes and trains in the future. If you're used to 'Train Simulator', then you'll get the idea.\n\n\nOverall, Train Sim World has now set a very solid foundation for the future of Train Simulator, with better visuals, effects, interactivity and variety over it's now dated predecessor.\nLike a flower, this will blossom over time as it's choice of content grows and other features are added.\n\nDovetail are clearly very keen to make this work.\n\nI'm definitely glad I've jumped back aboard ready for what will no doubt be a fantastic future for Train Sim World, and if you're a fan of all things trains, you should too!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 258, "steamid": "76561197970944205", "last_played": 1506887946, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 371, "playtime_forever": 1922}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1504997231, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506567", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504997337, "recommendationid": "34848422", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Is it perfect?

I've to use joytokey to use my personnal throttle with less less precision ! this part is a great deception for a \" realistic hardcore sim\" it want to be. the key sensitivity not always the same regards to different train.\n- attach the cars / waggon seem not realistic at all ?  just reverse at low speed and it's done , or maybe only this approximation for the tutorial parts ?\n\n\nedit : \n\nimportant key : F3 for FPS\nImportant Key : key 9 for map and path changer\nImportant Note : in Scenario 2 for cold start : if brake pressure is above 79psi  give som brake to set it down close to 79psi.\n\nimportant Note :  my new review is17/20 as it is great,  immersive and rewarding. Love it so far.\nAfter 40 hours for all scenario, driving a train can be sometime a bit boring ... but it's good for what it is.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 461, "steamid": "76561197973661444", "last_played": 1506802275, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_forever": 2414}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505046566, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502253", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506632587, "recommendationid": "34860728", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "this game frame rate suckssss asss", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 206, "steamid": "76561198414224701", "last_played": 1506469519, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 613}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1505676929, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495304", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1505676929, "recommendationid": "35031496", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
