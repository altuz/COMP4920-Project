I got hope they will make the Weapons skins/ flight control better soon enough tho \n\nI do reccommend this game though as I am aware of their works and know their capable of doing a lot more as they did in the past", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027459368", "last_played": 1502102553, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1501424408, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508858", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1501424408, "recommendationid": "33905840", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "PLEASE NOTE: MY RECOMMENDATION COMES WITH A HUGE ASTERISK!\n* This game is actually terrible!\n\nHowever, it's a kind of terrible that I cannot help but find hilarious, it's the kind of terrible that I cannot help but laugh my damn arse off at. The plane flying minigame alone is so damn funny, due to it's utterly broken control scheme, that it's a barrel of goddamn laughs.\n\nIf you're looking for a serious experience, battlefield 1942 or the like, stay away from this game as it's probably one of the worst FPS games I've played. However, I have way more fun with this than I do C.O.D and in comparison to other shitty FPS games, it's better than some cynical ass piece of trash like Stealth Force: The War on Terror. The game tries to have a lot of variety and you're bound to find something so inept that you'll burst out laughing at it.\n\nA complete and utter abomination... but a hilarious one at that.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198015161096", "last_played": 1504302352, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 531, "playtime_forever": 171}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504301368, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495192", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504301368, "recommendationid": "34669752", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}]}
