Graphics have improved a lot since the original. The weapons targeting is much better, there is a level editor. What is bad is the lack of old trails, it is not possible to play every game on each track. And what was the worst thing in the original was the rocket and the grenade launcher ... These two guns would get a lot of fun on a level. Please let the original tracks be added to the map repertoire and take out this 2 gun weapon and the game will be good. If you want more players then I think you're about to throw 1000 keys and what's important to give the game a workshop support. It would be very good if you could download maps from a workshop. Thanks for reading it.
