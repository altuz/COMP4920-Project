The environment delivered here is exquisitely detailed and feels solid, but persistent clipping bugs and other small issues keep it from feeling ready. The story fragment that this game tells certainly rouses interest and curiosity, but the continuation feels a long way off, if it'll ever come. The puzzles are reasonable, sometimes offering multiple solutions, and the presence of non-helpful items gives the game, on the one hand, a realism that few adventure games offer (in the sense that every object you can interact with has its use somewhere), and on the other hand, can be frustrating as you wonder why more parts of the environment aren't available for interaction.
