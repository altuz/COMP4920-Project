I love a good adventure story.\n-Extremely long. It felt like a really good book.\n-Never boring\n-Likable characters.\n-Awesome soundtrack.\n-Free H patch\n-Kymil's voice ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n-All six endings were unique. I had fun finishing them all.\n\nCons:\n-The art was...okay. Some derpy faces here and there, but nothing too distracting.\n-I felt like choices hardly mattered in the game. All you had to do is stay close to your desirable route and you get your ending.\n-The voice acting was also...okay. The voice actor of Carrault was too gruff and Seere was too nasaly, but they were managable.\n\nI can't wait for Chess of Blades, fam.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198241596864", "last_played": 1500515048, "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 119, "playtime_forever": 77}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505689310, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505689310, "recommendationid": "35034922", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
