The controls are simple enough for anyone to jump in, and gameplay mechanics get changed up slowly, but steadily. Difficulty hasn't proven much of an obstacle yet (I'm at 30% iirc), but I'll admit that I've played a fair share of puzzlers so that definitely helps. Can't say much about the lifespan yet but at this kind of price point it's hardly a factor. Personally I'm a big fan of games like Mole Mania and Catrap, so this is right up my alley. Good puzzle games make the most out of simple control schemes, and since you mostly only need to use the arrow keys for [i]Warlock's Tower[/i] I'd say mission accomplished!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006876338", "last_played": 1486640770, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 86, "playtime_forever": 212}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1486142196, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505955", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486142196, "recommendationid": "29673670", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Beautiful and addictive.
