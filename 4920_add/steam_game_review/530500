There are like ten endings, several branches, and apparently to make it more \"challenging, there are no pointers to places in a room you can interact with, which are a lot of the time exactly the same as everywhere else.  There are no hints, nothing to help out.  I beat the tutorial and one of the main rooms, and I'm not sure if I did that the \"right way\" because I didn't get a main ending.  Unless the developer fixes this, this game is a complete failure.
