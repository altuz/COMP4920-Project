Graphics are good but not great.  If it's on sale you really can't go wrong.  It does offer hours of platforming.  The controls are probably the worst thing about the game.  You can get an xbox controller working for movement, jumping and firing bubbles using the input settings in the launcher but not from in-game and you still need KB/M to get through the story and tutorial screens.  This game works very well with the stream controller if you take a little time to get your button bindings set correctly.  This is a fun game that can be had for little money but just know that the controls take a little time to setup if you want to use a gamepad and the Xbox controllers don't work in the story and tutorial screens.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198081972143", "last_played": 1496210651, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 371}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1496240951, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496240951, "recommendationid": "32086838", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
