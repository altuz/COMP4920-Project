Fanboys with no concept of how game development from small studios works start claiming the sky is falling and the project is doomed.\n\nDon't believe the hype. Steam Hammer received a recent small patch, and the developers have spoken up in the forums to squash these silly rumors.  The game is still under development. Go ahead and buy it and know the project is new and being attended to.\n\nI'm going to recommend this game to any fan of sandbox/crafting games. Of course it's in alpha and there are issues. That's to be expected with every early access title. Steam Hammer wasn't kidding when it says that it's a \"hardcore\" game. The U.I. is a bit complicated at first. Crafting and collecting resources takes longer than other titles in the genre. Steam Hammer is more about staking a claim, making a clan, building a self sufficient town for your clan members to control and operate out of. Then potentially battling with other clans for control of a map area using Victorian era rifles and air-ships. There are some \"pre-made\" structures on map that can be claimed as your own. Sounds like fun to me :)\n\nI will update this review as time goes on, but over-all I'm happy I supported the project and I do not regret the purchase.\n\n\nKeep in mind this is VERY Early Access. 6/10 at the moment. Worth a buy.\n \nPros:\n-Great Steampunk themed concept. \n-Nice ambience. \n-Hardcore gameplay that's more adult based.\n-Teamwork in multiplayer is crucial to dominate.\n-Claiming land and maintaining it is cool!\n-Very small yet friendly community. Mostly European so far.\n-PVP is possible, yet murder carries penalties.\n-Deep RPG elements for your character.\n-Bioware/KOTOR/Mass Effect style alignment system.\n-Elder Scrolls: Morrowind style levelling where you level up what ever skill you use.\n-Terraforming. Shape the landscape.\n-Many interactable items.\n-Weather affects growth of crops. Deeper gameplay concepts.\n-Host your own server, clans, etc.\n-Reasonably priced considering you could waste years in-game.\n\nCons:\n-The day and night cycles are too long. About 1 hour = 12 hours in game.\n-The U.I. is a bit clunky compared to other games.\n-There is clipping issues through the ground that will kill your character... at the moment.\n-It's possible to get stuck in very shallow holes you can't jump out of.\n-Crafting stations break too easily and are too expensive to repair.\n-Slower paced than other games. Requires patience and devotion.\n-Not really suitable for younger kids. Very complicated gameplay.\n-I have encountered a crashing issue server-side. But it fixed itself.\n-Sometimes it's difficult to interact with objects because the wrong menu pops up.\n-Many servers were removed due to low population. No NA servers at all.\n-Map is somewhat too small.\n-Crafting some items takes too long. 15 seconds or more easily.\n-Crafting recipies could be more clear.\n\nUpvote this post to spread the truth to others. Games like this only get better with support. This is a title you could perceivably get addicted to and play for years just like MineCraft or Space Engineers.
