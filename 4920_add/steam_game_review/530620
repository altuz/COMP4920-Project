The links can be found below for anyone who is interested. I put quite a bit of effort into them.)\n\nAs a fan who has been there since 1996, i was one of the few people who saw in the teaser, what this game had the potential to be when it finally came out! I spent a lot of time covering the game and defending it from those who were so quick to dismiss it as a P.T. clone. In short, i have a long history with RE and RE7 so when i finally got my hands on it, and it was everything i hoped it would be, you can imagine my excitement! \n\nThe game isn't without its issues however, as a second playthrough has really opened up my eyes to the fact that, some more enemy variety would have been great. Hope to see some classic BOW's in the sequel! (Copy that Capcom?!) \n\n-The graphics are very good, but some spots look \"off\" the outside areas can feel flat, and some textures just don't feel like they belong in an otherwise fantastic looking game. \n\n-Sound is fantastic, especially with headphones (no brainer) <--- see what i did there? ;) Everything sounds great, creepy sounds, bumps and creeks will keep you on edge, enemies have distinct sounds to let you know they are just around a corner, or the other room, waiting to dismember you with glee. The music is very tonal, and dynamic, it typically goes with the pace of the game, but not many of those \"iconic\" Resident Evil tracks, like for example, the RPD main hall, or Spencer Mansion basement (kek). Which is unforunate, and i can't help but feel little else but the Aunt Rhody theme and Save theme will remain in 10 years time to those nostalgic listeners. But i understand why they made that decision. \n\n-Controls are your standard first person fare, though a bit slowed down by default to match the more methodic pace they set for the game. I honestly didn't even check to see if you can adjust sensativity as it just felt right. Controller guys will be happy to know everything functions just fine in that department also. \n\n-Performance is great for most people, but some of us have had issues with stuttering on AMD processors and other hardware incompatatibilities. I had to turn things down to about medium settings, which honestly still looks fantastic, and had no issues aside from a crash here and there. Hopefully Capcom patches these things for those of us with problems. \n\nAll in all i feel RE is back to what made it great! Isolation, backtracking, key items to progress, resource gathering, conservation, inventory management and a great mystery to unravel all topped with classic horror movie homages! The game will take on average, 10 or so hours to complete with plenty of reasons for a replay or two!

The RE7 teaser encourages exploration and puzzle solving. Ammo is also scarce and you are provided with limited carrying space, although you won't have to worry about maxing out your carrying space in this demo. Evading your enemy is also a better strategy than fighting them head on, which brings back the suspense of enemy encounters.\n\nThe most noticeable change is the first person perspective. This view plays well, considering how small and cluttered the environments are. The first person view can be frightening because you can't see an enemy stalking you from behind. The game also uses FPS style controls, but they don't take away from the challenge. Some supernatural elements are included, which I didn't really like myself because the old Resident Evil games were more sci-fi in their approach. Of course, this is just a demo, so maybe the supernatural elements will be kept to a minimum in the full game. \n\nDespite the RE7 teaser not entirely following the formula of the original RE games, the RE7 teaser is still an enjoyable experience.  \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970740493", "last_played": 1488411554, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 161, "playtime_forever": 347}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1485121703, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502546", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485121703, "recommendationid": "29431829", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I liked the demo.

After how poorly Capcom has handled the previous installments of Resident Evil, and with the addition of some really poorly made spin-off games, people have had high hopes for a return to the classic RE style of survival horror instead of action \"horror\". Sadly, after seeing the trailers and playing the demo, it seems that many people don't understand what this idea of \"going back to your roots\" actually means, Capcom included.\n\nAnyone who has played Resident Evil since its beginning knows what the games are like. RE's roots are in traditional survival horror with campy characters and dialogue that give the games a charming appeal while still maintaining a creepy atmosphere. They can be very formulaic in structure and story, but the basic mechanics and gameplay are simple. You solve puzzles, find keys and weapons, and try to avoid being killed by zombies and various special creatures strewn about the map. However, from the demo, it seems as though Resident Evil isn't \"returning to its roots\" so much as becoming an entirely different game. The mechanics feel like a cross of Outlast and Amnesia, where the focus is on the first-person perspective and groteque visuals of the environment instead of the traditional survival horror that the series is known for. The problem with the switch to first-person is that it's an easy way to abuse cliches that currently run rampant in the horror genre. Some I noticed in the demo were the use of jumpscares and the poor flashlight in exceptionally dark areas to force a sense of fear due to lack of vision. It feels as though this installment will just be using various tropes right out of currently popular first-person horror games and just become another generic first-person horror game, full of poorly done jumpscares and loosely relating to the RE franchise.\n\nThe game has little to no feeling of being a Resident Evil installment outside of the title, and a blurry photo of a helicopter baring the Umbrella logo on the tail. [spoiler]While the basement creature has serious appeal and definitely looks like something out of the franchise[/spoiler], the rest of the game feels so disjointed from the franchise. I'm sure it's been said time and time again, but it just feels like RE7 is attempting to bank of the popularity of Outlast and PT, and instead of making a new IP out of it, they're slapping the Resident Evil title on it in hopes of winning over the shrinking population of RE fans that are willing to buy their games.\n\nFeel free to try the demo and come to your own conclusions, but don't go into it expecting this to be Resident Evil \"going back to its roots\" because it isn't. This is just a PT/Outlast clone with the RE title.
