Simple, but challenging.\nThe problem is that when I reach about 6 rooms into the first level, the game freezes for a moment, then the game restarts and I end up back in the middle of the starting field with no health and commanded to heal myself. I've done this 3 times now. \nI then closed out of and restarted the game and it put me into a room where you can select what boss you want to fight, and then it got stuck on \"generating dungeon: 0%\". It's still there as I type this review.\nI want to support this game, since it's cheap and fun, but I can't recommend it until it's playable.\n\nEdit1: I restarted the game again, and this time it generated the dungeon.
