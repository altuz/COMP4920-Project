You can go through maybe 10 puzzles or so, but if the timer runs out, you need to start from the \"chapter/stage\".. This sounds fine until you realize the your character doesn't move directly vertically.\n\nControls:\nLike Grimm said, the controlls are horrible, and better designed for mobile.\n(Space) = dig\n(Right Alt) = Mark mine... er grave.. But Marking a grave doesn't do anything. You can still dig on a marked grave.\n(Left Alt) = Special Dog Hint Mode, which shows you a heatmap (recommended graves to dig up)\n(I forgot) = Special Lightning, where you get to randomly disable a mine, but only on certain levels. (But what's the point of mines then?)\n\nScore:\nMaybe there's some benefit to never losing your dog, or getting a perfect score, or powerup store... but it's a meaningless counter for all I gather.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198033891555", "last_played": 1477785089, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 244, "playtime_forever": 211}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1477790911, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517891", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1477790911, "recommendationid": "26304823", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
