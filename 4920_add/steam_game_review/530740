That being said, I would say the one thing that might be a bit unique is the customizable mech in a shoot em up game. The best way to describe this would be like the old Medabots games, you mix and match robot parts and as you take health damage you lose parts and the attacks linked to those parts.\n\nPretty fun, the difficulty spiked pretty quickly on normal (note that the modes are casual, easy, normal, hard). It's a shoot em up game that would probably be much more enjoyable with friends, the lack of online is a bit of a bummer.\n\nThe first 2 stages were really slow but after that it got significantly harder. The stage progression is different in that you can go backwards into stages you've passed up instead of having to always progress forward, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about.\n\nCustomizable robots is nice but I think I would have actually preferred the more popular rogue-lite route of whatever pickups you choose to take replace/augment your current ones instead of being able to pick and choose out of everything you have ever taken. It's also weird that they let you know exactly which upgrade is available in which stage.\n\n\nMax resolution is below 1080p but this isn't a genre that you would play for amazing graphics anyway. Runs smoothly and consistently at good frame rates.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044873014", "last_played": 1476132594, "num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 362, "playtime_forever": 31}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1476117487, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535504", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1476132691, "recommendationid": "25968660", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "You've probably heard of some games that had a lot of vision but suffered a bad implementation.
