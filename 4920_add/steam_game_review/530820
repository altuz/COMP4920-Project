It really needs to have an introductory area for each of the abilities like how well Portal did with the easy learning curve. The whole game through you have to just figure out what they do. I got lucky on the first map that used the \"clock with the 3 arrows over it\" as I had no clue as to what it did. The 2nd area with it I ended up on the store page where I finally found far down in the description what each thing actually did. \nThe parkour crap is plain annoying and not a puzzle. Those were like filler rooms.\n\nIt has some cool ideas and concepts, but it just feels like half the game is missing. \nA combination of these things made many areas quite annoying.\nAlso, all the text popping up at the beginning with the controls WHILE the guy was speaking was not smart. Have the monologue then release the player and remind them of the controls.\n\nNo Quick Saves/Loads sucks. You must go to main menu and reload the whole game and lose any progress in the level you were in. Glitchy in places. The shiny/higly reflective ceiling is confusing at times making it seem like there are gaps over walls for instance. Also makes it somewhat hard on the eyes.\n\nWhile I do appreciate the hard work from only ONE person making this, it's no excuse to release it in this state. They should've called on for volunteers to help. Many people would have helped for free.\n\nBottom line: I can not recommend at the current price point and in its current state. Will update if there's a major update to the game.\n\nI recorded my full blind run of the game. I was going to do a walkthrough video as well, but by the time I finished, I couldn't stand the thought of playing it again.\n\n[b]Video: https://youtu.be/a96PjpTu6ss[/b]\n\nP.S. (Other random thoughts)\n\nThe whole maze thing using the time power is such a cliche thing from Portal and most people do not like the maze/world portal thing that I know of.\n\nOh, and in that one level with the 2 cubes, 5 barriers, + the 2 small barriers for the cube holes. . . There's nothing to tell the person what opens the door. 2 Big buttons and 2 small buttons. It would make more sense to have to get them where you do in this level, but with the cubes on the same size buttons. AKA, no signage/antline issue. \n\nThe area with the stairs is the only area where I knew what was truly intended and tried to break, but couldn't. That being said, I have no clue on many others if I did them as intended.\n\nPLEASE KEEP WORKING ON THIS! GET SOME HELP! It feels like you got burned out and said fvck it, close enough, to make some quick cash or something. \nA small group could make this a really good game.\n\nAddendum: 3 Steam cards and all 3 were Orange cubes.\n\n Got all achievements just by finishing the game except for one and no details are given until you actually get it.
