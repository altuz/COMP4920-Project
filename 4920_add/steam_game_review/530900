ALL RIGHTS RESERVED UNDER \nCOPYRIGHT CONVENTIONS BY ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANJ^ \n\n\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL NOTE \nLEO TOLSTOY, 18281910 \n\n\n\nCOUNT LEO NIKOLAYEVICH TOLSTOY was born \nAugust 28, 1828, at the family estate of Yasna- \nya Polyana, in the province of Tula. His moth- \ner died when he was three and his father six \nyears later. Placed in the care of his aunts, he \npassed many of his early years at Kazan, where, \nin 1844, after a preliminary training by French \ntutors, he entered the university. He cared lit- \ntle for the university and in 1847 withdrew be- \ncause of \"ill-health and domestic circum- \nstances.\" He had, however, done a great deal \nof reading, of French, English, and Russian \nnovels, the New Testament, Voltaire, and \nHegel. The author exercising the greatest in- \nfluence upon him at this time was Rousseau; \nhe read his complete works and for sometime \nwore about his neck a medallion of Rousseau. \n\nImmediately upon leaving the university, \nTolstoy returned to his estate and, perhaps inr \nspired by his enthusiasm for Rousseau, pre- \npared to devote himself to agriculture and to \nimproving the condition of his serfs. His first \nattempt at social reform proved disappointing, \nand after six months he withdrew to Moscow \nand St. Petersburg, where he gave himself over \nto the irregular life characteristic of his class \nand time. In 1851, determined to \"escape my \ndebts and, more than anything else, my hab- \nits,\" he enlisted in the Army as a gentleman- \nvolunteer, and went to the Caucasus. While at \nTiflis, preparing for his examinations as a \ncadet, he wrote the first portion of the trilogy, \nChildhood, Boyhood, and Youth, in which he \ncelebrated the happiness of \"being with Na- \nture, seeing her, communing with her.\" He al- \nso began The Cossacks with the intention of \nshowing that culture is the enemy of happi- \nness. Although continuing his army life, he \ngradually came to realize that \"a military ca- \nreer is not for me, and the sooner I get out of \nit and devote myself entirely to literature the \nbetter.\" His Sevastopol Sketches (1855) were \nso successful that Czar Nicholas issued special \norders that he should be removed from a post \nof danger. \n\nReturning to St. Petersburg, Tolstoy was re- \nceived with great favor in both the official and \nliterary circles of the capital. He soon became \n\n\n\ninterested in the popular progressive move- \nment of the time, and in 1857 he decided to go \nabroad and study the educational and munici- \npal systems of other countries. That year, and \nagain in 1860, he traveled in Europe. At Yas- \nnaya Polyana in 1861 he liberated his serfs and \nopened a school, established on the principle \nthat \"everything which savours of compulsion \nis harmful.\" He started a magazine to promote \nhis notions on education and at the same time \nserved as an official arbitrator for grievances \nbetween the nobles and the recently emanci- \npated serfs. By the end of 1863 he was so ex- \nhausted that he discontinued his activities and \nretired to the steppes to drink koumis for his \nhealth. \n\nTolstoy had been contemplating marriage \nfor some time, and in 1862 he married Sophie \nBehrs, sixteen years his junior, and the daugh- \nter of a fashionable Moscow doctor. Their \nearly married life at Yasnaya Polyana was \ntranquil. Family cares occupied the Countess, \nand in the course of her life she bore thirteen \nchildren, nine of whom survived infancy. Yet \nshe also acted as a copyist for her husband, \nwho after their marriage turned again to writ- \ning. He was soon at work upon \"a novel of \nthe i8io's and *2o's\" which absorbed all his \ntime and effort. He went frequently to Mos- \ncow, \"studying letters, diaries, and traditions\" \nand \"accumulated a whole library\" of histori- \ncal material on the period. He interviewed \nsurvivors of the battles of that time and trav- \neled to Borodino to draw up a map of the \nbattleground. Finally, in 1869, after his work \nhad undergone several changes in conception \nand he had \"spent five years of uninterrupted \nandjgxceptionally strenuous labor Tnnierthe \nIbesfcondUtions of life/' he published War and \nPeace. Its appearance immediately established \nTolstoy's reputation, and in the judgment of \nTurgenev, the acknowledged dean of Russian \nletters, gave him \"first place among all our \ncontemporary writers.\" \n\nThe years immediately following the com- \npletion of War and Peace were pa**efl in a \ngreat variety of occupations, none of which \nTohtoy found satisfying. He tried busying \n\n\n\nVI \n\n\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL NOTE \n\n\n\nhimself with the affairs of his estate, under- \ntook the learning of Greek to read the ancient \nclassics, turned again to education, wrote a \nseries of elementary school books, and served \nas school inspector. With much urging from \nhis wife and friends, he completed Anna Kare- \nnina, which appeared serially between 1875 \nand 1877. Disturbed by what he considered his \nunreflective and prosperous existence, Tolstoy \nbecame increasingly interested in religion. At \nfirst he turned to the orthodox faith of the \npeople. Unable to find rest there, he began a \ndetailed examination of religions, and out of \nhis reading, particularly of the Gospels, gradu- \nally evolved his own personal doctrine. \n\nFollowing his conversion, Tolstoy adopted \na new mode of life. He dressed like a peasant, \ndevoted much of his time to manual work, \nlearned shoemaking, and followed a vegetari- \nan diet. With the exception of his youngest \ndaughter, Alexandra, Tolstoy's family re- \nmained hostile to his teaching. The breach be- \ntween him and his wife grew steadily wider. \nIn 1879 he wrote the Kreutzer Sonata in which \nhe attacked the normal state of marriage and \nextolled a life of celibacy and chastity. In 1881 \nhe divided his estate among his heirs and, a \nfew years later, despite the opposition of his \nwife, announced that he would forego royal- \nties on all the works published after his con- \nversion. \n\nTolstoy made no attempt at first to propa- \ngate his religious teaching, although it attracted \n\n\n\nmany followers. After a visit to the Moscow \nslums iri 1881, he became concerned with social \nconditions, and he subsequently aided the suf- \nferers of the famine by sponsoring two hun- \ndred and fifty relief kitchens. After his meet- \ning and intimacy with Chertkov, \"Tolstoyism\" \nbegan to develop as an organized sect. Tol- \nstoy's writings became almost exclusively pre- \noccupied with religious problems. In addition \nto numerous pamphlets and plays, he wrote \nIV hat is Art? (1896), in which he explained \nhis new aesthetic theories, and Hadji-Murad, \n(1904), which became the favorite work of his \nold age. Although his activities were looked \nupon with increasing suspicion by the official \nauthorities, Tolstoy escaped official censure \nuntil 1901, when he was excommunicated by \nthe Orthodox Church. His followers were f re- \nquently subjected to persecution, and many \nwere either banished or imprisoned. \n\nTolstoy's last years were embittered by \nmounting hostility within his own household. \nAlthough his personal life was ascetic, he felt \nthe ambiguity of his position as a preach", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198264886385", "last_played": 1502235065, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 104}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487362240, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492846", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1487362240, "recommendationid": "29992317", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Good fun for about 30 mins. not worth paying any money though.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000251171", "last_played": 1485647866, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 413, "playtime_forever": 32}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485648024, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495427", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1485648024, "recommendationid": "29553013", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "pretty amazing game , my mom bought me all emoji packs\n\ncan't wait for the emoji movie", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198086542805", "last_played": 1486406298, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 303, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1486406304, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489835", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1486406304, "recommendationid": "29746767", "votes_funny": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Suprisingly a good game lmao", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198153935420", "last_played": 1486489177, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 36, "playtime_forever": 298}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485979163, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492845", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1485979163, "recommendationid": "29635068", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
