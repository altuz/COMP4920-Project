When I mean short you can complete the 2 levels combined in less than 15 minutes. Yes that's the entire game, 15 minutes. The levels are the first sections of the first chapter, the game is following some kind of story. That's not described but you can tell there's meant to be a plot.\n\nThe amount of content in this game, regardless of the polished quality is no more than a demo. This game is incomplete and should not be purchased until the developer makes this into a complete game. Go ahead, pay \u00a314.99 for a demo, it's your money. I feel cheated and so will you when you reflect on how little there is. You can argue there's replay value in those 2 short levels, sure, but that will wear thin quickly.\n\nMy advice, add to your wishlist and keep an eye out for new content. If it's on sale then it's your shout whether to take a gamble. Just remember this game was released over 6 months ago. Does that give you confidence, 6 months development time post-launch for a 15 minute game?", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198020445786", "last_played": 1497135866, "num_reviews": 111, "num_games_owned": 779, "playtime_forever": 35}, "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_created": 1497137277, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482934", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1497304580, "recommendationid": "32329984", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Tech demo....blurry...short.....overpriced....played it once...done.....", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197974854004", "last_played": 1490939996, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 276, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1491813075, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500572", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1491813075, "recommendationid": "31056215", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
