It's Early Access at best.\n\nThe item descriptions make no sense, the tutorial doesn't mention core gameplay mechanics (e.g. it doesn't mention using the grip buttons to drop markers), and how to use the essential repair tools are not explained.\n\nOverall, you will feel really frustrated because you don't know what anything does. For example, your probes go missing with absolutely no explanation as to why. Check the battery, check the fuel, aaaaaaaaaaaaand it's gone.

The voice acting (robot) and grammar is absolutely horrible. Wish they would hire someone that has some experience with interactive storytelling and possibly a minor in English to proof and correct the several grammatical mistakes. Gameplay-wise, the game is very stable and hand controls in VR work well enough. Getting around can be confusing though and it takes time getting used to the hand-based UI system. Flying the ship around is not very intuitive nor cinematic. You essentially fly to the sun of each system and send a probe to look at planets while you stare at a sun the entire time. Would be nice to actually pilot the ship. The graphics are also nice. I bumped up to 200 on the super-sampling, turned AA on and set textures to Ultra and there was no sign of FPS drops at all (1080 Ti).\n\nWith futher refining for controls, some added gameplay elements and a better voice actor and grammatical fixes, this will be a fun VR game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198052331508", "last_played": 1499878029, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_forever": 36}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499878407, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500461", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499878407, "recommendationid": "33483838", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
