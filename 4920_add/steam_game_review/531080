I have only played it for about 30 minutes so far, but I was completely enthralled.\n\nThe game is set at a 3/4 angle viewpoint and is a point and click diablo-style dungeon crawler game. Being in VR the left hand moves the screen around and has some light zoom in/out. You need to use the left hand as a candle to light your way as well which was neat. I actually sat down at one point to get a closer view. The way the graphics are everything looks like little toys. I actually felt like there were little action figures in front of me animating and fighting. It's a fairly simple game but I can see a lot of cool things being done. Early access so you know there's more to come.

The UI is fairly minimalistic but feels really good, and the VR controls are tight. The art assets themselves aren't going to amaze anyone in 2017, but they did a great job making everything coherent. With some solid lighting they give the game a pleasing aesthetic that is easy on the eyes in VR and just looks cool to be in. There is a VR tutorial built into the game which is also a big plus. Not related to VR, but I also appreciated the campy-yet-adorable voice acting.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay isn't likely to blow you out of the water, but I think the package as a whole is fun. There were a few annoyances - sometimes the menu spawns inside a wall and gets cut-off, and the in-game controls help shows the gamepad controls even if you are using the Vive controllers. It also took a while to figure out how to move the playspace which I don't think was mentioned in the tutorial. All in all, it's a solid take on a tabletop perspective game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961485482", "last_played": 1492560092, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 317, "playtime_forever": 84}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1492567029, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510703", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492567029, "recommendationid": "31229484", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pretty great VR dungeon crawler, Interface works fine \"no accidentally moving your player useing menu\" :).\n\nTips. I thought I could not adjust height of table \"active devloper got back to me right away\" (Hold the right-hand grip button while raising and lower the controller.\"adjusts table height\") also (you can scale the world as well by using the grip-buttons on the left and right controller simultaneously) this is wonderful to have/know as i was hurting my neck before.\n\nPros. active develpor :), nice design, smooth, good quility models, enemies \"good veriety off the bat, nice models took a moment to just zoom in on them, good control, spells, pick ups, loot, gear (having your menu open either slows down time or stops it which is good, you can pick spells, scrolls and potions without rushing... the play is in real time its not a turn based system if your standing still without menu open the world is still going on (you also need to keep telling character to attack will not auto attack...).Status effects Fire/posion damage over time, I also like that you die a good bit thou you seem to just respawn at start of that level with all progress on that level staying put. \"maybe theres a limit to respawns before loss? i died 2 or 3 times.\"\n\nSometimes a level starts and you get swarmed by all enemies on that level, almost certain to be a death thou i kind of like it (if you dont got the scrolls and potions)\n\nNegs. When scaling size/height of table you can end up hiding the menu(the one not on controller) having a way to see health and mana at any time not having to look at that external menu would be welcome. Also maybe a way to pivot map (rotate the map) would be nice.\n\nI'm recommending the game it feels soild, whole playable game and its the first of its kind that i know of in vr.
