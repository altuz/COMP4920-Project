The graphics are only slightly better than what you would see in an 80's gold box game or 90's Master of Magic etc...  So with that expectation properly in mind, I would very much give this game a hearty recommendation.  If you're familiar and enjoy TBS and management games this is one of the better ones I've seen.  If you're new to the genre or on the fence the dev has a free demo on their website that I highly recommend trying before purchasing.  I purchased the Gold add-on which allows you to edit all the stat's of the units, which is fun to play around with.
