(I ended up going back to the game for another hour and a half)\n\nThe game is a very charming twin stick shooter. I keep getting too greedy and dying instead of retreating so I haven't progressed past the third level (now fourth), but I was having fun the whole time.\n\nGame play is basically flying around gathering flying fish for oil and blowing up enemy planes and gathering crafting items to build up your plane, the number of plane parts is still pretty shallow but it just entered early access. Flying up to a new level whenever you feel like you are ready for a difficulty jump. You can return to base with a diving mechanic to return with your loot. If you are shot down you have a chance to try to guide your burning plane back to your landing pad, it takes a bit of practice. If you do the crash landing you lose all of your currently equiped plane parts and all the loot you are carrying, if you fail the landing you need to start a new game.\n\nThere are a couple control rough edges that I am sure will be cleaned up soon. Keyboard/Mouse control with 2 monitors led me to clicking outside the game area causing the game to lose focus. With the controller the starting gun is single shot and fire is bound to the right trigger, I found it quite hard to spam fire since you must fully release to fire again. The other guns I tried all had auto fire, but I didn't get to try them all yet. Both problems are easily fixable.\n\nI am guilty of playing alot of games once and then letting them rot in my library but I will definately return to this one when I want some light action. Pretty sure this will be a \"Just one more try\" game when I should be going to bed.

The D-Pad Down to land is quite hard to find out, even with the small banner telling to press it when you're almost dead (in that situation I'm not reading anything and am just trying to survive ;-)).
