The movement controls were so bad that it was actually easier to sit still and fire at the enemy while an inch away then to actually move it around. The editor was extremely simple and felt like it didnt matter what i put on my tank as long as i had the bare minimum. The graphics made me feel like i wasnt wearing my glasses. I actually regret spending the $0.74 that it took to buy the game. Heck, they'd have to pay me in order to make me play it more. Not sure what high school freshman made this game, but it doesnt belong on steam.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042437374", "last_played": 1484099035, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 69, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1484099621, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518174", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1484099621, "recommendationid": "29174545", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The Controls suck The Graphics suck And The general idea sucks  Overall this is one 99 cent that i want back", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198168085073", "last_played": 1503696905, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 51, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1492216884, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492216884, "recommendationid": "31146380", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
