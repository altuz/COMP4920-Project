It is a rogue-like first person shooter. Unlike othere games in this genre POLYGOD is really really good. The developers listen to the community and regular updates the game. They frequently make changes to the game balancing when enough players requests it. \nThe game itself has an old school feel to it. The gun is in the middle bottom of the screen (like the original doom). Each enemy a specific attack pattern. The levels are randomly generated. Usually this means poor level design but with POLYGOD this is really well done. The levels has a seed that can be adjusted by the player. The games blessings (will come to that shortly) is attached to the seed so each run will be the same with the same seed. There is also a daily dungeons for competing against other players. The blessings is basically a power ups. They are bought using souls, that s acquired from killing enemies. The power ups are great, varied and the more powerfull power ups usually have a down side, for balancing purposes. A great touch is that each power up affected the look of the gun. The graphics are simple low poly style graphics with no textures. This style works really well. POLYGOD is definitely worth the asking price at the moment. Great gameplay and a responsive developer make this game one of the few Early Access games thats worth the risk. \nP.S.

I did contact the devs, and found that I could play with other people in the US, just not my overseas pals. Its EA so I can't give too much shit, but for a massively multiplayer update I was let down on that component entirely, and was the reason of purchase.\n\nThe other issue I have is the projectile amount, with certain loadouts the amount of particles are computer demolishing and there is no hard limit it seems to how many you can acquire. 2x, 3x, 4x 5x bullets, with more bullets that trail, that split into three, that have subsonic waves. The amount of projectiles and performance of them is really obnoxiously bad and left for some really awkward balance by my longest playthrough to the final boss.\n\nThe entire screen was filled to the brim and I could clear the entire map with 5-10fps destroying my CPU @ 4.7ghz on an i7. Definitely needs some balancing/tuning/performance work because for a rougelite fps the balance wasn't there at all it felt like, you either went mega-clear with high damage or you didn't. \n\nI'd say wait a bit until it gets polished up, but avoid if you are looking for long-distance coop as its pretty much built in to not work, or show games half the time, and I'm not the only person who dropped into the Discord to check if the damn thing would work.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197996739487", "last_played": 1497228604, "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 366, "playtime_forever": 320}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1498521985, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513761", "votes_down": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1498521985, "recommendationid": "32835672", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
