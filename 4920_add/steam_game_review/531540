Since it was a SciFi themed game, it immediately skipped to the top of my playlist.\n\nThen I was stuck in an absolutely tiny window reading an excessive amount of text in the tutorial because I couldn\u2019t adjust the resolution once the tutorial began. I admit, that soured me on the game. \n\nAs for the tutorial itself, it was thorough and explained things fairly well, BUT it didn\u2019t feel like I learned how to truly play since I was simply told the rules and told what to play when. The tutorial is both very good and not a proper introduction to playing.\n\nGiving the game another chance does reveal a lot of good things about it. The ships are good. There is excellent variety and quality art. The game design and game play is reasonable and well thought out. Unfortunately the game feels too slow over all. Even playing with a speed human deck it feels like you are grinding away in order to win.\n\nIf you are looking for a new card game, you could certainly do worse. This game doesn\u2019t make it into my recommend list, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t make it into yours.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198078815095", "last_played": 1487306810, "num_reviews": 100, "num_games_owned": 806, "playtime_forever": 101}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1487306821, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491693", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1487306821, "recommendationid": "29976985", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Sucks!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198095217331", "last_played": 1486436904, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 33}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1486436976, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482753", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1486436976, "recommendationid": "29753936", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
