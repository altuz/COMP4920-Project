The dialog, the world, how it starts all add up to a must have game for me.  I can't wait to play it fully fleshed.  \n\nThings I love off the top of my head?\n- ALL the little hidey holes.  OMG the caves, the waterfalls, the nooks and crannies and finding hidden loot.  :)\n- The dialog.  Shiny.\n- No fancy gimics or specials on the shooting.  Aim and fire.  Like it should be.  \n- Maps as well maps.  No blinking indicators or flashy crap. A map as a map that you have to read.  \n- The World is breathtaking,  the flora is colorful and the critters are wild.  \n\n\nImprovements I would suggest?\n- Make the keys mappable or provide alternate left hand key mappings. (I saw in a post that this will happen, please don't forget it.)\n- Give me more!!  I want a quest to build legs for Swift Strider, I want to craft with all the loot. Please let me push at least one of the hijackers into the starship engine when I find my ship.   \n- And that brings me to the loot.  Please let me sell the junk.  I am the loot mistress and dropping stuff, well it hurts.\n- I would like to play as a female.
