That's about the extent of the positives.\nThis game is lacking the basics of game design. It almost appears as if the game developer has never played games themselves before or had nobody test it and give feedback. In the first 10 minutes of gameplay, enough \"game design sins\" occurred for me to quit.\nFor example, restarting a level takes way too long. This is the kind of game that gives you stars based on how many moves you took each level. I don't like getting less than 3 because it feels like I didn't really complete the level, so I restart quiet often. Partially because (another game design error), the game doesn't tell you what e.g. buttons do. There are buttons on some levels that raise a tile of the map, but there's no indicator of which one it raises. So you have to just test it out and restart afterwards because, unlike before, now you can actually plan your moves because you know what to expect from the button. Anyway, the restarting takes too long. When you restart, there's an animation that takes away the level, then the screen fades into a \"Level x\" screen to, I guess, remind you which  level you're on? Then there's another animation that brings the level back, followed by an animation that puts your player on the level. This is way too much stuff for a simple restart mechanic and it's frustrating that you have to wait through it every single time you restart.\nAdditionally, the game is lacking basic option menu features. There are no volume sliders, only a simple on/off for sound. I guess the developer expects the player to go into our OS volume mixer and adjust sounds there? There are also no fullscreen/windowed/borderless options at all, which is fairly annoying as this is a game I would be playing on one monitor while watching videos or something on my second monitor, which fullscreen doesn't lend itself to. \nAlso, the controls aren't great. The game encourages dragging in the direction you want to move, but it can get pretty tedious. There are also arrow key support, but they're too confusing due to the perfect 45 degree angle the level has from the camera. Perhaps if it was more like 30 degrees and the arrows were better aligned with the camera angle it wouldn't be so unintuitive. Also, as far as I know, there are no restarting/undoing shortcuts with the keyboard, you  have to press the buttons in the bottom right of the screen. The developer, back in 2016, seems to have said that this would be added in a future update but I can't figure button it is. Of course, this wouldn't be a problem if the developer had decided to have a basic keybindings option in the menu, but they didn't so I have no idea if it's in the game or not. This is particularly annoying with the undo button as, as always, there's an animation associated with it. So if I want to quickly undo 10 moves, then tough luck, I have to wait for like 5 seconds for the game to complete the animation between each click. Also, quick note, the undo button is weird and annoying as well. It seems random as to how many moves you can undo. Sometimes it's just one and sometimes it's like 15. Of course there's no explanation at all of how it works.\nAs far as the actual puzzles go, they're not great either. There's nothing to discourage you from simply mashing buttons until you get 3 stars (asides from the rage-inducing restart-mechanic, I guess), so a lot of the levels degenerate into random attempts.\n\nAnd these are just my impressions after the first chapter of the game. I suppose I'll keep playing it though just to use it as an example of what not to do when designing a video game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007064315", "last_played": 1498204414, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 303, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1498196437, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507463", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1498197513, "recommendationid": "32666457", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a great little puzzle game.
