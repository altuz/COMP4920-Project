Again, this game is quite punishing.\n- You will likely need to find and read that guide on rpgcodex.net, because the game doesn't have a good enough tutorial and even the help section is lacking.\n- Game does a poor job of explaining how necessary crafting and alchemy are. It's quite difficult to balance your build to account for that.\n- A lot of metagaming is required, heck I didn't even know there was more than 1 ending, and you need high Charisma for the others.\n\nI will still recommend this, but you need to know what you're getting yourself into before you buy it.\n\nThis game can be very frustrating and punishing at times.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 750, "steamid": "76561198099003350", "last_played": 1506352677, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 327, "playtime_forever": 750}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506344832, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506344832, "recommendationid": "35202377", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I like hard games, and this game just bends you over and rapes you raw.  If you didn't play the first game, you'll have no idea what you're going into, will end up around 6 hours in, and find out your only option to progress is to cheat or restart.  Game is overly reliant on RNGesus. \n\nCult following (including devs) is ridiculously toxic.\n\n@Vince - I have already uninstalled - so I can't post a SS unfortunately.  I had been set up with 6s and an 8 in Int and Cha with pretty much all of my points in Spear and Dodge with a few in block/crafting; (forgive me for not remembering my party member's names, they barely said anything in the game.  The Hammer guy from the beginning, the Crossbowman you can convince to trade sides, and the half-blind Legionnaire guy).  I played on the standard AoD difficulty - it warns you that you'll die alot, but I can't say that I take that sort of thing at face value - as a sort of random comparison, I tend to succeed fairly ably at things like XCOM2's Impossible/Ironman modes without needing to resort to savescumming.  This game seemed a large engagement in frustration, with very very low chances to succeed at even basic manuevers.\n\nMy progress was halted at the fight with Reinard.  There are 2-3 battles immediately before that grant little to zero healing afterwards, and I was generally just screwed over by bad luck with crits / ability damage that I was unable to recover from.  The thing was, I had been completely able to handle the fights leading up to them without an overmuch difficulty - the scorpions in the caves gave me minor trouble, but I got past them in 2-3 tries. Reinard and the preceding encounters basically wiped the floor with me - triple archers in one fight, guys with (apparently) auto-criting/very highly accurate bombs that deal immense damage, and pretty much always being forced to assail the enemy's position meant bad things.\n\nThe inventory system / lack of complete tooltips also drove me completely mad, but that's another topic all together.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 427, "steamid": "76561198000938806", "last_played": 1506293149, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 108, "playtime_forever": 427}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506289780, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506466235, "recommendationid": "35191563", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
