At first I liked it just point and click to shoot.Don't touch the zombies. Simple concept. The fact everything was slow was annoying but did not kill the game. Then the update came. It made the guy faster,reloading faster and the zombies faster. How much faster? Blink and you die. The game is now broken. Before the update I could make to floor 7 or 8. After the update I barely make it past floor 3. Why? The ony shot you can make is a headshot. The Zombies heads are tiny. The weapons do low damage and everything moves the speed of light. The dlc's are the same story. I did like the Music though but it gets repitive and the GameBoy graphics gives it a nice retro feel. It brings back my own memories of playing games on the gameboy. Why is this game so broken? Why is this game crap? Is winning even possible? Should I destroy my gameboy?
