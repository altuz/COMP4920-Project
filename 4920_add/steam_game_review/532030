Here is hoping for Sequel with just as much dreamy trippy visuals and great music.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198308020997", "last_played": 1501992823, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 111, "playtime_forever": 278}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1501980617, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1504774328, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497678", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1501980617, "developer_response": "Thank you so much!
