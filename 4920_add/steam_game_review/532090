Harvey has succeeded at his quest and found a girl to marry. Unfortunately, he falls into a depression as he no longer has a purpose and tends to laze around all day. His wife leaves him (7 years later), and he continues in his dark ways... until the ghost of his brother shows up... and well, a new adventure starts.\n\nBanter is as fun as the first title, and some of the puzzles are amusing. I would suggest playing the first game before this one, just to get the backstory if nothing else...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "last_played": 1501136073, "num_reviews": 362, "num_games_owned": 445, "playtime_forever": 94}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501136534, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501136534, "recommendationid": "33825335", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
