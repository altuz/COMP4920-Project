After experiencing Melee movement and microspacing I found myself desiring these options in other games as well, so I had high hopes and bought WaveLand on release.\n\n     Gameplay: Within minutes I approved of the game's physics and movement. Mr. Foster tuned his level design splendidly with the beast he had constructed. The input buffering and hitboxes all feel precise. The potential for optimization and speed in WaveLand is massive and addicting. Several times I could not make myself leave  a level until I was #1 on the leaderboard. After introducing the concept, no time is wasted in ramping up the difficulty, and similar to Melee, WaveLand might be treacherous for the casual gamer. Those hungering for a challenge will have their appetite sated. In game currency is entirely for aesthetic customization, but obtaining coins and solving hubworld puzzles is fun and satisfying in its own right.\n\n     Story: Messages are scattered  throughout the world alluding to the overarching plot of the game. The story is sparse and slightly cryptic, and is certainly not the focus of WaveLand.\n\n     Visuals: I'd lay money that WaveLand was created in Gamemaker, which typically means the visual quality is largely tied to the skill of the pixel artist/animator. In WaveLand's case, everything looks clean and clear. There was not a single time that my eyes were confused about any part of the game. Everything is immediately recognizable which allows a player to react and maintain speed even in the first time through the area. Environmental art keeps things fresh and imaginative between worlds while remaining unobtrusive.\n \n     Sound: All sound effects are distinguishable and appropriate. WaveLand's soundtrack is mixed nicely with the feel of the game. It functions mainly as slighty hype background music, but there are some inquisitive and atmospheric touches in the hubworlds.\n\n    Closing comments: WaveLand is fully aware of itself. Most game elements function as above average placeholders and take a backseat to the core mechanics. This game is about speed, efficiency, and near frame perfect inputs a la Dustforce. While the roots are strongly in Melee, the mechanics come into their own with a few intelligent tweaks.  I must praise Mr. Foster specifically for his level design, difficulty curve, and overall awareness. The later levels fully respect and employ the difficulty that is called for when you make wavedashing your core mechanic. We should all keep our eyes out for his upcoming projects in the future! Congratulations to Logan Foster on a well-made game. Your love for Melee movement is shared by many, and is palpable in Waveland.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198061128125", "last_played": 1495767065, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 182, "playtime_forever": 1163}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1492732662, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515632", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1492732832, "recommendationid": "31265559", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I've never played melee more than ten minutes.

Melee's game exploit known as wavedashing. In this game, you wavedash,the act of dodging towards the ground and then gaining momentum from it. It is your main method of movement. In this game, you will also come across wall jumping as an ability and a shine-stall, which lets you stall in the air and reflect projectiles. The game can prove to be very challenging and have extremely tight situations. My biggest gripe with the game is how it handles time. If you fail to beat a level in a certain amount of time, you will be unable to progress to the Nightmare levels which are required to beat the game.

The versatility and possibilities in the movement is darn near perfection.  Other than that, what you see is what you get - clean and clear visuals with a signature flair alongside a powerful OST.  The level design is fun and unique, with the hub world just as nice as each level included in it, and the atmosphere, while very cryptic, is interesting and inviting.\n\nEven with the abundance of references to Melee both from players and the game itself, I actually felt it played a lot like a spiritual successor to Dustforce, another speedrunning platformer which is amazing, obviously with a few key differences.  I've played my own large share of many Smash Bros. games, but I was never interested in the intricacies of high level movement.  Given all of the time spent in those games and a large number of other platformers, speedrun-ny or otherwise, this game still feels like it has a life all its own, even when it flaunts its inspiration.\n\nBuilt from love, loads of fun, and a bargain price tag.
