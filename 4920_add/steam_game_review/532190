I remember playing hockey games on the Sega Mega-Drive, and most of the fun to be had in those games was derived from trying to start a fight in the game. It was a novelty, but a lot of fun. So much fun, in fact, that there was a Monster Hockey League game that tried to amp up the violence a bit. Super Blood Hockey is a fun tribute to those old hockey games, with a dash of extra violence. No need to wait around for a fight, they happen quite a lot. Even the ref can get knocked over in the mayhem! My only gripe with the game is that the speed of the characters feels sluggish, and almost tank-like in their turning for some. Luckily, you can unlock a feature to adjust the characters weight, essentially giving them all a speed boost. I feel like it should be faster off the bat, but still, this is a great nod to those old hockey games, and has a fantastic, frantic arcade feel to it. Highly recommended, especially with friends!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971831420", "last_played": 1505126921, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 549, "playtime_forever": 39}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505133844, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500123", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505133844, "recommendationid": "34882076", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I saw a Reddit post about a negative review on this game, and a response from the game dev.

There are several game modes to choose from, as well as challenges. The challenges range in difficulty and unlock a number of features in the game giving you a goal to keep you coming back to play some more.
