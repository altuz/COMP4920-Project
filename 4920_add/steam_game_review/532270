Quite easy but still amusing. Excellent material for demoing Vive to others, not so much long term content for yourself. Bought it on sale at -66% (5,09\u20ac), definitely worth it at that price point.\n\nThrowing parts were mostly mediocre, they are implemented well but personally I don't like mixing it with weapons. Most maps can be finished standing still but some needed crouching or some movement to see behind objects.
