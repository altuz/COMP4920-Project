Would you rather shoot up an orchestra of sentient instruments, or a swarm of abstract female genitalia? It's all here.\n[*]The available aspects. From bullets to bombs and from swords to salamanders. There're 12 of them in all and they each offer a unique play style.\n[*]The music. Although a good chunk of the soundtrack is derived from external sources, it all somehow suits each scenario as it comes. In particular, the themes of stage 3A and its boss sent shivers down my spine as I played.\n[*]The lore. I can't say too much about this, but the mysteries and legends give the game an even better sense of depth.\n[/list]\n\nThings that I think could use some fine-tuning:\n[list]\n[*]Hinderances to visibility. In some of the more \"flashy\" stages (particularly in the latter half of stage 3B) some bullets, especially smaller ones, tend to blend in with the background to the point that they are difficult even to see.\n[*]Lag. Most of the game is pretty good about maintaining a constant frame rate, but there are certain events that cause a distracting amount of lag. Most notably, that complex, multicoloured portal that appears after Stage 1 brings the game almost to a halt. Other, more minor instances include: the curtains at the end of Stage 2C, the water ripples by the end of Stage 3A, and the transition halfway through Stage 3B.\n[*]Bugs. A game-crashing error occurred when I game overed in the middle of the boss of Stage 4B, stating: \"Unable to find any instance for object index '156400' name '<undefined>' at gml_Object_obj_redclaw_hand_Step_0\". Aside from that, there is not much to complain about, although there is a minor bug that I encountered in the game settings menu, where the descriptions for some of the the options are out of place. For example: when \"Extends at\" is highlighted, the description for \"Show Boss Timer\" is shown.\n[/list]\n\nIn summary, [i]In Extremis[/i] is great. While I cannot call it \"perfect\", at least in its current state, the overall gameplay is both stable and fun; it is a solid game. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys shoot-em-ups who would like to try something a little different, as well as anyone looking to get their mind twisted and turned by this work of art.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198274179021", "last_played": 1499483647, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 57, "playtime_forever": 444}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1482607085, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505084", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1482607085, "recommendationid": "28606628", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Cool shoot 'em up with unique aesthetics.
