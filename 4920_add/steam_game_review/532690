The annoying part is that you must watch how the exploration unfolds and it gets boring pretty fast. I also think the game is more of a visual novel with exploration and sadly I don't really like VNs. \n\nOther things in the game:\nThe trading is not so engaging\nThe battles are easy, just takes time.\nThe texts and cutscenes can't be skipped\nVisuals are nice\n\nMaybe I'll play some more, but it would be only to see the final shape of my world.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198085037210", "last_played": 1487152231, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_forever": 326}, "votes_up": 29, "timestamp_created": 1487171792, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542954", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1487171792, "recommendationid": "29943456", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game seems alright, but it's definitely niche and has some story-driven events. Although it may resemble some similar old games like Merchant Prince/Machiavelli or Uncharted Waters, it had a very different game mechanic that makes it more of a hybrid of RPG and Visual Novel with (kind of) the exploration aspect of 4x strategy games.\n\nIt's main big draw is the ability for players to determine whether their expedition's discoveries are true or not. Quite an intriguing mechanic, as it allows the player to control what landmass is discovered for each expedition.\n\nI'm recommending it mainly because the game's stable so far and I have not seen any notably big bugs as of yet. However, keep in mind that the game is definitely niche and might not be as fun or entertaining for people not into this.\n\nOpinions on the game, in sum:\n\n- it has a long tutorial-like section and it can take an hour to unlock the main features, including dowsing for treasure.\n- its story-heavy in some parts, although after the tutorial-like section, the player is free to do other things in addition to the story events.\n- some might not be a fan of it, but I seem to like the zooming in and searching for items portion. I kind of get that it is intended to invoke the feel of exploration and searching for treasure in a vast map, but some might also see it as kind of gimmicky and strange, not to mention a little eye-straining.\n- there's no tactical combat. Just had to mention it. On the other hand, at least there's not much combat to handle directly, so that's a plus for players who prefer to autobattle stuff.\n- the exploration part is the big feature of this game. Landmasses can generate and the player can agree or deny that the newly explored region look like that. This is one of its main feature, not to mention allowing the player to change the world through this mechanic.\n- trade is basically kind of like matching resources to produce secondary resources, which is similar to Star Ruler 2's resource system - for example, coffee and milk makes coffee milk. Distance also affects how much gold each trade route produce, as is the speed and capacity of trade ships. Of course, the matching resource part is not necessary for making profitable trade routes sometimes.\n\n\nI think that sums up my review of the game so far...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006683021", "last_played": 1487248935, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 959, "playtime_forever": 583}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1487234450, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514984", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1487234450, "recommendationid": "29957825", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So this game is amazing, right?

This could be a very enjoyable game, but there are a few things that should be addressed.\n\n1.  A pause button.  Time continues to move as you scroll around the map looking for new treasure chests that\n     may have popped up since you last looked at them.  The Main Menu doesn't always pause it, as I have had\n     new events happen while in it.  I don't like RTS games, so I added that tag for this one, because it plays like one.\n\n2.  Mapping.  Unlike some other reviews, I actually like the fact that everything outside the \"known\" world at\n     the start of the game is different with each playthrough.  Unfortunately, in my very first game, I had a quest\n     location end up being totally inacessable ... the Red Sea was an inland sea, like the Caspian.  No way yo sail\n     into it.  And as part of it is \"known\" at the start of the game, making it land locked is inexcusable.\n\n3.  I could do without the repetative running commentary during voyages.\n\n4.  Kraken.  At first I was exceptionally annoyed at them.  Then I realized that what they probably represent\n     are the actual dangers and expense of exploration during this period.    Otherwise, I could do without\n     the fantasy aspect.\n\n5.  The scale.  Sometimes you have to scroll all the way in to see something.  That annoys me as it makes\n     the time expended to recheck the map 4x as long.\n\nI plan on restarting and trying it again.  Currently at 8 hours into the game.  As noted in item 1, you always\nneed to re-review areas of the map previously explored for new pop-ups.
