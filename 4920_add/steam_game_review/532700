I'd say: if you can live with the cons listed below, by all means do check out the game.\n\nPro's:\n- Really cool creative puzzle mechanics! Takes a while to get your head wrapped around it.\n- Soft colours, nice simplistic art style and music.\n- Philosophical messages in between the levels.\n- After playing a while, you learn how to take 'shortcuts' in the game, entering sections at weird angles and getting away with it. \n- This whole game is made by one person.\n- Cheap game, and it will probably take a couple of hours to finish it.\n\nCons:\n- Everytime after I flipped the world, I couldn't move my mouse right away after the landing, it'd snap right back into front view position before I could look around properly. In a game like this, that is a big disadvantage and very annoying.\n- WHY is spacebar the 'turn the world upside down' button? How many times I instinctively tried to jump and instead flew off into oblivion...\n- No rebinding keys.\n- The mouse sensitivity is way too low!\n- The camera angle: it's hard to tell what's right below you and when you flip the world it's disorienting.\n(- It doesn't tell you how many crystals you need to collect per level. Can be annoying at times.)\n(- Little spelling errors in English.)\n(- When I started the game a while ago, the achievements didn't work. These are now added.)\n(- I still don't understand the use of the Special Tube... except that one time I randomly drifted into space, created a Special Tube, steered myself towards it and it dragged me right back into the level.)\n\n\nThanks for reading, I hope this has been of some help to you.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197998178631", "last_played": 1480715447, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_forever": 376}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1480718853, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506860", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1480719134, "recommendationid": "28148725", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Finque is a really fun puzzle game with nice mechanics and a great story!

TL;DR somewhat simplistic, needs polish, buy it on sale if at all. To the dev, I recommend lowering the price to $2.99.\n\n[b][u]YOU CAN ZOOM OUT.[/u][/b] I'm putting that there so the preview of this review shows it to any potential customers. Use the scroll wheel to zoom out to a distance that makes sense for you. Unfortunately, when the player gets covered up by the level geometry, it snaps back to \"Behind-the-Head-O-Vision,\" which is incredibly annoying. I wish the default was the Zoomed Out view, and the player would silhouette through the geometry. Super Mario 3D World is a good example, where when you were obscured you would appear as a colored shadow on all the geometry, though it's common in a lot of games.\n\nThe mechanics are interesting but lack polish. The \"Vacoom Tubes\" need some indication of which direction theyre going, in my opinion. I agree with other reviews that say that my instincts that Space is Jump leads to many deaths.\n\nWhich reminds me, [b]Please raise the killZ floor[/b] or whatever it's called in Unity. I know I've made a mistake, I don't need to fall past the stars for a good solid 30 Seconds or whatever. When you fall to your death, you just have to sit and wait for the restart, which only promotes a fear of taking risk, and there is some fun to be had taking shortcuts.\n\nI don't know if I haven't gotten far enough to hear new music, but please make it change in some way. I would say having a few different tracks for each \"section\" of the game would be nice, so that if you're constantly having to restart the level(ie from dying which happens a lot) you don't just keep hearing the same 30 seconds of music over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and see how annoying that was?\n\nIt's an interesting title, but I can't say its entirely fun. It's actually kind of boring. I don't think it's worth $10 dollars. I got it on sale for $3.49 and I'm regretting spending that much. This could be an good game, it just needs a lot more work.
