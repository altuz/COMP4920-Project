With the Encore Pack DLC, it features up to 5 anime girls with further customization options to feature any of them in a solo concert or group dance concert of 3 characters, 10 additional songs and additional costumes and headgear with fanservice. The frames per second(FPS) counter and score given to your computer will be shown while playing and at the end of each concert performance.\n\nAfter playing through all 12 songs, I have decided to recommend this 3D simulation because among the 8 Japanese songs with vocals(the other 4 are remixes of their respective original songs), all are fast, lively and catchy and have lyrics in Japanese and English language and approximate pronounciation in English displayed as subtitles while playing the concert. Recommended with DLC for fans of Japanese pop music and for those who would like to learn a bit of Japanese or English along the way while listening through each song.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006413390", "last_played": 1503763778, "num_reviews": 91, "num_games_owned": 2216, "playtime_forever": 184}, "votes_up": 32, "timestamp_created": 1501345206, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566370", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501345206, "recommendationid": "33884394", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
