While there are markers, that generally show you where to go so do not expect a Dead Space like line that literally shows you the path. And since it isn't a linear corridor shooter, there's a lot of room to get lost. It's more challenging than other games but definitely doable.\n\nCons:\n-Lack of polish and bugs, although the dev is working on it.\n-Not much customization: graphics options and keybinding settings are pretty limited. \n\nSummary/What to Expect:\n\nI see too many comparissons to Soma or Subnautica which I don't think is fair and could disappoint some people. I'd say Iron Fish is more like Firewatch (or other walking simulators) but underwater. You're alone underwater but in radio contact with your superior who helps you as you navigate the 3D underwater world and uncover the mystery. But unlike other walking simulators, there are a fair amount of gameplay elements, puzzles, and you can easily die. You can also mess badly enough that you need to restart and the world isn't linear so you could easily get lost.\n\nI'm about 4 hours in (ignore the 22+ hours I have on record since I play a bit then alt-tab out) and love the setting, characters, atmosphere, and how the game gradually intensifies the mystery and spookiness. It isn't 100% polished but it's overall very well done for an indie game. The dev clearly has passion for this game and has communicated quickly with people on the discussions page. So if you're looking for a story rich, first person, exploration/walking sim hybrid in an underwater setting, this is the game for you.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960421273", "last_played": 1477850746, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 306, "playtime_forever": 1310}, "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_created": 1477855188, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520419", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1477855188, "recommendationid": "26323014", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Game is getting a hard time, harder than it deserves.

It's like a missing part of SOMA, in that you can explore, and retreat to your small vehicle for minimal safety, and yet feel just as vulnerable. It was a world I wanted to explore.\n\nUnfortunately there are rough edges that kept chipping away at my fun. Hopefully they'll all be improved with time so I can come back for another attempt.\n\n1. At the start you have to choose between Story or Survival - I wasn't clear on the differences, and what might be removed from one. Would story mode be simplistic, with no threat? Would survival mode have the story stripped out? Yet I assume once you start with one mode you are stuck with it, and won't know if you are missing out.\n\n2. I hated the interface and controls. It seemed like the mouse was disabled - there was no pointer to use it in menus, or the in-game controls and puzzles.\nThe game has fixed keyboard controls (WASD, but the tooltip looked more like the arrow keys). I have no problem with WASD being a default, but since I am uncomfortable with it it became an extra barrier for me. Please, all game devs - let players bind keys however they want! I was fumbling for the X key or F key or left control, and was just getting frustrated. If I could have set up controls how I wanted this wouldn't have happened.\nOther control issues: you can't use the scrollwheel alone to toggle through your inventory - you have to press CTRL then use the scrollwheel. Clunky.\nThe interface for your systems was likewise confusing, how to switch between items. I managed to choose something in a menu (upgrades, I think) but tried all the keys and mouse buttons and couldn't work out how to get back to choose another option like Artifacts. The only way seemed to be to quit out of the game and reload it.\nAnd yet, after using WASD for movement, I came to a button puzzle that used the arrow keys instead. It's all a bit of an  unintuitive mess for me. Being able to redefine things would have helped.\n\n3. The one time I died in my small adventure was when I ran out of oxygen. It's badly implemented for three reasons. Firstly, the oxygen meter looked like I had three tanks. I assumed when the bar ran out a tank would disappear and the bar would refill. No, the three tanks are just decorative, you only have one bar. Secondly I was warned to get back to my sub because my oxygen was low - presumably my radio friend monitoring systems and being helpful. Except when he gave the warning I was too far to get back in time - I died just before I reached the sub. If you build in warnings, at least make sure they trigger when it is still possible to act on them. Thirdly it's bizarre that the oxygen tanks run out so quickly. They are teeny. Worse, the second they run out, you die. In real life you would have at least an extra 30 seconds of action. But no, my character wasn't gasping or breathing with difficulty - she went from normal, to dead, in a second or two. Even ten seconds of holding my breath and I would have made it to the sub in time. Actually, since the tanks are so small, why can't you carry them in your belt like the other small round items (first aid kits, repairs etc)? If you pick one up the previous one is destroyed (even if full). Despite the extremely hazardous environment your character refuses to even carry a spare when she finds one.\n\n4. Occasional clipping problems - usually items from chests falling through the chest and becoming unreachable, or clipping through a large cargo canister wall. Since the items might mean life or death, it can be annoying to die from a bug. Likewise the flares you follow are invisible - just red light and steam, but no actual flare, as if they clipped through the ground.\n\n5. There is an aquajet you can use for getting around quickly. Sadly I found it to be cumbersome to use, due to the controls, and the fact that I couldn't view my scanner and use it at the same time. Since the aquajet doesn't even have a spare oxygen tank under the seat it was more irritating than fun.\n\n6. My game ended when I had the objective to \"find the final submarine\". I had found it, and swam around it, but on reloading that objective remained. Presumably it was because you had to solve a puzzle to open a chest, but I had to give up. During two sessions I tackled the puzzle numerous times, and could never get all the buttons to light up. A YouTube video seemed to get stuck on that bit so I couldn't see the solution. I went to a help guide but the only tip I found was \"read the logs\"; I did that twice, none seemed to mention how to solve this puzzle. Maybe I'd missed a log earlier. At this point I explored a bit then stopped playing, because it is one of those games where you often can't move on until a scripted event occurs, triggered by something else you do or see. It left me mildly frustrated that a squad of diving soldiers (or whatever) would choose to look a crate by building a puzzle into it. Just seems a bit far-fetched. On the other hand, it worked. I couldn't get into it. I uninstalled eventually.\n\nStill, I would like to come back one day and play again, see if I get further, hopefully when a few of the issues above have been fixed in patches. I'll reiterate: the atmosphere is brilliant. I played in the dark with headphones on. I enjoyed my couple of hours in the game on the whole, and it is promising. A bit more polish and it could become a go-to game for those who like slower-paced creepy horror explorers, soaking up a chilling atmosphere.
