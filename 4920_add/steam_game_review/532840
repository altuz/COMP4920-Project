Early on you get a can of protein powder.  The description makes it seem like you'll be using it to wake someone up, or something to that effect.  What do you use it for?  Using it as an alternative for fingerprint dusting.  Except the last person to use a terminal was a guy in a giant psuedo hazmat suit, and the second time you use the powder, it's on a ID card that can also apparently double as a fuse?  There was no logic there what so ever.\n\nThe last straw for me was to use a terminal to get a piece of information (room numbers), except for a few things about the terminal: 1.  You used it once before for a completely different purpose, and the new purpose was not there before.  2.  There was a reactor overload not 30 minutes before that logically would have fried it completely.  3.  The terminal is literally labelled \"Damaged Terminal\", and the description describes it as barely functional.  Why would I use a damaged terminal?  WHy not logically label the information I needed elsewhere, like put the room number on the wall?\n\nThe story itself barely makes sense, and barely ties into the original game except by theme alone.

While I think this is a clever idea and a good way to give a taste of what their games feel like, unfortunately the taste I got from Cayne was disappointing. \n\nOn a first glimpse, it looks like a game with a very specific aesthetic and atmosphere, which personally I find very appealing. It makes you feel like you're about to dive into a small chunk of a big, immersive world. You realize it's not as wonderful as it feels once you get stuck on the first puzzle.\n\nIf you like to proceed by trying to randomly combine everything with everything, then you'll get your treat. I prefer intuitive puzzles that have some logic, puzzles that make you feel satisfied when you figured it out yourself and not because you were lucky to click the right stuff in the right place. Unfortunately, Cayne disappoints on that aspect. And there isn't much left to this game that can make up for it.\n\nVoice acting seems to be good, but the main protagonist is obnoxious and just not pleasant to listen. The language used in general feels like taken out of urban dictionary (I understand it was supposed to bring out the personality for some of the characters, but for me it was immersion breaking). Gameplay feels sluggish, you spend most of your time trying to get from point A to point B. And the story itself, well, you can figure out the whole twist pretty much in the first half of the game (providing you didn't quit frustrated with the puzzles).\n\nAppealing aesthetic and atmosphere was what lured me in and I don't regret playing it if just for this sole reason.
