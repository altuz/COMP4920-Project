The graphics are not stunning but still are clear and presented in a way that allows you to get the feel of battle. You can concentrate on actual strategy without having to try and figure out what you are moving to or looking at. So I'm actually pleased with the graphics.  Now for the game play,  it's actually pretty straight forward and not in-depth, so if you are looking for lots of variables to combat then you need to buy a slitherine game. Otherwise if you like turn based table top combat fun like \"Battle Cry\" then you will certainly enjoy this game.  It's worth the investment because it has the re-playability that will give you a pleasent Civil War Strategy feel,  this will stay installed on my steam library for sure.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197985186971", "last_played": 1476143784, "num_reviews": 41, "num_games_owned": 433, "playtime_forever": 71}, "votes_up": 30, "timestamp_created": 1475795877, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548570", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1475795877, "recommendationid": "25893221", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I'm not sure why, but this game doesn't play any sound effects.

I just bought this game because I already own Civil War 1863 by the same game developer and that game's sound effects and the music plays great. I love these kind of games. I don't understand why the sound effects in this game don't work because both games are from the same game developer. I'm sure a patch will have to come out to address the issue. The music plays great in this game but not the sound effects. I say to wait a few days until the game developer addresses the sound effects issue.
