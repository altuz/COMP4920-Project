The execution however leaves a lot to be desired. This game has a lot of balancing issues. The starting guns are very poor, the stealth pistol cannot be used effectively against heavies since it just doesn't do enough damage to them to put them down before they shoot back. The gameplay is also heavily biased towards stealth, you are far less likely to succeed if you go loud. This is partly because the weapons come with a very limited amount of ammo, the rifles and the SMG's only only carry two spare mags which you would go through very quickly if a few heavies show up. That wouldn't really be an issue if the available arsenal reflected that but that's not the case. At least half of the guns are loud and stealth guns come saddled with lower damage. You will also quickly discover that there is a meta for a good loadout, there are two or three guns that combine stealth and good damage and that means that the rest of the loadout is almost worthless. Tacticals also have only a very small number of viable options, for example you would be crazy to take grenades over throwing knives.\n\nAnother problem with the game is that there are no intermediate saves. This becomes a major issue if you decide to go for \"Completing primary objective undetected\" challenges of which there are 15. Say you stealthed 95% of the mission but the last guard spotted you? The entire attempt is down the drain. This brings me to another problem, usually in coop shooters, if stealth goes badly your partner can back you up and you can complete the mission loud. This isn't the case here since the MP is completely dead. You stuff up here, you better place mines and grab loud weapons quickly and hope for the best.\n\nLack of content is another issue with this game. There are only 15 heists spread between 5 different areas so not only is there a very limited amount of missions but the areas are also recycled between those missions. Games like Payday 2 get around this by introducing procedurally generated layouts, this helps the replayability value immensely. This isn't the case here, the areas and even the guard and item placements stay exactly the same.\n\nOn a final note, I would like to make a warning for achievement hunters, there is at least one broken achievement in this game. \"Bags for life\" does not unlock for on either of my two PC's. It does not unlock while meeting the minimum requirements of the achievement or even by picking up every single loot bag in the map and it does not work on different heists either. This is unlikely to ever get fixed because the game has been abandoned by the developer.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 670, "steamid": "76561198006217347", "last_played": 1507027675, "num_reviews": 57, "num_games_owned": 767, "playtime_forever": 1116}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1507029017, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504505", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507029137, "recommendationid": "35442301", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
