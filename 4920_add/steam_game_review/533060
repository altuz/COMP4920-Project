The game is incredibly short and ends on a \"to be continued\". Boo. There are only a few music scores that are all repeated but I guess, considering the game length, that's not a huge deal. There's also no map and no hints as to where to go next. There ARE hints during hidden object scenes and a skip button for puzzles however. I should mention that I never got stuck for long, I never used any hints in HO areas, and I didn't skip any puzzles.\n\nNow for the reasons I'm recommending this. It's chock-full of hidden object scenes. In fact, that's the main reason to play it. And they're good old fashioned HO scenes - lots to find and no having to make extra moves before collecting your items. I know developers now add a bunch of twists and extra features to their hidden object scenes to liven it up but, really, I found NOT having to do all that very refreshing. The objects are all fair as well. You might have to search a bit to find them but they're all right there - not hiding behind anything, not mislabled, and not making you click all over for it to register. Again, refreshing!\n\nAdd to that an interesting and twisted story and some lovely graphics and character models. Puzzles aren't going to make you tear your hair out and it's easy to figure out where to use your collected items. \n\nI certainly wish it had been longer and..... just be prepared for an unsatisfying ending. But if you want to relax and just find a bunch of items, try this game out.
