The controls are sub par, the gameplay is kind of mediocre, and the artistic style is painful. Regardless of these flaws, I'd actually still reccomend this game to an extent. The game doesn't pretend like its supposed to be great, so it ultimately achieves its goal. The layout of the town in game is also fairly pleasing, and the over abundance of references or just over the top sequences actually creates an interesting experience. Honestly I would probably enjoy the game more if it had a more detailed art style, butthe game didn't set out with that style in mind.\n\nDon't go in expecting a flawed masterpiece.
