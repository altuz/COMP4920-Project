Your hunger knows no bounds and it\u2019s up to you to prove that to the mortal wretch who summoned you to this plane. This twin-stick shooter will have you blasting waves of soldiers with a variety of power that are randomly selected by a dice roll, eating to keep your health up, and avoiding sword strokes and a hail of arrows in order to survive.[/h1]\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jzmYhSR7DiI\n\nThe \u201cstory\u201d campaign in Behold! Is a bit misleading because there\u2019s no actual story to speak of behind the gratuitous violence that the game presents. You are given a brief tutorial that suggests that you have been summoned into this protective magic circle by the man outside it and then you are told how to shoot your eye lasers and how to eat to recover HP. \n\nAfter that - surprise, surprise - you are encouraged to break free and kill the man who summoned you, after which an entire kingdom is after your bulbous, floating head.\n\nThe story must be played through in one sitting and death results in a game over screen that presents your score and then you are returned to the brief tutorial.\n\nYou can skip it, by the way, at any time by simply leaping out of your prison and eating the puny human. It took me too long to figure that out and my impatience/insolence earned me an achievement to boot.\n\nThe game is best played with a controller. You can shoot your eyebeams using the back triggers, leap then smash into the ground with right button, and eat using left button. You kill enemies through a combination of laser blasts, ground pounds, and devouring. Two of your five outer eyes are available to you at one time and both can be fired simultaneously. They can be aimed in any direction and can be repositioned while firing. To prevent such versatile weapons from being too overpowered and to keep gameplay varied, Toster12D3 made it so that the elemental attribute of your blasts are tied to a dice roll. The elements are as follows: freeze, kinetic, doom, fire, and fear.\n\nLeaping and eating are also on a timer and both provide you with a way to avoid enemies/do damage and recover health/do damage respectively.\n\nThere is a brief pause after you depress the back button, during which your D-20 will roll and the name of the ray type will appear and then you\u2019ll be able to fire for a few seconds before having to roll again, which serves as a cooldown period and prevents you from firing will-nilly. This dice roll isn\u2019t only thematically sound, it forces you to strategize your carnage a bit.\n\nAs you progress through the waves of enemies in the story mode, you unlock upgrades for your Beholder. None of them are quite explained, so it\u2019s a matter of trial and error to figure out what combinations work best.\n\nBehold! Is quite strong thematically. The pixel art is grungy and the BGM is hard metal. Well-suited to murdering bunches of people.\n\n.Pros.\n[list][*] The price is fair for what you\u2019re getting.\n[*] Gratuitous violence is satisfying.\n[*] Leaderboards.\n[*] The game is strong thematically. [/list]\n\n.Cons.\n[list][*] Repetitive gameplay\n[*] Repetitive sound effects. The music was fine, but the frequent cries of the men I slayed grated on my nerves.\n[*] If you\u2019re not a fan of in-your-face metal, the looping track will drive you crazy.\n[*] Upgrades aren\u2019t adequately explained and therefore feel pointless.\n[*] There\u2019s a \u201cstory\u201d mode but not much story. A bit of narration could have easily fixed this and broken up the repetitive gameplay to some degree. [/list]\n\n.Bottom Line.\nFor the price, I can't say this isn't worth a couple of hours of your time. The game knows exactly what it wants to be and it does it well enough--just as long as you're okay with repetitive gameplay and sound effects. It has leaderboards for the more competitive gamers to see how they stack up against the community as well and for some that will be enough to keep trying for that high score.\n\n[code]If this review/EAR helped you, please give it a thumbs-up.

Furthermore you can jump granting you invincibility while in mid-air and crushing enemies beneath you when you come down (has a cooldown). Finally you will eat enemies whom you touch replenishing your health by 10 each time (again beware the cooldown).\nPowerups lying on the ground shake things up from time to time, providing fire trails, insta kill explosions, extra health etc.\nShort breaks between stages allow you to choose one of 4 random perks like a freeze explosion on jump landing or more health per 'meal'.\n\nThe Modes:\nStory mode has 4 levels, every level consists of several stages with a set pattern of waves which will loop upon completion. Level 1 includes a tutorial. Survive as long as you can to challenge the highscores.\nArcade mode has random waves and no scoring (kinda counterintuitive). Just kill stuff and relax ;) \n\nThe Verdict:\nI'm having fun with this. Rocking music, death, blood and destruction all over the place and tactical, score based gameplay to accompany. You need to learn to manage the cooldowns on your jump and nom abilities and take advantage of the different kind of rays.\nThe price is just right to recommend it to anyone looking for some juicy arcade action.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018288322", "last_played": 1478782349, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 171, "playtime_forever": 106}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1477763630, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500182", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1477777055, "recommendationid": "26297079", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's a fun, simple game with great music, you get your moneys worth.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198110436944", "last_played": 1497553376, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_forever": 110}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1477612403, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499958", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1477612403, "recommendationid": "26253214", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Right now, sadly, I can't recommend this game.  As others have noted, there appear to be some control issues that are only affecting certain people/systems:-\n\nMy mouse (Razer Naga with fully up-to-date Synapse software) won't move the targetting recticle.  This immediately makes mouse + keyboard play impossible.  I've tried it with my Xbox pad unplugged just to be sure, but it still doesn't work.  And speaking of the gamepad...\n\nThe right stick DOES move the recticle, joy!  But you have to hold it in a direction to aim, otherwise it snaps back to being on top of you.  This wouldn't be a problem, except the game is hard-coded to use A and B to fire the two beams.  I don't know about you, but it really doesn't feel right to me to have to hover my right hand over the pad with my thumb on the stick and a finger on each of those two buttons.  In fact it chuffing hurts after a while.\n\nThis would be easily remedied by allowing the user to rebind the controls, but alas, such is not possible.  And the M+K issue would still need resolving anyway, as there's no need for this to be gamepad-only.  Plus, you can't navigate the menus properly with the gamepad, so right now it's stuck in a messy no-man's-land where I need both inputs to achieve something but can't practically do anything.\n\nAlso, I have two screens, and the game insists on starting on the wrong one, with no way to move it as it immediately goes fullscreen.  It's not the biggest issue in the world, but I've not had that issue with any other game I can recall.  One problem I have had with other games, which is also present here, is the mouse not being locked to the game area.  Not helpful in a fast-action game like this to have it suddenly switch to the desktop because things have gotten a bit frantic... (though it does at least seem to pause when it loses focus).\n\nSo, to the dev, please address the following:\n   Get the mouse to move the recticle reliably, for everyone;\n   Allow users to remap the controls, or as an absolute minimum, move the fire controls to the Xbox pad triggers;\n   Clean up the gamepad input so you can use it to navigate the menus properly;\n   Either give the user some option for choosing which screen to run on, or make it start up in a window and add a full-screen toggle in the options;\n   Lock the mouse to the game area for multi-monitor setups.\n\n   I apologise to the dev if any of this sounds overly harsh (especially as the game seems to work fine for the majority of people, so there's something about certain setups that must be causing it...), but that's born of frustration; I can see there's a good game in here, it just needs saving from some issues.  I'm not going to refund it, as I'm hoping that these problems will indeed be sorted, resulting in a fun short-burst time-killer with some interesting depth.
