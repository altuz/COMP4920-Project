This is done by exploding the right series of red boxes, at the right time, until the blue box reaches its target, allowing you to move onto the next level and so on and so on. Since it is a minimalistic puzzler there really isn\u2019t a lot to it and you will have completed it within a half hour or so. The biggest appeal to the casual gamer is the treasure trove of easy achievements that come with the game. Problem with this concept is that those not interested in achievements won't really find much appeal and because of its simplicity it kind of robs the player of the concept of overcoming something challenging rewarding each player with a TRUE sense of accomplishment.\n\nStill there are currently six in the series and the Zup concept seems to get better in each rendition. Just like there are six episodes in the Zup series and now seems to be endless, I would also like to point out that there are 6 Rocky Balboa movies with the exception of Creed and seems to be endless. You know you want it... Rocky VS Zup!\n\nQuiet River make it happen...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/P9ZtZSdsGqQ\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 60, "steamid": "76561198112866114", "last_played": 1506156850, "num_reviews": 183, "num_games_owned": 2624, "playtime_forever": 60}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506158814, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505413", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506158814, "recommendationid": "35148466", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Literally finished the game and got all the achievements in less than 30 minutes.
