However, it fails miserably where it counts, in the puzzles.\n\nSome of the puzzles are incredibly obscure and either only make sense in the developer's mind or requires leaps of faith to solve them, as the game provides no hints for some puzzles being solvable in more than one way, or how to solve some of them.\n\nFurthermore, the developer has opted to making the game potentially impossible to finish by laying in puzzles that can't be solved if you wait too long with them, as the game removes access to some crucial hints and ways of solving some puzzles the further you get towards one particular ending.\n\nThus you can end up having wasted hours on the game, without even knowing that you've made it impossible for yourself to get the ending, as the game does not make any effort of telling the player this.\n\nBecause of these bad decisions on the developer's part, this game can NOT be recommended for purchase despite its low price, and it would get 1 out of 5 stars, if possible.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994968562", "last_played": 1484656319, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 2645}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1481736313, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517537", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1481739604, "recommendationid": "28363174", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
