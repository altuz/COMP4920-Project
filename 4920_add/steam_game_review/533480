I owned it for years outside of Steam.  I love the magic/skill systems in this game.  The biggest issue that I have with this game is that it doesn't have a sequel.  The GUI isn't great.  There are some things that I didn't even know existed until I had played through the game twice.  There are no graphics of which to speak.  It's purely a text game so if you don't like reading just don't bother.  However, if you do, you will find the writing is enjoyable, replayabilty is high, and you can take very different paths with each play through.  You can even become a very evil character who has multiple other characters under their direct control using forbidden magic that you learn just like other magic, only secretly.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971992101", "last_played": 1499033191, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 270, "playtime_forever": 2751}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504437634, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501096", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504437634, "recommendationid": "34709122", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ist Period, Ghost Hunting, Next Pyrotechnic Target practice then finish of the day with a bit of light mind control.\nGreat game Hard to get into but once the initial difficulity curve was over i loved it", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198020849683", "last_played": 1504970576, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 8515}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501738750, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501167", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1501738750, "recommendationid": "33985810", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It doesnt state clearly that it only has one school year then ends.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198052273017", "last_played": 1492942367, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 122, "playtime_forever": 702}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1500526759, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448398", "votes_down": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1500526759, "recommendationid": "33665315", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
