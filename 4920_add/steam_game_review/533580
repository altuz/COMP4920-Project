It is so good. \n\nIt is novel (to me). It has a good range of gameplay mechanics that are introduced steadily throughout the game and thrown together towards the end to make fiendish puzzles. It makes you feel like a genius when you spend half an hour learning about and solving a single puzzle. \n\nCompleting the game took me around 7 hours.\n\nHighly recommended!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197985233338", "last_played": 1504262029, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 3234, "playtime_forever": 445}, "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_created": 1503662622, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536933", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504262422, "recommendationid": "34479893", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
