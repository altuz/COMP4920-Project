Narrative is the pits, dialogue still lacks credibility, still hate the world setting and the items have been streamlined too much. There are some improvements, and I would definitely play this game anyday over the original so it has that going for it. Going to remove this for declutter to make room for better party RPGS.\n\nA lot of the lore, mechanics, and structure of Atonement 1. With some severe changes makes for an incremental improvement over the predecessor, and dare I say, turns it obsolete since this rehashes the same plot for intro and cannibalizes all the lore, the dialogues are a little more organic but still sound like they all are from the same person no matter who is talking. Game is structured around a hub and story-related collection of instances which change as you progress. This was good. There is thus more asset variety and less pointless trekking through the countryside. The instances are not very inspired in terms of design and the encounters are just trashmobs repeated over and over with little to no variety until you find the end of dungeon chest with the quest item. The plot keeps all the elements I dislike in terms of world setting and narrative, and somehow worsens it with a nonsensical clash of the timelines sillyness where you fight a clone of yourself and all the other cliches. Items have been streamlined by so much that they are just silly tokens that you equip for +Stats. You can use reward points to specialize in one of the several branches available for purchase through skilltrees and they all seem desirable in one way or another which is good. The animations on the sprites are a tiny bit better, and so are the sprites themselve but they are still low tier.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "last_played": 1502244460, "num_reviews": 1973, "num_games_owned": 4956, "playtime_forever": 329}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1502244847, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496899", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502244847, "recommendationid": "34116157", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game simply isn't that great. The plot is insipid. I'm really not sure how else to describe it.

Ignore the store page claiming there's choice and consequence, there's none to be found here. God only knows why all games released by this dev claim to have choice and consequence when none of them do.\n\nIf you plan on slumming it with bottom of the barrel games, then skip this and try out City of Chains by the same dev.
