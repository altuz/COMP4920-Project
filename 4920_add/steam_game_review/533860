The levels actually get easier when you progress. I had the feeling the developer didn't do the math and had his levels not tested on shortest routs.\nThere were levels that you needed to compleet in 24 steps to get three stars, I finished it in 5 steps. That is ridiculous! The higher the level set the more steps you have to compleet the level on three stars, therefore increasing the number of solutions for the level, making it easier.\n\nThe concept is nice, but the game didn't work it out properly because of the lack of polishing.\n\nBugs:\n- Navigation bugs (when selecting a level set for example, the game just doesn't do anything)\n- Freeze on level completion (the red circle gets zoomed in, and thats it, no stars, no menu, nothing)\n- Number of stars awarded is sometimes two, although it was definitly within the amount needed for three.\n- Visualisation bugs, sometimes the required number of steps for three stars wasn't displayed.\n- Achievement bug, [spoiler]I never clicked a black circle, though the achievement suggest I did. I received it when I clicked a regular circle.
