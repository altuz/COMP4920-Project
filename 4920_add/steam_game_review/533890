Aiming at enemies sometimes makes the red laser-sight jitter up and down and bullets just fly off randomly.\n- The red cursor is WAY too small and blends in to the environment too much. I shouldn't have to search the screen for it after dodging a bunch of rockets. If the cursor was more visible, then using your periferal vision to aim and focus on your character to dodge stuff would make the gameplay feel much better and smoother. Either making the laser sight a solid red line, or the red cursor more opaque/changed to a larger crosshair would definitely help. Maybe even allowing us to change the color of the cursor.\n- Mouse input is buggy and, while I'm pressing down and trying to shoot... sometimes it just won't respond. Holding down the fire button, letting go and firing again sometimes would result in a 2-3 second delay before you start firing (this is for the regular primary gun, not the one that overheats). Once I even had a bunch of lasers and rockets but NONE of them would shoot at all, and I was stuck with an overheated minigun which just takes way too long to cool down.\n- The blue laser enemies feel cheap and just stun-lock you and kill you the moment they show up in the corner of the screen. (This is a small annoyance, sure you can memorize their locations after a few runs and avoid them easier)\n- Getting stuck on pieces of the terrain on the floor, or a broken part of a building is really annoying and doesn't feel like it should happen.\n- No way to change options when you're in the game, you have to end your mission and go to the main screen to change things like sound or video settings. (I didn't know how loud the game would be so I started a mission, it was too loud, so I tried to change the sound but had to end the mission to do so)\n\nIf it wasn't for the first 3 negative points, I would have recommended this game easily.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961017402", "last_played": 1477022034, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 258, "playtime_forever": 40}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1477023615, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511093", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1477023615, "recommendationid": "26139732", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "THis is an okay game so far.

It looks great and plays extremely smoothly.\n\nThe dofficulty feels fair throughout the game and actually gives you a bit of a challenge on the later levels.\n\nA couple of things that bug me would include the aiming dot, which needs to be bigger / clearer and the upgrades of which need to be a bit more interesting than just adding more health / damage (Maybe an additional weapon tree for example)\n\nOverall though it's very impressive for a game that costs as much as it does!\n\nI've made a YouTube video of the game.

Excellent graphics, beautiful backgrounds. I especially liked the water (lake?) on one level. Enemies also drawn great. Some of them are very difficult to see, but I think that this was done deliberately. It's very dynamic. Cool physics. Killed enemies explode and pieces are flying on the screen! Thud! It seems as if some fragment of the robot strikes the screen.\nIn general - everything is OK. I liked it, although the difficulty of the game (for me) is too high. Enemies are very (very very very) much. And all at once. And shoot. And all this at the same time. Ahh! =DDD \nP.S. Please, make a cursor on the menu any other. This cursor is very difficult to see))))\n\nThanks for your work ^_^", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198309103284", "last_played": 1477002498, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1477002716, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490834", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1477002716, "recommendationid": "26136552", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
