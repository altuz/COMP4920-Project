Blink the Bulb is a clear homage to the Sega Genesis and is very faithful to the limitations of that system. The vibrant graphics in particular are very appealing and give each level a unique charm.\n\nA strong point of this game is the level design. Each level is fairly large and offers many different paths to the end. Levels also change depending on the day/night system, which adds even more to replayability. The combat is fairly straightforward and mostly involves charging up shots to shoot at enemies. Getting past regular enemies is pretty easy, but the bosses at the end of each level provide a decent challenge. There is also an inventory system and I appreciated the variety of passive bonuses that can be accumulated throughout the game.\n\nFor a free game the standard of quality is remarkably good - if it came out 25 years ago I am sure it would be considered a classic. My first playthrough took a little over an hour, which may be short by today's standards, but very suitable for an old-fashioned game like this. As someone who grew up with a Genesis this was a real treat to play.
