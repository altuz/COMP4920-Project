Sort of. I have to do a little better for the real ending, but what I could manage was awesome. Best GnG style game I've ever played. \n\nLoads of people are complaining that it's too hard, I have to wonder what they expected. Ghosts n Goblins is not easy I don't know why you'd expect this game to be. You have unlimited continues, use them. Arcades made us start at the begining so even though the game is hard beating a proper GnG arcade is certainly harder.
