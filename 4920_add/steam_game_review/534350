Basically a slimmed-down Caesar 3, with the population mangement taken out. Seems to have around 3-4 hours of content in the campaign, but there's a sandbox mode if you just want to sit building cities.\n\nYou build houses and then provide goods and amenities to upgrade those houses, producing more tax income and so allowing you to build more stuff. There's an economic chain of production with a dozen or more goods - about as complex as you'd get from a Settlers game, really. Goods can be made for export, or used to support your population's gradual evolution from bottom-tier slave workers to high-end villa dwellers.\n\nOne EXTREMELY annoying feature is the fires, which are dealt with by spam-clocking on the burning buildings. Whoever thought this would make a cool feature needs to go and seriously think about their lifestyle choices, because it's just annoying; I get the idea of fires to force you to build a fire brigade, but for God's sake just let them automatically tackle fires rather than introducing this mobile-friendly tap-sim. \n\nAll in all, it's pretty good for the price, but since you can probably get Caesar 3 or 4 for a couple of quid more, you're likely better off going for those.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971286991", "last_played": 1478451610, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 376, "playtime_forever": 71}, "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_created": 1478452077, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536391", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1478452077, "recommendationid": "26460412", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Meh. \n\nYou have to do every city on the Italian peninsula and then I just don't know I got bored real quick.
