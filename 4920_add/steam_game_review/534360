Some designers/artists/etc. probably worked very hard.  But to be honest; I think there are boardgames on Steam whom I've played (and will play) more than Colt Express.  So if you're into digital boardgames and are trying to figure out if this one is worth it...  I would go for something else.\n\nNonetheless I shall start with the pro's:\n\n+ nice graphics\n+ easy to use: making moves is straightforward\n+ has stories added to the classic game\n\nBut then... the biggest flaw.  What in my opinion kills the game (eventually).  The replayability is severly compromised.  Other games may be pricier, but if I compare the price with the amount I have played them...  You probably get more bang for your buck on another title.\n\nCause?\n\nThe multiplayer is very empty.  And as a boardgamer, I like the \"social\" aspect of a game.  Just having fun online with other people.  But this is hard to do.  The lobby is empty, no games running and almost nobody joins my games.  I'll write something in the loby-chat, only to hear my voice echoing in this empty canyon and the tumbleweed rolling in the wind.  \nSo in my opinion, after a few hours soloplay to get the hang of it, I'll play this game little.
