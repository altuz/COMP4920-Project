It's not life changing or super amazing, but it's a solid little game. You take charge of a very small town and help them grow. You need to keep the people happy as well get enough gold to buy troops so you can hold back the waves of orcs. You bump into some cool events that are pretty fun too. If you have only a few dollars left in your steam wallet and if you are looking for a game that you can play for a few hours then this is the game for you.\n\nThis was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\n\nOnce we have a 100 followers on our group there will be a game giveaway, but only the followers have a chance to win.\n\nIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.
