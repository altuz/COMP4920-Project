VR games are few and far between and this one is a keeper. I'll put this out of the way, its not a wave shooter. It has you exploring, solving puzzles, shooting,  and finding chests with loot.  This has more in common with Vanishing Realms, which is one of my favorite experiences.  While still in early access the game looks to have a lot going for it and is already very polished. \n\nI'm completely shocked that there is no hype on this game. Generally the first thing I do on VR titles is look at what the developer has made and judge from the quality of their previous work for a blind buy. I saw that they had made cyberpong and felt much better pulling the trigger.  I'm glad I did, and I look forward to future iterations.\n\nIf I had a criticism, it would be the movement.  The movement is location based teleporting, meaning there are only predefined areas that you can teleport too. I understand that the most likely keep this movement limited to keep you on track and not too get lost. But I think being able to teleport freely like vanishing realms would give you a better sense of freedom and would add a lot to the game. Sure, you'd look in some areas for ages, but the free movement would just add a lot in my opinion.  \n\nAlso I hope they add lip sync and better animation to the opening scene where the captain calls you out for mutiny.  I think better animation with the captain moving closer, maybe bring his sword closer to you, having the crew actually cheer his motives would draw you in closer and eliminate the need for the distracting subtitles.\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046309709", "last_played": 1479698372, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 638, "playtime_forever": 42}, "votes_up": 17, "timestamp_created": 1476945983, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527726", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1476945983, "recommendationid": "26125739", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "great start to a game. it reminds me of vanishing realms. {amazing game}, but falls short of it becuse of the method used for teleportation. you have no choice in where to go? the beauty of Vanashing Realms is the freedom to explore where you want and at your own pace.
