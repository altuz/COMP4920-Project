In my first game, the other players had glyphs, I didn't. Enemies had twice my health at the start.

The pay2win system effects your gameplay at all times, since the stone active abilities (comparable to summoner spells from League of Legends) become much stronger the further you advance on a VIP Ladder, making spending money on this game as you progress unavoidable lest you want to continue. It's not a question of if this will lead to a dreadful experience for the average nonspending player - it's just a question of when. And once the realization sets in, it will hit you hard. And the more you had played before finally hitting that paywall, the harder it will hit you.\n\nNot recommended, although it can be fun when you're playing it drunk and/or on a lanparty.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198025736124", "last_played": 1506618496, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_forever": 1992}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1486121892, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501908", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1486122076, "recommendationid": "29667440", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I don't mind if it's a League's or DotA's clone, I mean, HoN is an obvious DotA clone, but it's really fun. I played Heroes Evolved for like 100 games before it was released in steam, but not because the game is good, but because I was tired of DotA, LoL, Vainglory, HoN and other lane-pushing games, so I wanted to try something new, and I found this. This game is an absolute disaster of lane-pushing game genre, and there is three major reasons to it:\n\n1. [b]Balance and design[/b]. Stupid hero design that looks like a random mix of model, stats and abilities from LoL and DotA (imagine a ranged tank with Gyrocopter's rockets and Ziggs' ulti - welcome to Heroes Evolved, we have this thing), and ofc these designs can't be balanced - heroes in this game are either overpowered or underpowered. Buff in the jungle is random, boss is very powerful and gives like 30 AD, so nobody kills him, bad jewels (runes) system that I don't even want to talk about - it's that bad! I would even say that this game's design is the worst of all lane-pushing games.\n\n2. [b]Moneymaker[/b]. Imagine the game, where your in-game currency receiving is equal to LoL's, but heroes that are 65% more expencive, but not only that - there are also premium heroes that you can't get without paying real money, and also event-only heroes, that are achieved by like 5 people per event. Yeah, welcome to Heroes Evolved.\n\n3. [b]Casuality[/b]. It's that case when both teams are bad at this game, and with no actual comeback system it's so easy to solo carry games, that before Bronze III I had 95% win rate for 20 games! And you know why? BECAUSE THERE IS NO UNRANKED!!! Yeah, you're just forced to go ranked WITH NO CALIBRATION SYSTEM, and that means that Bronze I in this game is basicly a pre-10th level in LoL! Do you think that on high ranks there are good players? Well, I watched a Diamond III carry's stream, and what I saw is a carry that misses like half of his farm! Of course, punching kids is fun when you do this for first 10 times, but when you do it for 50 times it gets kinda boring! This game really has so low skill cap that a 3 years old child can play this game!\n\nJust imagine: this game is alive, but Dawngate is closed; this game was released, but The Godlike wasn't released; this game is in China, America, Middle Asia, Europe, but Realm of the Titans is only avaible in China; this game is released in Steam, but Paragon is not; this game already has it's mobile version, but Rise of Winterchill still has no standalone game - these facts make me REALLY upset. This game kills lane-pushing genre. Don't play this game, even if you are a really low skill player, just spend some time to learn LoL or DotA and play a quality lane-pushing game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198302349199", "last_played": 1486193448, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 31}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1485279849, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502337", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485366765, "recommendationid": "29466806", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "lagggg and laggg and lagggg..\nplease fix the server before launch the game...\nprefer mobile version..\nthis version is worst...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173918562", "last_played": 1486236507, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 34}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1486236228, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500459", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1486236228, "recommendationid": "29701005", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
