Even though their was an impressive and imaginative variety of weapons, I really didn't like the way any of them acted in combat. Also, this is a pureblood wave shooter with no plot or story at all to pull me into the gameplay.\n\nI'm not saying this is a bad game, it just wasn't for me and if you don't like wave shooters then it's probably not for you anyway.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198257293417", "last_played": 1499029767, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500436204, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500436204, "recommendationid": "33643711", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
