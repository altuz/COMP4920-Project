The first thing I liked about the game is graphics. It looks really good, with animated water and swimming fish. I also liked the fact that not only I can choose my avatar, but I actually play with the person of my choice. As I didn't like too much menu music I really found the in-game sound soothing and relaxing - just like real fishing would do. There are some minor issues with animated fish underwater but I believe that developer will fix it soon - it is very fresh game after all. The game mechanics are fairy common - you throw, you wait and you pull - everything what is expected from a fishing game. There is a variety of places where you can fish along with a selection of rods and other fishing equipment. All in all I really like the game and wish that this one will improve and get polished in time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025542947", "last_played": 1482340787, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 737, "playtime_forever": 297}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1482335412, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504742", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1482335412, "recommendationid": "28510031", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Best fishing game on Steam to play with 1 hand.
