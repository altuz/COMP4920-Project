It's a matching tile game with mahjong tiles as an option.  You can also change the option to more cartoony tiles that will be easier to match.  \n\nPros: \n1.  Awesome sounds (music and enviornmental sounds, both very chill)\n2.  Very beautiful backgrounds environments \n3.  Simple, relaxing gameplay\n\nCons:\n1.  Only two environments and they are static (no movement, especially on the second environment, you can see the water is a still photo and it kind of takes away from the otherwise awesomeness of the setting)\n2.  Even though the sounds are great, would be nice to also have an option to listen to my own music\n3.  You're just matching tiles in the end, would have loved to learn how to play Mahjong\n\nRating 6/10 I do recommend for the price, just know what you're getting for your money\n\n[spoiler] My personal wish list for this game: A koi pond with fish moving that you can see, hell you could be under water, either way this would be awesome [/spoiler]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1504380563, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 23}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504381092, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500511", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504381319, "recommendationid": "34693666", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
