It is after the wedding, and Amarantha and her chosen beau are settling in to the travails of married life. Since at the beginning of a playthrough you can choose which path you are continuing, that is easy enough. There are three settings: Visual Novel mode, which simply gets you the choices without the management portion of the game, Normal Mode, the easier of the two with the management activities, and Hard Mode, which... messes with you as you play.\n\nEach path has two good endings, two sad (or even bad) endings, and an epilogue for each of the types of endings. Do note you cannot get the epilogue without playing the management portion of the game.\n\nA fun game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "last_played": 1493149471, "num_reviews": 362, "num_games_owned": 445, "playtime_forever": 211}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1493114082, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510631", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1493114082, "recommendationid": "31354156", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
