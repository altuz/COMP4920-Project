I enjoyed playing through the various levels this game offers.  At first glance, it's a tiny bit pricey at $8.99, but given the amount of content and the future updates that will include many more levels to play through, you'll be getting more than enough value for the price.\n\nMusic is solid.  Controls are responsive, with only one ball being allowed to move at a time.  You can use the keyboard or mouse to move the balls around.\n\nGameplay is simple to pick up on with easy levels at first to show you the basics.  Simple objective to get all the balls into their matching color slots.  All levels are pure logic, with no guessing needed.  It's more learning the mechanics and obstacles in later levels and seeing how they play into solutions.\n\nYou can play in Casual, Normal, or Pro.  Only difference is the tighter time limits as you go up on difficulty.  So in Pro, you'll want to have solid routes planned already.  Achievements are not that hard to get after a little practice.  Once you beat a group of levels, you can practice the individual levels to learn new strategies, which can help in getting achievements and getting through Pro if you want to go that way.\n\nOverall, a very solid puzzle game.  Good amount of replay value if you're trying to improve chapter stats.  With the future updates, this will get more value.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198357900966", "last_played": 1487382002, "num_reviews": 49, "num_games_owned": 180, "playtime_forever": 2425}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1486866769, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513279", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486866769, "recommendationid": "29862677", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Exit is a wonderful puzzle game. It is simple, but I find it very relaxing to play and solve each level. The coins are a nice little bonus challenge as well, though not required to beat the level\u2026 technically. Over 60 levels make this a pretty good buy, even if it is $11.99 not to mention that the developer mentioned that there will be more levels coming out and will be available for FREE to anyone who buys the base game. You can play by clicking each ball with the mouse and then clicking again for the direction, or use the keyboard to choose directions and toggle between balls.\n\nThe three game modes are Easy, Normal, and Pro. Basically it just means that you have a tighter time limit the harder the difficulty you choose, and believe me when I say that it will pressure you on some levels. My advice to people playing this game is to analyze each level before starting to move the balls. The timer will not start counting down until you select a ball. Also, be patient with each move. I have screwed up a few times already by moving the wrong ball because I did not properly select the one I actually wanted to move.\n\nAs for what can improve the game, I can only think of two things. The first, and most important, would be an option to turn off the motion of the board. Although it does make it a bit disorienting (or who knows, it may be my current sleep deficiency) and therefore slightly more challenging, I think that some people may find it hard to look at if they get motion sick easily. The second thing would be more background music tracks. But to be honest that is asking for a bit much. It is a good game regardless of what music is playing in the background.\n\nAt the time that I am writing this review, I have only made it through 24 levels (not counting the demo)\u2026 mostly because it is 2:45 AM. All of them have been a blast and I look forward to playing more of this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198076839641", "last_played": 1482186016, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 188, "playtime_forever": 146}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1481971833, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508348", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1481971884, "recommendationid": "28422560", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "EXIT is an appealing game that works on multiple levels.  While the objective is simple, as befits a puzzle game, the difficulty levels allow for very different experiences.  At the Easy level, it's a more casual game, allowing for trial and error, but at the higher difficulties, the levels are timed, with the timer starting as soon as you make the first move, so you have to visualize the entire sequence beforehand.  Even experienced puzzlers should enjoy that challenge.\n\nThe graphics are nice and crisp, the sound of the marbles rolling around is satisfyingly solid, the techno soundtrack is punchy but unobtrusive - the presentational elements are very well done for an Indie puzzler.\n\nFor a single run-through, the game probably offers about 4-5 hours of game-play, but the different game modes offered, along with the promise of more levels, could expand that substantially.  Since it's only been a week from release though, none of the additional levels have appeared yet.\n\nThat brings up the only downside to this title in my mind:  the price.  While I don't think it's unreasonable, there's no doubt that compared with the price of other puzzle games, this one stands out.  However, I think that most puzzle afficianados who try this out won't regret adding it to their libraries, so I recommend that if you have an interest in puzzle games, check this out.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007899816", "last_played": 1486766975, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 397, "playtime_forever": 231}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1482602740, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500634", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1482602740, "recommendationid": "28604332", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198033107016", "last_played": 1500131324, "num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 349, "playtime_forever": 183}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1482940078, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484458", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1482940078, "recommendationid": "28755962", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
