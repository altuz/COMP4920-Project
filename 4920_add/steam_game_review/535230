Don't thank me, it's all due to my romanian friends. Also we need more game like this, more polished if possible.\n\nFor long review you can scrool down, lemme list few things for express one,\n+A good game for few hours, price/content wise it's worth it.\n+Sounds and sountracks are really well made.\n+It's battle and management system is admirable.\n\n-Repative after few hours,\n-Endless mode has several game breaking bugs,\n-Endless mode also got tons of bugs which will annoy you till death\n-It needs more content and polisment for more stabil and enjoyable experience. \n\nLong review below;\n\nDomina is a good game, not great but by all means not bad either. When you started to game it floods you with tons of things like training slaves, their needs, their skills, blessings, random events, host's moods, pit fights, morales, daily consumptions etc. etc. But tutorial and tips (info) system is really good, so don't be afraid for new things. Honestly first few hours you will be mesmerized to learn all the things and try to survive in this harsh atmosphare. You will train a champion which you spend tons of time and money and in the end you will lose him. Either he will die while trying to claim glory in arena or he will just run away with a slave girl at night. Alas show will go on. \n\nHowever, after few hours later you will learn tips and tricks. Then game will became lots of easier and repative, if you manage to cyle your gladiator's training before your champion's retirement or death it will became an easy game without a charm. Especially in endless mode you will be bored to death after 2-3 cycle of championship. \n\nAlso unfortunetly endless mode got some serious game breaking bugs. In arena if fight is close enough both fighters think they won and salute crowd, it was a endless loop (cuz noone dies) which you need to restart the game.\nSometimes blessings on your gladiators will disapear (mostly on sponsored fighters) then if you try to give them new one, it cause endless freeze on that save. Even you alt+f4 and try again it will freeze again in few mins. Which means your progress is gone, you need to start a new game.\nSometimes championship's date and a normal battle will overlap and game will think the normal battle is played while you challanged championship's battle, and it will f'ck your game up too. \n\nIn the end the game needs more content and fixes, it's an unpolished gem with lots of potential but it's still not there yet.\n \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 519, "steamid": "76561198107954523", "last_played": 1506233882, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 231, "playtime_forever": 519}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506233824, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506233824, "recommendationid": "35172207", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "finished this game quite quickly, but i'd happily go back to it again as it was a right laugh.\nBrilliant game\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198056659723", "last_played": 1506110473, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 519, "playtime_forever": 111}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506110519, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500624", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506110519, "recommendationid": "35136408", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great game, has a steal learning curve to begin with but once you get a grip of the controls you easily start to have fun, I had 2 attempts before I finished my first play through.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042196540", "last_played": 1499275456, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_forever": 180}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505052830, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502806", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505052830, "recommendationid": "34862959", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I loved this game but be warned it can be very addictive.
