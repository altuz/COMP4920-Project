There is no tutorial so the first thirty minutes of the game consisted of me dying over and over again trying to find out where to get water and food.  I persisted and I'm glad I did.  Once you find out how to play, the game is easy enough: during the day you collect resources, farm, and hunt.  At night you protect your house from zombie hoards.  Axe in the tree stump, flask in the house, gun in the drawer upstairs, super simple stuff.\n\nI'll be honest, I recommend this game based on the fact that it appeals to me.  I enjoy tower defense and I enjoy survival games.  Put the two together and you get a pretty decent game, especially for the price.  If you buy Save Home, remember that there is a lot of trial and error that you are going to encounter, you will die, restart, and die again.  Each time you do so, you will learn a little more about the game.  Eventually, you will become the master of this Russian creation.\n\nBuy it now or on sale, either way is worth your time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057353219", "last_played": 1503273074, "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 406, "playtime_forever": 300}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1491926246, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533998", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1491926246, "recommendationid": "31080594", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
