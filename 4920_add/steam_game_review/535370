(gamebreaking awful, no, but not good)\n\nThis feels like a game that would've been a hit if they aimed it at specific people and sold it for around 6$, as it stands it's being sold as a game full of humour where none can be found at quite a high price and this will not go well...\n\nIs there anything good, yes there is, the weird story, aliens, secret socities and such has gotten me interested and leaves me wanting more but I don't think I'll ever get to see anything more than I've already seen...\n\nNote to dev. either make a fun game (with working jokes) or an intriguing story, your italian sense of humour may work in Italy but I don't see it working anywhere within the english (or the good enough at english) speaking world.\n\nOne other thing - which is the reason I never did refund this - that I like is that they released it for Amiga OS 4.1, that deserves a bit of admiration.
