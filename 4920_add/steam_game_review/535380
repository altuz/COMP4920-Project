VR is blazing a new trail in gaming, but some of the best games or experiences out their are re-makes of classics from the very first video games ever; and this works.  For example, earlier on I was playing Gunjack which is basically Space Invaders on steroids, and it is a blast!  This is basically Asteroids on steroids, very simple approach to it too.  You are basically like Ironman flying around and blasting them.  It works, is addicting and simple.  There is no storyline, which can also be good. In my mind I can create a mission such as \"I am  clearing space lanes for galactic travelers, which is a great way to earn extra cash, being a top notch pilot...\".", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198016299604", "last_played": 1504587776, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_forever": 69}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1475159970, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496480", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1475159970, "recommendationid": "25766230", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[UPDATED REVIEW]\nThe developer has made some great updates to this game. The tracking HUD (optional) is fantastic. I no longer have to keep spinning around to see if something is silently sneaking up to smack me dead in an instant. The HUD seems to borrow from Elite: Dangerous\n\nThough head look still isn't my favorite way to navigate it definitely feels a little more intuitive.\n\nThe guns are still at the wrong angle (almost 90 degrees off), but that's something the dev is aware of and will hopefully correct in an update.  \n\nAll in all, the gameplay feels much better and closer to it's coin-op ancestor! I now feel comfortable recommending this early access game and look forward to continued updates.\n\n\n[OLD REVIEW]\nThat excalated quickly! I made it to wave 2 before eating a space rock. \n\nIt's a challenging game, but I think that's partly because it's not optimized as well as it could be. First, you're holding the guns at a really weird angle. Second, head look for navigation is a bad choice. Third, game need a HUD system to show you nearby asteroids or at least a noise coming from the asteroids so you're not getting smacked in the back of the head by a silent attacker without warning.\n\nI love the concept and would play this constantly if it was better optimized. I can't recommend this game in its current state. Hopefully the developer will make some improvements.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971905084", "last_played": 1492477520, "num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 167, "playtime_forever": 73}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1486339048, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1489370229, "recommendationid": "29731728", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Remember the game Asteroids?
