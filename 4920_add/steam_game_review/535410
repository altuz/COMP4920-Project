However, it falls short of reaching the goal line.\n\nWith only three skirmish maps (all of which appear to be the same with different backgrounds) and five difficulty settings, CapitalShip VR is missing the rest of the recipe for a great game. And as an RTS, it falls flat on it's face as the strategy is simply making as many miners as possible and overwhelming the fleet; The AI does little to respond to your assaults.\n\nControls are not very intuitive and the tutorial does little to alleviate the confusion. The game promises that you can make formations but it seems each time I have tried the ships just kind of move toward the enemy, at their own paces and not as a formation. Selecting and deselecting ships doesn't seem very natural as the selection is done with a sort of cone and you tend to grab the wrong ships or clusters of ships that you don't want to move. On that, ships tend to crash into each other without even attempting to avoid collision. And yes, they appear to take crash damage.\n\nCombat is somewhat lackluster. I have no indication of how damaged the enemy ships are until they explode in a disappointing boom. Carriers, when told to move, seem to leave their strike craft behind. This can cause issue when you issue an attack command and the tiny attackers have to traverse the entire map in order to get to their target. \n\nThe name of the game is CapitalShip. Yet the actual capital ship doesn't really portray that. The larger craft such as the cruisers and carriers are almost as large and the miner ships are much larger than the capital ship itself.\n\nEven with the above issues, Capitalship VR does deliver on several fronts. The ships themselves seems varied, each with a particular function and the ships are very well detailed and look stunning. I found myself pausing the action just to move the camera around the ships to take a good look at each one. The detail is all there and you can even make out the menus on the bridge of the capital ship. Very cool! \n\nI cannot stress how friggin' cool it is to issue commands to the fleet, and watch the action take place from the bridge, overshadowed by Jupiter and its moon, Europa. It truly is one of the coolest things you can do in a video game. \n\nAll in all, the developers need to take a look at successful space RTS games, chiefly, Homeworld. It had a sense of purpose and strategy. Both sorely lacking in CapitalShip VR. At the time of writing this the game is still early access and the developers need to take a good look at the best ways to improve this game because they are sitting on a gold mine, a real treasure that can push the forefront of both VR and RTS.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970497219", "last_played": 1482365167, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 101, "playtime_forever": 122}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1482367827, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508220", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1482367827, "recommendationid": "28519080", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's early days yet, but with the improvements I've seen only over the last few days I'm probably going to enjoy this game a whole lot once it gets some more content.\nFor right now, as of me typing this, it's pretty much just a defense mission and an assault mission, and a splash of tutorial, but the framework is becoming very solid.\n\nIf you want to get in on the ground floor to see it grow, this is excellent example of what Early Access is supposed to be.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992821166", "last_played": 1478710236, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 414, "playtime_forever": 60}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1477201241, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503418", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1477201241, "recommendationid": "26176511", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a really interesting game.
