It's a little obtuse at first as you're kind of dropped in without a whole lot of direction, but once you get the hang of the basics it's a super fun ride from their on out.  The hordes are daunting at first, but just run away if you're underleveled and they'll leave you alone soon enough (or enjoy the easy cash if you're overleveled).  The perks and upgrades feel satisfying, lots of a new forms of combat and movement that are fun to use in combination with each other.  My only regret is at some point the game ends... :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970899269", "last_played": 1505670811, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 547, "playtime_forever": 2513}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505675674, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505515", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505675674, "recommendationid": "35031107", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Sundered from the makers of Jotun is the best true metroidvania experience I have seen so far.\nA couple Pros and Cons from what I have played so far.\n\nPros and Cons Mixed:\nThe art is beautiful and reminds me of Ralph Bakshi's Wizards if you have ever seen this cult late 70's film.\n\nThough gameplay starts off challenging, the system for upgrading your character creates a harmony between skill and statistics that will promote growth, and assure the player even tough enemies will be brough down with patience.\n\nThough some complain about the horde sytem, I believe it to be a great chance to build on skill, and promotes more of a fight or flight gameplay mechanic.  If a player obsesses with killing every enemy, breaking every pot they are quickly going to be overwhelmed.  It promotes knowing your limits and adaptibility.\n\nYou are going to die is this game, it is going to make you mad if you expect otherwise.  The good thing, you dont really have a percieved penalty for this besides going back to the hub, and some random layouts are more challenging than others.  Some area are set even if what is around them is not.  For example: First area has a spot with a thorn bush you have to double jump over, then you turn around double jump to a couple wall jumps and are to the top. Hard at first, but you do it 20 odd times it becomes second nature.\n\nEnemys have set patterns to attacks. If you expect to button mash your way to victory, chances are you will be able to with enough character upgrades, but you are going to die, a lot.\n\nDifficultly wise of the metroidvania style, I use the Castlevania SOTN to Ori and the Blind Forest scale.  Sundered feels like it is right in the middle.  SOTN being super easy, kill mermaids for the first hour and the rest of the game is cake.  Then with Ori there is escaping the tree filling with water...  Died probably 50 times.  If you beat it the first time, good for you.  There is no doubt a reason for it that, be it drugs, trust fund baby, kid, spawn of the devil, watched a video, no social life, or just a lot of experience with other similar platformers.  Good for you.  My point though, this is not as hard as Ori, and much harder than SOTN.\n\nSo far I am at the beginning of the second zone and do not have much informations on how your choices impact the game.  More to come once I have done a couple play throughs.\n\nOverall, well worth the 20 dollar price tag.  Would buy it again, would buy it for a friend.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198003123326", "last_played": 1505217071, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 539, "playtime_forever": 559}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505207424, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505515", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505207424, "recommendationid": "34897500", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A procedurally generated Metroidvania? Yes please! I rather enjoy how progression in this game makes you feel like you've genuinely grown stronger and better at handling enemies. Going back to early areas late in the game is...cathartic, to say the least. The game controls beautifully too, tight controls and speedy, responsive movement suits the fast paced, hectic combat well. Oh, and the game is absolutely beautiful, in a horrifying, macabre way.
