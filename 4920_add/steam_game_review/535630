Other than a bit of lag now and again, it performs quite well, it looks good, and it plays well; what more can you ask from a game?\n\nIn general, I usually do not play top-down TPS games, but I do play survival and progressive defence-building games. The single player didn't interest me a whole lot, but when I joined in on multiplayer, it proved to be a grand old time, and I could actually make a dent in the hoardes that chased us! When things actually started progressing, it became a lot more fun.\n\nI voted to have a few melee options put in, and I've heard some good things are coming from the developers soon enough--I look forward to seeing this game grow and prosper.\n\nIf you like top-down shooters, multiplayer games, and shootin' stuff, definitely give it a chance.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198143338868", "last_played": 1504589641, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 65, "playtime_forever": 117}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1499015613, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510311", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499015613, "recommendationid": "33141117", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "An indie game that has had a lot of work put it into it.
