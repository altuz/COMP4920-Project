It is a game that you dont get bored easily as there are a lot of extra things to unlock and it is multiplayer although thre are not a lot of players playing this game. At all it is a very good game but there are some bugs that should be fixed. I strongly recommend it if you want to play with friends", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198072234306", "last_played": 1503776009, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_forever": 141}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1492200433, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490291", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492200433, "recommendationid": "31142598", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
