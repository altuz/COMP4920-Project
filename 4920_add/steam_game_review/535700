I am not able to agree with that statement as you are forced to take queen when promoting pawn. That is not according to chess rules. Additionally \"avoid check\" puzzles are mostly only doable as computer is not even trying to give you check. On other hand \"give check\" puzzles are so easy it is not worth to go there. Plus for \"checkmate\" puzzles some of them need deep gaming knowledge. In general, it is not bad game, it is just not very good. In 90 % off promotion and a puzzle a day game it could be worth. \nDo I regret buying it, no as it was cheap.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053208546", "last_played": 1495375345, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 95, "playtime_forever": 240}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1495272784, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498107", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1495272784, "recommendationid": "31856837", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
