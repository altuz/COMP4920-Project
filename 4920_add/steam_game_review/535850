I think some other reviewers have touched upon it, but the reason it is receiving so many negative reviews is probably due to the price. It seems a lot compared to the \"free\" MM game I am currently playing on mobile, but when you factor in all the potential micro-purchases in that version, it's similarly priced.\n\nUnlike the progression system in the mobile game, here you are given a load of vehicles from the beginning. I don't know if these will be added to or not, but they appear to be upgradeable via a loot system. For some reason, the upgrades I've won are only cosmetic - audio samples, skins etc - and again not sure if they'll be power-up upgrades available at some point. They don't all perform the same, as some reviewer suggested, but they are very similar it's true. I guess this is to make the 12 vehicle races a bit fairer.\n\nThe races tend to feel a little samey and random, not least because I always find myself playing bots. I do play at odd times though. However, where the game wins my vote is in the battle modes. It is absolutely manic! Each vehicle has 3 imaginatitive unique weapons, all animated well and with satisfying effects! Again, there is always 12 players, but this time it's actually very playable even with AI. When there are more humans online this mode will be the centerpiece for sure. You get killed a lot, but respawning can be fun as there is a setting allowing spawning as a different vehicle each time. This mode genuinely raised my adrenalin levels - no mean feat for a low-skilled but veteran gamer such as myself!\n\nTo sum up, you should buy this game if you are a fan of the franchise, as there is more than enough fun for your hard-earned, if you take time to look. Try not to compare it with other versions - true, many of them are more playable, but this is a worthy instalment in its own right - SEE YOU IN BATTLE MODE!!!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197982596881", "last_played": 1502516191, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_forever": 384}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1501791146, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490269", "votes_down": 11, "timestamp_updated": 1501791146, "recommendationid": "34000881", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
