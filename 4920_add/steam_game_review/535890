I really did. I thought the concept was interesting and it had a lot of potential. However, the bits of SA that shine are blotted out by all the painfully mediocre elements. (Full disclosure, the following breakdown is based on playtime up to level 6, as something happened there that made me unable to play any further. More details below.)\n\nThe music: The music in SA is pretty alright. Unfortunately, none of the songs I came across really stuck in my head or may me want to play levels again. True to the story of the band you play as, it sounds like it was made by a real small-time group. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but the tracks for this game sound like background music rather than the driving force, which runs really counter to the idea of a rhythm game. Speaking of which... \n\nThe rhythm elements: The rhythm elements of this game are what really let me down. You control a ship which moves between 5 different lanes on a 'music highway'. Halfway up the highway from your ship are a set of translucent lines. It is *there* that you're supposed to be looking for to hit the 'notes', but your character is at the bottom of the screen dodging whatever you don't/can't shoot down. This is a little odd, but wouldn't be a problem if the timing was correct. The timing for notes in SA is so painfully inconsistent that it's frustrating. Sometimes a 'Perfect' is actually a little bit ahead of when you'd expect, sometimes it's behind, but rarely is it ever as a note is actually being played in the song. Not only that, it feels inconsistent even when you do the exact same thing over and over. To give what I'm saying here some actually credit, I've been playing musical instruments in real life for 10 years. I play rhythm games on a near daily basis, be it Guitar Hero, Love Live, Audiosurf, Osu, Beat Hazard, Riff Racer, Chunithm.. I can go on, but the point is that I know what rhythm is. I know timing, tempo, and how beats are supposed to fall in music. So it's incredibly aggravating when I do the same thing and get different results. Not just that, but sometimes to dodge you have to make more than one movement, which is more than one key press. This means that while you're moving to dodge something, you may miss your window to get a 'Good' or a 'Perfect'. You might not even get 'OK' cuz the game thinks you made the dodge too far in advance.\n\nAesthetics: The game looks good; I'm a fan of the 80's pop culture look and the bright neon aesthetics. The HUD is well laid out and puts everthing toward the bottom of the screen so you don't have to take your eyes off your ship or the hit line. It's nice.\n\nStory and Voice Acting: Man, you'd think Stereo Aereo was an established franchise with how the writers toss around names and locations like they're common knowledge (if it is, let me know and I'll take this back.) I have literally no idea who these characters are or what they even do in the band. It's not really even mentioned until around level 4, though I suppose you could guess based on the shape of their ships. Anyway, these guys talk waaay too much. Get a high combo? Character quip. Get hit? Character quip. Do basically anything? You guessed it: character quip. I'd love to be able to turn this off, but that's not an option, which means you get to hear these mediocre lines spouted over and over again.\n\nLength & Replayablity: Looking at the arcade mode, I believe that the game has 8 levels. That's 8 songs. And.. That's it. Seriously, there is so little content here it's hilarious. Not only that, if you're an achievement hunter it won't take you long at all to ace this game. I got 32% of the achievements in this game in under an hour, about 4 of those came while I was playing the tutorial. Unless you *really* like this game, you're probably only gonna get about 3-4 hours tops. That's laughably low for a rhythm game. So if it's so easy to finish, why didn't I? While playing level 6, I ran into a graphical error that made it impossible for me to continue playing. The things I was supposed to be dodging were straight up invisible. Not even sure why that's happening; I've never had any graphical error like that occur while I was playing any other game on this computer. Suffice it to say, I'm going to be asking for a refund for that reason alone.\n\nTo make a long review short, Stereo Aereo is a really cool idea that falls short in basically every category. Honestly, I feel like if they had focused on making a solid shooter and focused the rhythm elements to boss battles, this would have turned out a lot better. The boss fights were the most fun and polished part in this game. Maybe some big updates in the future can push Stereo Aereo into a more finished state, but I have a hard time recommending this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017845433", "last_played": 1481804287, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 173, "playtime_forever": 48}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1481805937, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528254", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1481805937, "recommendationid": "28386643", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZsHcWBz_q0", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198339421398", "last_played": 1481736137, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 9}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1481736224, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447901", "votes_down": 21, "timestamp_updated": 1481736224, "recommendationid": "28363143", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
