So, it's quite unique since it's a word game but the answer is more like a riddle you have to solve by reading the other given words.. no need for hints! :)\nOverall, a relaxing game which can be even more enjoyed by those like me who have English as maybe their third or fourth language! Probably for a native speaker isn't -that- difficult but it has so many puzzles that it can still be enjoyable and relaxing. And of course, Steam is full of non-English native speakers, so why not? :)\nBy the way, I've been stuck some times during the very first sets of puzzles too.. ahahah", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198356141989", "last_played": 1505476493, "num_reviews": 114, "num_games_owned": 225, "playtime_forever": 101}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1505242757, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512750", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505242757, "recommendationid": "34906683", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
