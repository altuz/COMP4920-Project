I really did.  The art style and the execution are clean, simple and accessible.  The gameplay loop is repetitive ad infinitum, even for a rogue-lite.  Its art style is reminiscent of Heavy Metal Comics. \n\nThe game itself has nothing to do with Lovecraft let alone Cthulhu. This in itself is flagrant false advertising.  I paid the full price of $2.99 and while the game has replayability it has a life-span of less than 2 hours before I officially lost interest. \n\nBrilliant artwork cannot save an otherwise dull and repetitive game that seemingly never ends and that\u2019s not a good thing.  It\u2019s not worth more than 75 cents.  Especially when Hand of Fate was recently on sale and Elder Scrolls Legends and Infinity Wars are free to play.  Do the maths. Save your money. Invest elsewhere.  \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198408671944", "last_played": 1505459934, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_forever": 39}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505480641, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501371", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505480641, "recommendationid": "34971248", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
