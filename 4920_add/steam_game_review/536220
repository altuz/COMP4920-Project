I was so disappointed in this game.\n\nTL/DR: The characterisation is terrible (even Clem's), the story is horrible, the gameplay is somehow even worse than the first two games, and your choices don't matter.\n\n**Some mild spoilers below, beware**\n\nAfter playing the first two seasons and falling in love with or at the very least empathising with 99% of the main characters, it was a shock to find I didn't care about ANY of the characters in this game. NONE. Not even Clem. Even the characters I was supposed to like (Javier, Kate). That sucked. But worse than that, I found myself hating David with a passion, only to find the game trying to shoehorn me into symapthising with him. This was after he did horrible, unforgivable things (eg hitting his kid, shooting someone in cold blood while negotiating). Wtf Telltale?\n\nThat was only the worst bit of the storytelling - there were plenty of other points where the narrative either got completely lost or made no sense at all.\n\nThe gameplay wasn't great in the first two seasons but they managed to make it even worse in this one. Instead of coherently tying together the annoying quicktime key presses, they changed it so you're pretty much pressing a random key each time. Plus half the times you have to take control, there's nothing meaningful for you to do, eg a few times you take control only to walk the character forward a few steps.\n\nThe other reviews talking about your choices meaning nothing are completely correct, but I'll also add to that - at least 50% of the time, the dialogue option didn't seen to match what the character actually said. When I wanted to respond angrily to someone, I found my character joking, for example.\n\nI have to come back to Clem. I adore her as a character but they really fucked her over in this game. She was little more than a supporting character, and a cliched, boring one at that. I really wanted to see a story about her trying to survive with AJ, but I guess Telltale decided that would be too hard.\n\nOverall, if you liked Seasons 1 and 2, do yourself a favour and skip this game. Seriously. Or play it out of curiosity when it's on sale for at least 50% off.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 701, "steamid": "76561198004668088", "last_played": 1506427707, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 121, "playtime_forever": 701}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1506429439, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505689", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506429439, "recommendationid": "35221049", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This TWD title, was the worst of the series.

Complacent and unambitious but beautiful art and story telling.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 389, "steamid": "76561198017421988", "last_played": 1506898005, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 287, "playtime_forever": 496}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506980373, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497655", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506980373, "recommendationid": "35429133", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you liked the previous seasons of The Walking Dead, don't play this.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198078510182", "last_played": 1496181430, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_forever": 664}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505443997, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492583", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1505443997, "recommendationid": "34962610", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I'm gonna take a leap and say it. This is the best season of The Walking Dead and I have a huge amount of reasons for it. Playing for a different character instead of Clementine worked very well. For me and majority of players, which are still male, it's way easier to relate to Javi then Clementine. It also gave us the option for romance, which woudn't be possible otherwise or woldn't have desired effect in terms of atmosphere. I was a bit scared, that Clementine would act differently since we do not control her anymore, but that's fortunately not the issue. Clem acted alwayas as I expected. Another different thing, which distinguishes A New Frontier from first two seasons is how deep the story and character progression actually is. I'd say that there are less characters overall but their relations are way deeper than in any previous instance. Due to the fact there are also less deaths. Someone might don't like this fact due to Game of Thrones effect, but I have to say, those deaths were cheap anyway. For me it got a bit boring and repetittive to switch up groups every now and then in season two. I also would say that Telltale step up a little in terms of story continuality. Usualy you know that if you let one poeple live and the other die, they just swtiched up places. Now I actually wasn't sure at all and the storyline went wider than I expected. And last but not least, I like the postepisode and especially postseason overview of your actions and character development. Again, it's more detailed and deep overall.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 208, "steamid": "76561198031387862", "last_played": 1506039800, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_forever": 928}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506040905, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502133", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506040905, "recommendationid": "35116994", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A must have for a walking dead and teltale games fan.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198077772001", "last_played": 1496317034, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_forever": 580}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504877946, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490291", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1504877946, "recommendationid": "34814747", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Well start to off, I'm gonna give this game a rating of 7/10.\n\nPersonally I liked this game a bit less than the other 2, sure this game had its moments\nof panic, hard choices and characters that you cant stand, but thats only what gets the adrenaline going, but somethings made it just really stupid.\nBut overall the game was decent. The one thing that seems bad to me is the fact that the game lenght was 5h shorter than the first season. They seem to keep getting shorter and kinda rushed, so I hope they make season 4 longer. \nSo these are my pros and cons:\n\nPros:\nTextures have been improved \nThe colour saturation is better than previously\n\n\nCons:\nWith better graphics quality, comes worse FPS \n\nToo short\n\nEvery character except AJ and Clem were new, so you didn't have that certain feel or connection to them, which made it so that certain people didnt even find this even that emotional (to me 1st and 2nd were actually really sad at times) I didn't shed a tear in this one, of course I felt bad for some of the characters but that certain connection to them was missing. A.K.A = Need more feels!\n\nThe action scenes were too \"intense\", like the music they had playing during almost every action scene was just getting absurd, and altogether they were kinda boring ( almost every button you had to press was already shown, when in the 1st or 2nd one, some of the would popup at a certain point, and some of the animations just took way too long)\n\nSome of the choices you had to make, were completely different from what the game would actually say. ( The part where Clem shot the bullet dealer and you had to either tell the truth or protect Clem was the most confusing)\n\nThere was almost no times you actually had to do the walking on your own and search for stuff, mostly it was just you doing the action scenes and answering questions.\n\nSome of the controls were really off (the mouse was the worst one, sometimes it might just move on its own when you walk)\n\nFinal toughts:\nFeel like this game series doesn't need that good engine/new engine, the old ones were fine, like this game has to be played on my computer with almost the worst settings (previous ones went perfectly on 60 FPS, and this one around 20-40) = most textures are just pixel mesh, and that kinda takes you out of the immersion, and it was kinda buggy. Sometimes voice lines wouldn't play or textures would clip through walls. Like I think the only thing that from the old engine could be tweaked is the colour thingy, the graphics don't matter that much (the graphics from the 2nd one are enough). But if your FPS is shit, then that most likely takes you out of the immersion, which probably ruins your experiences.\n\nI'm only recommending this because of the story.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198070730266", "last_played": 1505604188, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 55, "playtime_forever": 453}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505606402, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502150", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505606402, "recommendationid": "35010026", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
