My daughter is taking percussion in school, and wanted to practice marimba at home.  This looks like a great substitute, and she immediately banged out Yellow Submarine and seemed right at home with the spacing, responsiveness, etc.  A way to import sheet music would be awesome (would probably have to appear quite a bit larger than the current music stand to be readable on the Vive, but virtual whiteboard sized or on the back wall would be great).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197973772310", "last_played": 1492980681, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 129, "playtime_forever": 63}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1479414058, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515346", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1479414058, "recommendationid": "26650302", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Obviously not as responsive as a real instrument, but this is a good start.
