If that is the case, don't dismiss this Steam version as being the same thing. The addition of collectables plus some new levels makes this game become an entirely new experience, with more challenging and rewarding moments. It's the Magnetized we knew and loved before, but with more flair and polish.\n\nFor people who just randomly come across this game, I feel like the other reviews have already given it justice. It's a fun little reaction-based puzzle game that keeps you busy for an hour or so. And for three dollars, there's not many deals that are better than this. I'd definitely recommend this game to any puzzle fan.\n\nIf you're still not sold about this game, go check it out on Kongregate. It's pretty much a Lite version to this.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198129083828", "last_played": 1494630482, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 117, "playtime_forever": 142}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1492279514, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492279514, "recommendationid": "31161798", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
