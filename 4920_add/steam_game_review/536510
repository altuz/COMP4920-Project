Some hacking game enthusiasts are put off by the linear nature of the hacker series but I personally feel it is a nice alternative to the \"open world\" feel of Uplink. The games do have some performance issues on WIndows 10 but most of them for me have been solved by using dgVoodoo. Moving on. The Hacker series puts you in the shoes of a hacker who has to infiltrate servers to perform a multitude of tasks. One mission may have you stealing information while another may have you uploading a trojan to a bank while stealing money. It isn't for everyone and as a matter of fact these games are about as niche as they come. However, if you have an interest in hacking and aren't turned off by learning typed commands for an old school operating system you should give it a try. It won't teach you to be a hacker but it will give you that feeling that maybe you do know what you are doing.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970007557", "last_played": 1499290140, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 523, "playtime_forever": 1077}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1498965644, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498965644, "recommendationid": "33112461", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
