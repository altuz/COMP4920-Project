I had played through this many months ago, and beat the episode, but it has been some time since then, and when I made the video, the game seemed slightly updated, but it glitched, and I could not complete it or show you the cool scene. That's more or less is the gist of my review. This game is a decent experience, maybe even a bit spooky, but the choreography is bad, and the game is a big buggy, so you might get frustrated and lose the vibe, or worse: have to restart it because something screwed up and you lost the key through the floor. The puzzle-age isn't that great either. It's basically pixel hunting. Look inside the vase in the office scene, and behind the blank prior to that in the shed scene. [i]It equally sucks to have to quit the game to find the spoilers because they hide stuff to make you use up your 2 hour refund window.[/i] The item you need is prolly in the corner, which isn't really a puzzle. Well worth the price, for sure. A gem if on sale or in a bundle. [spoiler]Overall, it compares well to Trespass Episode 1, which is another similar and buggy experience, but here, you are not being ripped off. There is no lady in this VR game though, just these giant eyeballs.[/spoiler] http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=904395363", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961017729", "last_played": 1491710612, "num_reviews": 236, "num_games_owned": 2716, "playtime_forever": 100}, "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_created": 1503954242, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.368913", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1503955311, "recommendationid": "34562181", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}]}
