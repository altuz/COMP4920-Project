(click on this story for full review and game details.\nI built EVERYTHING ... All structures.. But it's pretty hard to find gear or collectors? that's all that's needed to use for solid power? Once I found it and install it, I find out it erodes very fast and the fuel cant be used in Generator as yet? (27-Sept-2017) I made a bunch of wind generators but never seems to be enough to power all buildings like DORM and Bio Lab and Or Cantina with rest. A refinery takes less power? but those take more? I cant enter them? I can't get water or food without finding Plastic bottles or purification pills, serious?!! This needs a rework. I post on your forums but no response. People need to know this before they spend money. -That said this game is still fun and still squeeky new.\n1. You have multiple Memory leaks in game. Game runs slower and slower with time until it crashes. -seems to happen more during the upgrade process-3d printer issues?\n2. You recently added a top layer of sand / dust to game which hides holes people get stuck in.\n3. ---Fatal error-- Happens a lot. a bit less with graphics turned way down. \n4. You cant make water containers with natural elements? Again you must find Plastic Bottles or purification pills to make water / food - And if you make one why cant it be reused to refill with water? Can we make Purification pills or plastics* for making water containers. ? Something.. anything please. \n5 No end game content. Can't bring colonists in no matter what you do EVER.  Dead end.\n6. No official guide available? \n7. Official Web site is weak and it's Forum is broken or non responsive. https://community.gamesco.net/viewforum.php?f=3   (Steam is OK however)\n8. Being able to Move buildings around or disconnect wires would be very nice. \n9. Being able to save or load games would be nice.(Update a way has been found to save game in Steam,  Its a bit of a process but I listed how in forum.)\n10. I made a space suit.. researched it all the way to max. **Picked a few choice upgrades and skipped many. I can't buy another suit? I can't get back to the earlier ones after upgrade last one.** No path I can see to Max Corrosion (15)  max i can see is 10 meaning no path to enter cave safely so far with boxes left unavailible.   **I upgraded equipment to max on suits but its not enough to enter the cave. IM STUCK on that too.. no new suit is offered.. and I cant change choices!!**  Dead end.\n11. One level only - Hard Core. Others are listed but they don't work.\n12. I added a few spaces to vehicle inventory and drop in a rare item i find only to find it go POOF. Not on ground and not in my inventory and not in Vehicle ... ARRRGG.  (Note recent patch seems to have fixes that.)  Loot or inventors drops where you log or go LD at.\n\n13. BOOM! - My advance refinery 2 just blew up! and patence with JCB Mars.\nOk i was on a longer run but this is rediculious. I was repairing all buildings as i do every dam time I get back which BTW is just plain tedious.  I was in the process of building my last building and repairing my structures which were about 50% health BTW. And it blows up leaving litterally next to nothing.  >_<\n\nI think my next step is  put it on the back burner and not recommend this to anyone for now until more bugs get fixed.  So far the devs seem receptive. Points to be concerned about..No manual. No instructions. No easy save or load option. Constant errors. invisable rocks. hidden holes. lost experiance. Lost items. Dying without reason. Restart from scratch many times. The game has great potential but its far from a finished product that said it is still fun to play.    \n I paid for this game.   I gave it more than a fair shot.  I hope the bugs get corrected.\n\nAGAIN-  I found out you can actually make a backup / save through steam it works a bit more difficult to do but worth the time to do, I left instructions on how to do it on disscussion forum.\n\n(UPDATE)  1 October 2017  The Dev team does take comments into account and are working to improve game.   Since my post they have Fixed the solid fuel generator.  Reduce corrosion rate.  Made a save / load game button.   Made a way to make water using natural resources.\nso some nice improvements and getting better.  \n- This is an early realease game so bear that in mind.\n\nBOOM.
