Each \u201clevel\u201d contains one scenario that you are supposed to reorganize in order to play out an entire scene. Every scenario is unique, from settings to characters to lighting to sound... and it's intriguing to see each of them play out and unlock the next little \u201csandbox\u201d.\n\nCleary every one of the puzzles was crafted with much care, attention to detail and competence. It's interesting how some levels are more \u201crealistic\u201d (i.e. tell \u201creal life\u201d stories) and some are completely otherworldly! The amount of creativity funneled into this, as a whole, is a joy to behold.\n\n[h1]Why do I recommend it?[/h1]\n\n\u2663 It has a premise I've never seen before and a very interesting and unique way to execute it;\n\u2663 It is absolutely gorgeous;\n\u2663 The music, in the levels, is good;\n\u2663 The stories you form do play out in an interesting way;\n\u2663 The sound effects are quite fantastic;\n\u2663 It is a roller coaster ride in its themes and the next level is always a pleasant surprise;\n\u2663 It performs well.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Didn't lag or stutter with my GTX 750 Ti.\n\n[h1]But you may not like it...[/h1]\n\nSadly, [i]Miniature[/i] suffers from slips that, to some, [b]can be crucial downsides[/b]:\n\n\u2663 The interface is confusing;\u00b2\n\u2663 It's too short;\u00b3\n\u2663 It's easy;\n\u2663 The \u201cwin\u201d music is repetitive;\u2074\n\u2663 The UI won't \u201cgo away\u201d to allow what could have been gorgeous screenshots;\n\u2663 The level select menu is misleading and should be improved;\n\u2663 It lacks controller support;\n\u2663 It doesn't contain achievements;\n\u2663 It doesn't contain trading cards.\n\n\u00b2 As other reviewers pointed out, it is counter-intuitive.\n\u00b3 Can easily be beaten in under [b]one hour[/b].\n\u2074 It reminded me of [i]The Sims[/i] and how every time you clicked a new town or something this excessively jolly tune played. Some levels in [i]Miniature[/i] have a gloomy tone and the jolly tune for beating them defenestrates any possibility of an atmosphere.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAll in all, I got [i]Miniature[/i] during the Steam Winter Sale at 75% off and I have no reason to complain. Even at a bit more, it would have still been a fair price for such fantastic aesthetics and mechanics. To buy it a full price, however, is a risk, seeing at patches are certainly needed to fix your occasional bug (I hardly saw any), improve the level select menus and work on that interface a bit.\n\nIronically, this game suffers from lack of exposure.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066811930", "last_played": 1483405804, "num_reviews": 41, "num_games_owned": 349, "playtime_forever": 49}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1483408681, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532116", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1483408706, "recommendationid": "28963048", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "+ Beautiful art\n+ Very nice sound effects that work as hints as well\n+ Interesting concept\n\n- Puzzles are waaaay too easy\n- Controls and how to play are not intuitive (even with the tutorial controls, it made no sense to me at first... \"Exposure\" as synonim for \"check my answers\"? No, not intuitive... attreibuting unnumbered/unnamed scenes to \"white circles\" also took me some time to figure out)\n- Being forced random scenes every time you hit space in order to find the one you need is bit annoying\n- I REALLY wish I could zoom in a lot closer to catch and enjoy the details of the beautiful scenes\n- Settings are a bit weird... You can't play on windowed mode, everytime you change the resolution, it's instantly applied, no sound options etc.\n\nIt has a lot of potential, so keep up the good work, purpleElephant!
