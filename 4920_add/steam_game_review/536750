Deluxe is a cynical time-waster that tries to be too many things and basically fails at all of them.\n\nFirst there's the mining sub-game.  A lotto where you place explosives on a grid and hope to explode gold out of the ground.  The bigger the charge the more ore is thrown out, hopefully with gold in it.  Collecting the ore involves driving a mining truck that would have been better suited to a Tokyo Drift game.  It's pointless and tedious and shouldn't have been included.\n\nWorse the truck is a major money sink and the root of most of the mobile style grinding that plagues the game.  Upgade the truck so it can carry more ore so one can afford to buy better upgrades so it can carry more ore.  Repeat ad-nauseam for control and fuel efficienc too.  Similarly for the explosives.  Buy permits so you can buy bigger and more expensive explosives so you can mine more ore so you can afford better permits.\n\nThe town building is where BoomTown! should have excelled but doesn't.  Instead of SimCity it's just shallow slider management with no real fail condition.  Are people in need of a water?  Then build a water tower.  There's no management of water resources or scarcity, no piping.  A water tower covers a certain sized grid block.  Once the city grows outside of the coverage area then build another which doesn't overlap the first.  Repeat for every other type of building.\n\nAll-in-all I'm not impressed.  There's little reason to play for more than an hour and even that felt like a waste.  Spend your time and money elsewhere.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989528524", "last_played": 1477156940, "num_reviews": 40, "num_games_owned": 754, "playtime_forever": 60}, "votes_up": 39, "timestamp_created": 1477161348, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1477326370, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536860", "votes_down": 14, "timestamp_updated": 1477161348, "developer_response": "Hi Dragon. Sorry you didn't like the game - no worries, we can't expect everyone to like it.\n\nThere is one point we wanted to address, though. You say the gold mining part is a lottery - it really isn't if you use the right strategy. Here's what you should be doing:\n\nWhenever you detonate some explosives, it marks the landscape and if there is still gold in the grid square you will see gold rocks in the crater. You can hit the same square again to continue getting gold out. The gold also doesn't just appear in random squares - it appears in large patches so you should explore the surrounding squares to uncover the full extent of the gold patch which you can then fully mine later. You only need to randomly place explosives if you have run out of visible gold and are looking for a new area to mine.\n\nHope that helps.", "recommendationid": "26168523", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is great if you want to have some fun for just an hour maybe 2.\n\nI remember this game as a web/flash game on the internet, I loved it!
