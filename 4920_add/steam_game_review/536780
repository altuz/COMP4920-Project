Interestingly, they don\u2019t have a simple good or evil role, because everyone is motivated by a set or grey morals; something we rarely, if ever, see in a HOG.\n\nThis story must serve as a main motivation to play though, since there isn\u2019t much else in here. The stages look spectacular, but they are often half-empty. There are maybe ten hidden object scenes in total, with even less conventional puzzles. Even the point \u2018n\u2019 click parts feel half-hearted.

But I can't recommend it because it is ridicullously easy and repetitive. Even on the hardest difficulty. Pretty much ever obstacle is overcome by finding a recipe, two ingredients, solving the same very simple puzzle, and using the mixture. It's also very railroaded, which means you spend way more time watching cutscenes than you should (which are not well voice-acted). \n\nMost of the hidden object scenes aren't even really hidden - when you mouse over the item, it lights up, defeating the point. \n\nAlso, the sound effects and music have issues. The music is very repetitive, and not well-seamed. At time, halfway through a cutscene it just cuts back to the beginning of the same track, and it's very jarring.  The \"whoosh\" sound effect on zooming in/out gets annoying REALLY quickly. \n\nI wanted to like the game, because it really is pretty.
