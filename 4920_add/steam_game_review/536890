A+++.\n* The general sense of humor and look and feel of things.\n* Fairy game itself isn't bad either.\n* The music.\n* The sheer quality of the homage to [spoiiler]Adventure and Rogue[/spoiler]. Bravo. I knew there'd be a [spoiler]secret credits room somewhere[/spoiler], and I was not disappointed.\n* Quality block puzzles.\n\nMy main reservation is that I was kind of sad when I realized that [spoiler]the main area wouldn't change[/spoiler]. The original [spoiler]Frog Fractions[/spoiler] changed gameplay style completely several times, while this game focused on one specific mode and only took regular time-outs for mini-games. I was really hoping to permanently move on from Adventure to something else later.\n\nI found aspects of the game very frustrating. It was frequently unclear what I should do next, which is not a surprise given that this is a classic symptom of the era of game they are aping, but frustrating is frustrating, nonetheless. Still, I managed to get through the whole of it over a few days, mostly without needing spoilers.\n\nEither way, I totally don't regret buying or playing.

I am very disappointed with how everything turned out.\n\nThe fairy portion of the game provides a very relaxed experience where you're trying to grow a fairy village as the overseer. The fairies will perform tasks on their own as you blast your way deep into the earth, prioritize which resources to collect (food, wood, crystals, sparkles), grow your trees, and build structures to support your growing population. You can increase the speed of the game to hurry things along if you don't want to wait around too much.\n\nMy only problems with Glittermitten Grove (fairy portion) were its proneness to crash after a half hour or so and that the fairies were unable to gather crystals that were too deep underground. The latter made progression difficult when I had a horde of 30-40 crystals just sitting there, taunting me.\n\nNow Frog Fractions 2 (the game accessed through a secret door(s) in Glittermitten Grove) has good and bad parts. The mini-games were excellent and appropriately silly and weird. Some of the other meta aspects were funny too and subvert your expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, navigating the ASCII overworld and solving its puzzles made me frustrated to the point of stopping due to the unpleasantness of movement. The sword that constantly blocks you from quickly going down paths because you must rotate it in a way with Q and W where it doesn\u2019t make you two spots wide or two spots tall. The skates also function in a way where they work with you or sometimes send you backwards or in other directions you didn\u2019t intend, usually because of the sword or some other obstacle.\n\nIt just felt like one long battle against incessant annoyances to reach the funny and good parts. I was hoping for a smooth, interesting delivery of humor and quirks, but sadly sighing when thinking about the game is all I have now.\n\nGlittermitten Grove seems like the better overall experience despite its problems, but Frog Fractions 2 does contain interesting things that are worth seeing such as those excellent and varied mini-games. However, I don\u2019t know if playing it is the best choice.
