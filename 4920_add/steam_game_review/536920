Good cute graphics and i love the sound track. Really fits the game.  Think of a drunken frogger like game. Needs just a few little tweaks here and there and it will be perfect. Game hung up a few times after playing it for awhile but nothing major. I would like to see some holiday dlcs for this game. Halloween, Christmas etc. How about a drunk Dracula and Santa? Haha and a few drunks sitting outside the pub just for fun. Also you really need a controller for this game. Its not happening with a keyboard. Anyways i hope the Devs keep working on this game. Its a lot of fun and i plan on playing it a lot more this weekend!!  :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034818363", "last_played": 1480235422, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 1237, "playtime_forever": 123}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1478851138, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499709", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1478851138, "recommendationid": "26532408", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
