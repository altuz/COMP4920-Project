If you only want to know if it's worth or not: it IS. Alternatively, you can scroll down and read the \"conclusion\" section.\nThis review comes from a long time Final Fantasy player and fan, but I'll be as impartial as I can now.\n\nStory: \n\nMobius Final Fantasy involves the story of the prophecy of the Warrior of The Light in the fight against the Chaos. [spoiler]Older Final Fantasy players will recognize Garland.[/spoiler]\nThe concept it's not much original, but the events that happen within the story deserves a note: they're pretty connected and the dialogues are very good as well.\nIt's also important to progress in story to unlock more single player areas and challenges, which give awesome rewards.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nSo far, there are 3 Classes (Jobs in the game) - Warrior, Mage and Ranger - and there are 4 roles: Attacker, Breaker, Defender and Healer. Attackers can be either Warriors or Mages and they are the source of raw damage. Enemies have an orange bar below their HP bar, which is their Break gauge. While they have it, they'll take less damage (both from skills and basic attacks), and when this bar drops to 0, they enter in the \"break\" state, which makes them be stunned for (usually) 4~5 turns, taking more damage from all sources and this is where the Breaker role enters in, usually coming from Warriors and mainly Rangers jobs. Defenders (usually Warriors) are the tanks, absorbing most of the damage from enemies and sometimes even taunting them. Healers (Mages) are the ones buffing and healing the entire party and even soaking up some damage if necessary.\nYou start with 3 avaliable jobs: Onion Knight (Warrior), Apprentice Mage (Mage) and Neophyte Ranger (Ranger) and they evolve, unlocking another jobs. Not only that, but we may find other jobs from older Final Fantasy games, like: Thief, Dragoon, Red Mage and so on.\nThe battles are turn-based like Final Fantasy VII, VIII and IX for example. There is no Mana Bar, you use the skills through orbs you generate. (like some puzzle games mechanics nowadays) It is worth mentioning that you'll generate only orbs that your Job uses - Every job uses 3 different elements of the 7 avaliable: Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Light, Dark and Life.\nThere is also the Ultimate, which is exactly like the Limit in Final Fantasy VII and VIII and Trance in IX: An unique and supreme skill. Every Job has a different Ultimate and the bar fills when you hit and take damage.\nYour avaliable skills will be determined by your cards, which you can acquire from monsters (weaker versions) or bought from Ability Shop with Ability Tickets, which is mostly composed of known figures to Final Fantasy players like Ifrit, Shiva, Moggle, etc. You can get up to 4 cards which will determine your skills. They also gain level and exp just like you and give you different attributes (HP, Magic, etc) when leveling and they are also separated/classified by class afinity: (Warrior/Mage/Ranger)\nYou will spend stamina for each fight (they recover when you level up) and you are unable to fight when you are out of stamina. But you can still join Multiplayer parties if you want some recovery, you only spend stamina in Multiplayer if you create a party, not if you join them. (you recover 1 stamina every 5 minutes both in Single and Multiplayer, they have individual stamina bars.)\n\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics are great, 4k/60 FPS and the character details are literally 10/10, specially if you are a Final Fantasy fan. \nThe only thing is that sometimes the landscapes are too much in second place because your character is pretty much always zoomed that the landscapes are either are not noticed or feels repetitive, but they also look very good.\n\n\nSound:\n\nThe sound can get repetitive because of the \"Map music\" which is kind of a short loop, but the battle songs are amazing. \nMost of them are fast-paced (usually rock songs that feel fresh and adds an exciting atmosphere) and you can still recognize some small things, like the cursor moving, that's the same sound from the oldest Final Fantasy games and the traditional victory theme, of course.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nAt first I thought it was a pay-to-win game, because of Stamina and Magicite, (Cash currency) but I was completely wrong. Not only the game gives you lots of Elixirs, (recover stamina) it also gives you magicite per day.\nThe turn based battles gives a nostalgia feel while maintaining the modern graphics and interfaces and it's a fun game to play not only single but multiplayer as well.\n\nStory: 6/10 - A bit generic for Final Fantasy standards but above average for Online games.\nGameplay: 9/10 - Lacks a friendlist and Mana would be better than orbs: Even though this is fun, it depends on luck sometimes.\nGraphics: 9/10 - Only drawback is the background, that sometimes needed to be highlighted more.\nSound: 8/10 - Pretty good battle songs, but it can get boring if you are spending much time on maps deciding what to do, as the map songs are mostly loops.\n\nFinal score: 8/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198168649614", "last_played": 1498843105, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 85, "playtime_forever": 28723}, "votes_up": 111, "timestamp_created": 1487311509, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642898", "votes_down": 16, "timestamp_updated": 1487312466, "recommendationid": "29977945", "votes_funny": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "16", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I started playing this MOBILE game back in August 2016.

If you want any of the limited time summons (which are often the best cards at release) you will have to shell out LOADS of money. Example and the reason I quit: When Titus (a limited edition class card) was released, it was required to buy 12000 magicite (cash currency) to unlock him. That is over $70 worth of currency. For a mobile game. For a single card. For comparison, FF15 had just come out. FF15 (a game that developers put YEARS of labor into) cost $60. I haven't even kept up since.\n\nTLDR: Enjoy the game.

When you get deeper into the story ,or when it's challenging, you will lose a lot of stamina, which then you can only get it back by not playing the game, or using Elixirs. (You can't do a marathon on this game without Elixirs or $$$)\n\n- It's free, but there's in-app purchasing in the game, like Clash of Clans (though Mobius Final Fantasy isn't a Pay 2 Win game)\n\n-TAKES LONG TO LOAD if this is your first time playing the game! Like all of the apps I play, it needs to download its resources and assets, and depending on your computer, it'll take 15 minutes to as long as possible. It might even ask you to be closer to your wifi, which isn't possible unless you are using a laptop. \n\n-The tutorial is long. When you want to go somewhere else during the tutorial, you can't click anywhere else be doing what you want, instead, you have to do what the game tells you to do.\nIt's around 1 hour to complete the tutorial which is the only reason I hate it.\n\nOther than that, I had no problems playing the game. I take games pretty lightly so I can't really criticize that hard. I don't pay too much attention to the graphics (they're just enlarged and has more pixels, but it's for a phone-like device, not a computer so expect some low quality at times) So far, I'm enjoying the game and I would recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 59, "steamid": "76561198164590872", "last_played": 1506581003, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 2919}, "votes_up": 118, "timestamp_created": 1486512406, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614201", "votes_down": 22, "timestamp_updated": 1487027521, "recommendationid": "29771916", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "\"It's pretty good\" \n\nAllow me, in my limited technical terms, to explain.\n\nIt's a free port of a mobile game to the PC.

Of course, knowing that is a \"hint\" that the game will be awful since such games are almost always deliberately designed to be just barely entertaining enough to get people with certain addiction tendencies to stick with them and spend real money on them. One might say \"The game is free! You pay $60 for a normal 'AAA' game so appreciate this free one and if you spend a few dollars, it was worth it!\" Well, that's a fine point, except that I can't just spend $60 and get a great experience in a game like this. You could [i]literally[/i] spend thousands of dollars in this game and still not have everything.\n\nThe next argument, of course, is when people claim that you just have to be patient and you can get those things for free that normally cost real money. That's true! However, it would take an impractical length of time to acquire these things. Final fantasy games often largely involve grinding and they take quite a while to complete. Naturally, Mobius Final Fantasy has made the process take even longer to progress your character and inventory, because if it wasn't a pain in the rear, you wouldn't be tempted to spend money to avoid that horrendous wait. Although grinding sometimes bores me, I have to admit that it can sometimes be enjoyable in FF games. In Mobius, however, it just gets old. \n\nHere's why. Enemies [i]randomly[/i] drop a card. You need multiple cards to combine to make the cards better, and the four cards you \"equip\" determine your stats and they gain XP and level up while you play. Want better stats and better overall XP gains? Fight the same enemies over and over, even longer than in a normal FF game, until you have enough cards to unlock everything on the cards you need, then move along. In my opinion, FF games have enough grinding. Adding more grinding is not at all what's needed. There are various non-enemy cards you need to get either as rare random drops, or by using the in-game currency that can take 20 days to a month to get enough of to be \"worth it,\" just to raise the level caps of the cards, etc.\n\nLong story short, the game is designed to be decent enough to try to hook people in, but deliberately designed to suck hard if you don't spend real money in it, and simply spending $60 as if you were buying a new game won't get you as much fairly acquired content as buying a $60 game usually will, nor is it permanent like a $60 game, because if you ever wanted to play a new playthrough of Mobius from scratch, hypothetically, you'd either have to pay the same $60 all over again, or suffer the agonizing free-to-play intentional too-long grind. When the words \"free to play\" disgust someone more than a $59.99 price tag for a \"full\" game in an era when the $59.99 typically is missing various items of paid DLC to be \"complete,\" that means there is something very, very wrong with \"free to play,\" and I have largely explained most of that problem.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nThis game actually looks pretty darn good. You would think it would be awful-looking, since it was originally a mobile game, but it looks nice. That said, Final Fantasy XIII is graphically and artistically superior in terms of simply appearance alone, and though I haven't played Final Fantasy XV, the videos I've seen of his look outrageously superior to Mobius, of course. No complaints in this department, whatsoever.\n\n[h1]\"Story\"[/h1]\nYou load the game, get some pretentious, nonsense dialog from a disembodied voice, meet a guy whose armor practically screams \"obvious villain,\" get no explanation of how you got there or why without enough \"intriguing mystery\" hints and world-building to make me want to know more, and you're quickly informed that they think you're the \"warrior of light\" Final Fantasy VI is where storylines and character depth really picked up in terms of depth and creativity. It's also the first numbered FF game [i]without[/i] a \"warrior of light.\" That plot point wasn't good the first five times, and it's not good now. The few times FF games prior to FFVI had good plot points was when the plot points had nothing to do with the \"warrior of light\"/crystals directly. Instead of leaving that tired, uninteresting plot point in the past, they're digging its rotting corpse up to stink up another FF game.\n\nIn regard to the characters, the voice-acting was alright, and I preferred the voice performer for Mog, the moogle, better than the voice performer of Mog from FFXIII-2, but unfortunately, the moogle is the main person your hero talks to, and moogles capable of speaking the common tongue aren't known for great conversation. To make matters worse, all dialog is voice-acting for a couple of hours, then it stops and you have text boxes. It was pretty jarring, and text boxes made up most dialog I encountered for the last half of Chapter 1 of the game. No characters interested me, nothing interesting happened, the world didn't interest me, and I was just without reason to go on in terms of story and such.\n\n[h1]Combat Mechanics[/h1]\n\nI don't really have anything too snarky or biting to say here. The combat is actually fairly solid. You attack enemies and different element spheres fill a bar at the top. The cards you equip from enemies give you different Final Fantasy spells, each attuned to a different element, and if you get enough spheres of the element you need, you can use that spell. Elemental weaknesses of enemies are readily apparent, and you can also use the same elemental spheres as a tough enemy's element to up your resistance to that element. The combat is turn-based, with you taking three (or more with haste) actions before being attacked by the enemy, trying to break down a defensive barrier on tougher opponents, before finishing off their true health bar fast. \n\nIt works pretty well and I actually liked the combat. That said, the free to play aspects of the game will often prevent you from getting quality cards to have spells that actually hurt enemies, and no amount of grinding will improve your spells anywhere near as much as getting cards from buying them in the store with real money or using the drip-fed 'summons' to get more cards from the store. What also detracts from the flow of combat, is \"stamina.\" It's a resource that you use up to fight each battle, and once it's gone, you either use an item from the real-money store (or the drip feed of such items), or you wait 5 minutes for a point of stamina to return...and it takes 5 stamina per battle in the early chapter 2 map. So it would take 25 minutes between battles, and battles last typically less than 5 each.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIn short, this game is visually nice, awkwardly lacks voice-acting after having it for a quite a good bit of time, has poor dialog, lacks an interesting world and interesting events, and despite having a decent combat system, the free to play elements of this game mar that system and prevent the game from being enjoyable, since free to play games are intentionally made to annoy the player enough to cough up what the publisher hopes will be thousands of dollars each. Avoid the game unless you cannot afford other games and do not have other games...and even then, you could still find better free games. =/", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972040704", "last_played": 1487454325, "num_reviews": 455, "num_games_owned": 831, "playtime_forever": 817}, "votes_up": 64, "timestamp_created": 1487555234, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564661", "votes_down": 35, "timestamp_updated": 1505357046, "recommendationid": "30048435", "votes_funny": 7, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So currently at around 25 hours since downloading. \n\nI've read of people having crashes and server problems, but I downloaded it as soon as it was available and have not had any trouble downloading, installing the patch (took around 30 minutes) and could play the game straight away.\nI've not had any downtime since and I've had it running nearly constantly while working alongside it. ***This is a semi-long review of all aspects to date, so please strap in***\n--------------------------------------\nThis is my first time playing this game, never played the mobile version of the game but noticed it on my Queue two days ago. Downloaded it straight away and started it instantly. \n\nIntro: Nice intro movie and cinematics. While the tutorial is a bit lengthy if you haven't played before and wish to read all the text to get aquainted with the gameplay it does a great job of explaining everything. \nIf you want to read everything as a brand new player, it could take up to around 30 minutes. \n\n----------\n\nGraphics, Animations, Music and Sound Effects: Extremely impressed. For a mobile port played full-screen on my main monitor it looks fantastic. The animations during battles greatly exceed the cinematic animations. The spell effects are very nice as well. Music and Sound Effects are spot on. The voice acting is good in general, but your little Moogle buddy has a kinda cringe-funny voice!, but thats expected for a FF title. \n\n----------\n\nGameplay: Really like the battle system. It's very simple obviously as it was a mobile title.  \nBattles are able to be played Manually or set to Auto if you wish. I prefer playing Manually though to make the most of my available moves.\nMost battles are typically fast with the early longest being a max of around 5 minutes, however some can take a little bit longer if you spend time planning out moves against bosses.\n\nThe elemental system is pretty easy with there only being 3 different systems: Fire-Water, Earth-Wind and Light-Dark, with a Support element orb (Pink) for healing and other support cards.\nMost of your battles should be simple enough or moderate if you use the correct attack methods, but if you don't you might have a bit of a rough time. \nYou shouldn't need a Phoenix Down unless you go into an overmatched battle unprepared with a bad setup, come up against a difficult final wave or boss, or just play really sloppy. \n\nThere are a ton of all different types of Cards available to collect which determine your Attack and Support Spells, all upgradable by Battling and \"Fusing\" with similar cards. Cards require Gil to be Fused, however Gil is in no way difficult to aquire.\nThere is a Stamina gauge which depletes a tiny amount every battle you initiate, however, it refills quickly and as you get a bunch of Elixers early in the game, it shouldn't be a problem. As long as you don't continually lose Stamina by losing battles you should be fine. \n\nI've played for hours at a time straight without having to restore my Stamina and even now I still have 11 Elixers, picking up 3 during my casual playing times and exploring the different map sections. \nYou really do not have to refill your Stamina at all for a good few areas if you are playing consistantly like I decidded to do. I think I was on around 6 hours straight (with breaks!) before I had to use a single Elixer, which overfills your Stamina bar. It really is a fair system. \nIf you use up your entire bar then have to go Offline or Away for a few hours, then it refills extremely fast and you can blow through another full section with ease. \n\n----------\n\nStory: Very simplistic so far.

The Game itself is a great Mobile Port brought to PC. I personally have never played this Game nor heard of it before. But I must say that I really enjoy it.\n\nI am a huge Finsl Fantasy XIII Fan and I must say that this Game and its Characters remind me a little bit of it.\n\nThe Gameplay itself mainly is all about strategy-wise turn based fighting. You get 3 Decks (a little bit similiar to Lightning Returns) and lots of cards that you can enhance and upgrade to fight fiends with.\n\nAlthough this Game is mainly just fighting it does have a Story to it which I am really interested in. Unlike other Final Fantasies the Story in this Game is not as deeply and feels on some bits a little bit rough around the edges.

For starters, I did not play the original mobile version so PC port is my only experience with the product itself. Has the patient survived the operation? Let's find out.\n\nGiven the nature of these mobile games built around short bursts of gameplay, but ones that are practically infinitely replayable, some aspects I will only be able to touch briefly upon considering they require significant time investment overall to make headway. Story is one such element and admittedly MOBIUS actually has one where you assume the role of one of the identical Blanks \u2013 outsiders who find themselves in the realm of Palamecia, suffering everyone's favorite ailment amnesia \u2013 and under general instructions of a disembodied voice called Vox you try to sort things out. Along the way your named character acquires couple of guides, whether you like them or not, like Mog who serves as your window for this unfamiliar world. They are also fervent believers in the Prophecy which states that one of the Blanks will become the Warrior of Light and defeat forces of Chaos. You just might be the guy...\n\nWith that out of the way and with couple of hours of gameplay under my belt I can with some certainty state that I've seen most of what the game has to offer in terms of mechanics.\n\nAs expected, tapping/dragging will be your primary method of control as you navigate menus clearly built for mobile input, but expanded and generally much more usable with monitor real estate. Which is good because as much as this is a turn-based RPG it's also a card game and you need the space to minimize scrolling as much as you can. Character progression operates on the basis that your character, canonically named Wol, has a Job determining his weapon, unlockable skills and what Elements he can use. Most defining aspect of your combat repertoire is the fact that you have only four slots for cards aka your magical attacks, plus an additional one for a temporary \u201crented card\u201d. Each card requires specific amount of appropriate Elements you generate with regular attacks.\n\nThose are still just the basics of a simple game suffering under the weight of overly layered systems rooted in microtransactions, but I'll get around to that. For example, new Jobs are unlocked either as the final unlockable skill or acquired through cards themselves... which can be found or bought, either for real money, various resource tickets or Magicite you generate passively over a long period of time and then having to redeem before you can use, effectively reinforcing you to play the game daily. This also goes hand-in-hand with another system that will either make or break the game for you \u2013 limited stamina. If you've played other mobile games or less scrupulous MMORPGs you're familiar with what that is. In case you're not stamina is a limited resource that regenerates over time and limits how many things you can do. Want to access move across the map's nodes and access that particular mission? That's going to cost you five stamina points, and you'll be moving a lot if you plan to treat MOBIUS like a typical JRPG and play in long sessions not giving stamina the chance to regenerate.\n\nWith the amount of sheer layered systems the game has on display here; ranging from card stats, Fusion system, Skillseed which depends on the cards equipped and affects what Elements you'll get after normal attacks, purchasable cards in their myriad of forms, etc it's very plain to see it was made primarily with monetization in mind. While this is a huge detriment it doesn't really affect someone who would only play this game casually like I have and probably will for a while. Magicite redemption quantities are low so you'll be tempted to reach for the wallet or log in regularly. So many systems also amount to general headache of going through cards, checking for duplicates and sorting the situation out with Fusion on regular intervals. Thankfully, some of this can be automated if toggled under options, but this constant need to tinker is never ending. It's also probably half the appeal if you're into that, honestly.\n\nHaving said all that you may rightly be wondering how can I recommend this game?\n\nIt's more a case of lack of \u201cMiddle of the Road\" recommendation than anything else. Like I mentioned in the opening this is one of those \u201cHey, I recognize that!\u201d kind of games that draws from the entirety of the Final Fantasy as a franchise. Be it from designs and art used for cards or recognizable terminology used for Jobs, MOBIUS has something for fans purely from that angle alone even if you'll ignore everything else that comprises it. I would also be lying to deny the game looks stunning and was probably a marvel to behold on mobile. Admittedly probably because, in large part, you're not really moving your character as much as you're setting your next destination and character does the animation of getting there, but it's all in the menus. As usual Square Enix's financial backing is on display with production values extending even to game's stellar soundtrack. Combat theme changing depending on your basic Job was a nice touch, just to bring up one example.\n\nSo finally, what's the verdict? Like I mentioned previously \u2013 there's a good chance you will hate this game purely on principle if you cannot tolerate the business model. If you're someone like me who's maybe going to play for an hour a day, or even less, this may not be a problem at all. Use that thought more than anything else I've said as your main guiding light.\n\nAnd hey, it's free.

From the veterans I've talked to it seems that most of the cash shop items are not necessary to progress through or even play the game. It seems like more of a pay to speed up than pay to win. You can upgrade to 3 star cards and evolve the base jobs just fine.\n\nSecond, is it time gated? Yes. There is an energy system in place. You will not spend hours and hours grinding away. In the first few levels you are leveling up quick enough to refill your energy pool, but at around lvl 10 it starts to fall off. This isn't necessarily an issue for me because I just play this on my second monitor while I watch netflix or play another game.\n__________________________________\n\nAddressing things to do in the game\n__________________________________\n\nSo you want to know what there is to do? Picture this as an lite-incremental game. You evolve your cards or \"abilities\" over time to increase your power.  There are lots of zones to progress through in the story. You evolve your job or class over time by collecting \"seeds\" which are the currency. They are based on the card elements. Each job has a total of 3 abilty elements they can use in their set up. \n\nThere are trials and special challenges. There seem to be story events as well, as one is currently happening with Cloud Strife. \n\nLet's touch on combat really quickly. There are two ways you can fight, one being manually and the other automatic. Auto-ing will let you designate the AI to play the game for you. So far it seems rather smart and doesn't waste too many actions as well as saves your ultimate for \"breaks\". Most of this is explained in the in game tutorial. I won't get super into it, but I thought you should know that this is how the combat is broken up into.\n__________________________________________\n\nI guess that concludes my short review, I havent explored fully but I thought I would leave my opinion as I see a lot of negative reviews and the game doesn't deserve it.
