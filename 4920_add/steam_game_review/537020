There is a built in tutorial. \n\nI was one of these people.\n\n\nPro's\n\n- Every card is well thought out and has its own \"faction\" (type) as well as abilities that can be used.\n\n- The artwork on the cards has a stylistic charm similar to other famous strategy card games.\n\n- The music is great and nice to listen to as you slowly move forces into your enemies domain!\n\n\nCon's\n\n- There are only so many maps to play on and I would love to see more.\n\n\n\nIt's a shame that this has so few players. I had tons of fun playing this with my friend, and recommend this to anyone who likes this genre of games.\n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040824791", "last_played": 1484602051, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 419}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1482098028, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508510", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1482098028, "recommendationid": "28456554", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "giving this game a positive review for trying something new, i have yet to fully explore the game as of now, but seems pretty nice :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197996796573", "last_played": 1482947051, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 57, "playtime_forever": 50}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1483037612, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493325", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1483037612, "recommendationid": "28800528", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
