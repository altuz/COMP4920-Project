It's a nice little fluff game that you can play and quit at any time. $2 is a fair price, in my opinion. However, this game does have a couple flaws:\n-Resolution is fixed with seemingly no way to modify it\n-After a bit, the game seems slow. Perhaps if your speed increased as time went on/if there was a faster speed mode this game would be more of a challenge.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I like it. The idea is simple and the execution is great.
