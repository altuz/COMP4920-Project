Overall, it's not incredible, and it's extremely difficult, as most of the bullets are very hard to see, meaning you can die without even noticing that there are things which can make you die. With more work, it could be good. I experienced quite a few crashes after getting a Game Over, and I don't like the fact that you have to watch a cut-scene every time you press Play.\n\n[b]2/10[/b]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198080592525", "last_played": 1475863542, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 59, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 52, "timestamp_created": 1475863794, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542211", "votes_down": 21, "timestamp_updated": 1475863794, "recommendationid": "25908574", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Die for the Empire eh? \nDONE I DID IT, I DIED! MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!\n\n\nSeriously though,\nStarting with the art i like it. Clean and colorful without being gaudy, the ships design matches terrain in style\nthe ships themselves are different and feel very different, I like that\nThe enemies are varied and aesthetically pleasing as well, they have patterns that are specific to each type\nIt is difficult, but deaths do not feel cheap or rage inducing, each time I died for the empire it was obvious why and was my mistake\n\n\nBUT\nthe difficulty may be progressive, (farthest i made it is the ship you must defend, like the idea of putting objectives in running like that, games usually have different missions fresh idea i think to have missions come in stream like that.)\neven if it is progressive, the difficulty does not start out low enough, you are running your head against a wall. I really think difficulty levels would be great.\n Remember Halo? Heroic was the gold standard and everyone knew it was a bear to beat. So to go for glory you played heroic, but to have fun you played normal or hard. Let you get through and understand the game which prepared you for trying hardest difficulty have for example easy, medium, hard and DIE as difficulty settings\nwith die being the current difficulty and three lower levels which increase your health, maybe give you health steal when you kill enemies or lessen their damage so people can set it easy if they like so they can at least make it through the whole game\nand THEN if they like it play it on higher difficulties. Text in shop does not fit on buttons and is a small thin font that should be fixed\nA description of ships fire patterns and supers would be great make your game look cooler with those added diagrams I think and help player to understand what is going on. Sort of an info card for each ship that displays when you click on a ship or just place ships at the screen\u2019s top and display card beneath them.\nOne major gripe i have is the key setting, using arrow keys and mouse crowds my hands together and WASD is much more common and comfortable to myself and most computer gamers. Add custom key binding or an option for WASD key settings with C & V replacing shift and Ctl so you can use your thumb.\nodd thing i noticed is if I hold right and tap left ship will stop as I tap left, but if I hold left and tap right right tap is ignored, same thing for up and down. Minor but a control inconsistency nonetheless\n\n\nMusic is great, energizing and aggressive without being overwhelming game is fun and clean, screen is not cluttered like is common with games in this genre.\n\n\nIf you like HARDCORE ship shoot\u2019em ups you will like this game, not sure if you will like the price though. \n\n\n3/10 (I think difficulty levels alone would bring this game up to a 5-8/10 depending upon implementation)\n\nDISCLAIMER: Dev is a good friend of mine.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198064470814", "last_played": 1482379393, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 138, "playtime_forever": 59}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1480103894, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496943", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1480103976, "recommendationid": "27534692", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
