While i'm no veteran I have played my fair share of the genre and found it to be a very pleasant experience. I would consider myself a quick reader so logging 13 hours in completeing every route and every CG I would say is pretty decent for what I paid. (Bought the game during a sale.) Of course everyone elses mileage may vary because of read speed and/or auto play.\n\nAs one of the only ways (legally) to get the game now due to the fact Manga Gamer no longer sells the uncensored version on their site it is unfortunate that the version most accessible is not the 'complete' version. However the experience isn't too badly hampered, due to the fact that this is ported from the PS2 version and is pretty polished. And because it's the PS2 version Kareha's and Mayumi's route are also within the game bringing the heroine count to hefty 7, compared to the already healthy 5.\n\nAnd if you are desperate for the adult content for research and compltionist purposes you can find it online pretty easily.\n ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\nThe game ,although old, still looks very decent. The art has aged very well to other visual novels in my opinion compared to the likes of Clannad. \nMusic wise the tracks are fitting for the mood of the scene and the looping is noticible, but the tracks are good enough to mean that the looping isn't to distracting. \n\nActual route wise getting on a certain girls route isn't particularly hard meaning that for newcomers it's easily accessable and the writing isn't to complex which makes it easy to understand and take in. Furthermore getting a specifc girls route on the first playthough isn't too hard, which is always a plus.\n\nThe common route is pretty good it introduces the characters pretty well as it provides good characterisation of the heroines and there inner troubles and personalities. It is also pretty humourous to the point of giving a good chuckle which is surprisingly kind of rare for visual novels because while others are humourous you may only smirk.\n\nThe heroine routes are up and down some routes are really good while some are good. Of course there is a bias on which girls you like more. I found myself liking Nerine's the best, while I have heard people like Primula's the best. So it's all down to personal preference, but all of the routes are all very decent. \n\nInconclusion, Shuffle! is a very good visual novel for those who are looking to start getting into visual novels or those who have read a lot of visual novels and wanting to go back to an older titile. The title has aged very well, due to the good art, music and memorable to story. All the characters a very likable and you will probable pick a best girl before too long. The shorter nature of the visual novel also allows people with less time to enjoy a route relatively quickly. Price per \u00a3/$ is'nt the best ,but that's probably what you expect from a visual novel. Getting this on sale is probably the best course of action if you wnt to pick this title up.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198045015711", "last_played": 1499486094, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 167, "playtime_forever": 786}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1499565692, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524625", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500354134, "recommendationid": "33391393", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ok, so... eh..... The game is far from \"Bad\", its just like the original story and all, but with removed scenes and censored ones... Which is what bothers me, like, way too much to be honest. I know it sounds like I'm a perv or something, but I hate having the censored version of something, it makes me feel like I don't have everything I should be getting. I know, it's weird, but not having the porn part isn't the problem, the problem would be more when they literally censored the bits with panties, which makes it so the text doesn't match the picture anymore! Seriously, I'm at the point where I have the uncensored gallery on the side and look up the pictures to see what they were supposed to be like! It doesn't make the game bad, just annoying to some point. I still recommend this VN, it can be quite funny and the art is pretty, just keep in mind that having the uncensored gallery with you would be a good idea if you want to see everything there is to this VN.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198115910585", "last_played": 1504578644, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_forever": 872}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1503889599, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512133", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1503889599, "recommendationid": "34543913", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you like a light-hearted rom-com VNs with feelings, I highly recommend Shuffle!\n\nAs somehow who played the original game years ago, I know exactly what to expect going in.  I know the twists, turns and so forth, I bought this game for the nostalgia factor and the 2 new heroines, and so far I'm really enjoying it.\n\nIf I have any problems it would be the really abrupt day-to-day transitions that may be jarring for new-comers who know nothing going-in and some kinda incomplete translations wherein the voice plays more what the text say.
