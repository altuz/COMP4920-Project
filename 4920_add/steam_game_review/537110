I really enjoyed the story. The gameplay can be a little strange when trying to run and turn, but otherwise it was fairly easy and simple. The characters are very loveable and each unique, if not all crazy of course. It would be neat to see a second game or something added on [spoiler] especially because I want to know what happens with Ray and Zach. Does he kill her after taking her, or do they end up living together or something? Like I need to know and need closure on that [/spoiler]. \n\nI suggest getting the game if you have the money to enjoy the story for yourself. Each episode was only a few hours long. The puzzles aren't too difficult, though I ended up having a little bit of trouble on one of them because I went dumb.  You have plenty of time for most of the puzzles and you save right before anything too crazy happens. The soundtrack is enjoyable as well and seems to fit well at most parts. I find myself listening to it every now and then. The soundtrack can be found in the games files too, which is nice.\n\nFor some reason I couldn't take screenshots during gameplay, so that was a little disappointing for me. Also when you download the game, your antivirus may want to delete some files, stating that the files are dangerous and it's trojan. Just make sure to exclude the game before downloading or if you've already downloaded the game, turn your antivirus off, then verify the games files. When your antivurs turns back on, allow the files it will want to delete when it asks for your input.\n\nThat's all I've got to say. Get the game. Play it and enjoy it. Also there is a manga under the name Angel of Slaughter (Satsurika no Tenshi), it's not Officially translated in English, and an anime adaption is in the works. So once playing the game you can get excited for that. Anyways I hope to see a second game or a finale conclusion to the story (as I stated earlier) because to me it still needs a little something extra there at the end.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065701619", "last_played": 1504079496, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_forever": 404}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504103789, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500620", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504103789, "recommendationid": "34609354", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "BEST GAME EVER\nZACK X RAY BEST SHIP EVER!!!!!!!!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198408542749", "last_played": 1503013587, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 320}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1501553654, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499912", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1501553654, "recommendationid": "33940267", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
