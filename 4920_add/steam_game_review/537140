There's just not enough content here.  There's 1 hero, 1 boss, and 1 stage.  That's it.  You can either play against the AI or against another player.  \n\nWith the boss, the world looks very small.  You swing your arms wildly about or grab the hero.  You can destroy the platforms the hero can jump on.  You slowly but surely dwindle the hero's health doing all the above.  However, there's nothing really fun about it.  I mean why can't I grab the hero and toss him in the lake?  Or grab hero and drown.  Or grab hero and keep pounding into the platforms?  I mean you can do it in-game, but you won't do any damage.  At least let me breathe fire or something.  The AI is stupidly bad.  I never lost and I wasn't even trying.  You can only attack in a frontal cone.  \n\nThe hero can jump, attack, or lay mines.   You use the controller.  You avoid getting grabbed or swiped.  \n\nAfter a 3-4 playthroughs, you'll have done and seen everything you can do in this game.  That'll be about 7 minutes time.\n\nRate 4/10 in the current state, this game should cost $1.99 because that's how much entertainment value there is here", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "last_played": 1505786903, "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505789229, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505789229, "recommendationid": "35056758", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
