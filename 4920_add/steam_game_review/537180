It's very simple yet very complex. I only play it casually over the past few months. I would compare it to playing WoW but only as the hunter. I haven't done any end game stuff as I just keep levelling up digimon instead of levelling just one. I have at least 20 of them and just about all are above level 40 because as soon as you hit file island you have a free pass to essentially take your higher level digimon and turn in the quests as a low level digimon. Easy way to get them levelled up quickly. I would reccommend this to anyone that enjoys mmos but doesn't neccessarily want to have to invest all their time to enjoy it.

After a while, I stopped enjoying it. I enjoyed Digimon in the past, but, man, the grind game is real here. Say you found a spot where you can get a Digi-egg drop of your favorite Digimon. Now, spend about 2-3 hours to drop at least 3 of those eggs. Next, if you haven't done so already, grind specific data to hatch the Digi-egg. For the amount of data, it all depends on the egg. As for the time... difficult to gauge, but longer than an hour for around 30 data. After all is said and done, it's time to try to hatch the egg (the most nerve-racking and rage filled portion of this event). With regular egg drops and not those bought from the Cash Shop, you can very well lose the egg on your first attempt of hatching it. If you get the egg to level 3, you're in a decent spot. I say decent because it's the lowest you can hatch your Digimon at, which is most of the time under 100% of its full potential. If you want better than decent, pray to RNGesus that the attempt to level 4 doesn't break your egg. To get your egg into top tier, try your luck at level 5... Actually... just... no... slim to none chance of it actually reaching there... And that's just one thing that grinds my gears. If your Digimon aren't strong enough, you're gonna have a hard time advancing. Even your starting team (minus your starter) are below their full potenial, so doling out a lot of damage is difficult.\n\nTo sum up a poor rant, head into the game if you just want a huge grind fest.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198125503372", "last_played": 1485172284, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 63, "playtime_forever": 9213}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1486275239, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511201", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1486275239, "recommendationid": "29711237", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "i couldnt get into it\nkind of a boring mmo in my opinion, i would say just skip this one even if you are a big digimon fan\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071073421", "last_played": 1483421170, "num_reviews": 86, "num_games_owned": 453, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1485113497, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500345", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485113497, "recommendationid": "29429365", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "to many scam all bot, not even able to hunt koromon :(\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198137382625", "last_played": 1487313046, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_forever": 4049}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1485841828, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499863", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1485841828, "recommendationid": "29599105", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "nice", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198318820795", "last_played": 1479641302, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 0, "playtime_forever": 33}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1486991420, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502416", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1486991420, "recommendationid": "29899107", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I think ive played enough of this game to give a decent review \n\nThe game its self is so nostalgic because i grew up with digimon and its really diffrent from mmos like WoW and all the others because your not the one really fighting its your digimon all you do is control his digivolution and skills but when you reach mega form you become really OP and all the stuff you can buy with real money is so cheap not like WoW where everything is like 24$ most of the time its 5$ \n\n\nOk so there was the good stuff about the game now on to the bad stuff\n\nEgg system the way you get other digimon fu***** sucks you sit there for 2 hours just to get 1 classic agumon egg and to make it harder you need data for the digimon type if it dragon type dragon data and you need to use it 3 times but each data input is like 10 thats why is use the cash shop\n\nJogress like what were you thinking devs and why make it that if you want a permanent jogress you need 700 reward coins so thats like what you need to play for over a year and theres a series of torture quests just to unlock one jogress like omegamon \n\n\nbut other then that i vote this as a must play \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198083298194", "last_played": 1495703987, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 67, "playtime_forever": 1617}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1488125028, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501836", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1488125028, "recommendationid": "30199505", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "know what? i love playing this game until certainly there's GM coming to me when my brother was playing it. and just like say u're using bot and banned for 7 days (when actually i didnt). its just like WTF lol. but well i dont really enjoy it that much anymore.\n\nmy review for this game :\n1.
