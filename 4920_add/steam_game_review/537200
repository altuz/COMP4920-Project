But the I started to find the bugs...\n\nIt has potential, it reminds me in some ways of PixelJunk Monsters, which is my favourite tower defense game ever.\nSome nice incentives to play since you need to upgrade yoru towers and skills.\n\nBut then reality sinks in.. A classic example of a game that can't possibly have been tested properly. Or the bugs have been ignored. Or the port to mac is horrible as with many other games? I don't know, but read below.\n\n-The story line is filled with grammatical errors. Not a distaster.. but Im not even native English speaker and I see them left and right.\n-The gold extra gold you can get by chopping trees seems off. Some levels I get such a big amount.. it's like a walk in the park.\n-Same with the gems. it feels like yo ucan get a lot. I guess not a lot of effort went into balancing the game.\n\nThen the absolute dealbreaker for me:\n\nYou have some skills you need to buy with gems to use and 3 skills that are on a cooldown.\nOne of these skills is lightning, which is ver ystrong and has a longer cooldown then the other 2.\nNow I discovered the cooldown visual effect is there, but in reality there is no cooldown. You can spam the 3 skills like a madman.. So that just takes the fun out of th game right away.\n\nFor me this game is a waste of money and shouldn't be allowed on steam. Sadly, because it looks like it has potential, but devs that release this kind of game.. I have no hope for any fixes any time soon.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198026217829", "last_played": 1478799578, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 71, "playtime_forever": 460}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1478800150, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511460", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1478800150, "recommendationid": "26522260", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
