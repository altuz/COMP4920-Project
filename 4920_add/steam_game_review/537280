Oddball title aside, this game is fun in short bursts.\n\nHowever, despite me enjoying the game, I'm not going to recommend it. Why? Because although it is cheap and a great time-waster with a solid concept and execution, it feels more like it should be a mobile game than a Steam game. Yes, I am aware that there are other mobile games with a Steam release on here but on this occasion I feel that it should be kept mobile. Plus, it feels unfinished, more like a beta than the finished product.\n\nYet even though I don't recommend it, there is a decent soundtrack and it executes its simple concept well.

For a low low price of 63c i could be the owner of a game as marvelous as this.\n\nHaving quickly purchased and installed the game i launched it to find a helpful little unity settings window that held my hand and guided me into the game. Thankfully my laptop had an inbuilt 970 otherwise the default and only graphical setting of \"Fantastic\" may have caused a less worth machine to falter. I was also prompted with a tab called screen resolution which contained no less than 21 ascending iterations of number x number. Being the mathematical whiz i am i pulled out my toilet notepad and proceeded to answer all the questions from 640 x 480 to the difficult but achievable 1920 x 1080. I still do not know why it asked me these math questions but it did indeed fill the time for me as my rear end began to extrude its first log. \n\nClicking play I was immediately presented with a menu filled to the brim with features and buttons that I just had to press. Excitedly I pressed the first button i saw marked \"Exit\". This promptly exited the game, a trap i see that the developer has added in, that from the very game menu you are pitted against the game with only your wits and a cursor. clicking on the application once more i was yet again greeted with the unity settings window where i yet again wrote down and completed no less than half of of the math questions again until i realized that it was the same list as before. With me feeling just like my graphical settings, fantastic, i pressed on and clicked play again.\n\nThis time i would not fall for their elaborate ruse and proceeded to explore my surroundings before clicking on anything again. After a longer look i realize that there are only 5 buttons on the menu having checked for hidden ones thoroughly. It contained the aforementioned exit button along with a simple and effective mute button, long since the days of needing an audio slider, i prefer my games either muted or blaring obnoxiously at me. There are also 3 buttons near the bottom representing the difficulties being \"easy\", \"hard\" and \"hardcore\".  Being the adventurous person that i am, one part of me would have gone for the hardcore mode instantly but i more wise and conservative part of me knew that i was not ready for such a feat. \n\nClicking on the easy button i was whisked away to a 3d plain of persistently forward acceleration in an octagonal tube. At the bottom of the tube lay a yellow ball whose trajectory matched that of the camera. Together we moved forward in this tube as a white panel proceeded to come towards us, an obstacle I thought intuitively and attempted to dodge the foe. Two things happen that to this point in time I have no idea why it happened. Firstly, I tried dodging right by pressing space, secondly the game crashed. Thinking this was just a coincidence I relaunched the game, forgoing the math challenge this time and started an easy game again. This time trying the wasd keys then the numpad keys then the mouse buttons then F1 and F7 keys. Nothing seemed to work until a rather violent exit of excrement force my hand upon the arrow keys where upon the octagonal tube rotated along with the ball itself. Knowing the controls I set about to demolish this game. Evading the white walls like I evade women in public I swiftly rotated the tube where upon at a rather slow pace the ball followed along. This continued as the game became faster and faster until a white wall inevitably broke my seemingly amazing streak of 6. \n\nWith a confidence never felt before by me I brought out my toilet fedora and ruffled my neckbeard and returned to the menu and clicked on hardcore. Last night\u2019s mountain dew felt like energy in my veins as the speed caught me off-guard and I nearly fell to the first white wall. But this game was no match for me. Having survived an astonishing 23 seconds on the harder difficulty in super hexagon, I was a god to this game. I continued and slaughtered my previous record with an amazing performance of 9 walls dodged. \nStarting another game, I rested my off-hand onto the front section of my laptop and accidentally pressed the space bar. The game exited and I felt myself emotionally confused.  Having finished my excretion many minutes ago I still felt the urge to relaunch the game and play on, but I knew in my heart, if I were to continue playing this game it would be the end of me, no game out there could even compete on the same level as this. It would encapsulate me and truly overcome me. What would my guild members think, or my 4 chan group, or even my neopets. If I were to continue playing this game that would all be gone.\n\nSo I sit here still on the toilet many hours later contemplating my situation. A game as brilliant as this has changed my life forever, the immense value, the savings. It is too much for me. But it was still worth it.\n\nThe soundtrack was alright and my a$$ hurts from sitting on the loo. 5.2/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053730509", "last_played": 1478091700, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 151, "playtime_forever": 56}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1477148742, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480321", "votes_down": 19, "timestamp_updated": 1477148987, "recommendationid": "26164919", "votes_funny": 59, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I have a GTX 1060 6GB & get 15fps on 720p. otherwise, might be an okay game for 50 cent", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065318870", "last_played": 1477202305, "num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 186, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1477202317, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477511", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1477202317, "recommendationid": "26176689", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Existence Speed is Pretty Cool and Very Cheaper, Probably", "received_for_free": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198144259935", "last_played": 1504179173, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1490133382, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497417987, "recommendationid": "30659170", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "There has to be some stuff added to this game so I can review it as recommended :\n1- There has to be option in the main menu lead you to exit from the game.\n2- There has to be option to change the difficulty after \"dying\".\n3- There has to be option that you can return from the difficulty  you have chosen to the main menu.\n4- Add some more background that we can play without getting blind from it , in other words , some backgrounds that are  comfortable for the human eye\n5- maybe updating the main menu to something is modren .\n6- There has to be Trading card and achivements in this game like : getting 20 score in difficult mode , etc\n\nFor me , this game is enjoyable when I Challenge my friend trying to beat each others score , otherwise , It's kinda boring game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198198580467", "last_played": 1504949609, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 26, "playtime_forever": 453}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1498584403, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498935725, "recommendationid": "32866187", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
