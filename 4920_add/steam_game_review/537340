First off the controls are so bad they might as well start a political debate. A easy way to describe them is that you can only go one direction at a time. Like if you turn left you stay that way until you turn right, and it takes a long time for it to calibrate it forward, but by the time you are forward little Jimmy's legs are back at the checkpoint. Second off, the game runs very laggy. Not at a stop motion level but like just under a perfect amount. And it has a habit to increase the lag even under the least bit of in game action. Thirdly the game just looks plain bad, even for a early game. The levels look like something for a Seinfeldspitstain video, and they have a problem were you can just drive off course and go on forever until you fall of the map. Overall, don't but this game just spend those 10 dollars on TF2", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198353598559", "last_played": 1504377362, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_forever": 69}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1504396985, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501062", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504397225, "recommendationid": "34698417", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "3D Happy Wheels.\n\nDoes it get any better?", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198149753673", "last_played": 1499665542, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 73, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499842228, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501705", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1499842228, "recommendationid": "33473154", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Bloody hilarious!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198037818477", "last_played": 1498397323, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 577, "playtime_forever": 33}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500210420, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497252", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500210420, "recommendationid": "33584525", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": " 3D happy wheels. it fun gory and awesome", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049690209", "last_played": 1503602500, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 242, "playtime_forever": 95}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1502479585, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502646", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1502479585, "recommendationid": "34175269", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "too many ketchup explosions", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "steamid": "76561198406374906", "last_played": 1506182339, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_forever": 130}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502992674, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1502992674, "recommendationid": "34312131", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "its bored", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198211219009", "last_played": 1499944710, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 20, "playtime_forever": 156}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499779087, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477422", "votes_down": 14, "timestamp_updated": 1499779087, "recommendationid": "33455755", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
