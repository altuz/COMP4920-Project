Nothing could change my life on any spectrum, as much as JumpBall has changed mine. I don't know where to start on this. The graphics are greater than ANY VR game out there. I challenge you to try to find a game with better graphics than JumpBall. And the music, oh the music! It's as if a symphony has blessed my ears. The gameplay, it's eons beyond anything we have right now. The plot is truly stunning. It's better than CS:GO, TF2, Terraria, or Geometry Dash's plot. It truly moves you to another level. All of the characters have a touching background story of how they have met the master ninja. I can't even imagine how much training they've went through just to meet their Master. The artwork for this game is as if Leonardo DaVinci, Giovanni Degrante,Michael Angelo, and Wolfgang Mozart have come together to paint something to be remembered once the sun dies. Every gamemaker or corporation should try to imitate the creators work. He doesn't deserve a lowly title as the creator. He is my god, and he is everything I aspire to be. If there were ever a point to mark in history, it would be the day this game was released. This game is beyond perfect, this game... is creation itself. To cover everything I've said, this game is the greatest investment I have ever made, the graphics; stunning! Plot? Touching. Gameplay? Astonishing. Artwork? Beyond our age. Music? Blessing. All in all, you should really buy this game.

Many good laughs are had with both the ridiculous concept and execution of this gem. And when you get it on sale it makes the purchase that much more justifiable.\n\nThis game is a tremendously moving social commentary on the current state of Corporate Balls, and the struggles of the middle-class ninja. Each ninja represents a member of our capitalist society clambering to be successful and live the Balls Dream, only to be shoved away and sat upon by another of their fellow ninjas. The balls represent the economic food chain, in which those who are weak are crushed by those who have become mad with power and influence.\n\n10/0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000001", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198137137702", "last_played": 1482023729, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 84, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1482024031, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494366", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1482024031, "recommendationid": "28437463", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "what the fick", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027180717", "last_played": 1498528497, "num_reviews": 200, "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_forever": 94}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1496668860, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493862", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1496668860, "recommendationid": "32198884", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "jumpjump jump 8 ball corner pocket\n\ntis game is mildy ok\n\nbarely positive\n\nkkk", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198379467405", "last_played": 1497359931, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 10, "playtime_forever": 2207}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1497325828, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497325828, "recommendationid": "32380155", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Veo que tiene comentarios negativos, pero digo, el video y las imagenes lo dicen todo, absolutamente TODO, solo es saltar en el momento indicado, no mas.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197980209697", "last_played": 1496955367, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 118, "playtime_forever": 367}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1498268766, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498268766, "recommendationid": "32706025", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This quickly became a favorite at parties.
