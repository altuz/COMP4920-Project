It's obfuscating and frustrating gameplay turned me off immediately.\n\nThe game tells you nothing whatsoever about the game itself, the story, the character, why you're doing what you're doing, the reasoning for the monsters, not even the start is explained. I liked mystery, but this felt like...laziness.\n\nI was expecting a Wadjet Eye Games style of gameplay with tight writing, logic and reasoning but in a horror setting. It fell short of that by a country mile.\n\nIF you want a horror point and click adventure check out The Charnel House Trilogy.
