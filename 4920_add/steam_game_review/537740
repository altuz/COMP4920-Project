Simply put its difficult to master however the satisfacation you get when it all comes together and ends in that goal is a feeling that no other football game has created for me. Many times i have wanted to throw my controller in frustration and many other times i have punched the air in celebration when a well crafted move has come off. The great thing about this game is that everything you do whether its a pass, dribble, tackle or goal is a creation of your own idea. You want to play long ball... you can... want to play the passing game... you can... want to run past four or five players like ronaldo... you can... or maybe slice open a whole team with one perfect through ball... you can! It takes dedication to be that good and the game does have a learning curve. That is what makes this game great. Make no mistake this game doesn't hold your hand and playing the best players will feel like a lesson in itself however thats the challenge, be at one with the controller and allow your instinct to guide you. One analogue stick and one button pretty much does it all and that is all you need... simple right? Play it and find out what your really missing.

The game itself is slick, plays smooth and is fast - comparable with kick off 2. However, there are a limited number of options, there is no coin toss so you always play going up first, no wind, pitch, time selection. Joystick options are non existent. My 2 player game is greyed out. I have a competition pro Amiga joystick plugged in via an adapter that I cannot use. The game itself mentions just one button to do everything? Thats misleading because without an Xbox controller you can do nothing. ie you have to press X for menu at start of game, A kicks ball, B goes back - I could go on... Also, no instructions? really? Substitutions - cannot find out if you can or not. You can change the formation of your team though! ( It does not say how?) Took me a couple of minutes to find out. Referee - yes there is a referee but not actually visible on pitch, no linesmen either - shame really. In essence, I have an Xbox controller plugged in and a competition pro plugged in. 2 Player option is greyed out? Cannot figure out how to configure keyboard controls - if at all possible. The game needs some refinement ie options for controller and definately some instructions for controllers - how to change formation etc. So would I recommend the game? Yes, because of the price its an absolute bargain - for people that have played and mastered kick off 2. If you have never played Kick Off 1 or 2 or Player Manager on 16 bit machines you will really struggle with the game.
