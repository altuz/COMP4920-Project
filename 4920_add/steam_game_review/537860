First of all, in the options menu, an accidental click sent the sound bar in the options menu (the volume control bar) WAY off the screen.  It's like there was no thought process about how users might interact with options.\n\nSecondly, the sounds themselves get old VERY quickly.  Not like \"an hour or two\" quickly.  I'm talking about a matter of waves in the first level.  And the music is just BAD.\n\n2)  Gameplay\nThe game has several, VERY OBVIOUS design flaws.\nThe first: There isn't any balance to the towers.  Generally, towers are meant to be geared towards certain types of mobs.  Faster firing towers handle faster moving mobs, and vice versa.  However, in this game, there is a breed of zombie that moves faster than most projectiles, so most towers end up missing.  Even towers you'd expect with an instaneous hit, like snipers or teslas or simple \"gun\" turrets, miss, and miss often.  This results in an incredibly frustrating experimentation with towers, only to find that they're all gonna miss.  Thus, the fast creeps are likely to ruin your life early.\n\nSecondly, there isn't even a modicum of a story line, there's nothing to explain the how or why, and there's nothing to keep me interested in the game.  It's a very simple, overly so, map with mission markers.  There isn't any sort of \"after action report\" or anything to let you know the results of your game, or any reason to come back and try a harder difficulty.  There's no reason at all.\n\nThird, I accidently clicked new game instead of continue, and it erased my previous game.  Just as simple as that.  With no ability to retrieve it.  Incredibly bad design.\n\n3)  Application design\nEvery time I boot this game, I have to start it first, alt tab out of a black screen, kill it with task manager, and start it again before it will properly boot.  What's more, I get this weird second process under the same name popping up in task manager sometimes.  I don't know what to say, other than, \"Why is this happening?\"\n\nNow, I've played some tower defense games in my time, old school and modern.  You can't cover up bad game design with an \"Old School\" moniker.  They are not synonomous.  Avoid this game, even for 50 cents.  I'll let the developer keep my money as a punishment to myself for buying it without seeing a proper review.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969919209", "last_played": 1476268279, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 787, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 73, "timestamp_created": 1476268861, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602266", "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1476268998, "recommendationid": "25995494", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[h1]Did i just bought someone's homework?\nYes[/h1]\n\nI can call myself a fan of Tower Defence games, but this one isnt something i would recommend.
