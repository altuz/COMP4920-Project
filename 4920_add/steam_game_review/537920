It feels like a  wierd pulpy action-packed cult B movie. If Werner Herzog and Laibach came together in like the late 80s to make a video game, this would be it. This is something a little different. \n\nIf you like hard challanging heart pumping games you might just get a kick out of this game and the price is definitly worth it. This game is a hell of a trip; in a good way. The developers obviously did not focus on the graphics, like at all, but boy is this game a load of fun. The game mechanics are pretty simple but super fun! Its a shoot-em-up with some rougelike elements. There are a bunch of different weapons, you can pretty much use anything as a weapon; fling bodies, catch incoming projectiles, spam every weapon, this game makes you feel like a badass god while still being extremely challanging. The deeper you get the more the game surprises you.  It isn't polished at this point and the UX for switching weapons is quite clunky, but the actual fighting mechanics are a blast. This game will probably not be for everyone but if you can look past the graphics, wanna try something a little different, and have some action packed fun give it a try. Plus its called \"Supa Kila Monsta Hunta\" which is my new all time favorite name for a video game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197980443185", "last_played": 1477031061, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 496, "playtime_forever": 72}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1477014702, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506074", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1477014702, "recommendationid": "26138516", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "At the moment you start the game with a table full of destruction in front of you.

Bought it because I heard it had an asymmetric mode to play with friends, but we couldn't get that to work in any meaningful way (outside the second player controlling the VR player's body, which is instant naseua).
