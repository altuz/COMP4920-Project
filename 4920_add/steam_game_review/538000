You're only getting one song per purchase). Music is very subjective so I won't say too much about it other than it's pretty decent. Nothing I would personally put on my MP3 player but it's a good listen just for the VR concert aspect.\n\nKisekiteki Shining (Song 1) - This is a decent up-beat pop song but the design and effects are the weakest of the three. Most of the song just takes place on a single stage, though there are changes in the second half. The major drawback, though, is the few times you're assaulted by bright white effects. If you've used VR for a bit you know that getting a lot of bright white thrown in your face can be literally painful and possibly nauseating. On the plus side, it's the only song that let's you feed popsicles to the girls. It's understandable that the design is the weakest since it was the first but if you're only interested in buying one song to test the waters, go with either of the following two.\n\nkissxkissxkiss (Song 2) - This song is the best if you want a down-beat song. The effects are a lot smoother than the previous song and the stage is constantly changing. There's also a surreal aesthetic to everything. It's the most different of the three.\n\nKimamani Summer Vacation (Song 3) - This was great. The best of the three if you want an up-beat pop song. The visuals are very pleasant and constantly changing. Watching fireworks from a flying train car was actually awesome enough to distract me from the girls. The girls are also very close to you in this one making the experience that much more personal.\n\nOverall, each song is only a few minutes of content and replayability depends on whether you want to listen to them multiple times or not. Personally, I love the idea of VR concerts and hope the medium takes off in the future but right now the pickings are pretty slim so it's a reasonable purchase if you're like me and just looking for VR concerts. If you're not, you probably won't be satisfied with the minimal amount of content.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053210555", "last_played": 1503214106, "num_reviews": 66, "num_games_owned": 297, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503026414, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503196093, "recommendationid": "34319962", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Good music video in VR 360. Works as intended. I had no noticeable problems. The graphics are cartoony. The quality varies for some reason between the videos but they were clear and viewable for me. The dev did a good job of creating various scene changes in each music video performance which made the whole experience more enjoyable. The girls stay away from reach most of the time but do come close in some parts and on the train they sit right next to you and have you hold their purse and stuff which was cool. This is a visually pleasing and colorful VR creative experience. You also have something in hand to stream colors in the air while the concert goes on if you choose. It shows what could be if someone takes off with this idea and brings in our favorite real life performers to do the same. But at the very least our anime characters can really come to life.\n\nVideo here below in 4k of all three presentations.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1127232786", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197974765747", "last_played": 1504417334, "num_reviews": 221, "num_games_owned": 477, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504454530, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474003", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1504454530, "recommendationid": "34715354", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
