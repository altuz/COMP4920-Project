I beat the game, which can be done pretty quickly, and I found the puzzles uninteresting. Also, objects in your hands frequently fly out of your hands and are nowhere to be found. There's a constant line going from your hand to the center of the room, and I don't know why. It's very annoying.

Visually, it's great. That's it.\n\nThe \"puzzles\" are few and simple, and barely functional. The way you interact with objects leaves a lot to be desired as well. Holding the flashlight and it brushes the wall? That's dropped. You have the grip of a recently awakened comatose patient in advanced stages of atrophy. Even simple things like placing a key into a lock are done poorly. There's no animation or sound effects, you just wave the key into the lock and the door pops open. One of the puzzles requires you to strike a surface multiple times, and each time you do, the object you're striking it with falls out of your hands. Awesome.\n\nAs for the art: as I said, it looks beautiful. It's horrendously optimized though. I'm running a 1080ti and had literally half of my frames being reprojected with 0 supersampling. I do mean literally, OpenVR advanced settings had the reprojection ratio listed as 48.6%...on a 1080ti. It says min spec is a 970.\n\nI can't recommend this game. Even if it were free, the poor performance, lack of rewarding puzzles, and short gameplay would make it a pass. At $3 it's not worth it. I do like the art syle a lot, though, and if the developers can work on the gameplay elements, I'd be happy to check out their future stuff.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197968185841", "last_played": 1502138836, "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 361, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502139361, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502139361, "recommendationid": "34089474", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "My video play through:\nhttps://youtu.be/TH7SKa6Teu0\n\nA good value for $3!\n\nI\u2019m not sure if they require a large play area or not, but I kept bumping up against my chaperone bounds.\nOccasionally the game would stutter during play.
