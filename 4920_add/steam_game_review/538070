And those gave more of a sense of solitude and \"coma\", actually. Probably due to being minimalistic in everything: art, ambience, soundtrack.\nFor example, the \"memories\" episode. [spoiler]The presence of Death off screen felt more creepy, rather than when you meet her in person.[/spoiler] And the kid's doodles, like, just what kid would draw his dead dog in such a grotesque way? Small game \"memories\" conveyed the emotions stronger.\n\nI also miss the appearring dead birds on the bridge from the demo. The feeling of creeping doom was stronger, making it closer to the original small games.\n\nI think \"Coma\" is too strong for the title, it's more about a nightmare though. Specially when seeing you character falling asleep like ordinary.\n\nNon the less, it's a good game on it's own, with an interesting concept of changing the world depending on your decisions to several endings.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198045141963", "last_played": 1498929391, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 136, "playtime_forever": 576}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503939932, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495999", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1503939932, "recommendationid": "34557604", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
