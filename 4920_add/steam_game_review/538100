And by soothing, I mean slow.  Even while holding down 'run' your guy moves slow AF, and not only that, it takes up energy to run.. so eventually your bar runs out and you have to walk even slower until it charges back up.\n\nAnother annoying factor, is the slow factor.  Wait, didn't I mention that already?  Well guess what, when you chop down trees, and 3 pieces of wood appear, you have to slowly pick up all 3 pieces of wood individually.  It's not like a fast-click, like in Stardew Valley, no.  This game is crazy slow.  \n\nThe last thing that bothered me, was the lack of evolution of your sprite.  I built wooden armor, a shield, and a sword, but the sword and shield never visually show on your character unless you swing your sword or click the 'defend' button - the wooden armor didn't visually show at all, and that was disappointing.\n\nMusic also got repetitive.\n\nThat being said, I think a lot of people seem to like this game, and maybe it's for you!

Hopefully it will bring a lot of great new content. I'm hoping to see some of the following elements in the future:\n\n- A fluid skill tree, allowing you to invest more than 5 points in each skill.\n- More sandbox features, like customizable characters, more home decorations.\n- Improved combat system. (The combat system is great, however, as a mage I suffer if I'm battling a creature from the side. It often misses. That's why I always try and place myself above or below the creature. Also, I can only shoot in 4 directions. N, E, S and W. It would be good if I could also shoot NE, SE, SW and NW. It would greatly improve the combat experience. I have the \"Attack in cursor direction\" ON.)\n- I'm hoping to see a better online experience. Perhaps an official server, perhaps let people run their own public servers using IP addresses. (similar to Minecraft)\n- More weapons. I'd love a mage staff, there are bows and swords for the archers and warriors but the mage class gets no such privilege. Would love to also see more classes develop. \n- PvP. Perhaps zones for PvP, perhaps just an option to turn it on/off.\n\n\nSo far, this game is loveable and endearing and it FEELS complete to me, regardless of the oodles of room it has for improvement. Its multiplayer gameplay is primitive, if you want to keep a server public indefinitely, you'd have to leave your computer running for just as long. The Toys are a really nice touch and do impact the game for the better. (if you don't know what I mean, I guess you just need inside information to understand. Buy the game and see for yourself.)\n\nIts community is small, but you can change that yourself by simply being part of it, be nice and tell your friends if you like the game.

Just from that, you're sort of fine, except shift to run is pretty hard on the pinky. However then later in the game you need two or three more buttons for special abilities, one or two buttons for potions, and you just start to run out of space for your left hand.\n\nAs for your right hand, DST allows you to move with the mouse, you can't do that in Feel The Snow but you still need to use your mouse for crafting and other things. You could bind special abilities and potions and simialr to your right hands keys (jkl etc), but then you'd be switching your hand between mouse and keyboard, because the mouse isn't really optional.\n\nAnd this problem has the potential to get worse with updates. If they add more features (for instance different weapons which you're encouraged to switch between mid combat, they already have that actually but...) rather than streamlining things, the button overload could get even worse. It's already confirmed that they're adding a fourth ability for each tree.\n\nFour abilites works in league of legends because you can move with your mouse!
