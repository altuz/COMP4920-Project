Ive played many tower defence games and this one isnt a bad game. Its  a challenging game with several different biomes to play in. But must say the varitey of enemys is lacking. Their is only one music track which btw isnt bad. The price is deffently worth it. I give Raging Titans  a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Ps Graphis are pretty decent for a unity game . Two Tumbs up!!.And almost forgot their is a leader board that keeps track of ur scoring with other online players.

Until after a couple easy and moderate levels I discovered a very limited and unbalance game. Tower ranges are poorly designed or maybe its the maps? Some towers on some maps can only be placed so close to the action, which is just barely in range enough to get off maybe one shot. \n\nPitiful economics and difficulty balancing. Even for a verteran of the genre and being one who welcomes a challenge, I found this TD game to be mediocre at best, and frequently more annoying than fun.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198365022292", "last_played": 1486987114, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_forever": 230}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1488718045, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496942", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1488718045, "recommendationid": "30336530", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
