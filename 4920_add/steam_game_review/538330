I could not complete the demo because the puzzles were too hard, and I accidentally unplugged my HDMI cable during the video! Oh no! I'm a VR escape room aficionado, though, so will try to 'wing' it. The demo room is featured in the screenshots. It was alright. Everything in that level was a bit dark/gray and the overall graphical presentation is a bit muted. The other room you see in the screenshots appears nice and cozy, so overall, everything looks fine. Considering the price and likelihood on bundles and sales, this game is a positive entry in the genre. I like the promotion and work put into the lock picking systems, although I didn't understand how to do one of them. [spoiler]When I was a youth, I hacked the password mother put on the computer. Her hands were wet you see, and I was able to figure it out! It was 'Lock'.[/spoiler] http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=896713121", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961017729", "last_played": 1495335559, "num_reviews": 236, "num_games_owned": 2716, "playtime_forever": 90}, "votes_up": 28, "timestamp_created": 1504114935, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.379058", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1504114982, "recommendationid": "34613998", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
