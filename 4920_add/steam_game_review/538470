Either this is a scam as I reference below or the dev is incompetent. In either case, do not buy this poor excuse of a game. I wouldn't buy it for $0.01. I got refund.\n\n******************************************\n\n\n\"where the story has a fundamental role\" <- I spent 30 minutes trying to find the story or find anything to justify holding off giving this game a negative review, but I just couldn't do it. Remember the Windows 3D Maze screensaver from Windows 95? If so, then you have already seen this game. The best I have been able to determine, is that this is a maze you blindly run around while a woman slowly walks after you and if you get to close, you get screamed at then promptly start over.\n\nThere is little to no game options. Based on the limited options, grammar of the game page and half-assed game play, this strikes me as a foreign throw together in attempt to only get money for 15 minutes of work.\n\n\nTo the developer:\n\nIf you feel this review is harsh and I have missed some crucial part of the game that would change my mind, then please let me know. I will be hanging on to this game for another 2 days before requesting a refund from Steam. You have until then to show me the error of my ways.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994851983", "last_played": 1476857668, "num_reviews": 34, "num_games_owned": 539, "playtime_forever": 30}, "votes_up": 53, "timestamp_created": 1476858695, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585905", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1477419947, "recommendationid": "26111267", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "4 of the 5 screenshots on the store page are of the area you spawn in at the start & the 5th one is the first room you spawn into in the second area which is where you realise you've paid $15 for a dark maze game.\n\nI already don't really care for maze games, I like them even less in the dark (you get a flashlight which illuminates about 2 feet in front of you, it is barely tolerable). \nThe environments in the maze (that I ran around in for about 15 minutes before giving up because there didn't seem to be any environmental clues as to which way I was meant to be going) were uninteresting, which is why I mentioned the store screenshot selection at the start, I don't think there is much of interest in the rest of the game.\nThe busted wooden floors, the lockers closed & open, upturned tables were just repeated through corridors at random, so \nit all blended together into a blur of me not caring anymore & waiting for the jumpscare to kill me. \nThe Pineview Drive guys did a good maze in Obscuritas, it gave you environmental clues so you could tell you were on the right track, it was subtle an unobtrusive but you had a clue, so you weren't just getting more pissed off at another corridor that looked the same. \n\nI triggered the jumpscare about 5 times in the 15 minutes I played, the store says there is a story; I didn't find it.\nIt also does the thing which is worse than headbob where when you sprint it is more of a exagerrated drunken sway but while sprinting, that doesn't even sound like a good idea for a camera when you write itt down, so I'm always surprised when I see it.\n\nBasically, $15 maze game, no.\n\n*like the other reviewer says, if I've missed something, if there are clues & it isn't just nonsense maze running where I'll just stumble on the story because of luck; then I'm happy to buy it again & experience it.

I did give this game multiple tries but kept turning around in a maze. I ended up at another door that would not open. I strongly believe this game is scam like the other reviewers said.\n\n\n\nIn this game you need to escape a maze with little to no indication of what you have to do. After a certain time the screen goes red and a lady pops in your screen screaming in yours ears (very annoying scream that can damage your ears srls). Is this how you treat people buying your game.\n\nReviews are all right even at 2$  this game is not worth it. Graphics looked okay because of the unreal engine.\n\nThe character animation is terrible and gameplay is the worst.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3oSSVgdsq8\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDEV U WASTED MY TIME< YOUR TIME < STEAM EMPLOYEES TIME < GAMERS TIME <  FOR A SO-CALLED PERSONAL GAIN< IN THE END I BELIEVE THIS GAME WILL BE REMOVED FROM STEAM AND YOU WILL GET NO BENEFIT FROM IT.\n\nTHANK YOU GABE NEWELL FOR REFUND POLICY.
