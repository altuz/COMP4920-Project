Of course the game doesn't tell you any of this, even if most of it is easy enough to figure out.\n\nPerhaps the worst among the failures of this game is that its just plain boring. After about the 3rd person you've pretty much seen it all. The \"scirpted events\" are just vaugly ethically related multiple choice questions that don't seem to have any real impact. Earning money is pointless cause its not like you DO anything with it.\n\nOverall this is a bad game.
