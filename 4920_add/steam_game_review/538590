I feel like Sleeping Valley developers have a lot of nerve launching this game to Steam at this price. If this game was free play I wouldn't feel so compelled to write a negative review warning new players not to buy this game.\n\nControls are awful, you can only move and jump and both perform pretty bad. When you jump and move while in the air you just move at constant speed at that direction instead of slowly losing force which makes it very hard to aim for small platforms. Stages are generally bad and combined with the horrible mechanics the gameplay is rubbishy. It is also full of bugs, sometimes you lose checkpoints and have to start at the beginning of the stage again and my second run lasted 5 minutes because it bugged and sent me to the final screen directly. Above all, the Red Sea stage is also bugged, in the game trailer you can see how groups of rocks fall from the sky while I ensure you that in-game the Read Sea is a nightmare where rocks are launched everywhere extremelly fast giving you no chance and being just a matter of luck that you pass the stage.\n\nI encourage you to read reviews of other users about this game and you'll find long negative detailed ones that complain abouts the same things I do. There is only one little thing that I know for sure I will remember about this game positivily: during the bugged Red Sea stage one of my friends watched my broadcast of the game. He watched 20 minutes of helplessness and impotence as I died once and again. He watched how my hopes of overcoming the game slightly disappeared in the unfair bugged Red Sea, where only luck mattered... But, after 30 minutes of swearing, rage, despair and pray, the Goddess of Fortune took pity on me and let me pass tha cursed area... I died a few obstacles forward and the game respawned me at the beginning of the Red Sea. My friend died too, but from laughter.
