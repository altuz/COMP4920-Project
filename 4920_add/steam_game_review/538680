By recruiting optimization modder Durante to actually provide optimizations and post launch support, Xseed has proven that PC porting isn't as expensive or difficult as major publishers like Square Enix pretends it is. On top of optimizations are PC exclusive features like Turbo Mode, an FOV slider, and autosaves. Xseed and Falcom are proving to be the CD Projekt RED of JRPGs, and their games happen to be of that quality as well.\n\nAs with every Trails game, this game is just as phenominal as the Trails in the Sky trilogy was. It's one of the only JRPGs I could ever immediately start a NG+ on minutes after the credits roll. The characters are well written and fleshed out, the world is meticulously handcrafted to be unique and interesting, and the major story beats sets up the incredible sequel very well.\n\nThis is an excellent game to get into the Trails franchise. It was designed with newcomers in mind, yet still retains everything veterans love about the franchise. The amount of quality hours you can put into this game makes the full asking price worth it, and all purchases of this game is directly making a statement about what PC JRPG players want out of their ports.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000709228", "last_played": 1504317281, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 618, "playtime_forever": 4479}, "votes_up": 37, "timestamp_created": 1504800643, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557265", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1504800643, "recommendationid": "34797400", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Masterful:\n- PC port is perhaps the best port of a game from inferior hardware so far\n- K+M controls\n- turbo mode\n- the only jRPG I played where english voiceover isn't cringeworthy\n\nGood:\n- leveldesign\n- fishing minigame capped so fish doesn't respawn endlessly and you can't grind it\n- quite a few bosses are challenging on your first normal playthrough (if you won't abuse arc craft)\n- story twists\n\nAlso good, but Trails in the Sky has much better:\n- characters, villains, drama and general story progression\n- music\n- quartz system, there is no \"sepith tetris\" in Cold Steel\n\nBad:\n- grinding is necessary for $, achievements and leveling links/masterquartz\n- many optional and all hidden quests are timed\n- graphics is just a bit better than decade(s) old Gothic\n- cooking is not RPG skill but is fixed and you cannot improve it\n- pixelhunt for fishing spots and smashed boxes' loot\n- the concert event sucks, they should have made it better\n- loading savegame from here in the sequel (not ported yet on PC, expected by the end of this year) doesn't give buffs only for all sidequests/hiddenquests finished, it also checks for your level which you need to grind up then \n\nAtrocious aka fire from industry whomever decided to put it in this game:\n- swimming minigame which is worst QTE fest I've ever seen\n- pay2win DLC (bait gems that summon a trashmob that grant tons of XP)\n- NG+ is necessary to complete masterquartz collection and to see all of the most interesting bonding cutscenes\n\n\nOverall, the game is good, just not as great as Trails in the Sky was. For example Trails in the Sky discouraged grinding. ToCS encourages it.\n\nToCS in IMO above average game, but it's inferor hardware roots didn't do it any favor, I can't call it a musthave game.

I have about 80 hours clocked in on the ps3.\nWhat can i say? I buy very few games on retail price even less so when i already own them on another platform, but this game is truly something else.\nIn a world littered with flashy rpgs like Final Fantasy's which prefer style over substance, this game truly stands out above them all. Not just this but the entire Legend of Heroes series, though talking about them all would derail this review.\nWhat this game shines at, is its world building, the story takes time to unfold, you are gradually filled in how this fantasy world works.\nYou have a stellar cast of characters. None of them feel like placeholders, each person, each supporting character has a unique story and background defining them. \nThe characters traits may look cliched but when executed perfectly they shine through and through.\nYou get to live a school life not entirely dissimilar to Persona, you do quests, you go out exploring the world, you get entangled in political and civil unrest, explore the country of Erebonia and its heirarchy system, uncover a dark conspiracy, trust me, by the time you're done you'll be left wanting for more, which is a good thing cuz the sequel will be coming to pc in 2018.\nPlus the pc version is THE definitive version. Upgraded graphics (I seriously love the effort they put in the launcher, each option shows you a screenshot of what effect it has on the game) , turbo mode allowing you to fast forward cutscenes and battles (Wouldnt recommend doing the former) and about 5000 extra voiced lines exclusive for the pc version.\nNo japanese audio though, but the falcom server on discord has an unofficial japanese audio patch with instructions that you can use.
