Visually it's good looking, gameplay isn't so tight, and terrible weapon handling where you need to keep the grip button held down to hold your guns.\n\nLook at the other review dates and how long they've actually played, that's a key indicator for making a buying decision. All those stellar reviews and those players have abandoned this game after an hour. That's the reality, this isn't a good game, the first impression quickly fades to reality and you'll never play it again. But you'll keep it installed for years in the hope it's updated and fixed. Good luck with that.\n\nI get annoyed when people thumbs up bad games and say it has a lot of potential which leads to folks making poor buying choices. Well potential is meaningless when it doesn't reflect the 'real state' of the game. I can see this game could be good, but it isn't. It's either good or bad. It's just bad.\n\nIn summary, development has exceeded the ea time by a very long time with no meaningful updates in that time. There's little actual game variety and gameplay is quite flawed and not enjoyable. The video and screen shots reflect a game that looks much better than the actual experience.\n\nMy advice don't bother even if it's on sale, even when it's super cheap to try and entice you like a venus fly trap. I believe you will be ripped off, hence this long review to make people aware. Gamers should look out for each other, it's not a cheap hobby.\n\nPut your money towards Raw Data.
