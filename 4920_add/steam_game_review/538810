Below is my opinion of the game.\n\nPros:\n- You can learn a lot about diesel, electric and steam trains\n- There are 75 missions in which certain parts in the trains are damaged and you have to repair them. That allows you to get to know different parts of your locomotives.\n- Beautiful open world in which you can drive around in your own train to pickup damaged trains along the tracks.\n- Earning money to spend on upgrading the workshop keeps things a bit more interesting.\n\nCons:\n- All 75 story missions combined will be finished after about 6 hours.\n- The open ended gameplay after finishing the campaign consists of repeating random missions you already solved before. Some randomly generated faulty trains would have been way more interesting here.\n- You have three different workshops for the three types of trains. The functionality however is the same in all workshops. Makes it seem a bit pointless in my opinion.\n- The driving behaviour in the open world section of the game is horrible. Tight corners with high speed? No problem at all!\n- Some translations seem to be wrong or inaccurate.\n- Some parts like main connecting rods aren't fastened with any screw at all, For other parts like the  notorious lights in the steam engine you have to remove four seperate screws. This gives a wrong sense of importance for certain parts.\n- At some point, improving your workshop doesn't seem to do anything. The success chance of repairing some high end items does not increase above 66% and stays that way regardless whether your workbench is at level three, four or five.\n\nAll in all the game is fun to play if you like technology and learning a bit about trains. I bought it at 40% off for about 9\u20ac and don't feel like I wasted my money. Just don't expect to play it for weeks.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197982850115", "last_played": 1505313079, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 313, "playtime_forever": 375}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505314348, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505314348, "recommendationid": "34921014", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
