Hold a button to activate the movement of a limb and use the joysticks to move those limbs, with this game just removing the ability to use your legs; a perfectly nice concept. However, after playing the first 3 levels, it became infuriating difficult. I got through levels 1 and 2 of the story mode pretty quickly, using my joystick to move the arms upwards and grab at the red rocks. Even loved how [spoiler] some of the rocks and the ladder fell in level 2 [/spoiler] (put it in spoilers just in case). Whenever I got to level 3, though, the controls became extremely awkward. With holding down on the joystick not moving the arms towards the ground and having to be touching the object you want to grip to, the level became a giant mess, not to mention [spoiler] the electric wire making you have to time movements [/spoiler]. If the controls were better, this level would've been much easier, but due to the game being in a 3D environment, the control scheme doesn't work well for ground crawling, especially with the gripping system.\n\nI feel like if you can get past the control issues I mentioned here, the level design and level quirks are pretty nice. The spoilers contain quirks for levels 2 and 3, and I bet there are a lot more in the later levels. However, I personally feel that, especially for games like this, good controls can make or break the experience. Want a game that can make you rage but still has fun level design? This is a pretty good candidate. Other than that, for the casual gamer, this is a definite not recommended from me.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198239826158", "last_played": 1502241557, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_forever": 14}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502242424, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1502267636, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1502242424, "developer_response": "Game was originally ment to be controlled only with mouse, which works pretty well. Joystick controls were requested by the community so I decided to add them as a small bonus. \n\nClimbing with a joystick is definitely harder and more complex, so I can understand your frustration. It is something like a \"hardcore mode\" of City Climber. Mainly if you do it on your first playthrough.\n\nMaybe try mouse and see if it feels better? \n\n Thank you for your review and I`m sorry about your negative experience !\n- Ondrej", "recommendationid": "34115750", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "worst game in the world. There is one fatal flaw that makes this game worthless. THE FACT THE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO GRAB ON TO SOMETHING! I know that's the point of the game, but the the way it works is: if neither of your arms are connected to a ledge, wall, or post, you fail. the game stops you in your tracks and makes you restart. When I bought this game, I expected to be able to swing around freeley in a semi-open world. I didn't expect to move one arm at a time like a game of chess! The multiplayer is even worse. the co-op mode has each player control one arm, which means each player has to sit and wait like ten seconds at a time for the other person to grip something before they can even try. not to mention, the controls are awful. there is also a multiplayer \"party\" mode where the players once again, take turns falling down some stairs or something. Because the first thing I want to do in a party is watch my friends  awkwardly try to move there little noodle of a character around to grip something. don't buy this game unless you want to inflict psychological torture among your friends, who will probably insult you for buying such a terrible game. If the developer is listening, please fix your game, instead of the one at a time rule, add a death barrier  on the floor or something so I can maybe try to catch myself, make it a the floor is lava type thing, and make the multiplayer, well, multiplayer. It would be hilarious to have two little noodle guys holding on to each other for dear life whilst dangling over a cliff or tower. This would be one of my favorite game if these features were added. But until they are, DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!! it sucks!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198125318923", "last_played": 1499906498, "num_reviews": 34, "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_forever": 19}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499907836, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491612", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1499907836, "recommendationid": "33492536", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
