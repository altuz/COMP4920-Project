A fun action clicker that will eat up some of your time untill you get used to the difficulty.\n\nBy no means is it an AAA masterpiece and a Game of the Year material, but honestly, you could spend your money way worse. Fiery Dissaster delivers what it promisses - fast paced action with a pinch of strategy and resource management (in regards to your regular attack overheat metter, upgrades, or even unburnt ground that damages the enemies more the first time your lava plume lands on it, etc.).\n\nI honestly don't know why somebody would find it not reccomenable for people who are into such games. One reviewer says he/she doesn't see the point of this game. Well, for the most part, the purpose of any game is to be fun for the player, and Fiery Dissaster is fun (again, if you like such games). Another one says it's not really tower defence and strategy. Well, while agree it's not a full blown strategy game, neither is Bejeweled and it still has the tag. There are different flavors of strategy, and this game is one of them. Also, it's not a tower defense game? Then what the hell is it? You have a tower (volcano), and you defend it. You don't build stuff apart from getting upgrades, but of course it's a tower defense game! Also, if you check the instructions box (or play long enough, which the negative reviewers didn't apparently), you'll see it's actually a bit more complex than meets the eye. Hell, it even has two player mode!\n\nOk, rant over.\n\nIn regards to technicalities, again, they're fine. Simple, but neat, 2D graphics and OK music and sounds (apart from the overheatting noise - goddamn, that's annoying. Fortunatelly, you can turn it of in options). You also get a well made intro and a dark-ish plot about everybody getting crazyier and crazyier as the story goes, that also serves the purpose of introducing new upgrades. Wickedly fun. Also, the game is polished. We all know what \"gems\" one can get from Greenlight, and this game shows that the creators at least gave a damn. I haven't had any critical errors, gamebreaking bugs or anything like that. In fact, I don't think I've had any trouble with the game whatsoever.\n\nAs far as I know, this is the studio's first game. This means not everything will be perfect, of course. Apart from the overheating sound (I know, I know, it's just... damn, I guess the creators and beta testers were good enough not to hear it constantly, like I did) and OK graphics and sound (again, enough, but nothing too fancy) there are some things that show their inexperience, but nothing too bad.\n\nMy issues/advice for the creators:\n- why is it called Arcade mode when it's basically survival? You could avoid at least one negative review if you called it that, so that people don't click first to check gameplay. \n- The color of unlocked missions and locked missions is the same on my monitor (the former should be white, the latter grey I guess, everything white-ish for me).\n- Arcade mode has no description \u2013 the first thing that appears after clicking it is the choice between single- and multiplayer and then leaderboard. It just begs for an introduction like \u201eWelcome to Arcade (coughcoughSurvivalcough) mode. Here, you have to try to survive for as long as possible. Note you should play Campaign first to get to know the mechanics etc. etc.\u201d\n\nAnd that's it. These are my biggest gripes with the game. Which can telly you one thing \u2013 the game is polished enough that I had to grasp at straws to find something bad to say about it thats not \u201cderp, I haven't even checked the video introducing the game on store page and it's not what I thought, 0/10\u201d, which, honestly, is silly. \n\nAll in all, I heartly recommend the game for people who like both action and tower defense. The game is fun, you can see the developers have potential and work hard to make it as good as it can be.

I didn't hate it enough to ask for a return.  If I manage to stomach it long enough to be surprised, I may edit.\n\nWhen I see the Strategy tag, I expect it to be a major part of the gameplay from the start.  I don't see any in the first few levels.  It's not campaign-promise level false advertising, but it's certainly a major letdown for me.  Maybe they slip actual strategy in later, but so far I feel like I've been invited out for Indian and served a burger.  At no point will I feel less cheated if the deep-fried oreos for dessert are served with chai.  \n\nThe ad claims \"Epic cinematic music\".  Shenanigans.  It's ok.  It doesn't detract from the gameplay.  It's far better than the tinny crap that makes some folks wax nostalgic.  But Epic and cinematic?  Don't compare yourself to Michael Giacchino if you're outclassed by Bon Jovi.  \n\nEnough about what it isn't.  Here's what it is:  Bad guys come out.  You throw manually aimed fireballs at the square you think they'll be in by the time it gets there.  You get doubly punished for missing, both on the score and because if you shoot too often, you overheat and can't fire for a few seconds.  The rate at which enemies spawn is faster than you can shoot w/o overheating.  You're going to take some damage without near perfect accuracy (maybe even with it).  That may change if you get farther in, but the first few levels are almost pure whack-a-mole.  Except whack-a-mole doesn't punish you for swinging too fast.  It's tough, fast-paced, and very early you find yourself fighing on multiple fronts.  \n\nIf that appeals to you, great.  Give it a try.  For the price it seems like a good deal for folks who like what the mechanics acutally are.  Just don't expect \"Strategy\" or \"Tower Defense\", at least not in the first few levels.  \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027744312", "last_played": 1481085948, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 314, "playtime_forever": 19}, "votes_up": 17, "timestamp_created": 1479271913, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522359", "votes_down": 12, "timestamp_updated": 1479271913, "recommendationid": "26625406", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game seems pretty nice, if you're into tower defense games - you should definitely like it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007955797", "last_played": 1478898114, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 125}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1478898264, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493135", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1478898264, "recommendationid": "26544687", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "this is not tower defence.. and not fun..", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063368177", "last_played": 1487454457, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_forever": 9}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1487454612, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1487454612, "recommendationid": "30019487", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Arcade mode is terrible, played it 8x and could never even get far enough to buy even one upgrade.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042066229", "last_played": 1479675903, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 209, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1479675959, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488528", "votes_down": 13, "timestamp_updated": 1479675959, "recommendationid": "26721137", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I didn't really find the point of this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198088348711", "last_played": 1479413408, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1480710205, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473048", "votes_down": 16, "timestamp_updated": 1480710205, "recommendationid": "28146328", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "just nope...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198128885210", "last_played": 1499873513, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 695, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1499873628, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499873628, "recommendationid": "33482206", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
