It must be because I have played almost 100 hrs and still very much enjoying it.\n\nWhat I like about this game is the freedom to build as you see fit, experiment with different starting positions.\n\nGraphics are superb and the accompying music fits in very well with the theme of the game.\n\nI love the diversity of the buildings too.\n\nIt's a slow game at the start but it gets extremely entertaining the further you progress.\n\nYes, there are still some bugs but the dev is very keen to receive feedback so he can fix the bugs.\n\nThe dev is very comitted to this game. Nice timely updates and hotfixes too.\n\nFrom the Roadmap there are lots of additions on the way. What a great game this will turn into and I can see myself building up lots of many hours in Sugarmill.\n\nIf you like this type genre then this is a must game, not only because it very playable and with a unique setting but it has a dedicated dev behind it.\n\nIts improving all the time so there's lots to look forward too.\n\nEnjoy Sugarmill and what it has to offer.\n\njd", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1097, "steamid": "76561198365283425", "last_played": 1506940356, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_forever": 7172}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1505813814, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505813814, "recommendationid": "35061149", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is really promising.\nAnyone that like building/management games will like that.
