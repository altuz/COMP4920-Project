This is one of the first games I purchased for the Vive when it was first released and it quickly became one of my favorites.   It's someone short and simple but very interesting and you could easily spend hours playing.\n\nThe developers just updated this game on July 4th, Freedom Day, and because of that this game is not dead.  I for one am extremely excited to see what the future of this game holds for everyone.  I hope people who gave negative reviews because of the inactive development will change theirs to refelct that.\n\nBuy this!  10/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198099283936", "last_played": 1482277127, "num_reviews": 44, "num_games_owned": 631, "playtime_forever": 56}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499648561, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484467", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1499648561, "recommendationid": "33419042", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
