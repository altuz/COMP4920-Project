The green lead target indicator is an amazing addition and great help when introducing a new person to the sport. It nearly halves the training time required to start competing. \n\nOne thing I will say, is you absolutely must get the gun controller. The HTC vive controller by itself is a bit too light to be used for real training. Thankfully they offer the gun controller which makes the game a perfect solution for shotgun training.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198386684617", "last_played": 1501026505, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_forever": 659}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1494769791, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1494769791, "recommendationid": "31748737", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
