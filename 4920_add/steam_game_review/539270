The menus are slow to respond and hyper-excessively animated. The menus pop out at you which is fine once, but hour after hour of play it becomes a real headache, plus the excessive animation slows down game play. The game is designed around playing online where each score is shared with your friends. If you chose to just play yourself you still have to deal with the same screens about posting your score over and over and over and over. Click on not posting your score and it asks for your name again and again and again. \nThis game needs to scale down the animation and work on speeding menus and overall performance over purposeless animation.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198317820924", "last_played": 1502503482, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 749}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500461914, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505466", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500461914, "recommendationid": "33649140", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
