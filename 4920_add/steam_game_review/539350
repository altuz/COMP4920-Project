Don't get me wrong, the game's bad, but it's not the worst thing on steam.  It's meant to be a simple ball platformer where you go from level to level. However the camera angle is very worthless and unchangeable from what I can tell, the movement is sluggish and hard to manage, the levels are long with no checkpoints and force restart, the score is meaningless and indecipherable, etc, etc. Wouldn't recommend this game at all, but it's not as bad as everyone says.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057990658", "last_played": 1495909173, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 411, "playtime_forever": 945}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1495971427, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517817", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495971427, "recommendationid": "32017909", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I bought this game because i had a 75% off coupon for it, so it only cost me a dollar.
