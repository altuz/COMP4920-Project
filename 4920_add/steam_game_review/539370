As it stands, you have a two minute test after which your performance is evaluated and you get a letter grade. I'd really like to see this developed into something more engaging, be it a Papers, Please style slow reveal, or something comical like the old John Cheever story about the radio.\n\nI'll note that the game is wonky sometimes, with \"good\" solutions flickering between two video clips and the sound jittery. This seems to come and go. If your game doesn't look and sound like the gameplay trailer, try a reboot. Or do what I did and just wait several months.\n\nRecommended even so.
