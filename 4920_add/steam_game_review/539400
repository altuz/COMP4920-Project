A more difficult, more skill / less variety spawn of Binding of Isaac and Castle Crashers. Since the game is still in alpha there are only 4 levels, but to get there takes a learning curve and is very fulfilling. \n\nWould definitely recommend at either it's $14.99 on sale, $19.99 normal price or even if it were higher.
