Citalis falls flat though; It has boring mechanics like the arbitrary need for \"beauty\" and water - which are not resources, they're build-it-once and forget. And it has pointlessly punishing mechanics like the need to \"lock\" a water resevoir before it overflows, when the water is never consumed so it's just a little mini-game while it builds. The lack of interesting game mechanics result in a tedious and boring game.\n\nFurthermore, once you reach a certain level of success, the game does not push you to build a bigger city. The loan payments, the only way to lose the game, cap at $12,000, which means that building a city bigger than that will guarantee the win if you wait about ten minutes.\n\nCitalis could have been so much more - the idea is okay, but the execution falls flat. I bought it after it was recommended by Extra Credits, and it wasn't worth it at all.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198031998170", "last_played": 1499562788, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 216, "playtime_forever": 227}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499563316, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508145", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499563316, "recommendationid": "33390706", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
