It is comprised of three mini-games, and none of them make any sense.  One gives me a gun that I can't seem to shoot anything with.  The next expects me to jump up to an unknown destination, but then I die when I get out of bounds.  The final one at least lets me blow stuff up, but I just sit at the bottom of a tube and never get anywhere.  There are no instructions to explain what is expected of you, the controls are unfriendly at best (A and D to move, space to jump and the mouse to shoot?) and not very conducive to a game that can require precise movement.  They aren't even configurable.  I give the other two folks that posted reviews credit for spending multiple hours with this game, because after a couple of minutes I was ready to delete it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043364750", "last_played": 1484969168, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 204, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1484969758, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518056", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1484969758, "recommendationid": "29389067", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A very interesting 8-bit game.
