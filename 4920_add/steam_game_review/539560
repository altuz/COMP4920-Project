Controls take a bit of getting used to (especially as HUD is minimal) but as you get the hang of it, it starts to feel very satisfying. Would be great if there was the chance to race against AI, hopefully that will come in the future. Probably not for everyone but if you want a racing experience with a difference and have friends to play with, give it a go.
