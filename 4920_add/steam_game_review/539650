That game held my heart to an outrageous extent. After the game finally closed all it's servers, I was looking for another martial, Asian inspired game that allowed progression, farming, interaction, and over all a good story. I picked up 12 sky 1 not long after and from there began another long term relationship. I have played 12 sky 1 and 12 sky 2 (MaynGames), and I could not be any happier to hear that this game is now on steam. This game is truly worth the countless hours of game play. If there was ever a good mmorpg game that I would recommend to any one, 12 sky 2 is most definitely in the top 5 games. This is a MUST PLAY!
