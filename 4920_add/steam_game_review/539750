First of all you can't change to a windowed mode.  Alt-enter will give you a window but the game doesn't resize so it's unplayable like that.  Highly annoying.  Second, there are two modes, your basic levels and they unlock the timed trials.  Sounds like a lot of puzzles.  Nope.  Same ones.  To make it seem like there are more puzzles the dev duplicated the original levels to make a new mode allowing you to time yourself.  Why couldn't that be in the basic leveling mode?  If the puzzles were different and you had to complete them under a certain time frame, then okay.  But the same ones and only seeing what you time is to beat yourself is bogus as a separate mode. \n\nAs a puzzler, it's okay.  I'm not hating it as much as some others I've played, but it's not really oodles fun either.  I'll finish it off and it won't be a chore, but not something I'm looking forward to either.  Graphics are a bit too crazy and annoying.  I've just turned the sound completely off.  If you really want it, get it on sale for at least half off.  Then you don't hate yourself as much for getting it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198355036865", "last_played": 1501348761, "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 550}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500210181, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505768", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500210181, "recommendationid": "33584437", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
