It features 8-bit art (with a bit of modern cheating) and music which harkens back to arcade boards like Pac Man and Dig Dug, with the modern flair afforded by progressive technology and design. It feels like a Game Boy game being enhanced on the Super Game Boy; this comes from its customizable SGB-like border, in the presentation of cutscenes, and the simplicity of its colors and shapes. It doesn't chain itself to the limitations of the past, though! It has beautiful but simple parallax effects, comical detail (just wait until you meet Biggie Frost!) and clearly distinguishes between over a dozen enemies through color and function.\n\nUnder the hood Space Cat contains simple and intuitive mechanics, which combine into a deceptively challenging experience in Adventure Mode (the hot young star of the game). The titular hero Space Cat can run, double jump, cling to walls and jump from them, attack enemies with his claws, and use a jet pack which recharges fuel when you are on the ground. He can also choose from a few items littered throughout the level: a melee-range hammer to deflect bullets, a gun to shoot enemies at range in four directions, or an umbrella to slow his descent. If you plan to see Space Cat through to the end of his adventure, you'll need to learn to do it all.\n\nLevels scroll automatically, which adds both tension and difficulty to the experience. Instead of being able to rush past enemies, you have to deal with them, at least for a short amount of time. Some enemies are beyond reach, others are hiding in the background and waiting to pounce. Then at the end of each level Space Cat must learn the mechanics of the unique stage boss. None of the levels ever feel unfair, because the way forward is clear and there is milk spaced throughout the stage that space cat can use to recover his health. The bosses can be stressful because if you die, you have to start the whole level over. But I was never frustrated with the game for anything but my inability to complete a level.\n\nOn the technical side, this game is far from perfect. On more than one occasion keyboard inputs were dropped, but it thankfully never made anything impossible - the versatility of the character makes it easy to work around this. There are no control customizations, so multiplayer on a single keyboard is tough, and not all controllers are supported so you will need to manually map controls to the given keyboard controls. There is also no netplay, so if you want something like that you'll have to get REALLY creative.\n\nEven with everything I've highlighted, there's so much to this game worth praising:\n\n* A traversable menu, where you move Space Cat around to access its modes and customizations\n* Like 100 unlockable hats\n* A 2-player basketball game and a playable game in the credits menu\n* Arcade mode, with all the same mechanics present, formerly known as Space Cat 1.0\n* 4-player local co-op or competitive play in adventure and arcade modes\n* Stage Select mode after you beat the adventure for the first time\n\nAt the end of the day for the content, price, and the care and dedication put into it, Space Cat is a lovely gem for arcade enthusiasts, indie lovers, and nostalgia hunters alike.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019782747", "last_played": 1505185084, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_forever": 728}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1504563175, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504563175, "recommendationid": "34744991", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not only is Space Cat fun, but it's also creative and innovative.  I dont know of any other game where you're a cat; trying to \"strike it rich\" on an astroid.  It hits me with the arcade games nostalgia, just because of the way the game makes you feel.  Its colors and sound are such a huge element to the game.  I love the most recent patch too!  The new patch made the game more customizable, which is always a nice thing for a game to have.  If you like classic arcade games, give Space Cat a try; its beautiful.  Another reason, Its good is for people, like me, who play a bunch of FPS and indie survival games; its a nice change of pace.  I truly recommend this game... Although there is one thing Im not a big fan of.  Im no game developer, but for PC gamers who want to play this game, there are two choices pretty much.  Classic mode and giant mode.  All the other ones are CO-OP only.  Maybe its going in the direction of consoles, but people on PC still like to play it too!  PC gaming isn't meant for couch CO-OP, so its hard to get those game modes going.  As of right now I don't think there is an online multiplayer, which is bad for PC gamers.  Its too hard for four people to squish together around a keyboard to play a game.  And to most PC gamers, controllers are a pain to set up and deal with.  Maybe down the road there will be one added, but still its a pretty fun game.  If you decide to buy it, I hope you STRIKE IT RICH!!!.

This update adds so much to the original game, on top of the classic modes, there is an updated hub area, hats, basketball, changeable soundtracks (at the time of this review, only a few are out) and most importantly, an adventure mode. \n\nThis mode has 8 stages that are very much like classic side scroller bullet hells, except with the mechanics from the base game, allowing for some fun mobility. The jetpack opens up the option of avoiding enemies, and in the later stages, its sometimes better to do just that. There are a few weapon choices, but they work differently from each other, allowing for smarter play once you get the handle of them. Finishing the adventure mode gave me the same feeling that beating Dark Souls for the first time.\n\nThe designs of this game, from levels, to enemies, to the music is fantastic. It's the kind of fun you'd get from turning on your NES playing Mega Man 3 or Castlevania as a kid. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198020735792", "last_played": 1504137223, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 280, "playtime_forever": 403}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1503884516, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503884516, "recommendationid": "34542972", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Simply put, Space Cat is a fun and challenging NES-inspired, Arcade-Style platformer.
