And I love fashion!! This is the second game for Angela and the first on steam. The story is fun and easy to follow even if you start with this game (Although you can know more about Angela's background from her sister's games Delicious Emily)\n\nBeing a fashion designer was Angela's dream, and what is better than joining a reality TV show to persuade her dreams! You'll get to meet Angela's best friends Jenny, Kitty, Virginia who I liked so much because each has a different personality. The game is story heavy as the other games introduced from the same developers, Delicious Emily and Heart's medicine. This one is centered around dreams, love, sacrifices, challenges, jealousy, betrayals and above all, friendship!\n\nI loved the pace of the story and the characters involvement, it was so entertaining to play through the whole game. The plot twists were really good and didn't expect them coming. \n\nPros:\n+Beautiful graphics.\n+Cool characters.\n+Good music\n+Smooth game play.\n+Steam achievements.\n\nIts a time management game with a story, I suggest you to check a video before purchasing the game and also check the other games from the same developer. Gamehouse games are like a big family, most of the characters you'll see them taking a part in the other games and their relationships/connections are amazing! They are all fun to play! Been a fan since 2008.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071375554", "last_played": 1493583308, "num_reviews": 64, "num_games_owned": 1062, "playtime_forever": 661}, "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_created": 1498639895, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555453", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498639895, "recommendationid": "32921245", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
