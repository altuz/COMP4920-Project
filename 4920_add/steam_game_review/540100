I find it is best played in short bursts when one is wanting to take a short break from other tasks (chores, work, etc.). \n\nIt supports online multiplayer and local multiplayer (up to 4 for either), and is best enjoyed with friends. It is a cooperative screen-defense game with rogue-light progression and minor competition (someone becomes a demon if you take too long to beat a level).\n\n The gameplay itself is best compared to \"Super Mario Bros. 3: Battle Mode\" from the SNES. Add in a crystal that you have to power up (as a team, or solo) to advance to the next stage, and you have this game described in a nutshell. If you don't like that style of game, then you likely won't like this. \n\n I picked it up during a sale, but I do think the USD price is justified. The base game itself is fun in a casual-setting, but replayability at the moment is small once you manage to clear the last \"world\". There are five worlds, and what feels like ten levels within a world before being advanced to the next world.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043555355", "last_played": 1502493283, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 106, "playtime_forever": 420}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499525140, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498569", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499525140, "recommendationid": "33376281", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "As the developer friendly asked me for a review, here we go:\n\nThis is a very short-lived game where you hack and slash a lot of monsters to get enough magic power to progress to the next level. It is probably best for short breaks. I wasn't able to play the game for a long time because there was only one keyboard-layout which used the z key. With a non-US keyboard, you were not really able to play the game. The dev, however, added a second key-layout which made it able for me to play it. Thats nice!\n\nWhat i like:\n- The drawing / pixel art is nice\n- Sound is good\n- Easy to understand and play\n- It is veeery cheap\n\nWhat i don't like:\n- It's a bit of a \"highscore\" game. It's quite pointless, you are doing the same thing all the time with increasing difficulty. Not my personal flavor to be honest, but then again, it was 1$ or so.\n\nI did not try the multiplayer, but local co-op may be a lot funnier than solo play.\n\nCan recommend it for people who like short and simple games, good for a break", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960837317", "last_played": 1499024614, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 615, "playtime_forever": 19}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500744010, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492427", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1500744010, "recommendationid": "33725559", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game is very repetitive and does not explain anything.
