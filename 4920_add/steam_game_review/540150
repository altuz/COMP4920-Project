IMO the best in the series so far and especially good as it covers a subject that most games usually ignore; the blitzkrieg years 1939-40, You can run campaigns for all the important combatants too, the Germans, Poles, British, French and even the Italians in the S. of France. There's a tremendous variety of historical unit types to play with ranging from tankettes, tanks, SP guns, personnel carriers, flamethrower tanks, trucks, artillery, AA guns, armoured cars, AT guns, mortars, hmg's, infantry etc. \nThink Steel Panthers and you won't be far off. You can zoom in quite close to see your forces and the scenery, though far from spectacular, compliments the battles and allows various tactics to be used. Each campaign is made up of several engagements and there are 3 difficulty levels.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198078773953", "last_played": 1481836629, "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 202, "playtime_forever": 204}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1481837317, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506603", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1481837317, "recommendationid": "28394376", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Hexwar is a very good game developer who really cares about the games they develop and they listen to the people who buy their games for feedback.   Tank Battle: Blitzkrieg is a pretty simple game to learn how to master and play.  The game has a pretty good tuturial to learn how to play the game. \n\nYou get quite a few different scenarios to play in the game.  Every scenario you play in is always has a different battle to play in and the battles are pretty fast pace to play through.  I really like the feature in the game where you can setup the game to unlock all the scenarios right away so you play through any of them. Each scenario usually takes about 15 minutes to half hour to play through.  I like these kind of games where you can just jump right in and play through each scenario in a short time period.\n\nThe game has a good zoom feature to zoom in on your units and the game also lets you adjust the game to fit your computer screen.  I also like how the music in the game fits each battle you play.\n\nIf you like this game then I recommend you try playing Tank Battle: 1944 and Tank Battle: North Africa for the PC.  They are very simliar to this game in gameplay.  I really enjoy playing those games too.  Keep up the good work Hexwar and keep making great games to play.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970510452", "last_played": 1490787352, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 133, "playtime_forever": 71}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1481418886, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1481419936, "recommendationid": "28300282", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It could be brilliant, and the gameplay is actually quite fun, but the maps are so ridiculously small, the levels so stupidly easy, and there's absolutely no depth to it.
