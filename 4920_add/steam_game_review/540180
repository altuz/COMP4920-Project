The fact that the last update happened on May gives me very little hope for the future of this game. Of course, something may have happened to the Dev, and i wouldn't blame them for it, but be aware of how regular the updates really are when buying this game by taking this in mind. With that being said, the idea is quite interesting, and although it did remind me of \"Papers, Please\", It offered what i think is a fresh take in the \"Be a government employee in a Dystopian Environment/Country\" genre.\n\nStill, i wouldn't recommend purchasing it now, not even in a sale.
