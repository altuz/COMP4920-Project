There are three playable characters, each with his own inventory and set of levels to complete, and finishing the game requires the player to complete all three paths. The game seems quite impenetrable at first -- the player will be able to accomplish remarkably little -- but slowly opens up as the characters accumulate items and solve puzzles.\n\nEach player begins with no method of defending himself, and the player will just have to avoid the monsters. It takes very few hits to kill the player, but death has few drawbacks; the player is returned to the world map with a loss of money, but keeps all items and puzzle progress that's been made, making death less frustrating than it otherwise would be, and encouraging exploration and experimentation -- key elements in a game like this.\n\nThere are two major problems with Vulture Island. First is that some amount of grinding for money is required; each of the characters will have to buy an item to progress, and this may result in the player having to run back and forth through levels grabbing coins (particularly the last item, which requires 500 coins to purchase!). More important than that, though, is that it's not always even slightly obvious how to use an item (the ball of twine and bug spray come immediately to mind), and that can result in lots of running about trying random things.\n\nThose flaws aside, Vulture Island is a pretty fun few hours. It's a pretty small concept and a short game, but it's charming and well-made, and it's not very expensive.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983828261", "last_played": 1478168782, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 797, "playtime_forever": 204}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1478169815, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511736", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1478169815, "recommendationid": "26397922", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Vulture Island, the way i've experienced it so far, is a light hearted and atmospheric adventure game that lets you explore freely and figure out for yourself how to go about solving puzzles and defeating enemies with four different characters you can switch inbetween as you see fit.\n\nThe game is good to control with keyboard or controller and you can also remap both of them, which is a big plus since the basic layout is not all that good in my opinion.
