After about 6 hours I'm just now on the 5th stage of the first of two Queendoms populated with only slim, light-skinned women. It may take you more or less time to get where I am depending on your ability to aim well, prioritize targets, dodge or repel incoming enemy missile attacks, and make good hiring and purchase decisions between onslaught waves, \n\nEach Queendom has 5 stages, and each stage has a minimum of four waves to complete. Scoring headshots regularly, and having high accuracy, will increase the amount of gold you earn each wave. There are a plethora of enemy models with unique attack types, movement, and special effects. \n\nI definitely recommend this game in its current state if you're looking for a bow and arrow shooting gallery vr game with a variety of enemy models and attacks, the use of roomscale for dodging or hiding behind walls to defend from incoming attacks, a campaign with additionial stages that unlock as you complete them, and a minigame which allows you to defend your castle with hirelings.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198003316479", "last_played": 1484120025, "num_reviews": 40, "num_games_owned": 455, "playtime_forever": 2946}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1479101824, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508359", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1479101824, "recommendationid": "26595275", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game has been an absolute blast! I see moba style games coming in the near future thanks to ideas that this game has implemented to semi-similar games of the overall same genre. Wave based, tower defense, upgradable weaponry, decent teleport system, and downright pretty. \nOh yeah, did I mention it's hard? \n(She told me so, but I had already been aware)\n\nI've been enjoying trying to figure out the best way to spend my loot in order to die in the most lengthy possible way. I've gotten to the centaur-type boss on level 6 once.\n\nI hope very much that this game gets a multiplayer mode with co-op and head to head, I want the bowstring to be closer to my body... maybe further away from the bow-hand controller is a better way to put it. I feel like I'm constantly trying to destroy endless waves of demons and constantly being trolled by an invisible, and slightly imaginary, bowstring. That bowstring is rude. \nThere is a bit of blur at a distance but for the most part I get it. I really think that this is due to our machines not setup correctly within control panel and the likes. I've fiddled with more settings and steamvr resets than I'd like to remember.  I am confused why fps can say it's hanging out at a balmy 60ish on ultra settings yet it doesn't appear to be the case. Maybe, this is merely it's interpretation of repro+fps or something else above my head (I'd put money down on the latter).\n\nTLDR; thanks guys! It's been super fun so far and I cant wait to see where this takes you guys.
