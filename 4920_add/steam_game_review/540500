Your ship can be equipped with different primary and secondary weapons, which will be unlocked for different missions in the campaign.\nMission and story descriptions are written and some parts have voice acting too. \nGraphics are very simple but still sufficient, the soundtrack is great and fits perfectly. \nFlight mechanics and dogfights are pleasant and challenging with increasing progress. \nThere are a good amount of options for e.g. scale, graphics, and ofc controls - HOSAS is no problem!\n\nRecommended!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994527111", "last_played": 1496185156, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 305, "playtime_forever": 145}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1496186917, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496186917, "recommendationid": "32073938", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Starfighter Arduxim has everything you want from a starfighter game, minus cutting edge graphics and an open world, but for this price, you can't pass it up.
