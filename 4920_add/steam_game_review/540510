Worth it. It was a great little 45 minute trip, which was the perfect amout of time for the installation. \n\nThere's no running, no jumping, just a little circling and a little clicking. It is very short, there's no replay value, no challenge, and no skill required at all. In fact, there are a lot of people who wouldn't even call this a \"game.\" I can't call that negitive, though. It's a series of brief interactive experiences. It's like being able to play with some wierd kenetic sculpture installation at a virtual modern art museum. Use headphones. It's not like you're going to hunt down the soundtrack and pop those tunes on at the gym, oh hells no. It's just that the ambient sound design really enhances the feelings of immersion and disorientation.\n\nYou'll probably only ever play it once, but it worth it the next time you need to wait for something else to install. \n\nAlso, for the first and (most likely only) time you play it, if you happen to have access to a quality dispensary, I highly recommended making a quick stop there, first.\n\nEDIT: I hadn't read any other reviews before writing this, and I just read a bunch right after I posted. The one thing that comes up, over and over (besides \"not a game\") is reviewers comparing it to an art exibit, or a series of sculptures, it's not just me after all. When you get a bunch of unconnected people say the same thing about something, that's pretty telling about what your experience would be like, as well.
