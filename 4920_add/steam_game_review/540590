I wanted to like this game, It looked like it was going to be similar to star fox from the super nes. The controls are the biggest issue, they simply dont work, engaging enemies is like throwing rocks out of a car on the highway, continually takes damage from \"crashing\" because you move to engage an enemy which is on the side of the screen, even in areas where there are no walls that you would strike. The enemies get destroyed but when attempting to retrieve your coins or \"power ups\" you will likely miss them or \"crash\" if you hit several enemies (which is what will happen the majority of the time) you are only able to pick up a power up from which ever one you fly through so you end up getting very few of the coins/guns/or fuel. Speaking of fuel hope you dont run out it is random to appear for killing enemies, so if you are low on fuel and dont kill the right ones, to bad. Power ups dont stay beyond one round (the ones you purchase) So if you waste money on a new plane it only lasts one level. Missles cost 5 coins, but kill only one enemy, I stopped buying and using them very very early. The game is very short. I was very frustrated all around with the game, it tries to be a bullet hell and a retro-style dog fighting game and fails at both. The bosses are bullet sponges with \"hit here\" before the battle prompts. the first boss is a large tower that shoots bullets constantly and you just fly in circles as the bullets pass you and yours hit every time and continue this for several mins. No chance to even get hit if you just keep moving. Outside of these boss battles it is no about movement as the plane's handles like a drunk ferret. Running everywhere and crashing into everything even if there is nothing there. sometimes you hit enemies when you fly into them sometimes you dont. sometimes you are surrounded by enemies on all sides and cant hit them because of there positions other times you have hit the 3 enemies on the screen and have a long corridor with nothing but your precious fuel running out. I have been waiting for this game for quite awhile and am really unhappy that it turned out this bad. I can usually forgive cheap indy games and find something to enjoy about it but this is so bad I wouldnt want to keep it for free. Stay away at all costs. 2/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040445146", "last_played": 1489722719, "num_reviews": 37, "num_games_owned": 629, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1489723833, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506036", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1489723833, "recommendationid": "30562605", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I like this game, good gameplay, good graphic, good music, but a little bit too short.
