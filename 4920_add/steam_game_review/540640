The sound track makes me tingle. The sounds in general tick a nostalgia that I haven't felt since the SNES, and early playstation era. \n\nPros: \n~ The characters are cool, and feel unique.\n~ The art is great\n~ Sound Track IS SO SO GOOD.\n~ Controls are tight.\n~ Characters are creative\n~ The writing is neat. If you go into it with the mind set that this is written by hip hop artist the disconnect is greatly appreciated.\n~ I love that almost every line in this game so far can be sung.\n\nCons:\n~ That being said this game NEEDS a lot of polish.\n~ I've killed monsters, and they'll die in areas that I cannot access so I cannot pick up whatever they drop.\n~ I was sad that I couldn't use my SNES USB game pad, and had to use a XBOX controller. I would like to see the control scheme get changed to something that I can select. \n~ The hit detection is really off some times. \n~ The shadows in some areas are just black so I was having trouble seeing where my character is walking. \n\nOver all I am liking what I am seeing, but It would be nice to see this game polished. I'd recommend it honestly. It's cute, and I appreciate all the hard work put into it. I am also biased. I love the genre, and anything that MegaRAN touches I treat as gold.
