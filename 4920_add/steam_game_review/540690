I found myself clicking through dialogue early-on, only to reach another boring battle. The story is written poorly and has tacky animation, coming off as an amateur flash game in the end. Further, there is hardly an RPG element to Hellenica, as the game offers little in the way of rewards to improve the characters and gameplay.
