It's physically painful to move gems around (mostly because you'll be bleeding from your ears - when the movement glitches and gems start to jump around like crazy, the game starts playing EXTREMELY loud sound at the rate about 20 times per second). Of course sound sliders in battle do not work, and the ones outside do not save their state, so your best option is to mute the game through Windows' volume mixer.\n\nGame mechanics barely exist. Developers copy-pasted the concept similar to Mobius Final Fantasy and a dozens of other games without even thinking about how it is supposed to work. Here you just have dudes with more attack+hp and dudes with less attack+hp. Tradeoffs? Strategy? Nah, of course not. Take dudes with less damage and feed them to dudes with more damage. And of course the UI will prevent you from doing any reasonable management of your dudes (no sorting, no filters, and the game resets the scrolling position of the list every time you open it, so the task \"sacrifice 5 useless cards I just obtained\" requires like 2 minutes of repetitive scrolling).\n\nAlso, pay2win elements were not properly removed from this port. Like in most p2w games, gold doesn't mean anything, and you can only buy meaningful things with donate-based currency (gems). They switched off the ability to buy gems for $$$, but did not provide any ways to farm them (you'll get a fixed amount by completing all the missions the first time, but you won't be able to really get anything with this amount). So, basically it's like playing pay2win without paying - painful and completely pointless.\n\nScore: garbage/10\n\nupd:\nJust to be clear: most of the positive reviews here are most definitely fake.

I enjoy RPG's with collecting and crafting as well as match 3 type puzzle games. This is like the hybrid of my dreams. I have not played another form of this (though my GF has been trying to convince me to play the mobile version but I do not like to play games on my iPhone). I'm about half way through the early chapters and it's very engaging. The first 10 missions were very easy (too easy IMHO) but it did build my confidence with how to use the skills, allocate the heroes, and really choose a good allies for the more challenging missions.\n\nThe graphics are very cute for a puzzle game- nothing spectacular but not grainy and blurry either. Pixels look good on my PC and it loads very fast. I enjoy the graphic configuration feature which pops up every time you start the game. It allows you to select your screen resolutions & graphics quality. This makes a big difference if you only have a small tablet PC like I do.\n\nThere is far more strategy involved in this vs. a regular Match 3 like BeJeweled. Here the heroes you use make a huge difference in how well the battle's go. It is exceptionally like Pokemon and I think adults who like Pokemon will love this game if they enjoy puzzlers. I enjoy the ability to fuse and enhance the heroes - this provides a level of customization you can apply to any hero you favor- and it's RPG based. I'm a leisurely player and don't rush through - I go back and replay older missions to get extra items to fuse with and I pay attention to the Heroes/allies information.\n\nOverall any gamer who enjoys games like Puzzle Quest and Puzzle Chronicles or other Match 3 games and RPG\"s must pick this up - it's addictive once you pass the early missions which are too easy. There is only one save file - but that's ok for me as the game is priced at a good point.

Boy I was wrong.\nThe new update patch with new graphics has totally transformed the game.\nI can\u2019t love it enough that developer has updated the game with cooler DRAGONS!\nMy inventory is now filled with cooler DRAGONS trading cards.\nI wasn\u2019t a big fan of previous dragons used in the game.\n\nI will continue playing and update my review soon.\nFor now, it\u2019s worth to say that:\nThis is a great game with tons of missions, solid graphics, anime-style scenes, and fun turn-based RPG combat. \nThe gameplay is challenging to a fault; sometimes the grind to beat all stage missions is a bit tiresome.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198052739658", "last_played": 1487598776, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 1361, "playtime_forever": 306}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1486892393, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500757", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1487323161, "recommendationid": "29868558", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Overall:\nVery Enjoyable I like the game a lot. I also like the fact that I can continue playing offline as well.\nThe characters really stand out throughout the battle! \nFun to see how the \u201clittle Goddess\u201d you had in the beginning grow up and evolve into \u201cfull Goddess\u201d.\n\nGems movement:\nI notice the gems movement is a little bit twitchy.\nHowever, it still doesn\u2019t break the overall fun in doing match 3.\nCompared to other match 3 game I have played, the gems movement in this game is still decent with some room to improve.\n\nBattle/levelup/team:\nthe leveling and skill system is very simple.\nYou started out with 25 diamonds in the beginning, which give you the ability to summon a \u201cfearsome\u201d hero and to join your team.\nYou can then pick other units dropped from battle to join your team as you progress.\nEach unit has its own special and attack skills that triggered by matching the right colors of the gems. \nEach time after winning a battle, the chosen heroes in your team will get a chance to level up. \nIn a few occasion after accumulating enough XP, your whole team will level up too.\nBattle system get very complicated as you progress further and unlock new chapters.\nIn later missions especially battle against the legendary dragons, one shot from the dragons will be sufficient to kill your team. It\u2019s very important to have your leader fully evolved and the right heroes summoned to help you out.\n\nFake reviews:\nI notice that some users are complaining about this. \nHaving bought this game from launch at 10% off and played for over 40 hours, I don\u2019t think some of the negative reviews are 100% accurate.\nIf I have to guess, most of the naysayers are people who either don\u2019t own this game or have very little playing time.\n\nAlso some stupid people complaining about Russian people writing reviews in English is totally uncool.\nI\u2019m a Russian and I do write reviews both in Russian and English.\nThe person who made this prejudicing comment must be a troll living in his mum\u2019s basement, not understanding the world", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173840515", "last_played": 1486915672, "num_reviews": 55, "num_games_owned": 468, "playtime_forever": 2810}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1486808852, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500479", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1487416667, "recommendationid": "29844005", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
