First thing, it's not 6v6, but 4v4 plus one bot on each team, the advertising wasn't honest about that. There is no campaign like Overcooked or Lovers, so the versus mode is all we got. I've bought it cheap, so it felt fine buying it at a >50% discount. You might enjoy it if you got a few joysticks and some buddies to get together and give it a go. Gets old soon, but still a worthy try along with your mates. However, it was made to be forgotten soon, so I can't recommend it if you are short on budget or if you're a solo gamer. I'd recommend Overcooked or Lovers instead, both which have a higher replayability.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004038352", "last_played": 1504059870, "num_reviews": 64, "num_games_owned": 1414, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1498435531, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508385", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1498435531, "recommendationid": "32793695", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "6 player local?cheap? hell yeah", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066231005", "last_played": 1501021634, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_forever": 64}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1492865496, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496965", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1492865496, "recommendationid": "31296240", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
