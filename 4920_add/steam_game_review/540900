Gameplay itself is  passable and fun enough, but too unfairely hard on occasions. \nDid I expect it for 0,99EUR?\nNo I did not, I mostly expected what I got. For instance, in my country 0,99 is a price of bag of pretzles.\nWas it more fun then a bag of pretzles?\nApsolutely, the product was a pretty fun top down stealth shooter (maybe more shooter) game that occupied me for more time then i expected. And the pulp feeling of the game even made me laugh a few times.\n\nOverall, a definite thumbs up, good value for money, and an ok item to have in your library.\n\nPS\nSorry for my grammar, English is not my native language. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065597365", "last_played": 1484125837, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_forever": 71}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1483450055, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517583", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1483450055, "recommendationid": "28975727", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Prepare to die, alot.\nGame is really difficult and you'll need to learn as you play\nMistakes are not easily forgiven.\nLuckily, checkpoints are evenly spread and even if you die close to the end you wont be left feeling cheated by the game\nThat is what kept me going.\n+1", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197996374111", "last_played": 1484053304, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_forever": 53}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1484053328, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508553", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1484053328, "recommendationid": "29161402", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Nuclear Contingency is not an amazing game.
