The overall lighting is aweful and it takes forever to find a toy plane hiden in an obscure spot. Way too dark with no way to adjust the lighting.  Keybinds where c for crouch, e for action, and w-a-s-d for movement. Mouse for looking/ view. Although it sounds simple enough, it bothered me enough to mention it.\n\nThe overall design of the levels/ areas seem laughable. You start out with an oddly designed, but rather nice looking house and then from there it just goes downhill. I say this because you seem to spend the vast majority of the game wandering the house and the house is just so ridiuclous. The basement desgin is so ridiculous that if it was real I would first facepalm, and then suggest moving in homeless people to live there because of how unecessarily large and maze like it is. This house designer is cray-cray no joke.\n\nAs for Krampus the monster, he feels uneventful and not scarey. I'll get bored wandering around lost in the dark before he shows up and then when he'll show up randomly its just like \"oh, hi there Krampy\". First few times felt jump-scare like, but its only jump scares and those lose effect after a few times of it being repeated. His image itself was not at all scarey, in real life maybe, but a game? Nope. I've had better jumpscares from Slendy (SlenderMan) to be quite honest, and he's super underated.\n\nLots of run around pick up a key then run around some more to find another key and then another and so on. This gameplay got repetitive and boring very fast. Theres a few other puzzle types, but the bit with the keys felt very heavy. I stayed playing for the story.\n\nStory seems to be alright, but I only just made it to the attic stairs when my entire game crashed. Which was a bit of a buzzkill, even after being frustrated with the very poor lighting and annoying key binds. I'm now stuck in the attic, mkay.\n\nTLDR:\nNo tutorial, so good luck learning the keys and what to do.\nPoor key bindings and no options or way to adjust any part of the game be it lighting or key binds.\nThe lighting is terrible and theres no way to brighten the game to look for objects/ objectives, which are, by the way hidden in obscure and dark little nooks and cranies.\nThe gameplay is repetative. Its basically find a key and find a lock for said key, then continue to find more keys and more locks after some point. Lots of find said object and goto said location with said object.\nAreas are designed in weird and crazy ways which don't make any sense to me.\nCheap jumpscares that even Slenderman can do better.\n\nMaybe worth a shot if on sale or cheap in general, but the lighting and key binds need improvement, as for the jumpscares, well have you ever played Spooky's House of JumpScares? Yea, and it almost feels kinda rushed in some aspects. Is it just me or is this game super short and relatively easy?

It also has one halfway-decent \"puzzle\" idea, and a couple of other \"puzzles\" which at least aspire to a challenge greater than opening a cupboard and finding a key inside (though there's plenty of that, too). \n\n   Oh, and when you press the keys on a piano, instead of the requisite piano sample we all know and love from other first-person games, you get a blatant plinky-plonky ELECTRONIC KEYBOARD sound instead.
