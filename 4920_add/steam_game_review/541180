It's basically a F2P version on myClub and that's great! Konami should probably update their title to show that. Now gameplay is classic PES, Feels much better than Fifa and you have a lot more control over the ball. The ball feels nicely weighted and moves along the grass nicely. There is no overpowered lofted through balls or crosses for easy goals you have to play from the back and build up your attack. There aren't many players atm (around 2,000 at peak times) But even with only 500 players online it only takes me around 1-2 mins to get into a game. Usually it's good matchmaking with good tight, and close games. The servers aren't amazing. I've gotten on a few times with the servers down for some reason but the issues seem to be fixed within 30 mins or so. So no real problem there. Now this game is based around the 360/ps3 version of PES 2017 and I have no clue why. Konami have been doing this for years with their yearly PES editions. It's the main reason why I do not own any PES game in my Steam libary. Give us the Xbox One/PS4 edition Konami please! Our PC's can handle it! Like just look at the system requirements, They are around 10 years out of date. Give us some improved graphics and shadows. Also can we have more options than low/med/high. I can run it on max settings @1080p/60fps sure but it would be nice to be able to turn off some options we do not want. Overall a fun game which I can see myself putting in several hours aslong as there are players to play against. I'm not quite sure why there are so many negative reviews of this game espically when it is a free to play game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198160969677", "last_played": 1500288134, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 286, "playtime_forever": 849}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1486825893, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506800", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1486825893, "recommendationid": "29849856", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The main attraction here is exhibition mode and what you get for free is pretty good value.
