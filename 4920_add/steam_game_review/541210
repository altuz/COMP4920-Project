If a Commodore 64 could track play time like Steam you'd seen the teenager me with hundreds of hours split between that, Silent Service, Gunship and Project Stealth Fighter. (Those were they days, my friends...) So, I bought the game, largely sight-unseen, because of a handful of pre-release videos and the developer's state goal of exactly what I said above.\nFirst what this game is NOT: It is not a station-simulator like Janes 688i, Sub Command or Dangerous Water. Don't buy this if you want to play out fantasies (or recall the good-old-days) of the minutea of operating a sonar set on a nuclear submarine. This isn't an underwater Falcon 4.0.\nNor is this Harpoon or Command: Modern Air-Naval Warfare. It is not a rigerous simulator of operational-level actions. You are not COMSUBLANT giving orders from on high to defeat the Soviets in the North Sea, you are more like Commander Daniel X. McCafferty of the USS Chicago hunting fleet oilers and Kirov task forces or firing Tomahawks at Soviet airstrips in the Kola Peninsula.\nThis game is what I stayed up late playing in my teen years with a closed door and towel under the crack so my parents wouldn\u2019t suspect. It is the game that at my 20th high school reunion classmates I hadn\u2019t seen since I was 17yo recalled me playing. This is the game that got me into reading Tom Clancy, Larry Bond, Michael DiMercurio and playing the GDW tabletop games Harpoon and Twilight 2000. This is the game that I consumed gallons of Mello Yello at $0.49 per 20oz bottle playing. All of the fun of those memories, but with reasonably modern graphics and a decidedly better interface (as of the 1.07 patch).\nLike it's 1980s predecessor this game has non-player crewmen operate stations like sonar, torpedo control and ballast control while you concern yourself with tactics, weapon choice and employment and the decisions of command during combat. Like the older game the most useful screen is the map view and the 3d cinematic\u00ac\u00ac\u00ac is mostly for vanity\u2019s sake. The updated UI allows more of a \u201cgiving orders\u201d feel to the game and software like Voice Attack is compatible with many of the game commands if you want to play out your fantasies of standing on the bridge giving orders.\nThere are two campaigns \u2013 one set in 1968 and another in 1984. I\u2019ve only played a small amount of the 1984 setting, but the scope is about the same as the older game, but no more than that. Essentially, it is your single American boat against the Soviet Navy. There\u2019s no support from other NATO units. The available US boats are the Skipjack, Permit, Sturgeon and Flight I Los Angeles-classes and a handful of sui generis testbed boats like the USS Narwhal. Though there\u2019s been no announcements yet the developers has openly stated their intent to add friendly units, more campaigns and allow play as other NATO (and even Pact) members.\nModding new ships and weapons and adjusting the values of existing units is trivially easy, they\u2019re all plain text files, but the game engine\u2019s middleware makes adding new 3D models virtually impossible. The developers have it on their long wishlist.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nThis is essentially an improved remake of my second favorite games of all time. (My #1 favorite, the 1984 space sim Elite, already got its improved remake.) The game has a learning curve, but it\u2019s not as bad as many of the pure-simulator games out there. It\u2019s not quite an arcade game, but it\u2019s a game first and simulator second. I\u2019d compare its complexity and authenticity to Microprose and Janes simulators from the 1990s \u2013 complex enough to require reading the manual (and making real-world knowledge helpful), but simple enough to be approachable by interested laymen.\nThe knocks are partly because the interface still feels incomplete and partly because there\u2019s still some balance issues that need to get worked out. I\u2019ve not played a huge amount and with the updated interface the controls aren\u2019t terrible difficult to learn if you\u2019re used to similar games, but even with the recent (1.07) updates there\u2019s still a bit of bugginess.\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nServiceable is the best way to describe them. They\u2019re not bad, per se, but nor are they top of the line. Of course, this is also a good thing because it means I can play it on my Surface Pro 3, but it also means it doesn\u2019t look astoundingly better on my high-end gaming desktop. Each enemy boat has a single (or a small number of) 3d models showing damage and objects like crates on the deck don\u2019t fall off when a boat capsizes. I\u2019d compared the graphics to a top-of-the-line game in 2001 or so, and with vehicle-oriented games that means they look pretty good until they get damaged and then the flaws in the simplicity start showing.\nIgnoring 3D, the game\u2019s map and interface graphics are decent for getting the information required across. I could certain suggest improvements for information density and availability, but again, it\u2019s serviceable.\n\nSounds: 7/10\nI\u2019ve never served on a nuclear sub, but the game at least gets the Hollywood version of it across with the hull creaking, pump noises, wooshing of torpedos firing and, more recently, the crew responding to orders. The only real downside to the recently implemented crew voices is I can\u2019t figure out of there is a single voice actor doing them all, if a handful of actors provided voices for different words or if a given actor plays a specific position on the boat where helm, diving control, sonar, weapons, chief of the watch, etc. are different people. The sounds are good enough for what they need to be, but won\u2019t be winning game awards.\n\nControls: 5/10\nThe controls in the game how it originally shipped were crap (or maybe I\u2019m just spoiled by my mouse). The original game was 90% keyboard driven and unlike the 1980s version there was no custom-cut keyboard overlay in the box. The keyboard commands were also oddly organized with one command toward the top of the keyboard meaning \u201cup with ballast\u201d while another command toward the bottom meaning \u201cup with planes.\u201d Yes, it makes sense in context of how the stations actually work, but it\u2019s confusing if you\u2019re not well versed in it.\nSince the 1.07 update the game is a lot more playable with a mouse-driven interface for dive control and engine room and the ability to click on the screen to steer the ship along with a panel for operating the masts and clicks for countermeasures. (I wish you could manually set the bearing with numbers instead of clicking, though and as of this writing there is no \u201cup periscope\u201d button I\u2019m aware of.) The interface just gives me the feeling of needing lots of work, though it is decidedly better than many subgames from years ago.\n\nSocial/Community/Developer: 9/10\nFirst off, there is no multiplayer and it\u2019s a far-off goal for the developers.\nSecond, the community for the game on Steam and SubSim Forums is generally friendly, though I\u2019ve had no direct interaction. (If I have an account it\u2019s only to gain access to members-only downloads.) The Developers, however, are extremely active on those forums and listen to requests and respond as to why they will, won\u2019t or can\u2019t do it. For example, the interface changes and crew voices were due in large part to community requests and the voices are actually members of those forums.\nThe developers are willing to help with modding to the extent they\u2019re able, but there are some technical issues as to why their assistance is somewhat limited. The Unity engine the developers used makes it difficult to modify 3D models without a recompile of the game assets. (Kerbal Space Program uses Unity as well and 3D modding is trivially easy in it, so the problem can be overcome but it is still a future goal.) Having said that, nearly every settings file are in plain text and the developers are friendly to modders changing them and adding new content.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004758520", "last_played": 1505623748, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 241, "playtime_forever": 285}, "votes_up": 31, "timestamp_created": 1505877700, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548751", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505877700, "recommendationid": "35076742", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a great example of a fairly accessible submarine simulation. The game puts you in command of a US nuclear sub in a cold-war gone hot scenario.

That said, if you are completely oblivious to the topic of submarine warfare, nothing will make much sense to you, since the game doesn't bother to explain how nuclear subs operate and fight. So a word of warning, if you have no idea about submarine stuff, go online, or just read a book on equipment and tactics. Despite interface accessibilty, there is a serious level of simulation underneath, so the game will expect you understand concepts like thermal layers, sonar arrays and weapon firign depths and ranges. However, if you have any interest in the subject at all, these things should be comprehensible and you should have no trouble employing them in combat.\n\nA few things worth noting:\n\nThere are just two campaings, but they are both dynamic with various missions, so replay value is high.\nThe music is awesome and sets the tone well.\nGraphics are not spectacular, but they do the job, and the whole game does look pretty.\nYou can kill a whale with a torpedo (if you are a careless person, or just a terrible human being).\n\nTotally a must have for submarine geeks, good entry title for noobs who are willing to do some research on the subject.

It can be quite frustating and unforgiving sometimes (talking about you, missions where you get instantly torpedoed by +5 air dropped torpedos), but thank god for a save function. There are still some bugs, or some missions which are downright impossible to even start: you need to catch a hunter-killer pack transiting to the Atlantic, but so far, I haven't come close to catching it.
