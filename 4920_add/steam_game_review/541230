You earn money by killing aliens, mountains of them, and spend the money to deploy more soldiers/buy ammunition for their weapons in the tower defense stages or unlock, upgrade each genre of your soldiers and open supply chests for obtaining random weapons on the global screen.\n\nOne unique thing about this game is that you need to reload your soldiers after they are out of ammo, which is equivalent to a soldier only being able to inflict a certain quantity of damage at the set amount of cost (both depending on the weapon), and you must take this fact into consideration when planning your formation.\n\nChest-opening with in-game money is pretty exciting and getting good weapons of unique and legendary ranks would be very helpful in early and middle game.\nAfter you beat the game for the first time, i.e. killed the boss in stage 40, the game becomes a little tedious. Although the stages at the two higher difficulty levels are quite challenging in terms of the understanding of the enemies and your soldiers, the expert levels are mostly excessively long and boring. There are also minor problems in the game system, for example, the choice of target of your soldier is always confusing and there's no way to configure it manually, and sometimes enemy units may collide with each other and deviating one of them from the path they are supposed to take. Finally, the achievements are quite grindy, especially the one for killing 500 thousand of aliens. At the point when I got all the other achievemnens, only 160k are shot, so I gave up on that one.\n\nOverall, Alien Shooter TD is an average tower defense game. If you like this series or you are a fun of TD games, it is worthy. Otherwise, wait for a discount.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198072155841", "last_played": 1500219258, "num_reviews": 76, "num_games_owned": 677, "playtime_forever": 2061}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500220977, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500025", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500220977, "recommendationid": "33588124", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "One of the better TD games I've played in a very long time.
