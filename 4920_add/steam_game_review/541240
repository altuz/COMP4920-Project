Think Solstice on the NES, or to a lesser extent, Landstalker on Mega Drive. The movement is cool, you gain new abilities at a nice rate. \n\nJudging by the map in the menu, it's a fairly decent size game. I'm using a gamepad, so not sure what keyboard controls/mouse controls are like\n\nMy daughter loves it. It has some crude humour in it (squirrel constantly refers to finding his nuts and asking people if they have seen his nuts. The point of the game so far is to find his stolen acorns), but she can't read, so that's not a problem for smaller children.\n\nEdit : So I've played about 2 hours now (my 4 year old sits next to me and talks about the puzzles). It's actually pretty hard. I think I'm about 15% of the way through (the journal gives a percent estimate) so it is a fairly decent size game. Thankfully the devs implemented a portal so you don't need to backtrack through the puzzles. Still really enjoying it. Definitely worth $10.

Since you can clearly see the exit, lots of times you only need to trace the puzzles backwards to get a good idea how to finish it.  \n\nIf you do get stuck or make a mistake, you can reset the current map and start all over again with full life!  \n\nSomewhat non-linear progression on the map.  There are a couple of choices in which way to proceed.  For example when heading towards the boss' castle, I could choose one of 2 ways to get to it.  \n\nLoads of hidden items to find. \n\nCons:\n\nCan't move the camera around to help see blind spots.  Sometimes you can't tell if you're going to fall off and take damage or if there will be something there to stop you. I realize I can just try out the blind spot and then reset the current map if I take damage but it's annoying at times. \n\nMost of the items (hidden or not) don't do anything for you.  Only the keys and gems matter.  \n\nThough nuts give you hints about the level, other than that they do absolutely nothing.\n\nYou can totally tell this was made for an ipad application which would then mean that this game is much too expensive for Steam.  If you're going to pick this up, please be sure to purchase at a discount. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/ih1lEW99t-0\n\nOverall, for a fun time where you want to test yourself without hurting your brain cells too much, pick this game up.
