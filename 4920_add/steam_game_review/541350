For a commercial product which is being sold for ~11$, I feel that it's too underdeveloped in the sense that it feels more like the cliff notes version or the Demo version of a game rather than the game itself.\n\nThe story is nice, but definitely has the potential to be deepened, widened and extended.  \n\n\nThe game world is as simple as they come, in my opinion oversimplified. Almost no redundant items to interact with, feedback on using items in a false manner is limited to few non item specific comebacks.  It's all pretty linear and straight forward: go from A to B, from B to C and pick up D from E if you want to get to F.  \n\n\nAll in all, it's worth the play, but I just can't recommend it for the price in which it's currently being sold.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198176534477", "last_played": 1497645306, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 193}, "votes_up": 18, "timestamp_created": 1497732578, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536791", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1497732578, "recommendationid": "32517371", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This was a fun, albeit frustrating, 2 hours of gameplay.

I would recommend it, so kindly forgive that the following list of criticism exceeds my compliments.\n\nIt lacks DEPTH.  The few characters involved are very undeveloped, the dialogue options also seem irrelevant.  The story's resolution is disappointing and shallow, and more than once, reaching dead-ends requires pixel-hunting or, more annoyingly, the repitition of a repeated, previously unsucessful action several times, without indication of a changed response, before you can progress with the game.  \n\nOverall, the technical aspects of the game deliver all that is expected, but without a very specific walkthrough you may get annoyed at the tedium of the very specific actions required to progress, often with an arbitrary time limit.\n\n6/10 Would play more from this developer again.", "received_for_free": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025560698", "last_played": 1497496684, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 289, "playtime_forever": 137}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1497497532, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522849", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1497497532, "recommendationid": "32423090", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Calm Waters is a fun and interesting game and runs smoothly with okay graphics.
