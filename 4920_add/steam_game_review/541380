Barebones, inconsistent physics (even though the game is literally named after the word), and quite a few bugs and glitches.\n\nGraphically, it's like a track editor in games from the early 2000's. Sort of a blocky, non textured look with a basic color pallete. The car itself has no color or body. It's just a frame and tires all in grey. No options for other vehicles.\n\nSound is generic. The music is nothing of note, and the sound effects are practically non existant. The only real sound you hear is acceleration sound and once in a while a stock crash sound that ranges from generic when crashing, to generic when getting pummeled off the track.\n\nNo sense of speed either. It's go and....stop. This is made worse by the fact that there's \"cheap deaths\" . You'll need momentum for some of the jumps or fall to your doom. And in a game where the physics range wildly from tolerable to \"I live upsidedown now\" , this is just pure awful. The worst aspect of the entire game though, is the camera. If you flip or spinout, the camera mimics your car. Causing a weirdly disorienting experience. Even something as simple as keeping the camera stationary would greatly improve this \"game\".\n\nOverall, this game has potential if actual effort is put into it. As of right now it's just too similar to an asset flip with a price that will make you go \"Welp, sounds interesting and it's only a dollar!\" . Don't bother unless it's patched or updated in the future. And no, this is not early access.

What DOES bother me however is some \n\ntextures will just dissapear at times,they'll still be there to drive \n\non,just invisible...a um...slight problem.\n\nThe sound is also mostly absent,there's no music,and the only sounds are \n\na standard engine noise and a thump if you impact \n\nsomething...however,sometimes when you respawn the vehicle, the sound \n\nwill simply cut off entirely and not return.\n\nThe playable vehicles? just one wireframe dune-buggy looking \n\nthing...that's it.\n\nBut the real issues come in the gameplay,it's a standard driving \n\ngame,the \"Physics\" comes in the form of obstacles,speed-bumps,breakable \n\nbarriers,loops etc...and in most areas the track has no walls,meaning \n\nyou can fall off to your doom almost anywhere,with checkpoints few and \n\nfar between.\n\nNow anyone who's ever played a game with a racetrack creator has \n\nprobably at some point decided to make \"THA MOZT IMPOZZIBULL TRAKC \n\nEVARRRRRR!!! :D\" and proceeded to do so,only to realize that it wasn't \n\nany fun to slowly inch around a track avoiding hazards.Welp,there are \n\nhazards OVER THE ENTIRE TRACK! Most enjoy driving games for the sense of \n\nspeed,but you have to plod through this too slowly to get any \n\nenjoyment...one tiny mistake and it's back to the last checkpoint...but \n\nhey,maybe you like obstacle courses?...you won't on this,as most \n\nobstacles are designed to infuriate you instead of providing fun or a \n\nchallenge,thin rails to drive across,speedbump clusters that go on \n\nforever...obstacles that come up THROUGH the track as you drive over \n\nthem...it's all pretty bad....\n\n...So...how are the  \"Physics\"?\n\nWell,sometimes taking a speedbump slowly will send you flying into \n\norbit,sometimes you'll lose all traction and slide off the \n\nroad,sometimes you'll just fall THROUGH the road,and it seems if so much \n\nas one wheel isn't touching something solid,the other three wheels lose \n\nall traction...soo...yeah, this is a BIG PROBLEM! Especially on a course \n\nthat requires precision.There's also the speed issue,as I said,you have \n\nto inch through this,but some areas require great speed,loops for \n\nexample,however some don't have enough space in front of them to \n\nproperly build up speed,others you can get the speed just fine,only to \n\nfind a near unavoidable obstacle immediatly on the other side...given \n\nthe track design, momentum is a constant issue,as you always either have \n\ntoo much or not enough. Also,when your vehicle falls off the track or \n\nwrecks you press R to respawn,but this sometimes glitches,for \n\nexample:keeping your fall momentum and having you just bounce off the \n\ntrack at the respawn point,or respawning INSIDE of something. I'm sure \n\nthere's more problems I've forgotten to mention,but you get the point.\n\nBut through it all I persisted,to claim those sweet achievements and \n\ndefeat this beast!!! However,the steam achievements...didn't work...I \n\ndid what they say to do to unlock them,but nothing...NOT ONE worked.But \n\nwhatever,did I beat the game? Well i got to the end...only to have one \n\nlast obstacle,a block that appeared from beneath the track,pop up as I \n\ndrove over it and flip me off the road...still determined I made my way \n\nback to find...the block was still there,blocking the exit...with no way \n\naround it...I tried respawning several times,but nothing would make it \n\ndissapear,so I was either glitched,or it was designed to where you had \n\none shot to clear it. And while you have checkpoints,there is no save \n\nfeature in this,so if I closed the game,i would have to start over from \n\nthe beginning...I'M DONE!\n\nI  can only hope this was either someones first ever attempt at making a \n\ngame,or a clever satire of how easy it is to get bad games published on \n\nSteam,but regardless this was HORRIBLE. Not a fun type of bad you can \n\nenjoy ironically,just pure BAD. \n\nSo in conclusion...\n\nDON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF!!!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198118722792", "last_played": 1484861178, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 67, "playtime_forever": 162}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1484863392, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507339", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1484863392, "recommendationid": "29364228", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place.

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn\u2019t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a \u201chomemade\u201d touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198107284194", "last_played": 1485545400, "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 97, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1485545411, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506610", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1491048868, "recommendationid": "29526604", "votes_funny": 12, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Downloaded...
