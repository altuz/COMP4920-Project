Surprisingly the style and the mechanics of the game were on point- I love the color palette but I think the character design is a litle weak. Either way, I recommend this game for anyone! The puzzles and the thinking that goes into it is a little challenging but worth it. i'd definitely give it a try!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198350775971", "last_played": 1481601114, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1481601121, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499429", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1481601121, "recommendationid": "28337602", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "WORST GAME I EVER TRIED OUT IN MY LIFE.\n\nThis is my first negative review of my life.

Version 1.0.2 (released December 9th) fixes the issue. I wish I had found the bug before releasing the game, but there's just no way that could've happened. It was only after some players tested on a wider range of hardware that the bug was found. \n\nFurthermore, suggestions for graphics/display options can be requested in the discussion tab in the Community Hub. Those sorts of options can be implemented pretty quickly. That said, Version 1.0.2 allows you to switch the display monitor for fullscreen mode. \n\nI hope you'll give the game another try, as I put a lot of work into creating a fun game for people to enjoy, and I'd like everyone to able to actually play it. I understand this requires a bit of patience, which is why I need suggestions and open discussions with the community to improve the project! Apologies again for the inconvenience and frustration. And thanks for playing! \n-Matt", "recommendationid": "28270490", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
