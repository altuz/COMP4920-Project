I'm not sure if it's intentional or what but you have to scoot up to the tip of the board to go down and back all the way up to go up. In my opinion, it should be about the size of a skateboard where you can just stand in one spot and cover the whole board. Maybe adding different sizes of boards would help.\n\nI think there should be a free roam/practice mode added. I only played on easy mode but most of the time I didn't really care to go for the points, I was just having fun flying around.\n\nEven with these things, I still had a pretty fun time, and with an update or two, it could be pretty good.
