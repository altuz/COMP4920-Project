It's style is different from any other game I've played. It takes you to another world like most games, then brings you back with the difficult realization that the tramatic events in the game are everyday realities for so many people in countries like North Korea. Be prepared for painful visuals, but don't look away; take it to heart.\nThis is a short game but priced accordingly. Some of the keyboard controls were difficult for me, perhaps it's my keyboard. But I used a game pad and that was resolved.\nI ran into 2 or 3 apparent glithes (item exchanges didn't take place properly) when I spent too long in a level. I once had to reset a level to be able to complete it.\nEven so, I enjoyed the game for its visuals and story. I would buy a sequel if the developer were to make another.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198311419685", "last_played": 1477611507, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 118}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1478277328, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1478277328, "recommendationid": "26418938", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I knew Zephyo because I follow her and her art. Unfortunatelly I didn't had enough time to buy the game and play it, even thought I supported it on Greenlight. It's such a pretty game, art style actually leaves you breathless. Game was really short, I expected at least another ending, like rejecting going to other side. But still, it was a incredible experiance. it's amazing how descriptive that game was. \n\n\nI do hope someone can see my review and support this game.
