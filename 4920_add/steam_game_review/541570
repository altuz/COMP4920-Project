Each little touch adds something, from the soundtrack to the realistically-written cast. The premise is believable, set in a spare and not overly-referenced mid-90s setting. The sound effects and animation are grunge but also filtered through youth; gritty but not sordid. The writing is really good because it seemlessly draws you into a role of not only voyeur, but ally for Sally Face. From episode to episode, poking around to see if different rooms and events have interactable continuity--they do! The main character is so well-rounded by now (I just finished Episode 2) that he feels like my long lost friend.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198159829429", "last_played": 1506485107, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 261, "playtime_forever": 166}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1505713098, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505713098, "recommendationid": "35039518", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Sally Face left me wanting more!
