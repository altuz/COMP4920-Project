The combat, driving, and platforming are all passable, if unremarkable. Additionally, this version is buggy and lacks any sort of online play or even local co-op. If you like Disney properties represented in this game, though, you'll probably find it a charming game. And if you want to try the game out regardless, this is the cheapest way to get all of the characters, playsets, and power discs.\n\nThe customization aspect of the game is fairly awkward, though. It is supposedly a pain on consoles, and on PC, you have to use mouse-and-keyboard controls, even if you're playing with a controller.\n\nAnyway, onto the individual playsets:\n\nPirates of the Caribbean is probably the most fleshed-out of the bunch. It's a fun, pirate-themed platformer that also features naval combat and sailing on the high seas.\n\nThe Incredibles is probably the most combat-oriented, and the characters are actually fairly varied in that regard. That in itself is impressive, considering this playset has the most playable characters of any included, and all but Dash are voiced by their movie voice actors. The combat itself is fun, but I'll admit that it starts to wear out its welcome just as it comes to an end.\n\nMonsters University stands out for covering a setting and film genre not usually explored in games - college life. The stealth gameplay and emphasis on pranking give it a unique flavor as well.\n\nCars is the most unique of the playsets, so in theory, it should be the most refreshing. However, the driving isn't really that good, and in practice, there's a lot of seemingly out-of-pace collect-a-thon-ing and fetch quests.\n\nThe Lone Ranger and Toy Story in Space both work off of the same basic premise of cowboys managing towns. The Lone Ranger tries to mix things up with train cargo management, but that is ultimately a pain when trying to do so on foot. It also lacks the inherent charm that Toy Story in Space has. Toy Story also has some fun mechanical gimmicks and gadgets to give it a considerable edge.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198012902673", "last_played": 1499883482, "num_reviews": 205, "num_games_owned": 1223, "playtime_forever": 1476}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1499884639, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506750", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499884639, "recommendationid": "33485932", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "For 28 euro, it's hard to rate this objectively. I got the complete edition (1.2 and 3) in a sale, so I'm not massively disappointed, but I had expected a lot more. The game consists of 3 different \"modes\": campaigns, challenges and free roam/creator.\n\nIn the creator mode you can, well, create your own challenges, etc.\nThe challenges are mostly sort of mini games and the campaigns are fucking boring for the most part.\n\nIn any case you generally control a character of your choosing (since all are unlocked in the gold edition afaik), which is mostly cosmetic, who can jump, bash and equip some special items. There's really NO depth at all. On the contrary: item use is limited to 1 item at a time and switching between items and moves is a pain in the ass. The platforming for the most part is ok, though, but sometimes your character strictly refuses to do what you tell him to. Oh, you can't die or fail in this game by the way. There are a few missions you can technically fail, but you'll never have to restart a save or something like that. Even if you die in battle or fall into the water you get instantly reassembled in real time. You are practically invincible, which is a good thing, because otherwise this game would be even worse.\n\nOn to the campaigns, which I bought this game for (oh, what a mistake). I've now wasted 13 hours of my life. Great. There are 6 campaigns and all follow the same basic rules: collect money from missions and around the map, complete the \"main story missions\" and complete dozens of pointless side quests...yaaaay. After a few missions the map opens up more and more. One of the problems here is that all campaigns just rather end and there's no epic feeling completing them. You just return to the world and that's it. I'll list the 6 campaign from worst to best (personal opinion of course).\n\nPirates of the Carribbean:\n- By far the best of the six. As Jack Sparrow you have to stop Davy Jones and acquire pieces of a magical mask to thwart his Kraken. What makes this one so \"good\" (relatively speaking) is not only the hack and shoot gameplay mixed with interesting jumping segments, but the fact that you can also ride on the high seas with your own boat...plus this one actually includes almost no pointless side missions and has a moderately well paced and thought out story with an actual end!\n\nMonsters Inc.:\n- Another relatively fun one though it has way too many pointless side quests, especially the ones where you just have to spend money to erect buildings...but your goal here is to win the scare contest with a rival university. You do this by setting traps, shooting, bashing, scaring and sneaking. Unfortunately, enemies in this campaign can't \"die\", so there is no point in even fighting them. But it's Monsters Inc. and it's relatively fun.\n\nLone Ranger:\n- Well, I list this as number 3, but that doesn't mean it's good. Forgettable story, forgettable gameplay (shoot shoot shoot) and beyond boring side quests. The best thing here are the voice actors. You fight against Butch Cavendish and his gang to save the peaceful town of Colby and all the while you expand the railroad network. All in a day's work. At least this campaign has closure.\n\nThe Incredibles:\n- Oh boy, this was bad. Fight against what's his name and his minions, who (just like all other NPCs) are rendered as cheap Lego knockoffs and have no real role to play other than to annoy you. I guess, it wouldn't have been so terrible, if you wouldn't constantly get attacked by killer robots dropping from the sky, which can take a lot of beating and shoot you with missiles, etc. Later on you get a helicopter with the worst controls in a game ever. Yay. And it's still not the worst one. Yay.\n\nCars:\n- Lightning McQueen has to...do stuff, while that Italian douche wants to host a racing...no, THE racing event in Radiator Springs. Ever controlled a car that accelerates and decelerates instantly? Jarring. Besides pointless side quests, you will have to partake in different races, which can, for the first time, be kinda fun, if shallow, and perform stunts, which sounds, interesting, but due to the limited amount of moves you have (4) gets boring after 1 minute. Then you win the BIG RACE...and that's it.\n\nToy Story in Space:\n- Oh boy, until I played this one, I wanted to put Cars last. I didn't expect anything to be worse, but TiS manages to do just that. Buzz Lightyear is protecting aliens from...a volcano. The platforming, at start, isn't even bad, but the whole flow of the campaign is fucked up. You start by expanding your settlement and collecting dozens of different boxes, which contain the buildings, then you plug up a volcano and then you study some goo and then the game just fizzles out and throws side quest after side quest at you without an apparent end. There were no more missions I could see...only pointless sidequests to grind the exorbitant amount of money to build the hero monument. At some point in the game you also get a jet pack, which can only fly horizontally and not vertically. The possibilities squandered! Instead you have to purchase a rocket pack, to fly a few meters upwards, hopefully make it to an elevated position, use your wings to fly over to another island, etc. etc.\nOh, and there's also teleport pads, but they somehow, despite one being there, don't connect to your main base, the only place to collect your toys from, and you can't even select a destination, they'll just throw you around in order...or randomly, no idea. It's just a mess, a boring mess. When you think about Buzz in Space, you think about cool flying maneuvers and space shootouts, but nope, no enemies in this campaign (apart from the training facility for some reason...maybe building that triggers an alien invasion? No idea, I doubt it, since there are no weapons in this campaign). I never saw the end.\n\nSo, lacklustre campaigns, lack of depth and not so great controls make me deem this \"not recommended\". Even if it's aimed at kids, I think there are a ton of games that are better suited for kids and more fun...this is just an exercise in frustration, repeating the same bs ever again. Not even sure if this has multiplayer? I guess, the creator mode could be fun for many people though.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992229015", "last_played": 1500250546, "num_reviews": 249, "num_games_owned": 481, "playtime_forever": 774}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500252525, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501835", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500252530, "recommendationid": "33597624", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
