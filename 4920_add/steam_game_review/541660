I would almost recommend this one. They've at least learned a bit from Infinity 1.0.\n\nThe premise is the same: Playsets (campaigns) and free play + challenges and some new extra challenge levels. This time, however, your characters can level up and use special skills, which is quite neat. The main gameplay is also smoother for the most part. However, there are some game-breaking bugs in the game, for example, getting stuck in walls (which can at least be remedied by loading a save, but still), or the game simply crashing after a certain cutscene. Every time. I guess, if you wanna fool around a bit it's ok and kids will probably have quite a bit of fun with it, especially when compared to the first one. I will, again, focus on the playsets and rate them from best to worst. So, there are only 3 this time: Avengers, Guardians and Spiderman...quality over quantity? Well, yes, and no.\n\nGuardians:\n\n- This one is hands down the best one. It's got interesting and fun characters, a moderately good story and really nice presentation. It's also the only one that makes following the main story a piece of cake, instead of being distracted by side quests and not knowing which quests advance the story. You play as Starlord (or any of the Guardians or villains) to repel Ronan the Accuser, who is after the Infinity Stone you've stolen. The only real bad thing about this one is that it's damn short and some story missions are really just time-fillers and annoying. Also, if you have enough points, you can instantly upgrade Starlord to be a rapid fire instagib cannon. The things Disney Infinity still have not mastered is actually crafting a good story with a smooth progression path...so these campaigns are just short \"adventures\". Thiis one is barely 1-2 hours at most if you ignore the various, boring side quests. It finishes with an interesting boss fight at the end...well, interesting for this game at least.\n\nAvengers:\n\nLoki has unleashed the Frost Giants on Earth. Actually not such a bad campaign, but marred by pointless side quests. Also, as Iron Man, you can simply hover over the enemy hordes and let your impulsor blasts clear the way. Most enemies can't hit you, but will occasionally throw something at you, which you can easily dodge. There are a few boss fights in here as well and with Iron Man you can quickly traverse the terrain at least. Just be careful not to get stuck in buildings during flight.\n\nSpiderman:\n\nGreen Goblin has teamed up with Mysterio. Once again, this one is not terrible. It has some different mechanics and with Spiderman you can webswing your way through the city, only your ranged attacks are weak, but you pack quite a punch in melee. Of course you can simply play as another hero or villain. The story and especially the ending, however, are a letdown in the end, but I didn't even get that far, because my game refused to continue after a certain cutscene. The game would always close to desktop after that...annoying and ultimately the reason for not recommending it. Not for 28 bucks...at.\n\nAlso, if you're gonna let people play as various heroes in the story-mode, please don't lock every hero behind his own skill tree...it makes no sense to change from Spiderman to Venom if the latter has no skill upgrades...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992229015", "last_played": 1500591849, "num_reviews": 249, "num_games_owned": 481, "playtime_forever": 389}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1500593109, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500593133, "recommendationid": "33683984", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "WOW !

The combat is more enjoyable, the characters now have skill trees and generally have more options for exploring the world, and the addition of Toy Box Games adds something to do for characters without playsets. \n\nThere's only three playsets in this version, though, based on The Avengers, Spider-Man, and Guardians of the Galaxy, and they all play more or less the same, with Spider-Man being the best for having the best character and gameplay variety.\n\nAs for the port job, I encountered an odd bug a couple times during my Spider-Man playthrough, and the cutscenes are low-res, but it's a technical improvement. It still lacks the online features and multiplayer like the first game, though. \n\nSuffice it to say, if you liked the first one and want more of the same but with Marvel characters as well, you'll probably enjoy this as well.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198012902673", "last_played": 1500147796, "num_reviews": 205, "num_games_owned": 1223, "playtime_forever": 757}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500148272, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502633", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500148272, "recommendationid": "33567327", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
