The combat is very engaging, there are plenty of collectibles to look around for, the characters are very distinct from one another, and the new side-content like farming, Toy Box Takeover, and Toy Box Speedway give the game further gameplay variety.\n\nPerhaps if the series had been able to cross over characters between playsets a la Lego Dimensions, it would have lasted longer. The Toy Box Takeover mode and, to a lesser extent, Toy Box Speedway, scratch this itch to a small extent, but leaked footage of the fourth game indicate that there would have been a dedicated, seemingly full-featured crossover playset. However, just this one game on its own feels more varied than the entire Lego series I've played up to this point.\n\nThe port job is very good as well, but it's not quite perfect. Like the previous games, it lacks co-op and any sort of online play. More egregious, however, is the missing content. Gold Edition is missing two playsets (Marvel Battlegrounds and Finding Dory), ten playable charaters (First Avenger Captain America, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Vision, Dory, Nemo, Baloo, Alice, Mad Hatter, and Time), and their associated power discs. If you're looking for the complete Disney Infinity experience, even ignoring online features and multiplayer, you will not find it on Steam. However, if you want to enjoy the series at a low cost, the Gold Editions are an excellent way to get in.\n\nAs for the playsets, the three Star Wars playsets - Twilight of the Republic (The Clone Wars/prequel trilogy), Rise Against the Empire (original trilogy), and The Force Awakens - are all just light variations on one another. However, they are all among the best playsets in the series, offering a fun variety of combat, vehicle sections, and platforming. Additionally, unlike previous games, all Star Wars characters are playable in all Star Wars playsets if you find the right collectibles. If I had to rank them, Republic would come first, followed by Force and then Empire.\n\nThe Inside Out playset demonstrates the series' versatility. It's a solid mixture of 2D and 3D platforming, with a level select screen instead of a hub world and a Bejewled-esqued puzzle minigame. The controls aren't that great, to be honest, but the levels are quite varied in their use of mechanics. These lend the playset a very distinct feeling compared to the rest of the series, even if it drags on after a while.\n\nIt's not considered a playset, but I also have to give a special mention to Toy Box Speedway. It's no Mario Kart, nor is it even as good as Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed, whose devs also developed this section of the game. However, the lessons from the Sonic & All-Stars series can definitely be seen here, between the driving that has improved considerably from the first Disney Infinity and the handful of solid racetracks. Bonus points for a Gravity Falls racetrack, even if there's no playable Gravity Falls characters.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198012902673", "last_played": 1504481949, "num_reviews": 205, "num_games_owned": 1223, "playtime_forever": 4155}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1501267416, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511551", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501267515, "recommendationid": "33862505", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Infinity is one of my favorite series because it's a great third person open world game that isn't rated M. Before it came out I saw preorder cards and didn't think much of it cause it was a Disney game which don't have the best rep. After researching it I pre-ordered 1.0 cause it looked like it would be decent and an open world game that at the time my parents didn't have to make sure it was ok to play. I was blown away because it was actually really fun. And while 2.0 was a let down 3.0 raised the bar again. \n\nThe toy box is at its best for all the features and parts you have at your disposal. Especially since the gold edition has all the power discs which really give you theme, vehicle, tool, and pack options as well as buffs and costumes.\n\nPlaysets or story campaigns are the second best in the series just because 3 out of the 4 are  star wars based. While I like star wars I wish there were more properties used to widen the experience like 1.0 did. While they are similar they also have their differences which make them unique unlike 2.0 which had 2 identical play sets, same map with minor tweaks for each one. Inside out is a platformer focused one which is a good refresher. \n\nNow toy box games are good and like playsets but not locked in one property. They also show what can be done for the most part in the toy box. But they do have unique twists that make them unique and un-copyable. \n\nNow the game doesn't have mutiplayer split screen and a lot of the newer things like marvel battle grounds and the finding Dory playset and the characters released with those it is still fun. \n\nThere is mutiplayer if u have friends with the game you can join each other through the friends list. \n\nThe game could be even better once people start making mods for it like infinite infinity is trying to do.

First of all, if you're not a massive Star Wars fan there's almost no reason to get this one anyway...maybe for the toybox, but yeah, this only includes characters from SW and Inside Out I think. Anyway, onward to the \"campaigns\".\n\nThere are 4-ish, this time around.\n\nInside Out:\nYou play as any one of the emotions of the movie, going through about 20 or so 3D or 2D levels to collect stuff and solve some very easy puzzles. This is honestly the best of the bunch, even if it has barely any story. You just do, but at least the levels keep changing it up and get more challenging. There's a mechanic in this mode in which you have to switch to certain characters for a short time in order to solve some puzzles. Since you can freely change your character anyway, however, (without the time limit) I wonder why this mechanic is even still in there. Maybe the original game required the miniatures to be able to do so...but then again I wonder how you can beat the levels if you only have one of them...\n\nTwilight of the Republic:\nHands down the best Infinity campaign to date. It follows a story loosely tied around the droid war and Grieveous. You will remember scenes from episodes 1 and 2 I think, but the story is really a bit separate and different. You can follow this story without interruptions and finish it in 2 hours or so. You'll visit Geonosis, Coruscant, Tattooine and finally Naboo. Lightsabers!\n\nRise against the Empire:\nOh boy, after Twilight I actually got my hopes up, but they were dashed just as quickly like a ship onto rocks. In Rise you \"relive\" the events of the original trilogy...in very very condensed fashion and with some minor adjustments. This one has so many issues: like how you start the game on Tattooine and have to collect 2,000 credits...by doing SIDE QUESTS! All of them basically. Go here, collect this, bring here...blabla. There's no fighting for the first hour of the game, unless you repeatedly kill the poor patrol. What were they thinking?! Then they introduce \"base building\" from Infinity 1.0 and 2.0 again...and guess what, once you're on Hoth, you have to earn credits again to purchase and place three buildings! And if that weren't enough, better do all the side quests, until new story progression missions pop up (the side quests actually progress the story, but they don't give you an indicator of that, other than you knowing that Imperial sentry droids on the surface of Hoth are a bad thing). Then you can tow AT-ATs down. Yay. When it's more fun to fight an AT-AT on foot and destroy it than to use Snow Speeders you're doing it wrong. Finally we'll get to Endor/Yavin (I forgot) and have to fight off some stoff for the Ewoks to disable the shields of the second death star...oh I forgot, you also destroy the first one...in a terrible approximation of a space sim. It's basically an on rails shooter and you can go up, down, left and right a bit...even the segments where you can freely fly around are heavily gated...there is no real 3D space...just a small canvas in which you can hover up or down...not even really fly up or down...just gradually glide. Ugh.\n\nAnd then...The Force Awakens:\n\nIt's not as bad as Rise, but it's not very good either. You basically only relive the events of said movie, starting on Jakku...and yes, having to collect 2,000 scrap this time around...luckily you can now salvage scrap heaps to make this initial hurdle faster. After getting enough scrap, we flee from the First Order in another boring flight segment, but luckily the only such one in this campaign. Then we go to the planet, whose name nobody seems to ever recall, fight off more imperials, who are actually more of a challenge in this game than they were in any movie, and go to Starkiller base...before that we destroy a few Star Destroyers in a moderately fun space segment. Aaaaaand then we get to \"fight\" Kylo Ren...well, we don't really fight him, because we're weak and bla, so we contend ourselves with shooting at explosive barrels he tries to hit us with...in three separate fights by the way. Ugh. Han's death is neither shown nor even mentioned in the game by the way. He simply disappears after Starkiller base. Likewise some key characters weren't even included. You can see that this was simply tacked on quickly to make more money, but no actual effort was put into it.\n\nAnd then there's the Toybox Takeover again and the Speedway, which is just a racing mode, but with different tracks at least.\n\nOverall for the hefty price of this game I can't even begin to recommend it. You will spend about 8 or so hours completing it, yes, but most of that play time is boring or frustrating imho. Combat has been slightly improved, but that's it. I'm not even sure kids would enjoy this...maybe in creator mode.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992229015", "last_played": 1501322645, "num_reviews": 249, "num_games_owned": 481, "playtime_forever": 636}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501322715, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498442", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1501322721, "recommendationid": "33877217", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "All of the updated characters and playsets are not available.
