With the latest update the DEV fixed everything I described. I am impressed. This is the Kind of developer we need. The Game is still pretty empty at this point, but its early alpha. I cant say how this game will be when finished, but I can say that the dev is very active and listens to the players, so have my upvote!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198139063295", "last_played": 1482949220, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_forever": 2719}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1477855461, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506371", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1479417088, "recommendationid": "26323075", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
