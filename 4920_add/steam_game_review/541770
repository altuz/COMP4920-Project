It's almost like the people who made 69 Ways to Kill a Zombie abandoned that project to do this one. IT DEFINITELY HAS POTENTIAL! But seriously finish the game before you release it. The trailer shows people riding around in trucks together running through Zombies shooting but that is not actually in teh game right now. \nI hope there are improvements coming because I would like to give this game another shot; here are the things that bothered me:\n\nDraw distance is horrible. Thats the single thing that really kept sticking out to me throughout the entire time playing the game.\n\nMelee weapons do not work (I only tried the baseball bat)\n\nThere is a single generic zombie noise that all the Zombies make. Would be nice to see more varieties.  \n\nVehicles? I see them in the trailer but not in the game (at least not usable ones)\n\nKilling zombies is way too hard. I had to unload 10 rounds into the face of one just to take it down; after that I was out of ammo. Head shot single kill damage would be something I'd like to see.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197963322624", "last_played": 1477357591, "num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 351, "playtime_forever": 18}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1477369514, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495668", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1477369550, "recommendationid": "26209270", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}]}
