But I won't.\n\nSo your dumped into an ugly asset pack you have walked around before. From there it goes downhill. So you slowly wander around this very small area looking for puzzles. And I do mean slowly - there is a sprint but it makes so little differrance it may as well not be there. And yes there is the tedious torch mechanic and the game of hunt the battery. \n\nAlso there is the irritating mouse lag, and annoying motion blur. It would be nice to adjust these in the options, except there are no option to adjust at all. None. So you are stuck with awful laggy movement,   What little audio there is in game is often sparse and annoying with sound cues that repeat randomly. Oh and saves only save from the beginning of level checkpoints.\n\nAnyway, the very first puzzle, you are told to use a radio, and that is where I got stuck. Reading other reviews it seems I'm not alone. At this point i stoppped playing - I am really not invested enough to carry on and find a solution as it is no different from the many other unity asset pack horrors I have already played. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989290281", "last_played": 1503340514, "num_reviews": 108, "num_games_owned": 1203, "playtime_forever": 17}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503346987, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503346987, "recommendationid": "34402119", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
