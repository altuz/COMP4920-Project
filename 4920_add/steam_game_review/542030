You'll unlock more spells along the way to help you find more runes and solve more puzzles. In terms of visuals, I found the underground and darker parts of the game to be very visually appealing in VR, more than the outside was to me, but the outside does still fit the atmosphere. I personally found the progression with the in game hints to be easy enough not to be frustrating, but hard enough to still pose a challenge, however more hardcore puzzlers might be a bit disappointed with the difficulty. The game took me around 5 hours, so in my opinion it's absolutely worth the price if you think an exploration game with puzzle elements sounds fun.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 61, "steamid": "76561197994368591", "last_played": 1506039675, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 185, "playtime_forever": 400}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505786564, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505786564, "recommendationid": "35056322", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
