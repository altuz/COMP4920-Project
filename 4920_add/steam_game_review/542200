They have interesting motivations and consistent personalities. Added bonus: the MC comes with a snarky personality! Yes! Any otome-style game that doesn't force me to play as a wet noodle is a welcome break. Also, refreshing to see a Western art style in what is typically an Asian-dominated medium.\n\nBut alas, some cons - the main issue with this game is that once you play through a route once, you've experienced the majority of the game. The game's story is unique, and very cool, but it doesn't alter or expand much with different partner choices. The skip function in this game is also a little clunky, and while functional, requires more button-clicking than strictly necessary. Lastly, aside from the name, the MC also comes with zero customization options.\n\nThis is a pro or a con depending on your preference, but this game is probably a PG-13? The CGs are nice (although there isn't a gallery you can re-visit them in), but you're looking pretty exclusively at kisses and cute animals WHICH I AM ALL FOR.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198016884110", "last_played": 1502694981, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 298, "playtime_forever": 617}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1503037665, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494774", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503037665, "recommendationid": "34322036", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "My first full play through, the only one where I read all the text, took about 5.5 hours. I've managed to get \"good\" endings for all the guys, although I haven't yet looked into whether the \"canon ending\" is only possible with one particular guy or if there's a version of it for each of them. (Edit: After looking through the Discussion area, I'm thinking the canon ending is only for that one character, which I'm cool with since I loved him.)\n\nPros:\n- This isn't one of those stat raising visual novels - there are decision points where you have to choose between different actions and dialogue and that's it, thank goodness. \n- There were some nice funny moments.\n- The heroine wasn't a wet washcloth with no personality.\n- I actually kind of liked all the guys, although I did develop some strong favorites. My most unexpected favorite: Kyle.\n- I'm probably in the minority here, but I'm kind of glad the romance in this was just limited to talking, a date, and kiss here and there - no sex, even fade-to-black.\n\nCons:\n- It takes a long time for the heroine to find and transform all five guys. Way longer than I thought it would. Also, if you go into this expecting it to be a dating sim, be prepared for it to also take ages for anything like a date to happen. Maybe two thirds of the game?\n- I wasn't a fan of the art style, although it eventually grew on me.\n- No art gallery. If you have particular scenes you like, you'll need to take a screenshot.\n- The whole \"trying to figure out how to change the guys back to human for good\" story felt surprisingly calm and unrushed. I was a little surprised there weren't more emotionally charged moments, considering that these guys were never going to get back the lives they used to have. Sure, there were jokes about Frankie having trouble believing in the existence of the internet and whatnot, but most of the guys took things really, really well. Even [spoiler]Kyle[/spoiler] seemed to handle things well, until that one moment.\n\nWhile I wish the story hadn't taken quite so long to get going, I enjoyed this overall.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198031725579", "last_played": 1502158656, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 219, "playtime_forever": 528}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501969539, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494774", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501975212, "recommendationid": "34047137", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is rather beautiful.
