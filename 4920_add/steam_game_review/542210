Otherwise I see a lot of educational (as well as pure fun) potential for this game. A few things that I would love to see:\n\n-Example motions, to help teach the finer elements of motion control.\n\n-Placing gravity well/robot in different spots of the lab\n\n-Live motion recording, recording a joint as you manipulate it with the mouse\n\n-I'd love to push the robot down some stairs :D\n\nThe UI is rather intuitive, a quick tutorial catches you up on the not as obvious parts as well (Shift-clicking, double shift-clicking)\n\nFull disclosure, I do personally know the developers, but I wouldn't recommend this game unless I really thought it was a quality product.
