I found that there was a steep learning curve and that the tutorial could use some work but overall would recommend it. I wound up writing some guides for the game as I would love more English players to give this a look (most of the guide are currently in Russian). Other than that I do want to stress that going in I expected something that was a bit heavier on the story than The Herbalist is. A tag used for this game is 'visual novel' which I don't personally agree with. There is a story for sure but I would not call this a visual novel. It's more like a crafting game built around short story to motivate you to keep going. This isn't a bad thing, it's just that if you're specifically looking for a visual novel I would check out something else.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 256, "steamid": "76561198089374202", "last_played": 1506244419, "num_reviews": 32, "num_games_owned": 291, "playtime_forever": 793}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506244214, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506244214, "recommendationid": "35175265", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
