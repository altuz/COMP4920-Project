Instead of the interesting / funny contrast created by the song in the trailer, in the game itself it has spooky ass ambient music and an occassional groan from the monsters when they see you. They don't attack you, and you don't have any health or anything, so they instead just walk toward you and push you along down the hallways, I presume in the hopes of getting you stuck at a dead end to prevent you from progressing and thus making you load an earlier save (assuming you even play the game long enough to bother to make a save. Protip: Spare yourself the KBs used to create a save and just delete the game instead.)  \n\nI will now briefly describe the gameplay in this game. You may want to grab a pen and paper to take notes to keep track. I can wait... \n\nOkay, are you ready??? In this game........... you walk around a maze (although not really a maze since you're given a map that shows everything, including the locations of where the items are you \"need\" to collect) to walk around, grab 7 gems (by going through the laborious process of tilting the mouse to look down at a 45 degree angle and then clicking LMB once) Then wander around the maze doing this another 6 times, while avoiding being pushed into a wall and unable to move by one of the aforementioned \"monsters\"  You then return to the initial room where you entered the level to enter a portal, which upon doing so you are immediately transported to another set of hallways (no visual or sound effects just immediately thrown into another set of hallways) with another 7 gems to collect with another set of dumb monsters shuffling around aimlessly. \n\nThe game's self-aware trailer with its \"awards\" section and the very brief description of the game itself I was hoping were indications of a game that knows it's horrible but has some kind of endearing charm but having booted it up and now seeing that same tongue-in-cheek \"humor\" it comes across as more of a con than anything and I'm stunned this game is even available for purchase. \n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "last_played": 1503989473, "num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 800, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1503990711, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496104", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503990711, "recommendationid": "34570635", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
