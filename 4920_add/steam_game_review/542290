There are 5 main routes, one for each heroine and in addition there are side episodes. The heroines themselves are so loveable, and the game does a great job at making you feel attach to them. I really like the atmosphere and the setting of the game. Also the character sprites and artwork are very well drawn. As the game progresses the story will become deeper. The game is pretty long and very satisfying so it\u2019s definitely worth the price.  Overall, this game is really enjoying to play.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198241258370", "last_played": 1504913662, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_forever": 2130}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1498031052, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509167", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1502131204, "recommendationid": "32612119", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
