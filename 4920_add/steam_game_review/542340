The last update/improvement announcement was 3 months prior to this review. I want to commend the developer for putting the effort into making and keeping up with their game.\n\nInto the issues I faced playing this game:\n\n1) The first thing I noticed was the load times and loading screens. The first load entering the game was several minutes long. Not much of a problem in itself, however, the loading screen is mostly blank with little design to it. Without something to look at while it performed its extended load, I was about ready to go do something else while it finished.\n\n2) When the game had loaded, I began to move over to the slingshot and ammo table when I got a notification in the game: \"Low FPS Detected. Would you like to improve performance?\" I wasn't expecting any graphical options in a game of this scale, so I agreed to improve performance. Which would have been nice if it hadn't made the performance worse. Going through the pause menu and setting the graphics to low alleviated some of the fps issues to a more tolerable level(my PC isn't magnificient, but it should be able to run this game with no problem).\n\n3) I'm going to lump combat and gameplay together for this point. Your heartbeat meter is out of 100, but I was able to get it over 600 by avoiding as much damage as possible and grabbing every health item I saw. I'm not sure if this is an intended mechanic or not. The AI is quite lacking. The enemies stay outside the buildings and shoot you through the windows whenever they have visual. I noticed that when I would move the enemies would square dance back and forth outside the window until they decided they wanted to shoot me, or I got too close to a wall where they would literally kick my ass through said wall. Your fire rate is much slower than the enemies' fire rate. Even their shotguns fire like rifles. I timed 2 shots from the sling, and it was about 4 seconds from the first click to the time the second shot left the sling. In that 4 seconds, I could be shot 6+ times from a single enemy which is about 20 damage per hit. A headshot to most enemies was a kill, but the aiming and delay of your shot(plus the urge to avoid incoming shots and the enemies' affinity to squre dance outside the windows) makes it hard to line up a headshot. I found the best course of action was to shoot the enemy body parts that clipped through the wall as they waited on either side of a window for you to poke your head out. Getting too close to spiders on the walls will damage you. The game overs don't seem to make sense unless I was missing something. Sometimes when I died, it would just restart me back at the original spawn location, and I would resume like nothing happened except that any of the items I collected were gone and the enemies I had killed were still dead. Then other times I would die, get sent back to the main menu, and have to restart at the same spawn location, but this time everything had reset.\n\n4) This is the final point I wil make. The overall cohesion of the game is strange. If you speak to the women in the levels, it seems no one really knows why you're there and why the military has KoS order on you. The start building seems to be a basic fps setup. However, the second building had two jumpscares. One being a monster reminiscent of a Resident Evil type of monster. The second simply being a doctor who appears when you open a certain door and just stands there menacingy. The real scary part about the doctor was that I didn't kill him immediately and entered the room to collect the items and when I started getting shot, he was blocing the exit, and I ended up dying.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069001727", "last_played": 1501635642, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 102, "playtime_forever": 47}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1501635121, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517581", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501635121, "recommendationid": "33960841", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pros:\nIt's cheap\nHas trading cards\n\nCons:\nEnemies run into walls and can also shoot you through said walls\nLots of pre-purchased assets\nHorrible language translation\nLow Framerate (even with a high end PC)\nGraphics that are comparable to the original DOOM (would be acceptable if the gameplay were any good)\nNo story whatsoever\nFrequent crashes\nOverwhelming number of bugs ranging from minor to game breaking\nMany other things that i'm sure i missed.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198369912124", "last_played": 1504211949, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_forever": 214}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1500078618, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504013", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1501039429, "recommendationid": "33548046", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I could bash my head into a wall and have more fun than this.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198280415623", "last_played": 1502063943, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502063996, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502063996, "recommendationid": "34071453", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "fun", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198312383019", "last_played": 1503304641, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_forever": 35003}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503558984, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491648", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1503558984, "recommendationid": "34454352", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Shoot them all", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198214238443", "last_played": 1499868333, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 105}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499855886, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480808", "votes_down": 16, "timestamp_updated": 1499855886, "recommendationid": "33476488", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
