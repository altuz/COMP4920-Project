Plus with the terrible movement system, (I know it's for people easily motion sick, but not all of us suffer so badly as to require this kinda thing.) makes it so those of us without a full sized, empty studio to play VR in can't quite hit some enemies that back up away from us when they're staggered (Which is almost all of them). Fighting the tiny spiders was the worst due to how I can't properly reach them most of the time\n\nAnother issue I have is the really clunky inventory system, that is effected by your weapons and the light around you! So if you have a shield on your arm, and a ton of weapons and foods, good luck being able to see what you're hovering your hand over, and to make matters worse, if you get a lot of junk in there, it wraps around you, so your other hand might accidentally be pressing on your health potions while you try changing out your off hand weapon, and whoops, there goes all the potions you've been saving up! This is all, of course, assuming you can even see your inventory when the unnecessary day/night cycle hits midnight or whatever, and everything goes pitch black. I could not find the potion I was looking for after a needlessly difficult fight against enemies I couldn't see brought me down a lot of health. This was about when I realized that the 3 potions I had 5 minutes ago had entirely disappeared. At least as far as I know. I couldn't see much. A torch would be nice. \n\nThis game feels way too early to be charging $40 for.

My biggest problem was that 90% of my 22 minutes of playtime were spent running around.  I don't play games to hold down a controller button and watch my character zigzag around the world, I want something interactive and fun... not running.  In this game you run for a while, then fight a few opponents, then run for a while, then fight a few more opponents.\n\nI suspect the game could have been fun if it had just been an arena game where you have waves of enemies.  I am actively looking for a Sword Master VR replacement and was hoping this might be it but since I am looking for a workout game it can't be 90% of me standing while my character runs.  I want non-stop engaging combat.\n\nAlso, $40 is the price point for a A title (not AAA).  This is not an A title, so doesn't warrant the pricetag IMO.  In the Early Access section it says, \"We plan to gradually raise the price as we ship new content and features\" which means they intend to _increase_ the price from here, which is a bit insane to me.  It has a long way to go before being competitive at $40, none the less _more_ than that.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989776530", "last_played": 1497146155, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 268, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1497148159, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486428", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1497148159, "recommendationid": "32332372", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I found the combat quite fun, and the 3rd person movement okay.\n\nUnfortunately the world seems a bit lifeless,   Going from one area to another without much of an interaction with the world is a quite boring.  \n\nAs others have said, this game may have been better suited for an arena style game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197968061175", "last_played": 1496137277, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 517, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1497306029, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486428", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1497306029, "recommendationid": "32375590", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So far not a bad game. It will make you sweat, its quite a bit of work and during fights you really need to be moving around.\n\nPros\nDecent graphics\n\nFights are fun and intense\n\nPretty decent size world\n\nCool music\n\nThe game highlights your VR bounds with red. This is very useful I've found. Helps keep you inside your space. Can be distracting but is really necessary for a game like this.\n\nEnemy models are pretty cool. It feels quite real when 3 huge men are standing in front of you each waiting to take their swing at your face. The monster people things with swords look awesome. They're frightening.\n\nCons\nLocomotion: The view switches to stationary camera 3rd person view when your character is moving. At first I didn't like this. It does suit the game I suppose and gets less jarring the more you use it. I would still prefer an option to use teleport or onward style movement.\n\nPrice: 32.99 CAD is quite steep. And thats at 25% off.\n\nPlayspace: The bigger the better. I have a smallish 2mx2.5m space and I wish I had a bigger space. It's do able but you need to be paying attention to your boundaries.\n\n\nOverall, if you like this type of game, the combat is good, theres quite an open world to explore and many fights to be had. I'm 30 min in and have already had about 6 or 7 battles each with 3+ adversaries. I think this game can be great, but currently the price and the lack of locomotion options are the two things holding it back.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017125492", "last_played": 1496084158, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 184, "playtime_forever": 26}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1496084940, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501479", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1496085468, "recommendationid": "32047847", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Nice high quality game. Great music, level design, and melee combat may be the best yet.\nI never really liked 3rd person movement but this game proves it can work and can be Very natural and comfortable.  Feels like any other 3rd person game only with life sized characters and you can snap to first person view at any time.\nSort of ground breaking in this respect.\n\nThis game deserves to be longer.  I'd love to spend 30+ hours questing through the world they've created.\n I'm sort of taking my time because I don't want it to end.\n\nUpdated thoughts:\n\nAwesome but expensive. It needs more content. I've played it for about 2 hours and the combat gets a little samey (we're not talking fighting game level of combat here) combat physics are great and really feels like you're fighting but each enemy can be taken down with about 4 clean hits. (Maybe more difficult enemies come later). Weapons have runes that power up when you land successful blows or parry.\n\nThe game feels awesome sort of a glimpse of what a Skyrim type RPG could be like.\n\nI'm about halfway through the main quest.
