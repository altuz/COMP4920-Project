That being said, my expectations are pretty big playing games like Civ V, CS:GO, Planet Coaster, etc.  This is a game obviously made by one person and has very limited play through.  It would probably be a good game for someone who is just starting playing PC games, with little other experience to compare.\n\nTHe objective in the game is simple.  Find the key, go to the door, kill any enemies in the way.  The maze levels are very frustrating.
