You know how you want to scream at them, \"don't go in there, you moron!\" This game will make you feel like that, but you are the moron going into that stupidly scary dark place.\n\nThis game is undoubtedly a scary experience, and my first one of such in VR. I will not praise it on its game design in general, but in the context of VR, it does what it sets out to do.\n\nPlaying it in VR is scary, and quite unnerving, however, this is not because the game itself is particularly scary or well-made. Rather, VR does the scaring. If you ripped the game out of VR, the best you would get is one or two cheap jump scares and a rather boring maze crawl.\n\nThat being said, playing this will put you on edge. It will scare you. You will quit like a little bitch the first time you have to walk through a door. The jumpscares I mentioned do exist, but the way the developer crafted this game, within the context of VR, makes them the least fightening part. There is an absolutely frightening atmosphere of sounds and experiences throughout that will cause you to have the feeling of \"why am I here; I should not be here\". The sense of being in this place is what is truly scary. \n\nI recommend this with the following notes. Having played it, I would not pay more than $5.00 for it. For the price, it works and is scary. Get this game if you want to experience the new baseline in horror games. This not-that-well-made game, is scarier than every single horror game I've ever played on a monitor. Get this game if you want to scare the piss out of your friends.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018669116", "last_played": 1494022175, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 196, "playtime_forever": 446}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1493833681, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1493833681, "recommendationid": "31528411", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
