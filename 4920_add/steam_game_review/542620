There is no progression between games, but it definitely feels rouge-like with the lack of lots of instructions and the single life.  This game is quite entertaining.  I like to use this game to relax and wind down from my usual style of vr games, the more action oriented room-scale types.  When I play this, I kick back and chill while exploring and trying to figure out the best ways to stay alive.\n\nOne thing I would love to see in this game is a way to mark maps.  It can be very difficult to remember where certain pieces of equipment are when you have explored 30 or more cells.  Trying to find the sewing machine or the washing machine again can be a real effort.  \n\nOverall, I  do like this game.  I would  recommend it to people looking for a casual survival/crafting game with some rogue-like elements.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198317513791", "last_played": 1484552769, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 276, "playtime_forever": 256}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1483256165, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491687", "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1483256474, "recommendationid": "28894170", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It seems to be a Dont Starve in VR, i like the gameplay.
