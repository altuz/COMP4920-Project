If developer keeps working this title, he could have a top tank sim game on his hands. A few more aiming perks and scopes and measurement idicator overlays and you have  it. For the detractors of this game...guys its a friggin 3.99 game. Its not world of tanks. World of tanks is not a Tank Sim. go play Wot if you want to mmo.\n\nI'm going to continue playing this game.

I have not found anthing as good since then to satisfy my 'tankers' spirit...yes I'm Armour Corps. So when I saw this I as hoping for something that was: not too much of an unrealistic arcade game; and not too much of an unplayable simulation. I as hoping for balance.\n\nPositives...\n...You can't beat the price, so you get what you pay for...remeember that.\n...Good graphics with clear vivid colours, environment, and great looking water.\n...The game physics are good too with just as good explosions and effects.\n...The Russian tanks are nicely rendered with good detail and the look of wear and tear.\n...The sound is good with realistic shots sounds and impacts too.\n\nNegatives...\n...The scenarios and their sequencing is not that great, so you don't kno what your doing most of the time.\n...The 1st scenario is nearly imposible, which is not a good idea if you're trying to introduce people to a new game.\n...There is no tutorial or programed instruction, so you are left to guessing what you are supposed to do in scenarios.\n...Their is only one speed for any of the tanks you operate...and that is slow, slow, and slow.\n...The controls are terrible as well, bordering on simple arcade game controls.\n...There should be different views based on hther you're buttoned up or commander exposed.\n...You have no ammunition type choices (AP, APCR, HEAT, etc.) and there is no ammo count.\n...There sees to be no armour diffrences on any of the tanks. They all seem to brew up with about 3 hits. That is, A Tiger and a JS-2 are just as easy to kill as the a Pz IV or a T-34.\n\nI can go on with the negative points, but I ould rather just say that, I am fine with this purchase. I didnt pay a lot for it and it is promising. I am hoping the developer with take another shot at it and put out an update or an Rev 2.= that addresses all thegame related issues.\n\nCheers!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995382823", "last_played": 1485653897, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 924, "playtime_forever": 159}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1485057915, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1485069488, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499627", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1485057915, "developer_response": "Hello.
