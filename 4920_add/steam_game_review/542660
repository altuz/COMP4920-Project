Although A.I. is simple it is supprisingly difficult to contend with in this roguelike. Very smooth simple controls and mechanics. looks to have some replay value with daily runs, randomized levels setups, and loads of powerups and weapons. Wish my gameplay was faster however would be awesome to see it run without lag at times.\n\nSpecial thanks to the developers for troubleshooting my previous buffer problems. They were quick to respond after my first negetive review and kept in contact until problems were resolved.
