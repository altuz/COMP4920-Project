Not a lot for a solo player to dive into though; just a timed mode (2 or 3 minutes or something; come to think of it, I haven't been paying attention :P ), an Endless Mode, and a Wide Mode that reformats the playfield into something that fits in widescreen, which seems like an impossible thing to keep up with. But it all plays well, which is great news. Especially if you've got some friends around to dive into multiplayer with.\n\nIts that puzzle design where there are colored blocks on the playfield, and you remove some, then plop them back down on other like-colored blocks to clear them (though you have to activate the clear manually - called \"Punching\" here). All the while, blocks slowy creep towards the top of the playfield threatening to crush you when they reach you if you can't clear them fast enough. If you have ever played Capybara's \"Critter Crunch\", or Teyon's \"Ball Fighter\", its pretty similar except flipped around (grabbing/shooting blocks from the TOP of the playfield instead of shooting them up from the BOTTOM). Its a good design, and one most arcade puzzle fans should definitely check out if they haven't. Super Puzzle Sisters executes it well and also does the right thing by adding its own twist here in the form of special moves, which change depending on your adorable SD anime girl avatar. \n\nThe only real problem I have are the color choices for the blocks. Most are fine - yellow, green, blue, red, purple and violet. Out of those, most stand out from each other. HOWEVER,the red and the violet look way too similar imho, and there's already a purple (which DOESN'T look like the red). That makes the violet a redundant color choice, and I don't like how much it resembles red. Even the designs are too close - a 4-sided polygon (a diamond) on the red and a 5-sided Pentagon on the violet? C'mon now. \n\nIt throws your brain off a bit while you're scrambling around grabbing blocks. There's no punishment for trying to pick up a different colored block when you're already holding some, it just won't let you pick it up. Your brain will take a quick beat to adjust and you'll move on. Still, its a little annoyance that seems like it could be easily fixed with a quick asset swap. Merely changing it out for a different color/design - what about a white block? With 5 DOTS on it (like dice)? None of the other pieces have dots on them. That would stand out a whole lot more.  \n\nIf the violet block color is an issue for me, I imagine people who are color-blind will hate it. But mostly, the lack of content is what gets me. Puyo Puyo games have cute, simple little story modes. Puzzle Quest and Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes have psuedo-RPG modes; I'd love to see something like that here. Granted, this is like $7 - little for the solo player is no deal breaker; I just want more to do :) Its great for a quick little pickup game though, which is EXACTLY why you'd want an Arcade Puzzler like this in your Steam Library. And there's lots more fun to be had if you plan on playing multiplayer stuff. \n\nOverall, its really well done. Not flawless, but definitely very enjoyable, and perfect for quick pick-up-and-play sessions. Besides Magical Drop V and Raining Blobs, and Doctor Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine in the Sega Genesis Classics Collection (which is Puyo Puyo in Japan - you can pick up the mod to play that version in the Classics Collection Steam Workshop if you're not a fan of Robotnik's aesthetic, remember), there's just not enough of these types of games on Steam. If you enjoy games like this, or think you might enjoy arcadey puzzlers, feel free to pick it up :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002518295", "last_played": 1496057112, "num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 119, "playtime_forever": 63}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1494146197, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498853", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1494254786, "recommendationid": "31599211", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
