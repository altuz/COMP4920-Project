I positioned the game table at shoulder height and stand right in the middle of the game.  feels like I am a kid playing on the floor preteding to blow thigs up.  my favorite is the tornado.  when I release it I get right up close to it and it makes me smile every time.  I loved tower defense games on the phone, but this is a whole new experience.  All and all one of the best games I have played in VR.

The use of clear audio cues, the act of collecting money, tower layouts/spacing, the micromanagement of the hero, the varied manual defense options on the top of the castle; all of these things make you forget about VR and simply concentrate on managing the virtual table. Suberb!\n\nThe only issue I could possibly bring up with this game is the user experience on Oculus. I have both Rift and Vive, and room scale Vive is by far the superior experience. A seated or standing Rift experience requires quite a bit of turning and positioning. The teleport mechanic is clunky in the heat of battle, and the buttons used to turn are the same buttons that sell towers - I have accidentally sold a tower more than once. I know that Rift support is new, I expect it will get better with time.\n\nIf I were to make a list right now of the best VR games all time, this one is top 5 for sure.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 545, "steamid": "76561197970578575", "last_played": 1506129572, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 189, "playtime_forever": 980}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506130363, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506130363, "recommendationid": "35141450", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I would recommend this game if it were $1. $5 seems like a lot for this.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007582729", "last_played": 1501717180, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_forever": 24}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506564683, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491334", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1506564683, "recommendationid": "35253023", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
