The physics are true-to-life and the graphics are incredible. The crashing animations are very accurate, and so are the physics. For example, hitting a traffic cone head on sends you flying 30 feet into the air, causing catastrophic damage to the exhaust system and rear bumper, but leaving not even a scratch on the front end.\n\nReccommend to everyone who like anything.
