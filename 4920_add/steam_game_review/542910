It allows for free placement of towers, rather than be limited to a few fixed locations.\n     -- Uber Towers Limited.  It has a couple of uber towers, but balances them out by throttling their ammunition replenishment so that their ubers effects are not continuous.\n     -- Nice Graphics.\n     -- Upgrades.  The layered choices in tower upgrades gives the feeling of more strategic choices, instead of the common approach in other TD games where you have a simple upgrade path and you always upgrade towers to the max.\nCaveat:  I only played the single player game.\nCons:\n     -- A couple of the towers I never found a use for.  I don't know whether they are glitched, or I simply missed the point of where they would be useful.\n     -- You must (of course) always have a valid path.  However, sometimes with a complicated maze, the game won't allow you to place a wall or tower in a valid location, because the changed path is too complicated.  The solution is to restart the level and change the order of placing towers so that you don't try to force a change from one complicated path to a completely different complicated path.\n     Eyeballing Required.  I may have missed these features, but at least as far as I know there are no options to pre-show the path the mobs will follow or to show a grid for tower placement.  This can result in misjudging the space so that you can't place a tower where you intended, or misjudging whether or not the mobs can pass thru a given narrow space.  A partial solution is that you can plan out your placement by placing walls, which are cheap and also function as the foundations for towers.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198029021012", "last_played": 1499038541, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 354, "playtime_forever": 4083}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1495991227, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495991227, "recommendationid": "32024498", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "*REFUNDED*\n\nexpected a Defence Grid clone, what I got was something that needs a heck of a lot of work, yes it's still in early access but the game looks like it was meant for the late 90's (UI looks horrible & placement of towers needs working on) [maybe make the towers even darker red if you can't place them at the place where your trying too, as it's very difficult to tell the difference at the moment] not something due out this year or maybe next.\n\nStill following to see if changes get made for next sale time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970959560", "last_played": 1498424271, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 1527, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1498641454, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498641454, "recommendationid": "32922492", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
