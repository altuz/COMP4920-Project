You run, get a crossbow, face different type of enemies, beat them, get collectibles, power-ups and improve your character. A lot of things to do. But it is not easy of course. You need to learn the game and get a combat style. There are farm areas so you can farm and make your character more powerful if you stuck. By the way arrows are too important so be careful about it because you can easily get outnumbered.\nGame has a big potential, I am sure patches will improve the gameplay more.\n\nGraphics quality and map design is very good. Maps are too big for a one-man game. Sometimes it reminds me oldschool games. If your character move behind a big rock or building, you can't see the character because there is no transparency. Sometimes it is a pain if you are in combat but not a big deal.\n\nIf you like challenging games, oldschool games this game provides you lots of fun.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198060013870", "last_played": 1478950695, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_forever": 110}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1479133533, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503437", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1479133533, "recommendationid": "26600273", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Painted Memories is a hack and slash game with a story around it. Having story in a 'kill anything you see' type of game makes you aware of the map and gives you another task in the game rather than shooting. You collect papers in the game to know about the story and a mysterious being talks to you sometimes. Well, the hack and slash part of the game is quite fun. You have a crossbow and you learn skills as you progress and kill bosses in the game. With these skills, you get options and varieties in a fight other than 'left click' to kill something. There are little puzzles in the game and little tricks in boss fights, which I enjoyed figuring out.  As for the negative things about the game; animations of the characters feel a bit off at first, but you get use to them. At some parts, ways you have to walk without doing anything are a bit long. Length of the game depends how you play it because you can stay in a map to level up your character's stats as long as you want. Overall, it's a fun game and you get what you expect from a hack and slash game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046170484", "last_played": 1482332301, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 49, "playtime_forever": 138}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1482335062, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501356", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1482335062, "recommendationid": "28509918", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
