Boy, was I wrong. The physics in this game are just plain awful, give and go's aren't a thing. Passing is a challenge. I thought maybe I was wrong, maybe that these guys didn't just pump out a title and get people excited about the PROMISE of a good hockey game to make a quick buck, but again - I was wrong. \n\nAt worst it's so shoddily put together it barely resembles hockey. \n\nThis game shouldn't just be another failed venture, hockey devs! You can make a really good hockey game, I believe in you! I just don't want people to pay money for this untl it's better.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198086666373", "last_played": 1502147375, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1500210909, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505582", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1500210909, "recommendationid": "33584678", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Personally I like this game really much, sure the game is rated as Mixed but...i dont really understand why, when buying this game don't hope for a title like NHL 2k series or NHL by EA sports which are franchises and have experience for many, many years. This game is made by V7 Entertainent which is low budget studio and thats way this game isn't as expensive like those games. This was my first hockey experience on PC since NHL 09 and I can say you one thing i liked this much more. This game is a sports game that gives me a very good laugh and also is very competetive. Some people are complaining about Story mode. Personally I love it, yes it can be difficult or tricky at some points but thats the meaning of arcade. If you dont't like it at all and you can't or you're just too lazy to complete the Story mode to unlock Story mode+ which is full season mode with any team you choose and without primary objectives then there is also a cheat code which unlocks the full season mode and other extras. Sure there are some minuses like wonky controls sometimes, missing keyboard support or some other, but developers are updating it and sometimes those minuses in game are those which make it so special. Also forgot to mention that i love soundtrack and artwork in this game.\n\nOverall: This won't be your ordinary NHL style game, dont expect to have the most realistic sports experience on PC, but this is really fun arcade sports game in which you will laugh and rage in same time and you will lose many time of your life. The price isn't the worse so you might give it a try. 7.9/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198037875885", "last_played": 1505981369, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 131, "playtime_forever": 2309}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1500053346, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510840", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1500053346, "recommendationid": "33540614", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a great arcade hockey game, most of the issues have been fixed and the game is still being  worked on.

Far from fluid, the controls feel clunky, every fight is a line brawl and takes away from play. Player skating feels like you're trying to control a jeep in GTA. Scoring points is just a matter of skating up in front of the goalie and passing into the net. That's if you manage to get behind the defenders who will line you up all day and make you regret stepping into their barn. One timers are non existent.
