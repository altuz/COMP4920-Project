Where it feels like your walking through impressive drawings that are real enough to make you feel that you are in a world but not completely realistic.  It is the main strength of this piece of work but just as a symphony needs all its pieces together to be perfect so does a game and unfortunately not all the pieces play together to make that perfect symphony.\nIt is the characters where the first few pieces fall apart. They aren\u2019t drawn like the background they are rendered with computers with eyes so dead that you would be staring into and abyss rather than eyes. It\u2019s a shame that the characters stick out  like a Picasso between ancient Greek architecture.\n\nThe character dialogue is overall well written and makes you feel for the characters in this tale but where is most stories you see the characters grow over time here you only get to know them. The story is so short that there is no room for growth of change, they stay at the same place and never change.\n\nLastly the voice acting, this is a hit and miss, like a drunk violinist it manages to sometimes play beautiful notes but overall it leaves a bad taste in your mouth for you know they could have done better. \n\nEven though the story and gameplay make it a fun game and does ask for more there are parts in this game that make the experience less. It\u2019s like a beautiful symphony that gets ruined by a drunk violinist and a conductor that seem lost to what the symphony is playing.\n\nIf you like story based games and can handle a short play this is one for you otherwise if the things I pointed out annoy you too much then this game is not for you, otherwise take a look and maybe you will be leaving with an orchestra playing swan lake for you.\n\nmy video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcKAscEfYxc", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030912594", "last_played": 1497171222, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 71, "playtime_forever": 169}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1497199854, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510127", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1497199854, "recommendationid": "32347067", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
