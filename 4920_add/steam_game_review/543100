Beat this Game less a hour, and i have a feeling more like a demo play, that a real game. One small level with two state, no story, no \"music maker\", high pile of unused items, couple of bugs, seems like unfinished EA. All \"game\" it self it's just collect sounds and in last part press highlighted buttons on mixer. \nIf review this like a demo, it's very promising, nice art and music, but not sure about more content or DLC later. \nSo just wait for discount or some kind of bundle with it.\nP.S.

So the unique mechanic in the game is finding sounds for 8 step sequencer (basically you can play the game to your own soundtrack created from those sounds) Was the mechanic utilized intuitively? Not really. It is just kind of there as a sandbox tool and it did not create any worthwhile gameplay elements. Although I really enjoyed the aesthetic there are noticeable issues with camera lag and the flickering world. For $7 I expected a more refined experience considering 60-90 minute length.\n\n[b] 8 Step Sequencer & Sound problems [/b]\n\nIf you ever tried composing music on PC you will find a familiar 8 step sequencer as the focus of this game (like a beat VST) Which is a really cool concept but the game does not incorporate it well into gameplay.For a game that is meant to be all about sound, there are significant audio problems. You can turn your own music on/off but there are other sounds around you. So music ends up overlapping and being annoying as a result. Maybe the music in the world should stop if you using the sequencer? Who listens to 2 songs at the same time. On top of that, some of the loops have a rather irritating sound quality. Also, most of the game has no voice acting except a useless menu announcer that only breaks the immersion of the game.\n\n[b] Aeshteics [/b]\n\nI really like the design in general. There are some amusing animated moments and the only stage has a very cool surreal environment. Now the problem is that I expected more stages. The game even tells you in the \"Help\" that completing a DJ part takes you to next stage (it takes you to the credits) Unfortunately, there are some visual glitches and frankly, the movement feels a bit bumpy. You can control the game with Point&Click, WASD or Analog. So at least they provided enough control options. It looks fine but if I was to justify the price based on animation quality alone it would have to be longer.\n\n[b] Poorly paced experience & Lack of intuitive puzzles [/b]\n\nThe game throws you into the level with too much going on at the same time. Things are happening and I am not sure why they are happening. You can find different items that automatically interact with objects around the level ( which is technically not a puzzle at that point ) I am not even sure if every item had a purpose. So I guess this game is closer to the interactive cartoon which would be fine if it was paced better. You meet few characters and there is not much interaction. The game has virtually no dialogue so I had no idea what is going on. \n\n [h1] Final Thoughts 5/10  [/h1]\n\n[i] Beat the Game [/i] feels like a great game that is half way done. It has enjoyable aesthetic and good ideas that are not very realized. Loose visual narrative and distracting pace did not create a very immersive experience. The anticlimactic ending with the unexplained story was not satisfying. Maybe if they make more levels it could be sufficient game ( if it really took them 3 years to make one level I would not count on it ) Unless they make a patch that adds more levels it is not worth $7.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995669628", "last_played": 1504890434, "num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 597, "playtime_forever": 112}, "votes_up": 21, "timestamp_created": 1504815885, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515163", "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1504916366, "recommendationid": "34802025", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not bad at all: Original, fun and the price is fair!

The mechanism of finding and collecting sounds is fun to play, and the world that the developers have created is beautiful and surreal.\n\nThe obvious caveat with this game is that it is unlikely to take you more than an hour or so to complete. It's clear that the developers meant to make a much longer game; there are characters and objects that tie into future parts of the story that just don't exist. (Despite the 'to be continued', I don't expect the full game ever to see the light of day.)\n\nIt would be sad, though, to let that put you off completely. What is there of the game is well-realised and complete in itself -- the level that you play does lead you up to a satisfying end point. The mechanisms are fun, and I hugely enjoyed playing it.\n\nMy only real criticism, beyond the short length, is that there's little help in finding the sounds. They're mostly easy to discover, but I ended up spending the last twenty minutes or so wandering around trying to find the one missing sound. A hint system would have been helpful!\n\nSo, this is a beautiful, fun, and unique game. It's sad that it was cut short, but I'm happy to have played it and am glad that it was released rather than just dying in obscurity on a developer's hard drive.
