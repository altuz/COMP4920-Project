If you don`t like reading too much, maybe this genre of games is not for you. There are moments where you can \"interact\" with your environment, but due to the games nature it`s more reading than \"playing\".\nWhen you enjoy good writing, excellent voice acting and less interactivity, this game is perfect for you. \n\nI`m a big fan of visual novels and as soon as I saw this game in a store nearby for the PS4, I was in love with it. Unfortunately I don`t own a PS4, so when I saw it on steam today, I immediately bought it.\nJust played 2 hours of the game in total, and I`m totally amazed!\nThe backgrounds are fantastic and I love the voice acting.\nThe soundtrack is pleasent and supports the atmosphere of the individual scenes without being \"too much\" and the story is captivating and thrilling.  The story shapes depending on your \"actions\". Which increases the re-play enjoyment.\nMaybe a good \"starter novel\" for people who haven`t played any VNs yet? \n\n+++++ Maybe \"spoiler\" up to chapter 2 ++++++\n\nWhat happened to Fumino Aya? (Japanese way of introducing is the family name first, then the given name)\nBtw a nice play on words as Fumino Aya can be also read as \"Fumi no Aya\", which is \"Letter from Aya\" or \"Ayas letter\".\nAya is a penpal from 15 years ago who suddenly stopped writing to you. But then you find a unopened letter from her, in which she states that she has killed someone and can`t write to you anymore. You`re confused. What does she mean? Why have you not seen this letter 15 years ago when it arrived? And why is this \"new\" letter missing a post stamp?\nYou decide to look for Aya and travel to her hometown where you find a vacant lot instead of her home. You learn that there was a fire 15 years ago, which burned the house down. But why is everbody mentioning that Aya herself is dead already 25 years? And what about those \"ghost sightings\" of Aya after her death? Who wrote those letters to you?\nIs Fumino Aya really dead?\n\nIt is thrilling to learn more and more about the backstory.

What it lacks is probably the conclusion/ending part seems to be too convenient. This game has 5 endings, but the main plot is pretty much the same except the ending part.

You wont sit down and say \"oh so thats what was going on\" after finishing even the true ending.\n\nMy bigest complain is about how game handles investigation parts. Developers found inspiration in Phoenix Wright series and made investigation parts flashy shouting contest. \nGame is buiding up pretty good tense ghost story and then it throws it all out of window and gives you ridiculus interrogation scene, where protagonist is shouting at NPCs until they break down.\nI mean the interrogation scenes (or investigation how the games likes to call it) arent bad or anything, but they just dont fit well with the ghost story spirit.\n\nI really feel this game would be better of if it was less flashy and more serious.

The story is great and you can't but help to scratch your head at what it all means once you get deeper into the mystery. As I'm writing this review, I am still only on the 4th chapter of my 1st playthrough, but I recommend this game quite highly for those who like visual novels, mysteries, and don't mind all the reading involved. You should also note that there isn't much going on gameplay-wise, but it is a little different from some visual novels. \n\nEdit: So I finished the game some time ago and have seen all 5 endings (there are no character routes for those who want to know). There is a possibility that the endings might not satisfy everyone, but I was personally fine with them as they were all interesting in there own way as an explanation to what was going on.

I wouldn't recommend it for your first VN as it can be a bit slow and boring in places; I don't think it can capture a first time reader's attention.\n\nMy playtime is 14 hours. It took about 10 hours to clear the first route, so the remaining 4 is for the rest of the endings. Skipping dialogue I'd already read, of course.\n\nThe art is very good, very high quality. Music is decent but forgettable.\n\nThe atmosphere feels very calm and serene despite the subject matter. There really isn't a sense of urgency apart from certain endings. Selecting/clearing a route is very easy: simply select only the first options in letters and you will get the first ending, only the second options for the second ending, etc.\n\nThe game tries to be more interactive than most visual novels  by giving you options to \"Move\", \"Ask\", \"Check\", access \"Inventory\", \"Think\", use \"Guidebook\", and \"Smartphone\". At worst, this feels unnatural and unnecessary. At best, it's a fun option during investigations (which I'll get to in a bit). There is a feature called Max Mode which you use in certain situations, usually investigations, to say the right thing. It feels a bit like the game is trying to emulate Danganronpa in that way.\n\nInvestigations take place in each chapter when you have to confirm the identity of Aya's friends. Most of the time, it is quite simple to select the correct options, but occassionally there is trial and error to it. Luckily you only actually have to complete them the first ending you get; after this, there is a \"skip chapter\" function which is best left until after you reply to a letter. \n\nThe characters are, for the most part, decently written, with some questionable aspects to a few like Nozu/Chibi (why on earth did he ___? it doesn't really make sense). Takayuki, the protagonist, is passable, but has moments of being exasperatingly dense and coming off as simply a trash human being. Taking advantage of someone's phobia to force them into a panic attack in order to get information...really?\n\nOverall, it was an adequate experience.
