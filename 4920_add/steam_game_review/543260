Nice handdrawn sprites with lots of new backgrounds in multiple parallax layers, adding more atmosphere due to the feeling of depth. My only complaint is that the remixed soundtrack sometimes diverges too much from the original compositions, I would have preferred a more subtle interpretation. Most tracks are beautiful though and I really appreciate the option to mix and match original content with remake content such that the new graphics can be combined with the original music or vice versa.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the original, it is a platforming action RPG where you travel to different areas, always on the path to the next dungeon in which to beat the next boss. After defeating a boss, you get transformed into some new form, each one having their own unique abilities enabling you to reach previously unreachable areas where you can find new stores in which to by better equipment and reach the next dungeon. The different forms into which you are transformed enable you to run up certain walls (as Mouse-Man), swim under water (Pirahna-Man), hit blocks above you and below you with your sword (Lion-Man) and fly (Hawk-Man). Later in the game you can access certain rooms where you can change back and forth between all forms unlocked so far. It all creates a Zelda-like feeling where you often backtrack to previously visited areas because you realize you can now access parts which were unreachable earlier.\n\nThe remake changes almost nothing gameplaywise, the few tweaks feeling like improvements. There are a few additions like difficulty levels, the hardest one making you take damage as time progresses and unlocking an achievement upon completion, and newly created short dungeons to complete for each character granting you access to one final piece of equipment upon completing all of them.\n\nThis is who a remake is supposed to be done: cosmetic upgrades to visuals and audio, minor tweaks and some small additional areas and/or features. The end result is the same magical feeling created by the original and whether you feel like enjoying the experience with new high-quality graphics and audio or prefer the originals, the experience is superior to taking out your old Master System and playing the original yet again (not that I don't recommend adding the original game to you collection).", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198005269294", "last_played": 1504565653, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 161, "playtime_forever": 548}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505077812, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505077812, "recommendationid": "34871320", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Beautifull remake of a wonderfull game.

It was a visual treat from start to finish.\n\n+ The option to toggle between retro and modern sound AND graphics was also really cool.  Clearly there was a lot of love put into the remake here.\n\n+ The game itself is kinda fun.  It has a clearly articulated world with bouncy innocence, and some neat proto-action-rpg elements.\n\nNow, the bad, which completely ruined this game for me:\n\n- The controls.\n\nYep, just that.  They were so unbelievably heavy, imprecise, and tank-like that it almost sapped all the fun out of my experience.  If terrible controls are charming to you, then the positives I mentioned above will probably win the day for you.  But beware: I'm not exaggerating when I say that this game has the WORST controls I have ever experienced in a video game.  I really wish the developers had provided an option to play with either \"original\" or \"modern\" controls.
