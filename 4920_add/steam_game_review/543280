Very well designed and sounds great.  What would give it additional versatility would be some  extra switchable sound patches. \n\nThe only downside is that fast sequences don't seem possible but I'm not sure whether that is just down to the patch having a slow attack time or an inherent limitation on the controller position detection algorithm being used.\n\nI hope people support this and allow you to develop this further.

Don`t buy this if you have any musical leanings, your ears will NEVER forgive you. It`s in no recognisable way, a musical instrument. \n- To begin with, the image is very , very jittery and flits all over the place making it virtually impossible to hit the beam you are aiming for, It`s not my rift, which is set up perfectly. (Every other game has a rock solid image), I suspect poor optimization/performance. \nSecondly, you seem only to be able to actually play notes with your LEFT Oculus touch hand/controller, I couldn`t play a single note with my right controller. The other controls octave, scale, sample etc. \nLastly (and by far the worst fault), every control input, in fact ANYTHING you do with your right hand, is accompanied by various bleeps and bloops. If you WERE managing to squeeze something actually melodic out of the program, those bleeps and bloops will punctuate and ruin it.\nSorry to be so critical, but I use a lot of Electronic Music hardware and software and I just hated this.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198088829328", "last_played": 1504129364, "num_reviews": 83, "num_games_owned": 612, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504130412, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504130471, "recommendationid": "34619548", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
