Needs more proofreading (there's a handful of typos, as well as two odd instances of what look like placeholder notes that were accidentally left in), but the writing has a wonderfully dreamy, poetic feel, flowing from one thought to the next, sometimes vague as to what the protagonist is actually saying out loud and what she's thinking. The art is beautiful, and the music really builds up the atmosphere.\n\nI was all set to give this a positive review, and then a twist ending abruptly sucked everything interesting and ambiguous out of the story, leaving only a husk of tired cliche, and I just felt cheated.
