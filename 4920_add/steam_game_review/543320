I came across it by accident, but it looked promising, so I checked out the discussion page to see if the game had native controller support. It must have been my lucky day, because according to a post from the developer, it had just been added. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nI bought the game today and installed it immediately, but after half an hour of gameplay, I'm giving up. The [b]graphics[/b] are cute but not impressive, and the [b]soundtrack[/b] has an annoying [i]\"tinkling\"[/i] effect that grates easily. What really makes me want to return the game for a refund, though, is the [u]poor job that's been done with controller support[/u].\n\n[h1]Controller Issues[/h1]\n\nThe controls make you feel like the character is sliding around on ice all the time. Jumps are inconsistent, meaning that sometimes you jump after a button press, and sometimes you don't. When the jump doesn't execute properly, the character will instead just slide around and glide off the numerous narrow cliffs that make up the platforming aspect of the game. \n\nThe distances and heights that your character jumps when a button press results in an actual jump are also inconsistent and actually made worse when simultaneously pressing a directional joystick. I can't even use the potions in my inventory, becuse the cursor just keeps scrolling over the whole inventory landing on some obscure potion I wasn't trying to get to in the first place. \n\nI strongly urge the dev to revisit controller support for the XBox 360 and perhaps tighten up other aspects of the game as well. I'd be glad to give it another try at that point.\n\n[h1]Edit 1/11/17:[/h1] \n\nI wanted to update my review to let readers know that the developer has reached out to me and is taking steps to fix these issues. I spoke with him extensively about what I was experiencing on both wired XBox 360 and Steam controllers and also shared my specs with him so he could troubleshoot. It's my understanding that the developer intends to remove the controller support notation from the store page until issues are resolved, and I've made myself available for further runthroughs. This is exactly the kind of developer that I like to meet, because while a perfect review would be lovely, a specific critical review is just as valuable.

Even if you dodge the gamepad problem, you'll probably still think the game crashed. This is because the game does not have a loading screen.

I know it's got plenty of negative reviews, but it looked so neat - jumping around, making potions to use against the enemies.... sadly, it's even worse than my already low expectations for it were.\n\n* That blue world with the floating platforms? That's THE ENTIRE GAME. Exploration is pointless. There's never anything new to see.\n\n* Combat isn't fun. You just throw little short-range shots that stun enemies so you can walk past them. Also, it feels like hit boxes are off because I keep dying at times when I could swear the enemy never actually touched me.\n\n* Alchemy is boring and limited. Ingredients aren't super rare, but they are fairly far between and it never seems like I have what I need to make what I want. Also, there's no combining on the fly, you have to find a cauldron in the world and pay money to mix potions. Why?\n\nI know people probably won't believe me. They're going to vote this review as \"unhelpful\" because they want to believe the game that looks cool is cool and that I'm just a hater. Believe me - everything you're thinking I thought too.
