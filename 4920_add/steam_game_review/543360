No, seriously. It tries to be a Mario/Sonic/Late 90's pick-up-a-thons with shittier platforming mechanics and even shittier level design. Not to mention the achievements are...the same? Same name, same icon...but one is unlockable fairly easily but the other is a hidden achievement. What? So for the 5 mins or so I played it, I suppose you're supposed to control this...thing, which looks like a flask or something, and collect thingies around the map. These give you points. Oh, and you can open up a spawn menu and spawn a whole bunch of shit to supposedly help you around the level. Feels like an assignment for a game development student due to be passed up next week and done the week before. Something that I would so totally do, if I were one. Get it for the stickers and achievement I guess.
