Even though this game is still in Early Access, it shows great potential compared to similar titles, since it gives the player the freedom to explore this dystopian world where robots fight your battles to become the greatest ruler amongst your chosen faction.\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Sand-box style exploration: wander around this immense world to conquer as many cities as you want. This type of title guarantees endless hours of entertainment.\n[*] Diverse factions: choose which side are you on and crush the other factions to become the greatest ruler on the planet!\n[*] Simple gameplay: this sci-fi game combines both RPG and real-time strategy games dynamics in order to have both great battles and economy-driven dynamics. Farm resources, build factories, create robots and get ready to attack all of your enemies to make your faction the strongest one in the world.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Lack of tutorial: I hope the devs add a brief explanation of the controls on the next updates. Some dynamics need a better description, especially when it comes to navigation. However, if you\u2019ve already played this type of game, this shouldn\u2019t bother you at all because the interface is pretty intuitive.\n[*]  Needs more diversity: there aren\u2019t types of robots included yet and some elements are repetitive. Probably, these changes will be added on further updates when this game is finished.\n[/list]\n\nI\u2019d recommend buying this game because it has a lot of potential to become a great title after its minor issues are solved.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198138083145", "last_played": 1500774016, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 69}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1500772820, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498774", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1500772820, "recommendationid": "33733610", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's a interesting game with some more game mechanics can become a great game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198406758819", "last_played": 1500748249, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 37}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1500748547, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493836", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1500748547, "recommendationid": "33726988", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
