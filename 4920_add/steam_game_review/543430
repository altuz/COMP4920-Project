But it has some flaws that makes it sometimes impossible to guess the right solution. Basically it's buildup like a classic IQ-Test. 3x3 fields on which the right lower corner field is empty. Find the hidden patterns which can be anticipated by rules deducted from horizontal or vertical rules that apply. Unfortunately some of the 135 levels are corrupted with some missing fields in the pattern. The biggest problem is indeed that you have to assemble the solution out of given shapes on a gridlined background. Means it turns out  more like a puzzle game than a thinking game. Some stars inside a hexagon can take minutes to find the right positions. Another bah is the scoremeter in the middle screen showing how close you are to the solution. It's just too slow, timewasting and non indicative what's wrong.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035285721", "last_played": 1496521086, "num_reviews": 397, "num_games_owned": 3499, "playtime_forever": 122}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1497055461, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517832", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1497055461, "recommendationid": "32305443", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
