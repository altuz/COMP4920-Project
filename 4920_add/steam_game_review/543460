I enjoyed the game overall a bit short and a very not so present New Game+. . . you can go back through with your levels with a manual mission select but is this NG+ ? no it is just a chapter select so bad points on that. I do like the mulitplayer even though it is not part of the main game I would like to see a drop in mulitplayer for the giggles and a expanded coop online that already is there.\n\nThe online is cool in the sense that you are very much tight for time in much ways like the first games so that really brought back some fun, though since the single player is not like that it is very easy to build up then beat the game any time.\n\n Frank Rising DLC is decent but short again drop in coop would be really fun even if it wasn't perfect. Overall story is average and maybe a bit of a bump up to good after the DLC. Combat is fun and proabably some of the more pleasant shooting in the dead rising series but i do have a really good set up so I don't know how good it would be for someone who doesn't play with settings. melee is enjoyable ish but needs to make more side to side attacks because the zombies are a bit smarter. That being said the zombies are fairly smart in combat a bit stupid out of combat (they actually come at your back and get hits in).\n\nIf this game continues to get updated it could really be awesome just needs more filler for mulitplayer and maybe a DLC that add 4 more cases or some more random fun stuff to do in the game to give people more reason to stay after the beating of the game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 531, "steamid": "76561198118846962", "last_played": 1506465025, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 102, "playtime_forever": 2310}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506146302, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497735", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1506146302, "recommendationid": "35145141", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Thumbs down as well.

You know one guy was killed cause people broke down the doors and trampled him, one example as to why humans are mindless heartless selfish zombies...
