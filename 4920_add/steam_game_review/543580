I bought this for my friend who just got VR and it is the game that makes people laugh the most when they see people grabbing for the corn poop. \n\nPros: Funny, a good workout, 4 different diverse levels, additional modes for fun (poop paint and plunger archery), hilarious sound effects, fun for the player and the crowd watching them, leaderboards, decent price, \nCons: Sometimes grabbing the right item with all the poop everywhere can be tricky, tracking is nearly perfect. \n\nI recommend this game if you want a workout and a good laugh!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065555393", "last_played": 1502091694, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 240, "playtime_forever": 96}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502523870, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1502523870, "recommendationid": "34185787", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
