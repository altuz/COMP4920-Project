You can slide sideways or you take your thumb off the touchpad and keep moving. The volume can be too loud, especially in the underground level and church. The gun's aiming was off. Finally, the game is too dark and you can see screen door effect. \n\nNow the good. This was a great use of arm swing locomotion, though I'd enable it for both controllers instead of just the left, ie The Bellows. I know it was just a novelty game in time for Halloween, but I really enjoyed being able to move through the linear space naturally and I hope to see more game developers make use of this. Since this was a maze, I had to backtrack often. In games like this and Island 359, you have to develop a sense of VR direction to help you navigate or you can get lost really easily.\n\nSome suggestions to the developer:\nPlease work on the collision detection. If I lean in to look at a witch's cauldron, I don't want to be artifically pushed back as that causes motion sickness, plus it breaks my immersion. The same thing happens on maze walls. We need the hitbox to be smaller or something. Also, maybe use some more lighting effects from objects. Just putting glowing objects in an environment with no light is unnatural, \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994331093", "last_played": 1495770828, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 72, "playtime_forever": 67}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1477266807, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508417", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1477266807, "recommendationid": "26191514", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This was actually pretty fun.

It felt like I was walking down a single path that occasionally had a minor branch off that ended almost immediately.

More locations than just a corn maze.    I like the variety of monsters.  I like the swing arm motion--it has the most presence and therefore is ideal for a horror game.  Good atmosphere and sound--maybe a little cartoony, but scary enough.  The jump scares were particularly effective--I'd have liked to have had more!  This game is probably more fun for non-gamers and people new to VR. Reason: just one or two hits from the guns could kill anything. To rachet up the tension, maybe have the monsters take a number of hits before they die, with bigger monsters taking more.
