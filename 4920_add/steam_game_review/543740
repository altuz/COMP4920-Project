I personally know what it means to get something completed and on the market! As a single person developer it is an enormous accomplishment and something to be very very proud of!\n\nNow for the review!\nPros:\n- I love the scenary, the detail and the effects. The bookshelves, the furniture, the tiles and objects are very good.\n- Overall the graphics are good and satisfying for me. The cutscenes are great and the detailed portraits are fantastic\n- Personally I like the simplistic click actions\n- I am intrigued in the story. I loved the cutscenes and felt they did a decent job of pulling you in.\n- The fact that loot is the number one goal in order to get stronger is a good feature.\n- The UI Windows and the action bar look great. A bit on the simplistic side, but thats a good thing!\n\nCons:\n- Lack of a skill system\n- Lack of a crafting sytem\n\nOverall I give the game a very enthusiastic thumbs up! Yes, a skill system would ensure the games position as an RPG, but in reality a Role Playing Game means you assume the role of the character in the game and lead the character through the story, making decisions for him, that is all a RPG is in a nutshell. A skill system in my opinion is a definite feature we all love and a crafting system would definitely put things over the top!\n\nIn conclusion, be proud of what you have accomplished, listen to the critiques but don't take any immature remarks or comments to heart. After doing this for 15 years, you will see the trolls crawl out from under their bridges with no good criticisms and downright bullying attitudes along with a pack attack mentality. Don't get discouraged and be proud because you have made a major accomplishment here!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969809521", "last_played": 1501992957, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 120, "playtime_forever": 1487}, "votes_up": 15, "timestamp_created": 1501948677, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522641", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1501948951, "recommendationid": "34041049", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you like these types of games or indie games in general, or maybe you just don't have anything to play atm but you just wanna play something? Then this game might be for you!?\n\nThis game is not \"groundbreaking or a crazy RPG-game\" but a very good & kind of simple game with fun gameplay & exploration.\n\n\nAlrighty then, It took me just over 7 hours to complete the first episode/story of this isometric game while I was exploring all the zones, I really enjoyed it and want a episode two! :D\n\n\n___________________________________________\n+Graphics - I really like the medieval setting & art style in this game. \"Weather effects looks good\"\n\n+Gameplay - Is responsive and satisfying when you block/parry and counter attack. You need to eat or sleep to regain HP.\n\n+Sound - Good sound actually, really like the thunder!\n\n+Interface - Very clean and simplistic, I like that you have to read the dialog yourself, I get a old school \"nostalgia trip\" from it haha, oh I feel so old now..\n\n+Weapons/Armor - You can loot better gear from enemies or buy it from vendors. \"You can get gold from looting enemies or selling stuff to a vendor\"\n\n+World - The world have a pretty decent size with 11 different zones and 2 dungeons \"I believe it was\", one where I almost got killed & lost in because there was different ways to run but eventually I found my way out by dragging a table to an edge and jumped out. So the exploration is really fun in this game!\n\n+Story - The story was a little short but very interesting and I really enjoyed it, but now I wanna know what happens next! \"if there will be a episode two\" :)\n___________________________________________\n\n\n\n I actually like the game and are kind of impressed by the solo developer of this game that apparently have created the game & the engine by himself!\n\nI really recommend this game, It's totally worth the low price to support the solo-developer for future content!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997993228", "last_played": 1502217438, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 270, "playtime_forever": 423}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1502148942, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514211", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1502226234, "recommendationid": "34091798", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ignore the user tag about this being an RPG. Also the game description talks about developing skills. There are no skills that I could tell, and this isn't an RPG. Yes you have an inventory system, but you can't choose your name, character class, no exp or levelling or skill upgrade system at all that I could see. \n\nYour first couple tasks are easy fetch quests designed to introduce you to the game. Ok, fair enough. Then you fight a rat, Ok, whatever. Then you are dumped onto a map where 10 bandits swarm you even if you try to sneak past them (there are choke points that make sneaking past them impossible). Maybe you could defeat a bandit one on one, but you can't isolate or fight them one on one, so you have to run away from them to the edge of the map. And of course on the next map they magically have stopped chasing you. After THREE MORE maps of this running away because I can't sneak or fight b.s. I figured I'd had enough and requested a refund. BTW after less than an hour of gameplay I already had 3 of 7 total achievements, indicating how shallow and mindless this is. \n\nThis feels like a teenager did this. Sure, it's a nice project for a teenager or some weekend warrior programmer with game design aspirations. But it's absolutely not anywhere near the level where it should be sold on Steam.

Also, the game is childish and lacking in depth. This becomes clear very soon into your journey, pretty much the first dialogue your character engages in is sarcastic and infintile. \n\nThe controls are horrible and the stats and character building are almost non existent. The combat is hack and slash style and the enemies you engage with tiresomely chase you like a pacman.\n\nEven the UI experience is childlike with oversized buttons and text. The whole experience grated on me after about five minutes, after completing a dumb fetch quest and awkwardly pushing boxes into a barn - a frustrating experience.\n\nI actually like the graphics style, and a lot of work has gone into this...but its simply just not enough to make up for the lack of everything else in every other department.\n\nPerhaps the only way to rescue this game would be to withdraw it and rewrite it and redesign it - with a different writer and designer (maybe someone with a little less sarcasm who treats the RPG genre with a little more respect).\n\nRefund requested.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992717088", "last_played": 1501893184, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 100, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1501946121, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494205", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1501946121, "recommendationid": "34040155", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
