You can turn the sound on or off, but you can't adjust the volumes.\n\nThe translation is so bad that I couldn't figure out how to actually build the robots. The broken English instructions simply did not make sense. EDIT: okay, you click the building, then you click the icon with the arrow towards the door, which is normally the exit button. Yep click that one. Then you can click assemble.\n\nThere's a resource which I think might be Mass? But if you build lots of buildings, you can't do anything else that I can tell. EDIT: You get mass later, once you start fighting.\n\nYou can't delete buildings either, as far as I can see.\n\nAnd then there's the killer; even if you delete the saved game, your new game has the same resources that you ended the last game with. So that game I finished with a lot of buildings and 7 mass and I wanted to reset? Yeah, now I have no buildings and 7 mass and can't build anything. NOTE: If you delete all files and reinstall the game, you can restart the game. I'm not sure if a simple uninstall/reinstall works, I tried manually deleting all files instead. EDIT: uninstall and reinstall does work.\n\nVery basic bug checking would have fixed that, and very basic translations would have fixed the other issue.\n\nThis game should have never been released as a full game and the creator should feel ashamed.\n\nEDIT: after playing more and learning the game, it's terribly grindy. It seems there's special ships that you can only randomly get, so to get the best ones you've gotta run hundreds of maps repetitively. Also, to build the best attack bots, you've got to wait for resources to build up ...  it's a cross between a bad idle game and a bad strategy game.\n\nEDIT: after playing for several hours, I'm even more sad, due to how much potential this game has.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993624207", "last_played": 1497335909, "num_reviews": 38, "num_games_owned": 1377, "playtime_forever": 630}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1496956817, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506267", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497325910, "recommendationid": "32276385", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
