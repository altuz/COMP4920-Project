It's not very competitive, but has decent mechanics that get the job done. Compared to the later titles, Storm 2 may fall a bit short in the gameplay and roster, but the story mode has the same quality standards, telling the events of the first half of Naruto Shippuden. Personally, i also think that the music is better in this title. There's an online mode, but don't expect to find much activity there. I played it mainly for the story mode, and enjoyed it. The bosses and QTE's were nice, and the post-game side quests not too bad. And the game on 60 FPS is another beast. The weakest points are the english voices, the corridor style world map, and maybe the lack of some features that were present in the original Naruto Storm. It's a good game if you're a Naruto fan, and on PC i didn't found any major issues.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198190380543", "last_played": 1504951522, "num_reviews": 217, "num_games_owned": 630, "playtime_forever": 2228}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1504952893, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514682", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1504952893, "recommendationid": "34834039", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is so nostalgic i love it im so happy it has come to steam better graphics and runs at  60fps online is a little dull but im hoping to find a few people to fight! \nSo if you want to livein up the online play join this official naruto storm 2 discord server @  https://discord.gg/y2EbgxN or just add me :) THIS IS THE BEST STORM GAME!
