It's very smooth (with a great art style), it oozes mystery and intrigue \u2013 and of course clever puzzles.\n\nPros\n- A clever system of puzzle-solving involving 5 blocks with unique abilities, such as teleporting or moving across immaterial platforms\n- Great art style with lots of polish\n- A set of controls, individually quite simple, which combine to be very challenging \u2013 forcing you to really think about each move you make\n\nCons\n- There are a few bugs in version 1.0, such as occasionally loosing control of the characters (the blocks) and checkpoints seemingly activating before they're supposed to. Restarting usually solves this.\n\nCheck out some gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nraCEmsG53M\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030287064", "last_played": 1492753436, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 110, "playtime_forever": 166}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1492932557, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516128", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492932557, "recommendationid": "31313962", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
