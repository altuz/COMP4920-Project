With no reviews other than just negative votes, I felt I would step in for a text review. The review will be broken up into sections with \"----\".\n\n----\nYou aim with your head and the controls seem standard enough. \nLeft Controller\n1) Trackpad : Movement\n2) Trigger : Weapon Switch\nRight Controller\n1) Trackpad : Boost\n2) Trigger : Fire Weapons\n\nMovement is not teleporting as you're in a mech. Standard left controller trackpad movement is sliding at a steady speed. It is done by holding your thumb over the direction you wish to go, so there is no need to hold the trackpad down. I am a victim of motion sickness in some games with sliding movement, but not in this. I actually like the movement in Z'Code. Movement isn't to fast or slow so it works great. However, boosting might throw you for a loop with no trackpad experience,\n\n----\nGraphics are fair and I didn't have to many game performance issues. I did however notice a small dip in FPS in two areas of the game on a GTX 970. None of which were game breaking\n\n----\nGame Modes\n1) Easy\n2) Medium\n3) Hard\n\nI have only played easy & for whatever reason after finishing it, neither medium or hard unlocked. What's worse is you top it off with a language barrier for some people. If you can't read Mandarin Chinese you are out of luck. When you click on a locked game mode there is no English explanation.\n\n----\nAI isn't wonderful. I can slightly excuse this, but it needs to be pointed out. Once in the tracked distance of the AI they'll just open fire in a sort of straight path. Shots are very easy to avoid. This could be different in higher game modes, but as explained above I couldn't play higher than Easy.\n\n-----\nGame dialogue isn't voice acted. While playing a lady starts talking in large boxes of text in the bottom left corner of your cockpit. These mission messages disappear very quickly. Unless you are a speed reader and/or can keep the Vive in that sweat spot to read text you'll be missing a majority of what is said.\n\n----\nWeapons\n\nStandard Weapons: \n1) Chain Guns/Rail Guns/Machine Guns : Take you pick in name. It's just a quick shooting gun.\n2) Blaster/Energy Gun : A single round ball comes out both guns on your mech.\n\nPower Up\n1) Missles : Once you get enough energy these take over your standard weapon. You have little control over them as they simi-seek out enemies.\n\nSpecial Weapons (This is the ones I remember and/or only got to see in \"Easy\". These are dropped randomly on enemy kills).\n1) Power Blaster : Stronger than the normal standard blaster. Yet limited in ammo & honestly not to great.\n2) Power Chain Gun: Again better than the standard one. Better amount of ammo than the Blaster, but some what effective.\n3) Lasers : These seem very over powered. You shoot two beams out your mech to mow down a number of enemies like it was nothing. In fact, the final boss in this game can be destroyed with them. I happened to pick lasers up after one of the swarm of enemies before the final boss. I killed the boss in a matter of seconds with lasers. It made it literally no challenge at all.\n\n----\nGame Length is very short on Easy. I can't comment on medium or hard as stated before it wouldn't unlock. I finished this game in around 0.3hrs Steam time, or in other words about 18 minutes. For how short this game is & the slight issues I can't recommend this game for that alone.\n\n----\nAchievements seem to be broken. It's no biggy to myself, but it seems the old chivo's are broken, so achievement grinders want be happy.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197978585548", "last_played": 1478684957, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 5276, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 28, "timestamp_created": 1478685087, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558455", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1478740113, "recommendationid": "26500995", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I HATE TO DO IT BUT DONT GET IT YET, IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE GREAT, BUT AS IS IT MADE ME VOMIT, NO JOKE LITERALLY UPCHUCKED AFTER PLAYING THIS GAME, I DONT USUALLY HAVE ISSUES WITH IT AS I HAVE STRONG VR LEGS.
