Basically you're trying to survive in the first few days of the apocalypse. Each day you have to decide what you want to do and where you want to go. Each decision takes time out of the day. My first playthrough was 8 hours. How about some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-So many stats, even more at the end of the game ;)\n-Excellent character creation. Attribute and Skills system. I really liked the skills system, there's alot to choose from. \n-Lots of characters. \n-Revenge options! Sweet revenge, drool......\n-I did enjoy my death scene, I'd give myself some kind of acting award. \n\nCons:\n-No saves. I made a foolish decision and died, but I wanted to continue playing as that character. Had to pick all my stats again, then play through what I found a very slow game just to get to that same point. \n-Don't really get to know the characters, I found them pretty generic. \n-Crafting system. I didn't think it was necessary. More time could have been spent on developing characters. \n\nFinal Verdict:\nIf your going to buy this game make a really interesting character. Like a banker robber or something. The story is just too slow and the other characters too generic. If you don't mind a slow story the game is worth the price, and has alot of replay value.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198103497349", "last_played": 1501125964, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 480}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1501128191, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501216", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501128270, "recommendationid": "33823711", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I have been a fan of this developer and their interactive story games for a qhile, not including this (Zombie Exodus) I think I own 3 or four of their previous games and despite the short-comings these sort of games may or may-not have they've been really good.  And then I bought this one.\n\nYou see first I downloaded the demo, it was ok, short, naturally as you dont wantt o give the entire thing away but enough to make me sure that this like the others was well written and structured to be worth buying.  However after playing to it's conclusion all  I can say is that I feel conned.\n\nPrevious interactive games by this creator have been full stories, a beginning, middle, and end of sorts, and they've been great, sure some may be split across separate volumes but overall they have been worth the money because they have had been long-enought o keep you satisfired.\n\nThis however is a travesty, you get PART of the entire story, a chunk of it that is very short, and leaves you in the position of having buy the next part in the story if you want to continue. It feel like the remaining parts were locked behind a paywall, and nominal fee or not, the developers are still holding the remaining parts of the story to ransom, with an attitude of pay up otherwise you don't get to continue the game through to it's conclusion like you've been able to in numerous other intactive story games this publisher has released in the past. \n\nIn it's current state and given that you pretty much only get a small fragment of the game for the price, and it most definateyly isn't worth it, I WOULD NOT recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057258664", "last_played": 1500949607, "num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 297, "playtime_forever": 50}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1500949733, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489327", "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_updated": 1500985362, "recommendationid": "33777814", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
