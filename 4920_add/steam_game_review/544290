By that, I mean that I purchased this game for my son to play because he really enjoyed the single-player game [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/453750/Tyto_Ecology/]Tyto Ecology[/url].  Figured it would be his first MMORPG.  But I found myself playing this game together with him to do the puzzles and then kept on playing after he went to bed \"so I could help him out better\" the next day.\n\nHow is the game?  It's an educational game!  Designed to be fun!  And it succeeds in both.  My son was so busy collecting pets [spoiler]PEGACORN![/spoiler] , outfits, and stuff for his in-game home that he really got into all of the puzzles and learning quests.  We're talking simple things like which animals eat what food to complex things like heredity and behavior.\n\nHow is the Early Access?  I haven't seen any bugs or had the game crash at all.  There is new content and improvements added on a regular basis and regular (31 as of this review) communication from the developers here on Steam.
