The game revolves around a very particular way of moving around stages. Perhaps it lacks a bit of consistency, but that's what the game is about, finding a way of creatively overcoming the obstacles presented before you and getting used to the threshold where one movement becomes the other. I feel like a controller with analog sticks is almost mandatory for a fully enjoyable experience. Digital controls would make it very tricky I believe, but I never tried it myself - always played it with a controller.\n\nIn a few specific cases the camera can work against you, especially when you need to maneuver and use the face buttons at the same time, leaving you with no fingers left to control the camera. In this case you have to trust the game will pick the best angle for you, and sometimes it does not.\n\nI am mostly uncoordinated when it comes to platformers, and I felt fairly competent in this game. It is a relaxed, chill puzzle experience more than a skill platformer. I believe patience plays a big part in it, that and the fact I was looking for a more introspective, original experience.

I wanted to like this game, I really did, but in the end I had to return it for a refund.\n\nThe Pro's:\n- It is a very unusual concept.\n- The graphics are cute.\n- The music fits to the game.\n\nThe Con's are a mixed bag, none of which is a game breaker in itself, but each tends to lead into the next and the combination of them all is what drove me to return the game.\n\n- The essence of the game is very simplistic. I only played the first two levels but the objective was the same on both. Broken gate, missing keys, find the keys. That's it. So there is really no interest in the objectives, meaning you focus more on the gameplay itself.\n- The wild camera. Focusing on the gameplay is not easy when you can't see what you are doing.  While being a common problem in 3D platformers, this is particularly important in this game because of the way your character needs to wrap around objects to climb up them. Having to adjust the camera manually every couple of seconds while trying desperately to cling to something means you should prepare for a lot of deadly falls.\n- The checkpoint system. Aside from the keys, there are numerous other collectables in the level, some more awkwardly placed than others. But anything you collected does not get saved until you pass a checkpoint. So often you collect half a dozen or more difficult to reach items, only to drop off a ledge and lose them all on your way to the checkpoint.\n- Which leads us to the biggest problem of them all. The controls. I appreciate there is not a game controller yet invented that is designed to replicate the movement of snakes and I knew from other reviews this would not be easy, but for me it was way too difficult. I played 45 minutes and only reached level 2. During that time I died more than 20 times, so approximately every 2 minutes, most of which meant I had to go back and collect all of the items I had just lost, again and again and again. Now bear in mind that I have games like Dark Souls in my collection which are incredibly hard, but they make up for it by rewarding you and being entertaining.

The levels and obstacles are decently designed, and the graphics and music are sufficiently okay for a game of this kind.\n\nAnd then, there are the controls. If you're wondering how on Earth you're supposed to control a snake in a 3D environment with keyboard and mouse, the developers almost got the right idea. You hold the left mouse button to slither forward and use WASD to control the direction. On paper, it seems good enough, but within thirty minutes of playing this, I was convinced that this game NEEDED tank controls. Within one hour, I was dying to quit the game and go play the original Alone in the Dark. Press left to turn left, press right to turn right. What could be more simple? But no, tank controls apparently are the Unholy Spawn of Satan and it should be avoided like the plague (especially where it would make the most sense)(. But I admit, having WASD controls wouldn't necessarily be a bad idea if the camera were good, and he camera is, by far, the worst aspect of this entire game. It gets blocked in places where it physically shouldn't (if there's a pillar between you and the camera, you can't spin the camera on the outside of the pillar to get a good view of the level; instead, the camera will suddenly zoom in and you can't see anything), your sight gets blocked by scenery, the camera moves on its own even though you control it with the mouse, it spazzes out when you're in tight places and forces you to make involuntary U-turns and go back to where you were coming from, and so on. Seriously, the camera is a mess, and the fact that your movement is entirely dependent on the camera angle makes the whole control scheme come crashing down. I'd press the directional button to move the snake in one direction, only to see it spinning like an idiot in the opposite direction and fall of the pole I'm trying to hold on to. And if your answer is \"duh, just adjust the camera!\", you obviously don't know the camera in this game.\n\nOh, and did I mention this game seriously lag? I'm sorry, but I can't admit sub-20FPS precarious in a game that can't possibly be more detailed and complex than Skyrim or Arkham City. The optimisation is terrible, and that makes the camera control even worse.\n\nI suppose I could spend some more hours mastering the finely and precisely SCREWED UP camera control, but honestly, what's the point? It'd be more fun, not to mention easier, to physically transform myself into a snake and beat these levels in the real world, spikes and endless abysses and all. And if I want to struggle against a dysfunctional, uncooperative camera, I can always go back to Super Mario 64. At least the collectibles had a point in that game.\n\nI can't recommend this at all.
