I remember when this was an itch.io project referenced on reddit. I played it back then, and thought it was cute (it is), and its been on steam since last october. Not much has really changed, and its a tad barebones. It's made with love, and it's a personal project, which counts, but it's about 7-8 dollars more expensive than it should be. I reckon it will be overtaken by other such gardening simulators before long. Maybe they will add gardens to SteamVR Home or Altspace and then the genre will collapse. [spoiler]Maybe \"High Times\" magazine will commission the developer to develop a grow-room simulator.

I love Morrowind, and hearing about a VR game that'd let me practice alchemy for \"real\" is a dream come true, believe me.\n\nThe developer did kindly take my previous criticism into account, and fixed quite a few of the issues I reported, so props for that.\n\nHowever, I still cannot recommend this game atthe current price. It is very barebones; the title-promies potions are still nowhere to be seen, and the only thing to do at this point is plant a few types of flowers, watch them grow, then plant them again.\n\nThe house building is not very engaging (to me, at least), and shouldn't be the current focus of the game. I'd instead like to see some potions make an appearance. A month has passed since the last update to this game, so I have hopes that such an update is brewing (ha ha).\n\nUntil then, I'd recommend you hold your money until this project grows a bit.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009368508", "last_played": 1493144767, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 257, "playtime_forever": 36}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1493148450, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502427", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499859247, "recommendationid": "31363359", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
