The game starts out with a family getting a loan to build a town in a certain amout of time, if you don't the banker forecloses, something like that. The player goes through multiple levels repairing track, selling stuff like wood, concrete etc and when each level is done you build a bit more of the new town. It's more of a time killer but it's actually fun in the process IMO. I run a triple monitor PC and it works fine, no problems.  I'll take it to the end and then see if the replay is the same or if they added variations. Nice game though.\n\nI'm playing it through a second time now. The game is the same with no variation, so, for the replay aspect I'd say it's low for most people. The game itself can be completed in a few days or less, depending on how much time you spend in a sitting.  I'd say it's best to buy when it's on sale if you do.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198020921666", "last_played": 1479765338, "num_reviews": 41, "num_games_owned": 457, "playtime_forever": 755}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1479194783, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516341", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1479344158, "recommendationid": "26611637", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Based on the first half hour of game play...This game is not fun for adults.

There's a few spelling mistakes at the beginning of the game, no achievements or trading cards, and the town upgrade system has a few bugs. However, the gameplay itself is great and quite a decent challenge racing against the clock to complete 40 varied missions. I love the train theme and, whilst there is nothing super innovative here, I was sad when the game was done that there was not more. There's a story but honestly is so paper thin that it kinda gets in the way playing the next level. A detractor is the clock starts during the dialogue segments at the beginning of each level so you need to click quickly or skip to get to the action to try and get the gold medal. Overall worth a play and I'd hope with a sequel they can iron out some of the issues mentioned already and make an even better game :) Still recommended though", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972279378", "last_played": 1496272670, "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 655, "playtime_forever": 316}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1496273013, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496273013, "recommendationid": "32096353", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I love trains so I thought lets give this ago and I really enjoyed it I recommend it I only wish that the first one is on Steam.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198062085771", "last_played": 1480248316, "num_reviews": 152, "num_games_owned": 212, "playtime_forever": 346}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1493969890, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1493969890, "recommendationid": "31554530", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
