Try to remain at the top and score high. Plus there's some cool content that was DLC on the 360 that comes bundled in. Way easier here than setting a dummy Japanese account and buying digital yen to get at it. Plus a B run for the more tryhards to give the game a little extra punch, where they add a boxing like the 4th ship, with another hot wifu for those that have blood to spare after a pulse-pounding mission. Plus the Caravan mode which is an awesome addition, and a great SHUMP trainer/added challenge, can you last more than 30 seconds?\n\nThe bullets are colorful, the music is jammin' and the numbers are gonna fly up. I know some hardcore fans of the genre mark this game down for being too easy, well try the B run. I always have a blast when I play. More focus on flash than weird secrets it would seem.\n\nThis game is like candy, so much of the sound and art design just pops. The enemies explode and their bullets turn gray often right before they hit you, giving you that sweet hit of dopamine. The bosses have patterns and movement unlike what I've seen in similar games. There's so many little bits in the level to shoot, or thrilling scoring opportunities tied to a little reward sound. You may have so much fun your sweatband will be dripping after a run. \n\nPick this sucker up and have a blast blasting away.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198011637352", "last_played": 1506796173, "num_reviews": 55, "num_games_owned": 1071, "playtime_forever": 179}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1491635938, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508983", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1491680158, "recommendationid": "31011858", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "More shooters from Japan please! \nHave had this on my XBox 360 for years now, but can now FINALLY get the DLC seeing I didn't have a japanese ip! \nThanks for bringing this to Steam!\nThis is a great game if your a fan of these types of games.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049716099", "last_played": 1491699544, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 378, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1491699949, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1491699949, "recommendationid": "31029770", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Bullet Soul is agreat shmup with brilliant graphics, music and stages.\n\n\nIt features a bullet cancelling mechanic which basicly means when you blow up a ship the bullets it fired at you turn into harmless grey ghost bullets.

The sound in this game is glorious, pure eargasm you'll never get tired of it but what's more important it fits the game genre excellently. This is one of the few games that is easy to adapt but also teaches you a few things for example the oncoming bullets will not hurt you if you manage to kill the ship that fires it. The devs clearly know what they want to do in this game. Though i unluckily encountered an error which crashed the game after the credits finish so i didn't get to register my score during my 1st playthrough. This only happens in Mode A though, it does not occur in Bancho, Caravan or Version B as i've played it too.
