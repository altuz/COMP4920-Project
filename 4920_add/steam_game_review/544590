The game is to guess the angle an attack is coming in and block it. Every few attacks you get a chance to hit.

At the moment only one hit is allowed in the window and the AI barely reacts.\n\nEssentially go play Infinity Blade again and take more notes.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198039727964", "last_played": 1485382907, "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 216, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1485383108, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499110", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1485383108, "recommendationid": "29491221", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It is free to play, you are a Samurai, the Theme is dark, the Dojo looks awesome, you must try this!\nSure the game is small, but it is really fun.
