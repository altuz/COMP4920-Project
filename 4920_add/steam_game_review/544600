See the thing is those \"free\" casual mobile games are not actually free rather then freemium. If you dont know what a freemium is feel free to check out my [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/KurukiiKaesekuchen/recommended/463060/]Clover Tale Review[/url] on Steam as I described it in there.\n\nThe Game itself is a diner dash game with the story of a HOP Game. I personally fell immediatly in love with the Story and due to me liking casual managing games I also enjoyed the Gameplay alot.\n\nThanks to Challenges and changing rooms this game will not get boring in any way. The Graphics are very simple so I am sure low end pc's or laptops should have no problems running it.\n\nThere is no Voice Acting in this Game which personally didnt bother me, the atmosphere, thanks to great music was regardless amazing.\n\nUnlike Hearts Medicine - Time to heal there is not much sad bits in this game but rather funny moments. Seeing how Emily and her husband together with the rest of the family especially paige is managing christmas is rather comical. \n\nTo my suprise the game also took me 10 Hours to complete (with a few challenges) and yet still it felt way to short and I would like to binge play it all over again.\n\nThis Game is one of the few Gems on Steam especially Story Wise.\n\nI do recommend this Game to all HOP Game Fans and to all Diner Dash Game Fans. I also recommend this Game for its full price due to being 10 Hours long (or longer if you complete all challenges). And of course I am going to recommend this Game to all achievement Hunters because the game is not as hard to 100% complete as other games.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198062558470", "last_played": 1499508834, "num_reviews": 154, "num_games_owned": 638, "playtime_forever": 639}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1499765443, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518569", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499765443, "recommendationid": "33451642", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
