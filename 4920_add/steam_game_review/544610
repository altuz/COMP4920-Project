For my own part, I find it to be just about perfect: there are some nice wrinkles in the unit and weapon loadouts that you can mix with several tactical and manuver options to approach battles how you see fit. That being said, there isn't so much that you feel overwhelmed. \n\nI can't really say how this game would come across to someone who wasn't a fan of the shows, but as a BSG lover, this game is just great. The ships are mostly original to the game (since it takes place before the shows), but they follow the design styles of the Colonial and Cylon fleets perfectly. The weapons are cannons, missiles, and fightercraft and all of them look great. The muzzle flashes reflecting on your ship's hull are nice looking and the puffs of smoke being left behind as your ship moves are a cool touch.\n\nThe game is played in simultaneous double-blind turns where you and your opponent both issue orders to all ships, stations, and fighter squadrons. When everyone is ready, the orders are played out simultaneously in a short real-time action scene. After the battle, you can watch a replay of the whole match with just the action scenes. These replays are a real treat for fans of Ronald D. Moore's BSG reboot, as the developers seem to have tried to emulate the camera movements and framing of the show's space battles. If you are a fan of the show, you'll recognize some of the shots - the close (almost hull-mounted) camera following fighters or the scene of battle that suddeny pans and zooms toward an exploding ship.\n\nThere is also a strategic layer where you build ships, assign them to fleets, assign COs to the fleets, and move them around the map of the twelve colonies. If you have played the modern X-Com games, you might be familiar with one of the elements of this layer - you have to keep the governments of the 12 colonies happy or they'll leave the alliance and you'll take a hit to funding. I'm not sure yet just how screwed I will be if I mess up my strategy, but I can certainly feel the pressure of having X fires to put out and X-1 buckets of water.\n\nStory-wise, I'm only a short way into the campaign, but it is solid so far. You will see a lot of familiar names, as many of the BSG characters had parents or grandparents in the military during the first war. Two of the ones you meet right off the bat are an Admiral Lucinda Caine (mother or grandmother of the Pegasus CO I assume) and Helena Agathon (relative of Helo). Dr. Cottle also appears in a younger form.\n\nAs of this writing, there is no DLC for the game, but I would love to shower this game's publisher with money. There are a fairly limited number of units (though they cover all the tactical bases nicely) and I would totally buy DLC that modified skirmish and multiplayer fleet lists by colony. You can already play the Cylons, by the way.\n\nIf my overwhelmingly positive opinion of this game changes after putting more time into it, I'll certainly make note of it. However, if you don't see an addendum on this post, then assume everything I said held true and that I recomend this game to people looking for a great space tactics game with a light strategy layer, especially fans of the shows.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 550, "steamid": "76561198032498463", "last_played": 1507003682, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 279, "playtime_forever": 788}, "votes_up": 38, "timestamp_created": 1504580376, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566554", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1504580376, "recommendationid": "34748579", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "While BSG as a series features 3 'units': The Battlestar, the Viper and the Raptor, an actual strategy game needs more meat than that. There are a handful more units, such as a scout-type corvette and a missile cruiser, but there are far too few strategies and tactics made available by them to really call combat deep. There is really only one strategy: Literally stacking broadside warships, like the Adamant. Anything else is a waste of fleet space.\n\nThe AI is predictable; they rush headlong at your forces, launch an initial volley, and then break and scatter, exposing their weak sides with few guns. Your corvettes can stay in their rear and tear them apart easily; your Adamants can take the first volley head-on, then turn and broadside without their flank armor being stripped by the first strike. Your vipers absolutely cream Cylon raiders, and for the most part, are just a slight annoyance of telling them to go do something rather than an integral part of a battle.\n\nUnfortunately, the relatively shallow combat suffers from some extremely crippling bugs. Ship movement doesn't account for collision detection prior to resolving the round of combat, which means that tight formations (Like is necessary with the only valid tactic, the full broadside fleet) can very easily result in ships ramming each other and exploding instantly. Worse, or perhaps not depending on your experience, is damage calculation.\n\nYour ships have 6 armor values, for different facing sides. Damage counts the side that your ship was initially on at the beginning of a battle; I've had ships lose 30-40 HP turning into an enemy and taking 90% of the fire head-on, because the game is still dealing damage to their rear flank which has no armor, since that's the side that was exposed at the start of the battle. Left and Right armor are virtually non-existant, with a ship going straight from taking Rear armor damage to Front armor damage with their flanks being completely unscathed.\n\nIf this were X-COM, it would be like a character getting flanked on the enemy's turn, and then running into full cover and still dying because you BEGAN that turn exposed rather than ending it exposed - absolutely inexcusible in a squad strategy game, and absolutely inexcusible here. This not only screws up how combat actually resolves, it severely cripples what little potential maneuverable ships like the Manticore had, further relegating the game to nothing but massed Adamant broadsides, a battle you will repeat very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very often... and get tired of very quickly.\n\nLike many others, I can't recommend it in its current state. Not only does the central gameplay fall flat, it feels so unfinished and untested that it feels like a game which was pushed out the door instead of letting it fall into development hell, which does not inspire any confidence that it will progress beyond its release state.

However, the devs have already released a roadmap and patches are in the works, so they're committed to further support. I've not encountered anything that severely impacted my enjoyment of the game, anyway.\n\nIn summary, a must for BSG fans. As a fan of the show, I can say they've chosen a brilliant system to maintain the show's feel while also offering compelling gameplay. The one main caveat I'd suggest is that it's priced a little high, but I made the decision to support the devs in this case - they probably need it more than any AAA studio trying to sponge up my spare change.\n\nSo if you're not a Galactica fan, you may want to wait for the price to come down and for a few kinks to be ironed out.

Who knows, but my fears were averted once I picked it up and began playing it. The turn based gameplay has you constantly thinking and paying attention, checking your targets are focused, your raptors are prioritizing and most important your ships aren't crashing into each other. You can then watch in the autocam, which makes it look like it is directly from the TV show with the shaking and the zooming. There are hours of fun to be had here.\n\nThe criticisms I have is that the campaign can be rushed through very quickly, there don't appear to be many roadblocks in the campaign requiring you to research or make sure your fleet is up to scratch. There are a few of quality of life issues - most notably equipping your fleet with torpedoes/viper mk 2s in the battle screen, but also the whole fleet system, you have to level up officers which becomes increasingly difficult as you progress. For how fun and wonderful the tactics engine is, the CIC tasks are all very simple, mostly just building and moving fleets. While it would be nice to see a more XCom approach for outside the base, the developers clearly focused on the tactical aspect of the game and it shows in mostly positive ways.\n\nIn conclusion, as a fan of BSG and the newest XCom games, you will enjoy it immensely.

And I don't like that I can't give a thumbs up AND thumbs down. But this will be a long review. \nFirst, for a game billed as a strategy game, there is but one strategy. And that is to build enough ships to make seven ship fleets to protect each of the four quadrants of your map. This is not difficult with the exception that you play on the highest of three difficulty modes. Once you figure this out, this is where my biggest problems comes into play\n\n1) This is not a strategic game. It's a reactive game because the Cylons always have the initiative. They will attack your fleet or your planets and you simply react to the attacks - the entire campaign, until the very end.\n\n2) The game becomes repetitive and ultimately boring. The AI becomes predictable. AI will set up the enemy ships in one of three directions relative to you, left, right and forward. Elevation of these fleets are either slightly higher, lower or even with yours. The enemy fleets are cookie cutter fleets. \n\n3) For a game with the namesake of the most famous Battlestar in existence, you don't need a Battlestar to complete the game. And as far as I'm concerned, a Battlestar slows your fleet down.\n\n4) The ships: \nA) The Manticore corvette is pretty good for very early game, but it become weak and actually uses up a space in your fleet better utilized by another ship.\nB) The Adamant frigate will be your workhorse and fleets of seven Adamants can be used through the campaign to the end, thereby rendering the next three ships fairly useless.\nC) The Ranger missile cruiser is fairly useless because of the low hitting power of its missiles, even though it will fire every other turn. The  battles are short enough that you will rarely get more than 3 or 4 salvos off. The AI will focus fire this ship.\nD) The Minotaur gunship is not a good ship. Like the Ranger, the AI seems to focus fire this ship. And this ship really needs to get fairly close to the enemy for it to really work. And it is slow.\nE) The Atlas carrier carries two squadrons of Vipers, your WWII equivalent fighters. While the Adamant carries one squadron of Vipers, a Battlestar carries two squadrons and your shipyard also carries two squadrons, I never saw the need to use the Atlas.\nF) The Battlestar. Well, you get a taste of this ship in the second or third mission you play, which is part of the tutorial. You won't see another Battlestar for quite some time thereafter. I find the namesake of the series lackluster. It has a missle launcher and carries two squadrons of Vipers. It also uses the unique concept of FlaK. This creates a FlaK field on either side or all around the ship that will simply shred anything that comes in contact with it...including your own Vipers, missiles or ships, so one must be careful when setting off your FlaK defenses. \nBut, the Battlestar is low. You may know the old addage saying A fleet is only as fast as its slowest ship. This is true in this case. While its maneuverability is exceptional, like the Minotaur, it simply can't keep up with the rest of the fleet. And this, from a physics POV doesn't make a lot of sense when you factor out friction and most gravity and factor in humungous engines. The ship is not that powerful in weapons, other than its Vipers. The AI will focus fire it if it doesn't have another ship such as the Ranger or Minotaur to focus first.\nThis ship, with its guns and firing arcs should lay waste in short order any Cylon ship smaller than their large carriers.\n\nBefore I wrap this review up, I'm going to say that within the first 50 hours of play, I was bored with the game. There simply isn't anything in the game that would want to make you play for hours and hours and hours. There is nothing new to unlock once you have all the ships, special weapons and whatnot. The Resource missions are all the same. And in my opinion, the campaign was much to short. \nBut you may ask...\"Why did you play 250 hours if you were bored with it?\" Well, Through that time I played with the three different difficulty settings. While did this, I kept wondering if anything different or special would pop up or unlock. Maybe a hidden mission, or a once per campaign ship or something like that. But no, the game is a straight through campaign. \n\nBut do I recommend the game? I'm going to say Yes. And that's only because the Devs and Slitherine say there will be added content in the future. Is it worth $40? Well, I can go to the shooting range and blow through $40 worth of ammo (depending on the gun I take) within 3 minutes. Or I can go to 2 two hour movies with my family with popcorn and drinks for $40. So I leave the question of worth up to the individual reading this review.\n\nSo have fun with this game and then shelve it to wait on further content.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 212, "steamid": "76561198127245228", "last_played": 1506603056, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 15031}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1506605141, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514963", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506605141, "recommendationid": "35261847", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "My ultimate problem, and this is coming from someone who loves both this game and Battlestar Galactica, is that the fleets too heavily mirror one another and that the game is worse off for it.\n\nThis game has a lot going for it, and is very fun--that's no lie--I purchased and hardly ever played Battlefleet Gothic. But after deciding to rewatch the miniseries, I think I've nailed down the issues I personally have with the game.\n\nThe Colonial Fleet and Cylon Armada both rely on guns, missiles, and fighters. And that's all well and fine, but ultimately there should be a difference between the two of them, a much greater difference as we can see in the show. The Cylons relied primarily on two things there: fighters and missiles, and lots and lots of both. In the game, while this does take place nearly half a century earlier, the Cylons are deploying battleships and gunboats that can rival a battlestar's gunnage and that just doesn't feel right. When I use a battlestar, I should feel like I have the beefiest, tankiest, ship on the field. It carries an entire wing of fighters, it has enough guns to lay down a screen of weapons fire to blot out the sun.\n\nOr it should.\n\nInstead, I get a ship that melts to Cylon gunfire in seconds, whether it's in the middle or the edge of combat, and one that can deploy a field of fire, but can choose to either do that or target enemy vessels. When targetting an enemy vessel, the broadside turrets on the flight pods are too low on their damage to even matter. The artillery guns on a battlestar's back? They'll miss on nearly every shot that isn't targetting a basestar, and that's not right. I expect to be able to dish out damage and deal damage at the same time, the flak screen to be a natural product of a battlestar's firing solution. Instead, I get to block missiles while an enemy's guns still continue to shred me in the minute or so it takes a fully armored battlestar to melt. It isn't right.\n\nThe Cylons should be focusing on four primary things: boarding, hacking, missiles, and fighters. The Colonials would be at home focusing on fighters, armor, and guns. Instead, we have two mirrored fleets and not nearly enough diversity of playstyle. This is not to even mention that during the campaign mode, the difficulty jumps to a nearly impossible level where Cylon fleets start numbering at nearly a dozen, all of them large, while you've barely even started to construct anything able to fight them. By the time you do, you realize that not only are your fleets weaker, but that whenever you do fight your command ship and officer are always targetted and lost first, leading to a cascading failure of your entire campaign. And this occurs because a battlestar is less than half of what it should be, guns and armor and all.\n\nI want to love this game. I love what it does have going for it.

The graphics and feel is very faithful to the show, however there are drawbacks. \n\nAlthough at first it may seem the options around strategy are fairly numerous, in reality the the only seriously viable approach to combat is to focus on taking out one enemy ship at a time while keeping yours out of harms way. The enemy AI predictably tends to focus on the largest ship meaning you can use this ship as bait to routinely drawn the enemy into pincer type movements . I enjoy the combat and the feel of things but after 50 hours the tactics are becoming woefully repetitive. \n\nAnother issue that is fustrating is that you have no idea of the size of an enemy fleet prior to engaging so in the mid to late game this renders small fleets with green officers pointless. The only safe way to encounter fleets is by sending your best fleets with best officers. \n\nThe strategy element on the main map is surprisingly tricky and the choices that must be made do add an interesting dimension.
