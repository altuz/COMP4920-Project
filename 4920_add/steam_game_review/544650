It starts out as a typical \"chase the villain\" game but the locations and characters are interesting.\n- Beautiful art\n- The map is actually pretty (although can be a bit hard to navigate)\n\nCons:\n- The cutscenes and dialog scenes: they are not voice acted, so you just sit there watching the lips of a character move while you've already finished reading the text, and there's no option to just move forward at your own pace. This got really annoying.\n- Minor interface annoyances - it's really easy to accidentally click hint when trying to get the map, and lose the achievement. Also, the way you have to click several times each time you pick up an item (then to accept that you picked it up, etc) get annoying fast\n- The cane - not sure why it's a mechanic. I kept forgetting about it. It's a tool built into the UI that just helps you reach for stuff, usually stuff that they could have easily just placed in a way that you don't need it.\n- The soundtrack is the same 30 or so seconds on repeat for the entire game, cutscenes, gameplay, everything. And it gets annoying very quickly - I ended up turning it off after a few scenes.\n\nIf they would just fix a few of these, I would change to recommending, but as of now, I was frustrated more often than I wanted to be, but did stick with it because the story was interesting.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035577754", "last_played": 1485660118, "num_reviews": 32, "num_games_owned": 262, "playtime_forever": 88}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1485660488, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522509", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1485660488, "recommendationid": "29555536", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
