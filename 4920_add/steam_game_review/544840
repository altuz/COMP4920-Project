It\u00b4s free and probably meant as a means to pass time without straining your brain, that it does well.\n\nIf you do not wish to figure out the mechanics by yourself which can take a little while see a youtube video for how to play the game. Basically you smash chests which contain tools, building materials, plans for buildings and gems.\n\nUSE TAB  TO SPEED UP!!!!!!!  <---- Some people complain about the slowness of the game, it is VERY slow unless you use TAB to speed up things at certain points, and you need to keep TAB pressed, it's not a toggle.\n\nAs stated the game is very simple thus any further information would spoil your fun if you wish to figure things out for yourself. It's free and for me it was crash free as well though some people are complaining about technical issues. Yes, IT`S FREE ... \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198074245934", "last_played": 1485900501, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 71}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1485873114, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497274", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1485873114, "recommendationid": "29606630", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Characters are stupid, GFX is sloppy, and everything about this game reeks.
