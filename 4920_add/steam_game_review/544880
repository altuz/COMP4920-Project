Looks to have very little effort put into it. MAYBE worth $0.99. Could be quite useful, but everything from the graphics to the controls need a lot more effort put into them.

The ONLY way to do this is through practice. VR allows a full-immersion into an alternate reality. With Limelight, the potential for practicing public speaking is there - a new unfamiliar space with (virtual) people's attention on you presenting.\n\nSet the audience to neutral. The \"positive\" audience is silly. There are 3 room sizes - boardroom, classroom & hall. You load your google slides into the presentation for the hall & board room - very neat.\n\nI would like to see more done with this - there's a lot of potential to take this further.\n\nIf you're still reading, you probably are trying to conquer your public speaking fear. Here are a few tips: VISUALISATION, VISUALISATION, VISUALISATION! When you prepare a speech, it's not enough to just know it well to eliminate all your jitters - IMAGINE doing the speech AT the venue where you will be speaking. I have done various MC events & before I would get lots of tension. But when you include actually going to the venue & becoming familiar with the environment, you will lose some fear (of the unknown) because you at least know the venue to start with.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198023996947", "last_played": 1481975485, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 109, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1482127532, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504939", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1482127532, "recommendationid": "28462244", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Terrible!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992184058", "last_played": 1505935622, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505935649, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505935649, "recommendationid": "35090644", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
