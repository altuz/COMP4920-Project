From the beginning to the end I pronounced the rhymes aloud just to hear them and come more alive. This is the biggest pro the game has and what gives it it's true charasteristic over all other games.\n\nAlong with rhymes I loved the story. The beginning was truly wonderful doing everyday tasks and getting used to Ruth's life in past and in present. In the middle I was little confused but the story suck me in and I was totally in the story at the end. I have a habit of shedding a tear while watching touching animations or listening to music when things get emotional. But I have never shed a tear while playing a game - until Milkmaid. Seeing Ruth's apple of her eye ravaging and seeing the result I was blown away. If a game can awoke emotions like I felt there is something quite powerful in the story and it must have been well told.\n\nI loved the soundtrack. Sometimes I went in to a room just to hear a certain song :)\n\nThe puzzles in the game were straightforward enough to keep me interested in the story rather than get me frustrated. I enjoyd every minute of this game. I hear people usually telling that the game was too short. And I think that may be the case with Milkmaid as well.  I really can't understand this point of view. I believe that when the story is told it is time to end it - may it be novel, movie, song or a game.\n\nWhat can I say. This is one of the best games I have ever played. Maybe there is a little nostalgy involved because the graphics reminded me of the golden 80's but of course Milkmaid was retro not vintage.\n\nAnd one more thing: I liked the idea of Age machine and the mechanics of it. It gave the game some extra and of course it had a big role both in the story and in gameplay.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198272945678", "last_played": 1504991939, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_forever": 194}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504993566, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504993798, "recommendationid": "34847446", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
