Low setting? not even worth it. You get screen whitewash.\n\nHigh oe ultra setting? You get stuttering. This is on GTX 960 with 8 core AMD FX 8350 with 16GB RAM.\n\nThe first time game launch, it launch in 1024 4:3 resolution which can be changed in the graphic screen but you can only see the vertical resolution only.\n\nThe voice over? OMG. More sound like an english guy trying to impersonate an Arab. It sounds like someone who try to learn the language.\n\nWill not recommend this game until it mature more. At the moment it looks more of a product demo with need for very high spec rig to play it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "steamid": "76561198009935966", "last_played": 1506329655, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 1234, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1506329994, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500988", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1506329994, "recommendationid": "35199020", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "how do you turn down the brightness", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 145, "steamid": "76561198193167158", "last_played": 1507151336, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 71, "playtime_forever": 145}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506817151, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506817151, "recommendationid": "35358513", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
