Released in December of 2016, it thus far has only a small base of gamers who have purchased it, and an even smaller community of reviewers that have taken the time to write their thoughts about this alleged horror/adventure/puzzle title.\n\nThe only background to the \"story\" presented in the game is available for reading on the store page. Apparently, Beastiarium takes place in underground Petersburg at the beginning of the 20th century, and it has been 100 years since monsters have taken over Earth. The takeover caused all survivors to move underground and build a new world, but alas the cities that developed also got overrun by monsters. It is up to you to find out why people are afraid to leave their homes, and if the established Guard is actually there to protect the citizens, or if their purpose is more sinister. In-game, there are only a handful of narratives, none of which amount to much from a storytelling aspect. The voice acting is good, but even the subtitles are unpolished, in that their script does not fully match what the narrator is saying at any given time.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, Beastiarium comes across as both drab and annoying due to its simplistic and uninspired puzzles. Throughout 9 chapters, you will find yourself answering some easy riddles, luring a monster to a preset destination, figuring out the navigation of two labyrinths, finding a keypad combination, and fighting an end \"boss battle\". All of the puzzle elements found in this game have been done to the point of exhaustion in other titles, and given the lack of story, or any real presentation that conveys a sense of purpose, the overall experience here just feels empty and void. After a while it begins to feel like a chore to even finish the game, which is another fruitless endeavor as the ending is underwhelming and vastly disappointing.\n\nThe only things that Beastiarium has going for it are some pretty graphics and good optimization; sadly, the rest is a complete write-off. There are no horror elements, there is barely any atmosphere, and part of the store page can be misleading; it proclaims that it has \"combination of plot-driven quest and action-horror\" and \"seamless game world with sandbox elements\". There are no loading screens, so the \"seamless\" part is right, but the rest is simply untrue. As well, it's a massive stretch to say that the game has \"charismatic characters\", seeing as you will interact with 4 people for an amazingly short period of time. Needless to say, it's best to just pass on by Beastiarium, unless you can get it for about $3.00. The default $16.99 CAD price point is far too high for a game that lasts 45-60 minutes at best, and even at $6.79 CAD it feels like a complete waste.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]2.0/5.0[/b] - It's not awful, but it's not great.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork#curation]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049701098", "last_played": 1495622116, "num_reviews": 203, "num_games_owned": 2338, "playtime_forever": 60}, "votes_up": 32, "timestamp_created": 1495627372, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555377", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1495961705, "recommendationid": "31933230", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
