Blackjack players... do NOT waste your cash on this title, no matter how cheap.  I mean, even 2 cents is TOO MUCH to pay for such a terrible, terrible title.\n\nI got AAK and it busted me as 22.... I mean.... Really?   And this was after a computer player split a non-pair but no split option is available.  I posted these things to the developer to crickets....  \n\nSo, no splits, no logic for aces, no actual strategy, no developer support... this is clearly a bad cash-grab with no redeeming features.  Even the art style is completely stolen.
