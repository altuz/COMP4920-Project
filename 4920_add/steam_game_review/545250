In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk and feeds infants.[2] Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development.\n\nUp to 70% of males develop pronounced or physiologically matured breasts at some point in their lives due to an endocrine disorder known as gynecomastia. In other cases, and at other periods in their lives, their bodies produce lower levels of estrogens and higher levels of androgens, namely testosterone, which suppress the effects of estrogens in developing excessive breast tissue.\n\nSubcutaneous fat covers and envelops a network of ducts that converge on the nipple, and these tissues give the breast its size and shape. At the ends of the ducts are lobules, or clusters of alveoli, where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals.[3] During pregnancy, the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding.\n\nAlong with their major function in providing nutrition for infants, female breasts have social and sexual characteristics. Breasts have been featured in notable ancient and modern sculpture, art, and photography. Female breasts can figure prominently in a woman's perception of her body image and sexual attractiveness. A number of Western cultures associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts in public as immodest or indecent. Breasts and especially the nipples are an erogenous zone on women. Given the emphasis of some cultures on breast size and attractiveness, some women seek breast augmentation or other kinds of surgery to enlarge or reduce their breast size or to reverse sagging breasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso the demon is fucking hottest anime girl", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198059892269", "last_played": 1505625647, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 171, "playtime_forever": 161}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505619766, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501752", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505619766, "recommendationid": "35013267", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It lags when I try to play but I think it would be good.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198350496633", "last_played": 1505769870, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 57, "playtime_forever": 41}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505723280, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505723280, "recommendationid": "35041291", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Don't buy this", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197980303864", "last_played": 1505398182, "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 484, "playtime_forever": 43}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505398215, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505398228, "recommendationid": "34949194", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Bought it on sale for 0.72 cents.\nMost expensive fap i've ever had.\n\n10/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198124236500", "last_played": 1505678279, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_forever": 25}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505678368, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490196", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505678368, "recommendationid": "35031966", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game is fun as a joke to your friends but not to play.
