The player caricatures are hilarious.\n    [*]Its overall gameplay is decent. At the time of writing this review, it is a fun arcade game.\n    [*]While the game requires you to unlock all players, you can do this through playing the game instead of having to buy random packs. There are no players that are extremely rare or expensive to get and a reasonable fee unlocks them all if that is what you want.\n    [*]Upgrading players goes fast and unlocks cosmetic changes. The stats stay the same.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]The person who did the stats for the players made some ridiculous decisions. Tracy McGrady, Dr. J, Zack LaVine, Gerald Green, Shawn Kemp might be some of the best dunkers of all time but in this game none of them are 10s. Ben Wallace is an average rebounder, and Roy Hibbert is a better shot blocker than Wilt Chamberlain. Celtics' Shaq is one of the best 2PT scorers in the game, Ricky Rubio is a 10 for steals, Roy Hibbert is one of the best defensive big men, Tony Parker is a 9 on threes, and the Celtics' Ray Allen is a better dunker than the Bucks' Ray Allen. Kevin Durant is an average shooter and LeBron is just a dunker; don't expect him to be good at defense or rebounding. Why they could not just make the great players great is beyond me. You don't play this kind a game to have your favorite player be a scrub (or simply play like someone else). Just hand out more 10s and make some players (like Wilt and LeBron) truly dominant across the board.\n    [*]Nobody seems to be playing this online at the time. It is still very fun to play with your friends in coop.\nThe game's stamina feature could use an update. Instead of not letting me do a defensive move when I am out of stamina, it would be better if the effectiveness would just go down.\n    [*]The dribble moves have no real function, at least not against the CPU.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Neutral:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]3PT shooting is overpowered. You can defeat the computer with Ray Allen or Dirk Nowitzki by shooting threes and not running back on defense. I won a tournament finals game 45-20 by doing that. I don't think that the 3PT shooting effectiveness should be taken down though. However, this issue goes away when playing real players so I do not feel that this should be changed.\n    [*]Some other reviews complain about RNG. Sports games often have RNG as it feels more realistic. There is a very small percentage chance that a perfect shot will go out, and honestly, that is fine with me. You can shoot a basketball with perfect mechanics and still miss.\n[/list]", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 405, "steamid": "76561197977729238", "last_played": 1507082607, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 271, "playtime_forever": 405}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506985394, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506985569, "recommendationid": "35430319", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "For all intents and purposes, this is the spiritual successor to NBA JAM. \nI could tell even while installing this game that I'd like this more than NBA 2K17. \nNow if the NFL would lighten up a bit with their licensing (and hypersensitivty to injuries and CTE)  some non-EA devcould actually make a fun, late-hit laden, arcade style NFL game for pc, I'd be set.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 423, "steamid": "76561197993239867", "last_played": 1507180371, "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 579, "playtime_forever": 423}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1506748117, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500396", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1506887906, "recommendationid": "35323518", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Why is there RNG in my sports game?
