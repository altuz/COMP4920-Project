The main character is a scientist who... discovered that a project from the past is about to come crashing down in rather... apocalyptic fashion. While the novel does tell of why people on Earth cannot stop the Companion from crashing to Earth in a ELE (look up Deep Impact for definition), it does not say why those on Companion can't help...\n\nAnyway, the story begins like Pretty Woman. As in, you meet a whore/prostitute/call girl, who... captures your heart. And in the end... will you choose to save yourself? Or stay with her?\n\nIt appears to be a port of a Chinese VN, so some of the translations are not... completely done well, but the story does shine through. Note, I did get this on discount, and it might be a good idea to do so, too.\n\nAlso, this game is in line to get Trading Cards, depending upon how much demand is voiced on their discussion board...", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "last_played": 1503775764, "num_reviews": 362, "num_games_owned": 445, "playtime_forever": 33}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1503776078, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505180", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503776078, "recommendationid": "34512684", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
