As Olea settles into the village, Olea will meet Flori and Llima, two young adult girls who share their souls and visit the olive tree regularly in order to stay alive, a few minor supporting characters and 3 child spirits who will visit Olea in his/her sleep each night over 3 chapters(includes characters from Zeiva Inc's earlier visual novel [i]Voices from the Sea[/i]). [spoiler]In subsequent playthroughs in Beyond Nature mode after accumulating sufficient memory fragments, the child spirits will reveal themselves more fully and Olea will eventually acquire sufficient wisdom and memory to revive the olive tree, reach 2 additional hidden endings and unlock all bonus content.[/spoiler]\n\nAlthough there are no Steam achievements to obtain in this game and the Steam take screenshot button feature doesn't work, the game has a memory fragment counter that will track and record each memory fragment that is awarded with each different decision Olea(the player) makes and each different ending reached throughout in different playthroughs and there is a guide available at Zeiva Inc's website that will help players get all memory fragments and reach all 6 possible endings in the game. The game has beautiful artwork, great opening movie, theme song and soundtracks. Recommended when game with original ending theme DLC are at discount or in bundle offer as it takes less than 10 hours to read through all 6 endings and bonus content.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006413390", "last_played": 1500106993, "num_reviews": 91, "num_games_owned": 2216, "playtime_forever": 264}, "votes_up": 33, "timestamp_created": 1497526365, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569445", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1497533515, "recommendationid": "32432924", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
