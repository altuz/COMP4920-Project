I find the single player more just practice staying alive on the difffernet maps. 30 lvls in all some simple and some a bit more complex. Good music.. so that is a plus. I got it on sale so that helps. I can see playing this more with friends/nephews if they are into but I have a lot of local mp games and it may not get in the rotation often but I'd definately like to try it some. I think its worth it price and should be as good or better than a lot of other local mp games. Probably not worth buying if your a single player only type of person as a lot of that maps its simple dodging bullets and obstacles and is fairly simple.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197990318149", "last_played": 1490337043, "num_reviews": 55, "num_games_owned": 429, "playtime_forever": 17}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1482471298, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505166", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1482471298, "recommendationid": "28549787", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "GOOD GAME!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198320963149", "last_played": 1493139046, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1493115011, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493719", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1493115011, "recommendationid": "31354389", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
