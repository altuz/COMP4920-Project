Personnely I think you are false advertising the game by your reviews.  There is nothing in this game that comes even remotely close to the Steams Store page review's.  My feeling is a bait and switch.  For what I paid there is no loss.  But anyone expecting what the reviews show it's not gonna happen.  I am going to wait  and see if it even updates or simply disapears.  Nothing worth playing at this time.
