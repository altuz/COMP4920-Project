The game has excellent graphics and a pretty good music and sound design. But the most important innovation in the game is that you can make a flip in addition to the swap (button in the game has two different sides). It's simple - click to flip, drag to swap. But it makes the game more varied and interesting! Moreover, it's too hard to complete a level only with swaps. And considering that the number of moves is limited, and the number of flips is not, it becomes clear, that doing flips is very profitable.\n\nAlso in this game you can choose power-ups to accumulate and which are not. It's very useful! Also I really liked the some innovative in Match3 power-ups.\nAnother nice thing, I like to making moves in a match 3 games quickly and this game allows me do it.

You have to use strategy and think a little. May be some people who likes easy games not like that, but I like.\n\nWhat else is there? The graphics are very good, music too.
