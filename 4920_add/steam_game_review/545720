I also went through the pain of talking to the NPC's after every level, though I may have missed one or two. In all honestly if I did not go out of my way to make it longer, the game would have been around 2-3 hours long (Just in time for a refund, crap)\n\n-All NPC's are boring to fight\n\n-Attack patterns are confusing and non-repeating (For example, there are enemies in the forest that swing extreamly fast, so the only way to counter them is to parry before they attack, the only problem with this is that sometimes they will stab instead, landing the hit after your parry is done, there is no way to tell if they will stab or swing, so you are stuck with a 50/50 of blocking. And even after you block, you will need to guess once again if they will follow up on that attack or not, There is not much skill involved, and it makes the forest quite tedious and boring to go through.)\n\n-Some boss fights are dreadfully boring (Boss moves super slowly, and fires out lasers that miss 90% of the time. Whole boss fight is just 5 min of walking around power attacking it, as it has no way to close in on you, or stop you from healing if it manages to land one of its hard hitting lasers)\n\n-Weapons all feel the same (Greatsword does 1 damage more than a dagger)\n\n-Game seems to push the player towards a very \"Knight\" like playstyle, with a lot of the strength being better then the other weapons.\n\n-Only seems to be one armour type for a warrior type character.\n\n-Armour is bland and makes no difference in battle to my experience (Ive tried all the different armours, only a few give actual advantages, like the iron/steel armour giving health, or some armour giving mana regen)\n\n-Game is very grindy, unless you only use one weapon the whole game your not going to upgrade it fully at all\n\n-No \"Final\" boss so to say. I was all pumped for the ending, after defeating what I though were the \"Minor\" bosses, then the game just kinda ended. No final boss, just deleted my save and brought me back to the start.\n\n-Game lacks a good story. Im trying my best not to compare the game to dark souls, as I feel thats kinda unfair, but this is one point I really cant avoid comparing it in. The game seems like its attempting to deliver the story in a dark souls kind of way (In item descriptions, through small talks, small details you might not notice, trying to get the player to piece it together themselves) but the creator (Everything in the game way made by one guy, pretty impressive actually) does this is a very (in my opinion) bad way.\n________________\n\nAll in all while the cons far outway the pros, I did still enjoy this game a bit. Its really up to you to decide. Dont let my guide discourage you from buying it if you thing you will enjoy it more then me, and by all means pick it up, and just refund it if you dont like it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065630879", "last_played": 1502411688, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 261, "playtime_forever": 752}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1482714214, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517023", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1482714802, "recommendationid": "28654014", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game looks ok in pitures but playing it is another story.

Lore is present but delivered through subtle exposition, as in item descriptions or the environment, to allow the player to draw their own conclusions.\n\nNother has no exposition, but it seems to have zero lore as well. There's not much of a driving force behind *why* we're waking up in a foggy twilight forest and why everyone & everything seems to be out to kill us. I figured that I'd get some exposition as I progressed but unfortunately, 2 \"bosses\" in and there seems to be next to zero plot.\n\nThe game suffers from some technical failures as well. \n\nItems can be picked up and thrown but the game won't let you pick anything up if there are more than 1 valid targets nearby. This is a problem, as there are often rocks and traps nearby that you may need to immediately interact with and you'll often find this will get you killed. In particular, there is one enemy who is guaranteed to dodge and riposte melee attacks but he surrounds himself with items you can use to kill him. The problem? They're so close together that you have to fight the boss as well as the game in order to pick the darn things up.\n\nGaining a level requires you to gather 4 shards (or defeat a boss, gaining a level immediately). Once you've acquired these you can level up a stat by pressing the assigned key (?). These are Space, R and F. Interestingly, while in the inventory these keys are still bound to their actual purpose: Space is dodge-roll and F is consume potion. You will level up your Intelligence, which upgrades your potion effectiveness, then promptly chug one. These are not restored until you save or die, so this seems like it was either intentional or otherwise leveling up is such a major portion of the game that I have a hard time seeing how this went unnoticed in play testing.\n\nThe game touts controller support, but it is abysmal. Rest assured that it is just as bad for keyboard and mouse users - if your cursor is outside of a walkable space and you attempt to attack, it will fail. This is bizarre as your mouse position has no influence on where your attack lands (where you are facing does). This has gotten me killed more times than I care to count. I'm not sure if this is related to the recent patch which added an option for mouse aiming or not.\n\nBumping into an object causes you to snag on it. If a moveable object has a physical space, there's no way for you to \"slide\" past it - in fact, running near rocks or puzzle pieces is an exercise in frustration as you will bump into them and become physically stuck until you move away. There is an area that requires you to quickly carry an orb while evading enemies. This area is full of these rocks which seem to serve no other purpose than to demonstrate the game's failure in this regard.\n\nIn fact, I'd go so far as to say that this is the best description of Nother: It does so few things well, and they're spaced so far apart, that the rest of the game feels like it was set up to demonstrate the game's failures rather than to provide any sort of enjoyment for the player.\n\nEdit: Leaving the original review here for posterity's sake, but the developer has been quick to find and resolve issues and the game has improved considerably since launch.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997524525", "last_played": 1481793100, "num_reviews": 108, "num_games_owned": 1831, "playtime_forever": 215}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1481712213, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499160", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1481793251, "recommendationid": "28357989", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Edit:  After a few more hours I have to say this game is really good.  I have killed my first boss and I think I am level four now, I have a ton of weapons and armors.  I figured out that you can warp around.  I figured out you can throw weapons.  I am really on a roll.\n\nThere are a few bugs and I had to quit and reload the game a couple of times.\n\nI am getting used to the controls still but as you figure out more and more things you can and more and more weapons and abilities the controls require even more testing and getting used to.\n\nI am definitely recommending this game to my friends and if you like Souls and you like retro-style games this game is awesome.\n\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nJust like in Dark Souls you will be saying \"I swear I hit the roll button!\"  Controls are a little Janky but I am getting them. \n\nI tried to throw a boulder a giant's head, it seemed like the game wanted me to, but it would't let me... hmm.\n\n I have encountered 2 bosses that I can't beat, but I'm getting close.  Have my sword upgraded and found some sweet blood armor, but only wearing the helmet ATM cause I need fast roll for this current boss.\n\nGame is pretty good so far!
