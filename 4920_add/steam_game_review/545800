I have to admit that the art is what first draw me to this game.\n\nThe game consists of seven acts (\u201cdreams\u201d) where you play as a ghost named \u201creader\u201d aiming to go to \u201cthe other side\u201d. Helped by your sidekick \u201cwriter\u201d, you advance in the game by solving puzzles.\nSome puzzles are kind of hard to figure out. You will need perseverance, good observation skills and to pay careful attention to the dialogues with your different encounters in order to not miss any clues. You will also have to take notes, and for some puzzles you need to brainstorm on paper and do some trials and errors to figure them out. There is just one pixel hunting puzzle that required me a solution map to be solved (in fact, even with the map showing me where to click, I still had a hard time doing it right\u2026 even with a ruler\u2026 ).\n\nDialogues and monologues are a big part of the game. Voices were purposedly muffled to give them a more ghostly effect. Filled with humor or bad jokes, the dialogues make us discover some interesting imaginary ghost world.\n\nThe interface is simple (there is no inventory and you can \u201cgo to\u201d, \u201clook at\u201d, \u201cinteract with\u201d or \u201ctalk to\u201d an object by switching the cursor of your mouse) and the menu is very basic (you can only save, load and exit the game). There are some instructions in the art book about how to adjust your display settings to see the game art just right. F12 is not enabled, so you will have to use the print screen key to save any clues you find. You can use some screen capture freeware like Snapper to easily save screenshots while in-game.\n\n\nThe art book (or \u201ccommentary book\u201d) was an interesting read (it can be downloaded from the \u201cmanual\u201d link located on the right side of the game library page). I did not know much about a developer\u2019s work, so it gave me some insight about how the thinking and making process during game development works, but it could be a boring read for some. It also gave me some understandings about some aspects of the dream world in the game, and it contains some hints and solutions of the puzzles if you are stuck (but the pixel hunting puzzle solution map can be found on the forum).\n\n\nIf you forget the awful pixel hunting puzzle, it was an interesting game to play. If you enjoy puzzles games and reading while exploring some imaginary surreal world, I would definitely recommend this game to you.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198064392148", "last_played": 1500915594, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 153, "playtime_forever": 445}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501614715, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505156", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501614715, "recommendationid": "33955586", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
