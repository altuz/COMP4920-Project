It has a simple inventory system, and is non-linear; your choices can affect the outcome. The writing is decent, and it has music to go along with stills of the various areas you visit.\n\nI'm enjoying it so far. I was a little put off by a startup option in which I had to select whether or not to see content involving extreme gore and sex (!); I chose to enable the content and will reserve judgment as to whether it was really necessary to include when I get to the parts in question.
