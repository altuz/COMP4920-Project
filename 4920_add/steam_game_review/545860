I bought it after seeing the videos on the store page and thought it would be much longer and more interactive.\nBut it was still a fun half hour and the style of the game is well done for its genre. The characters are funny and the levels are fast paced and not hard to pass. (which could be a good thing compared to games who are insanely hard to finish).\n\nhope to see a sequel one day! ~\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198060237017", "last_played": 1493875436, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 662, "playtime_forever": 594}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1492885327, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526621", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492885327, "recommendationid": "31302861", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Extremely  annoying game, no pleasure in playing this.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198113501820", "last_played": 1492984692, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 80}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1492984725, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503278", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1492984725, "recommendationid": "31329222", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
