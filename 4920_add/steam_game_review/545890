The design of most of the levels was well done, but some of the end boss fights just became utterly ridiculous.   \nAnd the number of traps in certain levels was also superfluous to the point of becoming tedious and monotonous.  It could use some work to keep things interesting and challenging but at this point it loses its fun.
