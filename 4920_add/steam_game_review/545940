It's nice being able to specify what animals should spawn on your map, along with the amount (low, mid or high). The graphics have a lot to be desired and look more like it's made in 1999 rather than 2009. As hunting sims go, it's extremely easy to shoot animals in this game, not so much to find them, especially on bigger maps. However, a lot of the time the animals will run right at you or around you, allowing you to shoot them. \n\nI still enjoy this game for what it is, although the controls are a bit annoying, having no auto-run feature is wrist-cramp heaven! Pluses are the fact you get ALL the weapons and animals from the start, and it's cheap enough to waste a few hours on.\n\nIf this is your first hunter sim, avoid this one - I've been playing theHunter for a long time now and if anyone is looking for a good hunter sim, try that instead!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198123200436", "last_played": 1498246966, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 163}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1498247413, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507618", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498247413, "recommendationid": "32695639", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
