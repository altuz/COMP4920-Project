Also I wish they'd change the titles so it said Animated Jigsaws first then the specific title Wildlife, Beautiful Japanese Scenery, Japanese Women so they'd end up all together in my list instead of being seperated. When you have 1700 titles that's a lot of seperation between commmon titles. I should also add that most PC jigsaw games are terrible because they use lazy jig cuts where the pieces are almost all the same two or three shapes. These titles do a much better job with that.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198191401023", "last_played": 1495321091, "num_reviews": 38, "num_games_owned": 1632, "playtime_forever": 96}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1494621364, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505524", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1494623434, "recommendationid": "31709691", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
