For nostalgia players, this game is a must-buy. There is nothing I have to say convince you, it's a proper remaster. But for those who have never even heard of Voodoo Vince before, this is what you want to hear\n--------------------------------\nPROS:\n\n-1080p 60+fps\n-Controller support\n-Updated textures from the original (2003 release)\n-Smooth Platforming\n-Foot-tapping soundtrack (Majority of which is Jazz)\n-Rememberable voice acting, such as the main character Vince (Ken Boynton).\n-Hubworlds with unique level design\n-Devs that respond to community upsets via quality of life patches\n\nCONS:\n-Besides steam achievements, there isn't any sort of incentive to collect everything the game offers.\n-Platforming can be unforgiving. With lives, you can find yourself resetting to the last checkpoint with a certain tricky spot.\n\nMILD UPSETS:\n-No 4k VR support or paid mods ;-)\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTL;DR: Voodoo Vince Remastered does pretty well for a 2003 xbox game. It's a lot like the TY remasters, the devs are listening to the community trying to make patchfixes that improve the quality of the game. If you ever played Voodoo Vince before, this is a must-buy.

If you were anything like me when I first played it as a wee little fetus who had barely escaped the clutches of my mothers loins and you enjoyed it then and even had good memories with it then just buy it again and get hit with that same brick that hit me and (I hope) many others. \n\nHowever, if you haven't played the game I'm not sure if you'll enjoy yourself. Although its an amazing game with a great overall theme (the whole, almost suicidal doll, Jazz music and style), it isn't without its problems that certainly come up today. \n\nThe enchanced graphical improvements really make the remaster something for older players returning to the game it's still nice if you're jumping in for the first time. Now, on to the outstanding problems I have with the game. \n\n- Firstly, the game itself when compared to other platformers out there it doesn't do anything new as far as platformers go. You've got the standard normal punch attack, followed along by the legendary helicopter attack that completely eliminates the purpose of the punch attack. \n\n- Secondly, the boss fights in the game are rather easy and tedious at times, because I only found myself dying by my own hands. Whether I press a wrong key and tumble to my demise or stop paying attention and run into the boss on accident with little to no health.\n\n- At times the camera feels... Unnatural and has to be fought with every now and again just to get out of Vince's velvety asshole so you can finally identify those growling noises you've been hearing for the passed 2.5 milliseconds. \n\n- Some levels/sections can become tedious *cough* I'M LOOKING AT YOU SECTION WHERE YOU HAVE TO BUILD THAT FUCKING HOT AIR BALLOON *cough*. This may be due to me remembering as soon as I saw the loading screen for that section and thinking: \"Oh fuck I remember this bullshit.\" And then procceded to wade through that bullshit to move on.\n\n- You basically have an infinite amount of hearts (which are things you find scattered throughout a level to obtain more lives) ( also I'm pretty sure this was in the older version too). Because whenever you boot the game up you can travel back to a previous location and the hearts will all respawn in the same locations. I don't know if this was on purpose or not but it somewhat takes away from the sense of danger the game has. Even if you never use it you always know you can just \"go back\" if you're left on a single heart.\n\nAll in all if you like a well-grounded, interesting and amusing at times platformer (and can of course excuse the faults) then by all means pick it up. Because myabe... someday... We might just get a sequal...
