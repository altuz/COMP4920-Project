Back in the day when you had to aimlessly wander a scary house while some mysterious psycho stalks your every move; without the game holding your hand and guiding you through every step of the way. Coffin of Ashes can seem unforgiving at times, even cruel in its old school ways. But you will feel a true sense of accomplishment as you gather your wits and use them to the utmost to survive. \n\n The puzzles will really put your brain into cognitive overdrive, sometimes requiring the use of notes (which I'm not complaining about, I love it when games require you to think outside the computer and put pencil to paper to figure them out). I also respect the way the game repurposes common items/sprites/backgrounds in RPGMaker and utilizes them in new and interesting ways. The original art was great as well, adding flavor to cutscenes and helping us to have a more personal connection to the characters. The music and sound effects also help to set the mood perfectly. The protag is adorably deadpan, and it's fun to watch her interact with certain other inhabitants. \n\nThere's a twist in it, which I certainly won't spoil, but it adds a different dimension to your perception of the game and how its played. All in all, it was a difficult but very satisfying overall experience. Can't wait to see what comes next from the dev!\n\n", "received_for_free": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173569365", "last_played": 1500649739, "num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 300, "playtime_forever": 425}, "votes_up": 12, "timestamp_created": 1500746568, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522304", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500746568, "recommendationid": "33726332", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "PSA: THIS GAME REQUIRES 2 PLAYTHROUGHS FOR THE TRUE ENDING\n\nThis is a very nice game with cute sprites, good puzzles, and a coherent story-line. I do feel that the layout of this game is a bit big, for lack of a better term. It does feel that they wanted to make the rooms huge, but it makes everything feel so empty. Upon first playthrough, I did feel somewhat disappointed. I was expecting much more for a $7 game. However, after the credits the game asked me to save, then game me the option for a new game. I did just that, and I was presented with different dialogue, different options, and many different things. Granted, it's mostly the same for a bit, but it does take a turn at a certain point. After completeing the 2nd playthrough, I was content with the game. The story ended well, it made sense, and I felt like I got a great experience for my $7. There are a few things that bug me, but I can overlook them in the grand scheme of things. While most puzzles make snese, there are some that is just trial and error (which can take forever to figure out!). So overall, I do recommend this game, especially now since it's on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198346641970", "last_played": 1501993979, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_forever": 353}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1502326821, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504799", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502326821, "recommendationid": "34136376", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Interesting fun game to play :)\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198179822474", "last_played": 1500787434, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 40, "playtime_forever": 451}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1500787554, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501765", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500787554, "recommendationid": "33736650", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A very ineresting game,Hope to get more of these games early.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "steamid": "76561198348097896", "last_played": 1506509786, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 596}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502713952, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498610", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1502713952, "recommendationid": "34234728", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
