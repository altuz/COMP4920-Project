(which may screw you play up a bit, but that's just fine)\n\nLess than 1 Euro for this...a bargain IMHO, only wish there was a global high score list as it'd be a nice little extra but I'm fine without it and this will be played many times.\n\nIf you like to excercise you brain give it a go, it's less than a Litre of milk and it'll last a lot longer. :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198138101163", "last_played": 1478022042, "num_reviews": 81, "num_games_owned": 152, "playtime_forever": 33}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1478022494, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504824", "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_updated": 1478022494, "recommendationid": "26359052", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "more like jem forge", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046979223", "last_played": 1488077167, "num_reviews": 82, "num_games_owned": 2773, "playtime_forever": 39}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1487963476, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494871", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1487963476, "recommendationid": "30148214", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very much like the \"2048\" game for mobile.
