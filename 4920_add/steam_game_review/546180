If you concentrate fire on them from the moment they show up until they leave the screen, you just barely kill them.\nScore items magnetize to you, but gun powerups do not, meaning you want to maneuver carefully to pick them up.  This would be fine, except there are a lot of enemies with suicide shots???  What kind of design is it to have both suicide shots and pickups come out of the same enemy?\nYou have a melee attack that deflects bullets, but it charges so slowly that you basically have to know the level in advance to use it.\nThe characters are cute but there's not much to the story.
