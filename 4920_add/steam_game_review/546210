Perhaps a challenger could set rules for a duel such as what weapons are allowed, the space between the shooters, or which location the duel takes place, and the challenged player could either accept, decline, or negotiate the rules. Other game types could involve more than just two shooters (imagine a 3 or 4 person duel!) or a contest to shoot target practice objects quickly. A full character creation would be great too. Getting money for winning a duel could be used to purchase cooler hats, bandannas, jackets, gun skins, you name it. Killing the other player in one shot is fun for now, but I'd like to try a gametype where players have health bars and take more damage in certain areas.\n\nFor now I'd say it's worth it's price, but note that it will go up as they add new elements to the game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198203839563", "last_played": 1503682390, "num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 65, "playtime_forever": 49}, "votes_up": 20, "timestamp_created": 1498507842, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541322", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498507842, "recommendationid": "32828911", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "quite enjoy jumping on here for a couple duels now and again, I like the feedback from the vive controllers when your hands are in the correct positions to grip your guns,  however I noticed recently when you look down at your guns prior to the duel starting to position your hands and then look back up at your opponent it changes the position of your hips (makes the guns slightly higher) so you need to adjust for that, since noticing that I no longer raise empty hands and get killed.\noverall I don't regret my purchase, would be nice to have some people to duel/play poker with which is a downfall of many vr titles so far, until that time i will continue to work on my hip fire instead of raising my gun fully to aim.\nFor anyone having the same problems I was having with raising empty hands I hope this helps, and I hope to be able to shoot you in a fair fight online :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198103386268", "last_played": 1493013611, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 141}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1493089481, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1493089481, "recommendationid": "31349898", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "3.6 out of 10\n\nI'll revise this review as game development progresses. Right now I wouldn't recommend Unforgiven VR, there isn't much content to keep you entertained. It has dualing, a shooting gallery area and the saloon with poker. I've yet to find another person online so multiplayer dualing and playing cards is mute, it's just dualing against the AI and the shooting gallery.\n\nThe content in the game is polished, but the repetition of AI dueling has it's limits and stops being interesting after a short time. Goes like this.... Wait for opponent to swagger across the screen, pause, instruction to draw when the bell rings, fire guns. Gunfight is over in a second. But a good 40 seconds just waiting to get started. Rinse and repeat for all duels, somewhat repetitive and becomes boring.\n\nThe early access roadmap is ambitious and indeed if they pull this all off it could turn out to be a a decent title. The developers are leaving the best to later developement builds, which will also be the more challenging for them to make. The way the game exists now, you can't tell that these new game features are coming, it's built in a modular way. If the game was abandoned by the devs you'd still get a fully functioning game with the current features. I wonder if this was intentional, the price will rise as the game is expanded. As an early access purchase it's a fair pricing mechanic, if they fail to deliver the customer has only paid for the value of content at that time.\n\nI'll revisit when the next update arrives, until then I've rinsed enough out of the dualing.
