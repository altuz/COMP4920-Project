So many other games I havent had any problems with so it isnt my Controllers HMD or sensors. Additionaly the game is one of the rare few that nauseate me. Shoppe Keep did the same thing so its a wonder I even gave this game a shot but thats just me.\n\nThe game itself is fun, although it hardly presents itself in a playable manner. Very little is told to the player and the controlls for movement... Rotating your perspective and repositioning yourself should not be on the same thumb stick. Tilt the stick just ever so slightly and you change facing completely. Plus if you reposition yourself out of the are the game wants you to be in the video blacks out, good luck getting back to where you need to be now that your blind. \n\nOverall the game is entertaining when everything is going according to plan. Unfortunately for me and my Occulus, it never does. Might be better for you guys out there with an HTC Vive with its superior tracking capability. But if you have an Occulus, or something with even less tracking ability.
