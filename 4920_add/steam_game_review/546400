It is a tough platform puzzle title. \n\nYou guide a little blue torch with eyes to the end of the level while collecting gems to open up a second mode with more levels. The game is severely lacking any kind of narative that would explain why this torch needs to get to the very end of each level while risking his life dodging spikes littered around each stage. The stages are very linear and get even more rigid the further you get into the game. The game has a world map where you go along unlocking stages until you reach the very end. The game gets crazy hard by level 15 of the first mode, you need some crazy speed to get past the game.\n\nThe graphics are very basic. They're clean, you can tell the spikes hurt you. There are torches with a little flame animation on them. There are pillars that move into place when you first enter a stage. There are also balls and blocks with spikes that will move around in a pattern that act as a obstacle for the little blue torch. The game is very purple in mode 1, and green in mode 2. I was hoping for a little more variety but I couldn't get further to find out if there was a third color later in the game.\n\nThe game has sounds, and there is a musical score that plays in the background. There is even a soundtrack available if you enjoy what you hear. I don't remember one bit of it even now that I just got done playing the game less than 30 minutes ago. I'll just say it's very forgettable. \n\nOverall I think this game needs to be avoided even if you can get it on sale. There are cards you can collect. If that is your thing, just idle it. Even then the electrical costs, computer depreciation, time, etc will probably not make it worth it to get the cards.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969481463", "last_played": 1501659900, "num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 905, "playtime_forever": 23}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1501657855, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501659591, "recommendationid": "33965349", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Best game 2017 bounced on my boys dick to these graphic for hours.
