How on earth this game hasn't received more attention? Great art style, good music, nice touch of humour and level design that actually makes you think! Seriously, what's not to like? Recommended for all puzzle game fans! (difficulty so far has been just right, I try to remember to update my review when I've completed the game)\n\nEDIT\nOk now I completed the game and it took me 7 hours of pretty intense gameplay. Still I've got a couple of achievements, that give me good reason to return to this game in the future! Hmm, where could that barn party be at...\n\nI would say that the difficulty is just right, a little incostistent maybe. There are some hard levels that make you think and took me about 40 tries, some levels you might get on the first try. I don't consider that as a big negative point, important thing is that there are those harder levels that force you to think properly. The 3 boss levels are different, they don't require thinking so much but a little bit of practice and skill, which is very nice contrast to all other puzzle-type levels!\n\nReally nice and refreshing game, I recommend! Especially good for those late evenings that you are too tired to play shooty-bang-bang games, but don't want to go to sleep either.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041099788", "last_played": 1503161998, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 217, "playtime_forever": 458}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1502828111, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503162472, "recommendationid": "34263157", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
