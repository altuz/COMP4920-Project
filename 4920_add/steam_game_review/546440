But as that is not just the game, let's go into how the gameplay is. Being a cheap, local multi-player brawler, Sluggish Moss does provide what it promises. However, it's not enough to recommend it as improvements can be made to make it more enjoyable and effective. \n\n[h1]Improvements That Could Be Made[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*] Keyboard controls can be improved in terms of moving the controls for player two to the number bad instead of the arrow keys. I found it too cluttered with the current set up. Also having the 'V' key seems really awkward as I kept on pressing either 'C' or 'V' thinking it was the zap button.\n    [*] Perhaps rename the Help to Controls, and adding in how to enter the map for the next round (the person I played with happen to hit the Shift key/Boom key). Or have a continue page with the controls (before going into the round and after loading) since the controls go too fast in the loading screen.\n    [*] Perhaps more customization to the versus. Having more than the condition of having at least 2-0, or being 1 point ahead. Maybe being able to set how many wins you need and either random or selected maps so you don't have to pick one each time unless you select that setting before going into the versus. With only heaving to do a maximum of 3 rounds, it seems too short.\n[/list]\n\nBut if you do want a cheap game to play on a random game night with friends or family go for Sluggish Morss: Days of the Purple Sun. I do see how it could have been improved more than what it is now and while it is close to being recommended, it is not quite.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198280371208", "last_played": 1484544686, "num_reviews": 92, "num_games_owned": 379, "playtime_forever": 41}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1484546667, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500202", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1484546674, "recommendationid": "29290240", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I experienced this fine game at a LAN party in Wisconsin. I recently purchased some A grade titles, like Battlefield 1, but I can confirm that NOTHING meets the standards of this mint ass fucking game. Firstly, in Battlefield you play as a piece of waste, but in Sluggish Morss, you have the option of controlling a furry purple cunt or a brown ass fucker. With memorable quotes like \"dog dicks\" and memorable levels like \"The hood\" no one can make me fucking quit playing this fucking game. now if you dont agree fucking kill yourself and Merlin Cardin is a fucking legend.
