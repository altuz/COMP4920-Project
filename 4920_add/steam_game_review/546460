The sprite seems a bit slow and floaty, but that's acceptable with such a small game and I got used to it, the controls are fine and precise enough, there are much worse indie platformers out there, this is definetely better than a flash/browser game. The puzzles are simple but not boring, they got really cool by the end, actually stumped me for a sec. The platforming and traps are well made, the gameplay has a nice flow. I wish there was more levels, and the sprite had better physics, this would be a perfect game.\n\nI got through the dungeons in bit less than two hours, and the end screen informed me that I've died 147 times and only found 1 out of 5 gemstones.
