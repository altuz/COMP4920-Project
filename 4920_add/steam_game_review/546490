The option to choose your own name doesn't exist, the characters are very one-dimensional with only one graphic for each, the mini-game is completely and totally pointless, and the length of time this game encompasses does not allow for any real feeling of connection with either the story or the characters. On the plus side, the art style is good and the soundtrack is soothing. For a short game at a low price, it's not a bad investment, but don't buy this one if you want something to touch you or make you feel you've experienced something romantic.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198277991413", "last_played": 1500143791, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 67, "playtime_forever": 119}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1500144074, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500149544, "recommendationid": "33565989", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
