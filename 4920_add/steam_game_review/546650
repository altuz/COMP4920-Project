The only game I'd rate higher in this regards is Holodance, but that is because the orb placement in that game is set by a human therefore always spot on.\n- Gives you quite a workout - if you are hoping VR might help you lose weight this is an excellent game to use.\n- Constantly have to turn around as the orbs change which direction they come from, but they do this well and you will never have an orb coming from outside of your peripheral vision, so you will never be surprised by an orb you didn't see.\n- Have to dodge obstacles from time to time, not just punch everything.\n\nCons:\nI fully expect that many of these cons will be resolved over time, since they are all just polish type issues, and nothing fundamentally wrong with the game. When I bought the game it lacked local .mp3 support, but that was added within a day.\n- Local files only support .mp3 files - there is currently no .ogg or .flac support, which will be a disappointment for many audiophiles and free software advocates, and means I am unable to play the vast majority of my music collection.\n- Whatever .mp3 decoder they are using added pops into several of my songs. These tracks were all legally purchased from Amazon and other online stores, and play fine in every other music player.\n- File browser cannot scroll past the 40th entry in a directory, which can be a significant problem for those of us with a reasonable music collection (which I suspect is most of the audience for games like this).\n- After scrolling down in one directory and entering another, no subdirectories may be displayed until blindly scrolling upwards.\n- File browser does not remember where you last were in the filesystem after playing a track.\n- Tends to favour turning clockwise, so after every track you may have to turn around counter-clockwise half a dozen times to straighten the cable out.\n- Feedback seems inconsistent - the controllers vibrate for most punches, but not all - I'm pretty sure I didn't miss, but it doesn't feel like I hit anything.\n\nFeatures I couldn't care less about, but probably work well if you do care about them:\n- Something something iTunes something something.\n- Youtube (because Australian Internet sucks and so does the audio quality)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018759801", "last_played": 1500673547, "num_reviews": 56, "num_games_owned": 1008, "playtime_forever": 161}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1481112721, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510165", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1481118418, "recommendationid": "28234830", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Game gives you a work out!
