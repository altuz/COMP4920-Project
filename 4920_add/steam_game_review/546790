This game reminded me of a comic that I used to make when I was little. It starred little creatures that were spherical in shape, but had arms and legs... it kind of makes me want to reboot that comic series and make it a real thing! So this game was a little inspiring for me.\n\nOnto the gameplay and real review bits.\n\nPros:\n- Reminds one of Sonic and other platformers from the 90s.\n- Good level layouts with unique Red stars to collect (5 per level), except 3rd level.\n- No timer for levels which gives plenty of time to explore.\n- Levels are episodic, with 3 levels per planet.\n- Rocketing around the levels is pretty fun, lol.\n- The boss fights are pretty casual, nice touch for casual gamers.\n- It has a decent amount of achievements.\n\nCons:\n- Sometimes get stuck on tiles, I've noticed that the Magma world is the worst.\n- Since boss fights are casual, it might not appeal to a certain demographic of gamers.\n\n\nTL;DR\nI really liked this game, it was a spritely and colorful environment. I had fun exploring the levels looking for the 5 red stars needed to enter the free-collect level with plenty of stars to fly around and catch. It really reminds me of Sonic and some other platformers that I used to play when I was young, so the nostalgia factor is quite nice. \n\nThanks for making this game, keep it up developer! :^)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198058177937", "last_played": 1504932954, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 137, "playtime_forever": 921}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504818978, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499550", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504933570, "recommendationid": "34802769", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
