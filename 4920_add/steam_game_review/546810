All you do on this game is follow the dot to reach to your mission objective (again pretty similar to Chernobyl Commando). At least this game is somewhat more stable than Chernobyl Commando. To be honest with you guys, I honestly would give this game a neutral rating but unfortunately there is not a neutral button option. This game has some good moments and some bad moments. The good moments on this game are the shootouts, sniper firing, and the underground tunnel part (in my opinion). The bad moments on this game are the constant environment locations, the frame-rate chugs periodically, and that cheap kill cam moment when you kill the last enemy in the area (makes it look like a cheap budgeted Sniper Elite camera moment but without the skeletal mode). All in all this game is alright but it is definitely worth trying but only buy the game when it goes on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198121927012", "last_played": 1501669963, "num_reviews": 129, "num_games_owned": 913, "playtime_forever": 174}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501723877, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502937", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501723877, "recommendationid": "33982927", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
