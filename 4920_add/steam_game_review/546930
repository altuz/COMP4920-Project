I think there's some sort of voice-acted story that goes to this, but honestly it's boring and doesn't make up for the gameplay whatsoever. There's no terrain detection for enemies, the little 2 foot tall robots can somehow climb 5 foot fences at the same speed at which they walk. Most gun animations consist of 3 frames repeated when reloading. There are no stats given for any of the weapons, and no text boxes or anything to give you an indication of what's on your HUD. Controls aren't covered, either. Maps are terribly bland, though better than the incredibly boring maps in the Dinosaur games by this developer due to how many generic assets they placed in it (none of which you can interact with).\n\nThis developer has to be using an FPS Maker Studio without actually knowing much about coding or game design. Out of the four games the developer has released, they're all exactly the same just with different environments. And they're all now achievement spam games with trading cards because the dev knows how bad they are and needs some gimmick to get people to buy them.
