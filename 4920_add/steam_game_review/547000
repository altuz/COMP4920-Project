While it seems like it could get fun, the initial play is very slow, as in your little submarine moves very slowly. And many common enemies require a TON of damage before they die. So you're basically just pounding away with your very weak starter gun with no weapon upgrades. Some small bad guys take like 20 hits to die. The first boss is just a war of attrition for you to hold down your shooter and steer, bouncing around in this little room with the boss and your pea shooter. Boring. Not hard per se, just tedious. Also, there seems to be a bug where when you return to a saved game, if you hit the A button on your pad it freezes and you have forcibly shut down the program to get moving. All that being said, I like the graphics and the scatalogical theme. Just wish it were more fun.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198342609992", "last_played": 1481928717, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 92}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1479021857, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1482521185, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503676", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1479021857, "developer_response": "Wanted to thank you for your comments and review. We've addressed the speed and torpedo issues that you mentioned (including damage output), and we've also added new torpedo types that make killing enemies much easier. We are also working towards overhauling the Campaign Mode (which is what it sounds like you spent most of your time on). We agree that this particular aspect of the game is still lacking, and want to work to make it as satisfying as the endless Arcade Mode. We're glad you enjoy the theme and artwork and we really appreciate the constructive feedback. I'm glad to be able to say that we at least have some of it fixed now!", "recommendationid": "26575319", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
