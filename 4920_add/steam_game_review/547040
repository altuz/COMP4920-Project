It didn't sell me for a second on being afloat in space looking down at the Earth. Everything looked too small and too close. The moon is about three meters away, so is the Earth, and about the size of a dinner table. You can't cheat with scale in VR like you can in flat games. Did the devs try playing this in VR?\n[*]I have no idea what the readout at the top of my vision is, because it sits outside of the visible field when wearing a VR headset. I was twisting my face trying to see it. Again, makes me wonder if the devs even tried this in VR. Why not bind the readout to the controller in your hand? I eventually managed to read it and it didn't make sense. \"02:35%\"\n[*]The high fidelity and beauty of the Earth clashes with the low quality of the props and the \"space station\" you see at the beginning (even though it's gone within seconds).\n[*]It went on for too long. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I got bored looking at planet Earth from space, because it was badly done. I have to go play with Google Earth VR for a bit to reverse this cynicism.\n[/list]\n\nI wish I played this right when I bought it. I bought it months ago, and now I can't refund it.
