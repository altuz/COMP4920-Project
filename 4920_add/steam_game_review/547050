I have completed the \"white circle\" themed area but have no idea what those circles mean - it was all just brute force and guesswork on my part. and even in areas with rules I understand I feel like the game's just not giving me enough specific information to solve the puzzles. The Witness tried a similar thing, and failed for a similar reason - it's very easy to either not understand what the game is trying to teach you, or to get the wrong lesson from the tutorials only to suddenly be confronted with that lesson not applying in the actual game.\n\nI feel like the game would have benefited from sacrificing the aesthetic for a more specific tutorial. perhaps give the player the option to turn it off and figure out the rules on their own. as it is, it's too easy to just not figure out what the game wants you to do, and from there there's nothing stopping you from giving up and brute forcing the answer - maybe let the player make incorrect inputs. colour a block blue that's supposed to be green, and when you get to the end of the puzzle just don't progress the game until the player figures out where he went wrong? I dunno, just shooting in the dark here.\n\nI really do wanna like this game. it's got a good aesthetic and it's a good game to play in the background while doing other things. but it just ultimately fails as a puzzle game. it's close, but not quite there. The logic is unclear and poorly communicated compared to other puzzle games on steam. I'll just go back to playing that one picross game i bought for basically the same purpose that does a much better job of fulfiling that purpose.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989960659", "last_played": 1499979888, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 321, "playtime_forever": 112}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500173217, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1500173217, "recommendationid": "33575169", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
