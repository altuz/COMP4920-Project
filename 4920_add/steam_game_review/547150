Then you will love The Morgue, because that is exactly what it is. It has no health or sanity effects, it pretends to have a stealth section, but in reality the game's single enemy isn't really capable of that. It takes about 30 minutes to finish and claims to have more episodes coming, but really why would you want to play another episode after suck a dismal starting.

It says that it's 15-40 minutes for every chapter, that this is chapter 1 and the following chapters are too release and everything in the video is most definitely in the game.  I quite enjoyed this game! But that is because I knew this chapter was  an introduction and the following chapters were going to expand on the world/puzzles/etc...  For $4 I'd definitely recommend it because it includes the expanding gameplay with monthly updates aka the chapters.  If you are worried about how short it is maybe wait another month or two after the 2nd or 3rd chapters release and give it a go then.  I know everyone has different taste but don't leave a negative review for what the game BLATANTLY puts in front of your face and you failed to read. All I can say is I'm looking forward to the next chapters and for those who are questioning whether to purchase it or not...I can only say maybe wait for the next chapter to release or watch a few minutes in a playthrough to see if it's something you might be interested in.\n\nPros:\n-promising atmosphere (especially the water area)\n-screw your creepy statues\n-also screw your cathulucabra creature!\n-Random creepy music\n\nCons:\n-no in game settings (volume, video, etc...)\n-was a bit too dark even on lightest setting (which I believe was fixed in the most recent patch)\n-some areas could use a bit more texture (which I see was also added in the most recent patch)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198097303058", "last_played": 1491118130, "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 148, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1493925278, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492220", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1493953093, "recommendationid": "31546613", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "25 minutes.
