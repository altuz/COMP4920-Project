In addition, a checkpoint system is also included which refills every 2 stages as well, however - you'll only get the perfect achievement if you beat the whole set without using any checkpoints.\n[/list]\n\nThis game was clearly inspired from RFLEX and Zero reflex, I feel that it should be pointed out in case you are familiar with those ones.\n\nOverall I had a good experience playing this small game. \nThe requirements to beat every set of stages weren't very high IMO, so basically anyone with a bit of patience and a decent amount of skill can do this within a fair amount of time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040030741", "last_played": 1487187290, "num_reviews": 106, "num_games_owned": 828, "playtime_forever": 289}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1486616382, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1487020570, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503774", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1487187894, "developer_response": "An update to Sullen was put out earlier today that addresses your concern of the game being too difficult.

After several attempts I was eventually able to get a non-zero score. Disappointed to see there's no achievement for that. (Given that I did complete the tutorial I don't think the achievements are working, but I don't think that will affect me much). It's clearly a labour of love with high production values (if you appreciate careful minimalism), but it's apparently aimed at people who think Super Hexagon is for wusses.
