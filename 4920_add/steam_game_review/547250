Then they bump into each other or just sit in a corner somewhere. There is no challenge to any of this. \n\nYou will never feel immersed or excitement because of how amateur and cartoon like everything feels.

The AI are horrible and player models will intermittently dissappear then reappear. There is a not a very big weapons selection either. I didn't find the combat very fun either; there is not a lot of weapon recoil and whenever I stabbed someone with the knife it never would do any damage.\nThere is no way to tell if anyone else is in multiplayer. You just select a map under the multiplayer menu and it drops you into a game (all of mine consisted of bots). It needs some sort of indication saying how many players are playing are in a map. \nI'm sorry but this game is not worth $19.99; it's $5 less than Onward and right now the price I'd put this game at is free. Do a demo / open beta and improve the game then stick a price tag on it.
