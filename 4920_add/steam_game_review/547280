In the current version, it is really just a visual aid on about ~2 dozen concepts used in complex algebra, calculus, trig, etc.\n\n They picked some good examples, but I feel like the software lacks core functionality, like being able to save your workspace for example (what is the point of a pen if not). It becomes impossible to grab the data points/objects on the screen if you take the data points to their maximum on the plane and release the button. Aliasing is terrible in this app and I even tried to force AA. Every time the game says the \u201cred\u201d object, it means the black one. You should be able to pull up multiple modules at once and compare multiple parameters. You should be able to zoom in and make the modules bigger/smaller.\n\nI feel like the idea is excellent and with time and with more development it could offer some really insightful experiences for students or anyone trying to learn/better their understanding of higher-level math. I would love to see circuits integrated into this application as it looks like you have the mathematical foundation to handle simple circuits. Math like this is very abstract and hard to visualize, even professors have trouble drawing some of this stuff. Having the ability to see it in front of your face and change parameters on the fly is really the selling point.\n\nFor $10 I do recommend this for VR IF you are interested in mathematics, if not, move along.
