But this is FX2!.... Well on the ps3 then ps4 it was called zen pinball)\nI owned most of the ps3 tables and when the ps4 came out i was able to import them, I confess i was a little annoyed when i downloaded the pc version and could not import my tables! So on the ps4 i own ...well nearly all of them if i am honest, these are really really well made tables! \nSadly on the VR version there is only a tiny selection of tables and no sign that we will get any more. This does include the awesome Epic Quest table though. It was annoying that the tables had to be re-brought (those i own on the ps4) but i was willing to do so to help support the developers.\n\n\n[b]ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT / GRAPHICS[/b]\n You can have 3 tables active in the room space at any one time, however this is largely academic as you will only ever be playing one at a time (even if they let you play all three at once i doubt you have enough arms!) this does seem to be a disappointment to some and i confess i do not understand why (again i am only in possession of two arms and one head so perhaps those with multiple of them want to play more than one at once?)\nThe area you play in is done well and you have easy access to the menu and leaderboards, what is really cool is that each table comes with props that float and animate around you while you play, the animations on the tables are also really well done and translate well into VR (i so want to play the portal table or see what they come up with for the deadpool table in VR...one can dream)\n\n\n[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] \nI had no issues at all and there is plenty of options to tailor the game to your machines specifications, i have heard people bemoaning the performance but as i say it worked great for me and since this is my review\u2026..no performance issues.\nThere is a bug that is unrelated to performance, and more a \u201cwhy the hell have they not fixed this yet thing\u201d - The tables are very low which means when you stand your looking down a lot, not comfy with the vive and easily fixed with a height slider (Their community manager actually said to stand a stool or chair, reset the position then jump down\u2026..proving that sometimes people just do not think, personally when blindfolded by the vive i avoid climbing on chairs, perhaps that makes me a coward lol) I did find though that being sat and loading the game seemed to put it at the right height for me to play sat down.\n\n[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] \nIt is pinball, you hit the ball with the flippers and scream at it when it jumps down the whole at the bottom. Can not get much more intuitive than that. The controls are clearly displayed on your wands too.\n\n[b]MULTIPLAYER:[/b] \nIt has leaderboards, i for one like beating my mates scores (on the ps4 i am top dog on every table i own :) among my mates).\n[b]PROS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*] The pinball tables are exceptionally well done.\n[*] The animations around the table are very cool and add a good atmosphere (and amusement).\n[*] Pinball in VR works really well, i do not think i can go back to flatscreen pinball now (annoying as i have \u00a3100+ worth of tables over the years on the ps4)\n[/list]\n\n[b]CONS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*] Seems abandoned by the developers, no additional tables or important bugfixes.\n[*] Fx3 is coming out soon and has no VR, this is a bad sign for FX2 VR.\n[/list]\n\n[b]VERDICT[/b] \nGetting it shows the developers that VR pinball is something we want to see more off, but only get it if you are happy to keep it how it is (for the content available now it is not cheap but worth it)\nI am deeply displeased that the company has all but abandoned VR and i really hope they do a U-Turn on Fx3 and add VR support, i certainly will not buy any FX3 content while they avoid VR,i just can not go back to playing it flatscreen, the ability to see the whole table makes playing it just so much more enjoyable. As the only VR pinball table game i have played (are there others?) and ignoring the fact the company has, as i say, all but abandoned us, i do recommend it, most highly.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197966649882", "last_played": 1499406844, "num_reviews": 68, "num_games_owned": 1091, "playtime_forever": 80}, "votes_up": 14, "timestamp_created": 1499623162, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527460", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1499623162, "recommendationid": "33410623", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "THIS IS THE FUTURE OF PINBALL!!! Best pinball experience to date, less a few issues that once corrected overtime will truly make this incredible!!!\n\nPros:\n- With the low latency of VR, the table feels real time with no perceivable delays. FINALLY!!!\n- Feels like you are standing (or sitting) in front of a real pinball table.\n- Graphics, especially the lighting is very impressive.\n- Sounds are spot on.\n- Tables have cool animations and elements just not possible on a real table which are cool.\n\n\nCons:\n- You will desire more resolution as the back or the table is rather pixelated. Playable for sure, but visually less real that you would want which breaks immersion for me at times. Not a Con for the game but rather a con for VR as a whole right now. Cannot wait for VR to get to 8k +.\n- The animation on the outside of the table is very annoying and distracting.\n- No matter how many times I calibrated my system, the floor in the game was always ~6-8\" lower than the floor in my actually room.  I even have the floor fix add on and while SteamVR home is spot on, the floor in the game is always off.  Other games do not have this issue and nor did this game when I first purchased.  Very frustrating as I feel too tall when I play which is distracting and weird feeling. Come on Zen, fix this please.\n- The A, B, X, Y buttons mapped to the Vive's trackpad are utterly ridiculous. For instance, if you go to click A at the bottom and feel the bottom edge of the trackpad with your finger and press, nothing happens.  Why? Well the A button is about 2mm above the edge and thus must press there.  So silly as the A button should just extend to the edge. This needs to be fixed.\n- The 3 included tables are slow. Pinball tables in the real world have different speeds and I tend to prefer the faster ones, but this game all 3 are painfully slow most of the time. \n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198080940407", "last_played": 1502842156, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 118}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1502821447, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500771", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502821447, "recommendationid": "34261194", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Wow, this is triple win, no more need to expand my physical game room, much more user experience than regular pinball and less stuff so wife happy :-)\n\nGreat graphics like we are used to from ZEN.\n\nGreat and keep those X-platform titles coming in the VR library, waiting for Judge Dredd and Revenge from Mars :-)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198022392990", "last_played": 1501760869, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_forever": 122}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500817760, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500771", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500819632, "recommendationid": "33744507", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I have the HTC vive and this game works perfectly.\n\nWithout a doubt the coolest smoothest, most realistic pinball experience other than actually playing a real machine.
