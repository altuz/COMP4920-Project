I think it's great that each island has multiple achievements for building on it meaning that as they add more islands the achievements just keep coming. The game itself hasn't been out for a month yet but it's got a really solid foundation and I think it could grow to become pretty great for this sort of game. The devs have been very active constantly integrating helpful features in to Guild Quest as well which is great to see in Early Access. I really hope that this can keep up as the game gets further into EA.\n\nFor the time being I think updating the resolution on most of the textures and all of the text is needed as at the moment it looks a little too low res. I think with higher res texturing it could just look cleaner all-round.\n\nOverall a really solid game that has at least a dozen hours of playtime and counting for me personally, and for anyone who hunts achievements or just really enjoys this sort of game, probably many countless more.
