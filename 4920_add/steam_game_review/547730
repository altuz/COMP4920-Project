Those have some variety in shot type and bombs but I din't had time to try them all yet.\nStory is ok, I believe there is one or more references to Touhou Project.\n\nThe patterns are quite tight, especially on highest difficulty setting and for some might be undodgable without some basic knowledge from playing other Shmups beffore. Good news for new players, there is abudance of (9) bombs - those clear the field of bullets and deal some dammage to enemies (best used when you are cornered / can't move freely anymore). For more seasoned players, yes you can decrease number of those.\n\nThe game also introduces quite interesting mechanic of \"Focus\". So, the Focus works as your item-magnet, pulling all points, power ups, bombs ect, towards you. It also grazes and stops bullets around you - it has some good range but lasts only a moment and needs to regenerate before used again.\nFor those unfamiliar, Grazing stands for flying close to bullets aka \"gently touching bullets\" for more points.\nFocus mechanic can be really helpful with some patterns giving you time to fly through the open spots before those close, it is extremarelly usefull but can also damage you.\n\nAnd some people familiar with this genre might ask \"Damage? you meant kill you right?\" - and the truth is, that this game uses a health bar that can be regenerated by special white pick-ups with cross on them.\nAside from that, it appears that Death bombing (using bomb in split second after/ the same moment you are hit in order to save yourselve) does not exist in this game, so be warned.\nOther thing worth noting is that hidbox is extremly small, and slow movement is (at least for me) really slow.\n\nFor Boss patterns, as far as I got those seem to be orginal, and I am really glad about it. Last time I tried an indie shmup it had some rip-offs from other shmups that I played before.\n\n---\nAnd as a note, sadly my graphic card is fried, and I was playing on my integrated GPU which can handle most games of this genre really well. This unfortunely wasn't the case for this game, I have experienced some frame drops and freezes at some places, but game was still very playable durring the boss fights on highest difficulty. That being said, for me game simply freezes upon beating stage 2.\nTherefore I will update this review once I get my graphic card replaced, so make sure to check this reviev in month or two.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038121294", "last_played": 1501801404, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 260, "playtime_forever": 129}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1498424680, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514563", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498424680, "recommendationid": "32788621", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
