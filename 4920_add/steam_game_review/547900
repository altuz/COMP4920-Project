Restricted versus unrestricted free agents?  First draft picks flopping and 7th round picks leading your franchise?  Players holding out over contract disputes?  Having to make tough calls about injuries because you don't really know 100% when the player will be available again and bringing him back too soon could injure him even worse?   Relocating to nearly any city or town you can think of?  Choosing your entire coaching staff?  Even former players becoming coaches -- I watched as Ben Roethlisberger ended up joining the coaching staff of the Falcons before rising up to become their head coach.\n\nI have some minor criticisms -- mostly that player ratings are randomized (there's an option to only \"slightly\" randomize it but even that is too much, as half the time, even \"slight\" randomization causes Joe Flacco to not be the starting QB of the Ravens in 2016, for example.)  I'd like an option to completely remove randomization all together,   Also, I think coach ratings are ENTIRELY randomized...half the time, Mike Tomlin gets fired from the Steelers after the 2016 season and no other team wants him.  That's ridiculous.\n\nBut once you get past that first 1-3 years of willing suspension of disbelief, the game becomes INCREDIBLE.  Absolutely fantastic.  You can play for 100 years and look back at every detail.  Amazing.\n\nHighly recommended!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198126330208", "last_played": 1505460609, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 60, "playtime_forever": 18986}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1502560902, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505009", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1502560902, "recommendationid": "34196652", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I love it.

The game engine is very mysterious, so in MP everyone has their own little theories about what works best. MP play is easy-going and slow-paced, sort of like playing postal chess. The community is very active creating web pages for leagues, utilities to perform a live draft, data bases, or simply to discuss game play. I know I'm shown with about 800 hrs played, but this is just the last version. I actually go way back with this game. It's become part of my life routine to start the day with 10-30 minutes of FOF, then check back the next day and see what happened (actually, my hours might be a bit bloated from leaving the game on the background while I carry on with my day before deciding to do something). Very recommended, but only if you intend to play MP.

Rude, sarcastic, generally unhelpful old men. There are roughly 5 leagues or so total that have a full 32 members, and it's basically all the same people in each one. I played this version for about 8 months and never once saw a new league form. All the stuff about how bad the defense/AI are is 100% true. The developer wrote a letter 4-5 months ago stating he was no longer going to be updating this version (less than a year after it's release), and posted it on FoF central.. one day later he removed it, and there hasn't been a word from him after that. \n\nAll the positive reviews you see from the last 5-6 months are a coordinated effort on part of one GM to try to salvage the remaining leagues he runs, even these leagues see 1-2 players a month quitting. \n\nYou will spend countless hours on hours trying to understand how the game works as just about everything in the game is some hidden bar or rating with zero true explanation on how the game is determining the results, if you ask the community you will receive the most blatantly vague answer, if you press for more information you get labeled an a$$hole and get pretty much crapped on everytime you post something thereafter. The end result of all your attempts to learn the game will result in about 10-15 minutes of actual play time per day.\n\nThe game is full of bugs that are never fixed. Full of useless information in the help file that pretty much explains nothing in regards to how the game actually works. The few remaining players are the die hards that have been around for several versions of the game and as I mentioned above, are all basically old men who ran this players base off and into the ground.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019695010", "last_played": 1498407813, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_forever": 165773}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1500571066, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498314", "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_updated": 1500571066, "recommendationid": "33676569", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}]}
