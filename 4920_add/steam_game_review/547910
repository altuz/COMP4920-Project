The atmospheric build up is quite intense and the story line was engaging as long as you allowed yourself the time to immerse yourself in it by reading. You have to be into reading as it highly relies on you reading documents you find to build the story up. Without it there would be no understanding of it. It's worth the read. Keep in mind as well, puzzles are minimal. It is a walking simulator so if you are expecting fps or a horror hide and seek this is not the case. However, the paranoia will slowly creep on you as much as you tell yourself it won't which is a testament to the developers and their build ups. I often had my back to the wall reading documents I was paranoid to leave myself exposed in the game, I was a wall hugger extraordinaire LOL It does tend to feel repetitive over time regarding the scares however it's still worth playing through and for 4.99 ($2.99 on sale for me) you just can not beat it. AND those stinkin angel statues!!! I'd crap my spleen out often when they'd show themselves.
