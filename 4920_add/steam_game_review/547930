You can fly with your ship in space, land on planets and stations, approach other ships and each planet is like an open world. You can explore the cities and locations, get out in land and air vehicles exploring the planet and interact with NPCs (human or not), hostile or not. All with a central story and missions.\n\nThough old is simply amazing.\n\nYou can expect some bugs and problems, but nothing that will interfere with gameplay.\n\nThe audio is only in Russian and with English subtitles.\n\nWorth every penny(IMO).\n\n\nEu ja tinha a vers\u00e3o antiga da \"gamersgate\" e agora comprei a vers\u00e3o steam(jogando em 2560 x 1080), porque esse jogo \u00e9 simplesmente unico em seu genero.\n\n\u00c9 um RPG/FPS muito bom, com elementos que mesmo os jogos mais atuais n\u00e3o possuem. Voce pode voar com sua nave no espa\u00e7o, pousar em planetas e esta\u00e7\u00f5es, abordar outras naves e cada planeta \u00e9 como se fosse um mundo aberto. Voce pode explorar as cidades e locais, sair em veiculos terrestres e a\u00e9reos explorando o planeta e vai interagir com NPCs humanos ou n\u00e3o, hostis ou n\u00e3o. Tudo com uma hist\u00f3ria/enredo central e miss\u00f5es.\n\nApesar de antigo \u00e9 simplesmente incrivel.\n\nMas nem tudo s\u00e3o flores no jogo. Pode esperar alguns bugs e problemas, mas nada que interfira no gameplay.\n\nO audio \u00e9 apenas em Russo e legendas em ingles.\n\nVale cada centavo.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040644553", "last_played": 1489965034, "num_reviews": 72, "num_games_owned": 109, "playtime_forever": 907}, "votes_up": 52, "timestamp_created": 1486223072, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577127", "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_updated": 1486331448, "recommendationid": "29696114", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I should start this review saying that buying this on Seam will be the third time I have actually paid money for this game (I own my original Russian disc copies still and own it on GamerGate, the following review is my original review the latter) and should be telling in-of itself. After I play the Steam version, I will update my review with any additional notes I find about the about the game that are unique to this version. Hopefully now that Deep Shadows have released two of their three best games on Steam (the other being (Xenus II) White Gold), they will release (Xenus) Boiling Point: Road to Hell (and maybe start developing these types of games again. \n \nReview is as follows: \nThis game does something that very few games have done. It creates a truly open world experience (ala Elder Scrolls) that is in an amazingly realized Sci-Fi setting. It is beautiful, fun and every bit as wondrous as when you first step into an elder scrolls game. Granted, as with all deep shadows games I have played, there are some glitches, technical malfunctions and jenky code along the way (as with most Russian developed games that are ported to English), however there is an active community that is actively releasing unofficial patches to clean up the technical malfunctions.\n\nIn closing, despite the technical issues, the game is highly playable out of the box and the vast majority of the time you will not even notice the technical issues because the game is so fun and amazing on scope. Paired with the active community continuously bettering the game, this is a must buy for any fan of FPS, RPG, FPS/RPG or open world genres.\n\nThe final verdict: I give this game 5 out of 5 stars and is a must buy for anyone interested in the above genres and/or anything Sci-Fi.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004263235", "last_played": 1488437065, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 3502, "playtime_forever": 35}, "votes_up": 37, "timestamp_created": 1486252308, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555427", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1486252308, "recommendationid": "29706083", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
