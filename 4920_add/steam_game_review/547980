I am hooked.\n\nMy initial impression after loading the game was not good.  The crude graphics of the menu did not fill the screen, and the interface with arrow keys, spacebar, tab etc did not impress.\n\nAs I started exploring (turn-based), however,I got immersed  in the things to find and understand, realizing there is a lot of depth here.  What does it mean when the lantern changes color as I move around?  I can open those trapped chests with my warrior but take damage.  That aluminum ax I found does additional damage but lowers my magic resistance. I purchased a hint (number 70) from a shopkeeper which will become part of an on-going accessable list as my I discover more of the game's secrets.\n\nAt floor 8, my level 4 Warrior got wiped by a killer plant.  The game left a detailed memorial to my departed hero.  There is also a 17 page list of game items (100's of items) with the detail of discovered items changed from greyed-out to color with detailed descriptions.\n\nAfter reading the helps and hints written by the developer, I am ready to explore again.  I am going to pick a campfire starting kit this time as one of my warrior's 3 starting items.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198068300266", "last_played": 1505325458, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 96, "playtime_forever": 595}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504795223, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504795223, "recommendationid": "34795619", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Equin: Rabbit Torture Simulator Game!\n\nYou're a rabbit that follows a mysterious lantern into a cave that descends 50 floors. Along the way you'll enounter monsters, weapons, various items, traps, and a surprising amount of secrets. Anyone familiar with old 8-bit rpg's should be more than familiar with this formula, but don't misinterpret the term formula with bland as this is rpg does break the mold a bit.\n\nIt only seems super simple if you play super-casual but upon investing more time you realize that this game is surprisingly more in-depth than you may have initially given it credit for. There are four classes to choose from and you are given a choice of 3 items amongst a preselected set to start your adventure. Weapons vary offering special skills and your character, as it levels up, gains access to various skills that offer a surprising amount of strategy that I certainly was not expecting. The music is also surprising in the sense that not only is it pretty good but there's more than 3 tracks to listen to and that is a breath of fresh air. I also like the humor. I generally play games blind but I did watch the preview trailer for this game and that alone was convincing enough for me to purchase without fear of regret. While you may not be in stitches the comments and various bits of flavor text kept me chuckling and adds a bit of charm and personality that I feel quite a few games are missing nowadays. The random elements thrown in keeps the game from being \"samey\" and adds alot of flair and spice to your gameplay.\n\nUnfortunately, the downside to too much spice is chest tightening and alot of tears. I'm only mentioning this because some people, including the friends that I exposed this game to, are not big fans of random number generating. Until you get your feet wet, everything will seem absolutely random to the point of cruelty. A few people may be turned off at the prospect of having to start a game multiple times due to bad RNG. Being placed directly in front of an unavoidable killer plant at level 1 is a thing, dying within the first ten seconds, completely clearing 10 floors without obtaining any weapons or armor of value or none at all, being battle ready and still losing because you keep misssing and the enemy doesn't, these are all things you need to be prepared for. As you keep playing you slowly begin to realize that certain aspets can be slighlty manipulated to your advantage but nothing is truly definate which means you will see rabbit corpses again and again. Speaking of which..YOU ONLY GET ONE SHOT, you are permitted to save from the menu and continue your adventure but once you die its permanant(unless there is an item I have not recieved yet that offers a second chance). RNG comes with a very heavy-handed sacrafice of skill, mastery, choice, and patience and that disconnect may be enough to scare some people off and you, as the consumer, need to determine if that aspect is a deal-breaker to you.\n\nThis game is great. There's nothing wrong with a donkey punch every once in a while, look at Dark Souls. It can seem a little hardcore at first but stick it out, you puss. This game is a great addition to any rpg collection. Frustrations aside, when I completed the game I did feel satisfied with a desire to spelunk some more and there are plenty of things to collect and discover. The price is more than fair and there is plenty of game to be had. Now, I have to beat the game with the other 3 classes and attempt a 100%; the deaths...oh the many deaths that await...poor rabbit, why does god hate you?

However in my own experience I've found this doesn't seem to happen too often thankfully.\n\nThere ARE some items that will give you a second chance however they are understandably rare as they'd probably be in most roguelikes (Angel Tokens will grant you a free revive if you die.) Also there are one or two items that can be used that grant this same angel effect. Thank you for giving my game a shot!", "recommendationid": "34968153", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
