A perfect example of the elegance of simplicity.\n\n\nYou have a mere 5 things you can do, with a suprising amount of strategic depth in how you utilize those 5 things: Energy, which is your life's blood in more ways than one; not only is it your economy, but lose all of these and you lose the game. Turrents, which are your basic form of attack, good to spam lots of them. Black holes, which are your sole means of defence, as they deflect incoming shots, but enough focus fire can overcome them. Sentinels, which 'claim' territory on the map, which is good because the enemy cannot build things in your territory. Also work in a pinch to draw enemy fire, and will instantly destroy any enemy units caught in their influence. And lastly Missiles, which are costly, slow to charge, but if they go off, can wipe out enemy forces in a wide area.\n\nThe key is positioning; your forces and theirs will fire upon the closest target to them. So depending on where you build things, you can protect other things, and the same with them. You can fly anywhere on the map, which is a giant ball of strands, and each vies for optimal positioning to take out the other, by whatever means they deem necessary.\n\nTruly, this is a unique and innovative title; the only con I have is sometimes it can be akward to precisly position yourself exactly where you want to be, as when you stop flying you will automatically gravitate towards the nearest strand. Also, there doesn't seem to be a way to destroy a unit once youve already built it, which can sometimes be problematic with black holes, as they can affect YOUR turrets shots as well; depending on what they are firing at they might choose to fire through the black hole, which of course doesn't work very well....\n\nAlso the multiplayer is dead, so it is a good thing to have some friends to play with, unless you just want to skirmish with the AI.\n\nAll in all I would highly recommend this title!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198060293715", "last_played": 1500655367, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 177, "playtime_forever": 517}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1492038107, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499862", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1492658944, "recommendationid": "31106359", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
