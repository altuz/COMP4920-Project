I will go through and list the positives and and negatives I found after playing this game for about an hour or so, a grain of salt is not provided but feel free to take one if you need to.\n\nGraphics: 8  What do you expect, it's hand drawn on crumpled notebook paper and then animated! The kind of crap we dreamed of doing in Jr. High or High School. \n\nSound: 8 It is a light blippy and bubbly soundtrack and though I reside on the dark side of the spectrum, I can't help but wiggle and dance just a little bit from the overflowing and overwhelmingly happy music.  The sound effects are equally as happy and add to the overall experience.  I was expecting pew pew pew and got bloop bloop bloop.  \n\nGameplay: 9  This is a top down shooter like Asteroids or Space Invaders.  I can see this becoming engrossing and completely addictive if you have a weakness for casual games.  While the gameplay isn't super face melting fast paced by any means, it is extremely anxiety inducing once you get passed The Leviathon boss.  \n\nReplayability: 10  So it is permadeath in the sense you only get one, maybe two chances if you have a shield.  The ability to custom create your own scribble ship allows you to play the same \"map\" over and over again and each play through is completely different.  \n\nSo here come the negatives that I found.  \n-No coop multiplayer.  Couch coop for this game would make it 10x better!  \n-Not enough variety of weapons: This game needs paint cluster bombs, paint (flame) thrower, proximity mines, paint lasers, something...you get your basic bloop bloop gun and some targeting paint missles but in the hour or so I played the weapons are just more of the same, but faster.  \n-More backgrounds needed.  I love the fact that when you \"destroy\" a ship with your paint guns, it is added to the paper background you are playing on.  This only looks so cool for so long...variety is the spice of life.  I would love to see a few more notebooks or desks or tables etc added as backgrounds.  Maybe a bathroom stall wall or something :D \n\nOverall Impression: HELL YES! for under $5 you get a casual game that keeps your interest, supports independent devs, and is an amazingly fun experience.  I look forward to seeing if the devs keep this game fresh and new feeling with updates.  Will this be my main game with 100s of hours, probably not.  Will this be a game I fall back on when other servers are down or when I am feeling casual. Oh yes! This has the potential to be a huge black hole of time, in the most positive sense of the phrase :D \nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004948681", "last_played": 1493000430, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 217, "playtime_forever": 62}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1491355809, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511648", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1491355809, "recommendationid": "30953036", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A fun game for anyone looking for something lite.

The gameplay is very odd, it starts mind numbingly slow and then becomes very fast paced. The difficulty seems to lie in a manic flurry of enemies and random movements rather than strategy. When I succeeded it felt like luck not accomplishment. Within 15 minutes I had a top 17 in the world score.\n\nThe game drops you in without any explanation. You get points for killing enemies (I think?) but you can also pick up colored orbs for extra points. There are a handful of powerups but I was again unsure what they did. One with 3 colored balls made me shoot more but was time limited? A shield which lets me take an extra hit and lasts until damaged. Rocket which turns your bullets into rockets, and maybe there was another one?  At the top of the screen there is a bar that you fill and as you do your weapon seemingly increases power but its so obtuse I hardly noticed anything happening until I looked for it. You also have a \"boost\" which powers you through enemies. I seems like the type of attack that would work well for the slower stat ships. I'm not sure why each ship doesnt have a different special power.\n\nFor no reason what so ever you can draw your own ship. Neat. But you can't customize your ship in any way other than appearance. You have a set of stats for each ship but they are locked even for a custom ship. \n\nAs one of the other reviews said this feels like a college project. Its seemingly well made (except for not having Steam Overlay and crashing every time I tried to exit.) I just found it lacking any depth and fun. As a proof of concept or an alpha this product is solid enough to show investors and devs to continue work. As a finished game it feels hollow and 1 dimensional.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197978275211", "last_played": 1498869285, "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 322, "playtime_forever": 39}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1499880283, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499880283, "recommendationid": "33484462", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Actually really fun, but it kept crashing on me so I think I'll have to refund it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018057851", "last_played": 1500631048, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 240, "playtime_forever": 47}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1500631102, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500631102, "recommendationid": "33692800", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Let's face it, the reason you buy this is to draw willy ships and kill people.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198142211374", "last_played": 1498062931, "num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 273, "playtime_forever": 23}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1498769843, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498769843, "recommendationid": "33009856", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
