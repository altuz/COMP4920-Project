While this game looks pretty, the gameplay behind it is just too ripe and not ready for human consumption. [/b]Maybe after some number tweaking, this game would be good to go.\n\nOne Sole Purpose is a labor-of-love game by a one-man studio, and it very strongly shows it. My first impressions were that the game is just a super beautified wave-defense game in the Sci-Fi FPS genre. You have a small arsenal of weaponry that can\u2019t be reloaded until the end of the level and magical powers that push-back enemies, slow time, teleport, and manipulate gravity. With these mechanics at your disposal, you\u2019re expected to bustle through roughly three to five hours of somewhat repetitive gameplay.\n\nThe story to One Sole Purpose is that you\u2019re primarily playing as Michael, even though you start the game off as Sameer (technically, you actually start the game off as the Protector of Azorious for a cut scene, then switch to Sameer, but do you see where I\u2019m kind of getting at? Stuff\u2019s complex.) Basically, Michael is this punk floating through space until this Alien Boi impregnates his mind with the ploy to capture his brother, Sameer. Alien Boi needs to steal back Sameer\u2019s amazing powers because he thinks they\u2019re too dangerous to humanity. In order to do this, Alien Boi becomes one with Michael and gives him the same powers Sameer has, otherwise he\u2019s pretty sure they ain\u2019t gonna get jack diddly. Necessary evil, I guess.\n\nThere\u2019s a bunch of other characters that were incredibly unmemorable. Really though, all these characters, Alien Boi included, are just storytellers who fill you in on the state of the world, their personal intentions, or some hootnanny like that. Other than that, you travel to some planets in an effort to try and get closer to capturing Sameer. The game is actually about 50% story-telling and 50% repetitive gameplay. While some would say that\u2019s a good balance, I feel like the story progression is either fragmented, unenchanting, or just straight up uninteresting.\n\nAn important note is that this game has easily accessible cheats from the pause menu. I say this because after about an hour and a half in, the game was unnecessarily difficult, but I wanted to try and experience as much of the game as I could, so I enabled them. This was definitely one of the best decisions that the developer had implemented, because it allowed me to enjoy myself without getting fed up with the gameplay and bailing on the game.\n\nEnough of the formal introductions, let's see the good, the bad, and the score.\n\n[h1]The Good:[/h1]\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]: The hot topic is that this game is [likely] utilizing store-bought assets. I say likely because I don\u2019t care enough to verify myself. However, I don\u2019t consider that a problem since the assets in this game all fit thematically and don\u2019t take away from the overall game. So in short, the game looks great, I don\u2019t really care why or how.\n\n[b]Enjoyment[/b]: This game has a gravity gun, and with unlimited ammunition it\u2019s just fun to shoot everything with this thing. Kept me entertained the whole game. It was great.\n\n[h1]The Bad:[/h1]\n\n[b]Sound[/b]: While the sound effects and soundtrack all fit the game, the voice acting is pretty terrible. There are some characters that are done fairly, but well over three quarters of the voices have little to no emotion and sound like they\u2019re reading straight off a script. [b]I\u2019m looking at you, Feras.[/b]\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]: The gameplay is pretty bad. Enemies are incredibly heart healthy and the guns feel too weak; with limited ammunition (need I remind you that you can\u2019t restore ammunition on your own) it\u2019s way too difficult to take down the endless waves of enemies that you have to endure for about three minutes at a time. The mechanics of this game sound great, but the numbers need tweaking. Guns either need more damage, enemies need less health, or something like that.\n\n[b]Story[/b]: I really don\u2019t think a story board was used for this game because the flow just doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s there. It\u2019s sad because I can tell the developer really wants to tell a story, but it\u2019s just not engaging and I honestly can\u2019t tell why. Maybe it\u2019s the characters or the way it\u2019s being told \u2013 something\u2019s wrong and it\u2019s holding the story back.\n\n[h1]The Score:[/h1]\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with my channel, my scoring is a little less-than-traditional, but still relatively simple. I rate five categories from 0 to 2; 2 is great, 0 is terrible. The four categories are as below reviews, with the last being a \"[b]Wildcard[/b]\" category. This category allows me to grade games based on criteria that some games have that others won't. For example, I wouldn't try and grade this game off of it\u2019s amazing multiplayer matchmaking.\n\n[b]Score: 5/10[/b]\n\n[list][*][b]Graphics: 2/2[/b]\n[*]The game is real pretty. The assets all fit thematically and don\u2019t seem out of place. Good on ya.\n\n[*][b]Sound: 1/2[/b]:\n[*]While the soundtrack and sound effects are fitting, the voice acting is dragging this game down.\n\n[*][b]Gameplay: 0/2[/b]\n[*]The gameplay was frustrating and the enemies were incredibly difficult to kill. I had to turn cheats on to complete the game, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have continued past the first arena wave-defense set. My suggestion would be to tweak the numbers slightly more in the player\u2019s favor.\n\n[*][b]Enjoyment: 1/2[/b]\n[*]There are fewer things that are more exciting than a spammable gravity gun complete with ragdoll physics. Cheap laughs, but fun.\n\n[*][b]Immersion: 1/2[/b]\n[*][i]Wildcard Category[/i] \u2013 As I said earlier, the story and world is there, but there\u2019s something about it that\u2019s off. The cut-scenes are unnecessarily free-roaming, the characters are mostly uninteresting, and I feel like the story is being told too fast and too slow at the same time. There\u2019s not enough engagement to keep me interested in this universe that the developer is really trying to immerse us in, and that\u2019s pretty unfortunate.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Closing Notes:[/h1]\n\nHonestly, if this game were to get its numbers tweaked, I\u2019d re-review the game and it\u2019d probably get a 6/10 which would drag it out of my red light. No promises, because it\u2019d have to fit, but there\u2019s definitely some items here that can be adjusted. The developer has shown that he cares and that\u2019s pretty darn great because feedback often goes unheard. As long as I\u2019m still reviewing poopy games, I\u2019ll come back and re-review this one if the developer makes changes for the better.\n\n[h1]If you want to see a patriotic squid hat, you can watch the full review / reaction video below:[/h1]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DOFOhQeaW8\n\n(8/27/2017) I just realized, after about a month of this review being up that the link above lead to the wrong video.
