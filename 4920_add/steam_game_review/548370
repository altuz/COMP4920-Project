Most of the negative reviews are due to the numerous bugs that rendered it nearly unplayable at launch. But the devs are constantly releasing patches and eliminating the bugs. The game, as of this review's date, is completely playable. I encountered no bugs during my 7 hours of play time.\n\nHowever there are some down sides to this game. Death mechanic makes the game a bit grindy and it might be frustrating in later levels. If your character dies, it gets prisoned at that level and you have to rescue them with another character. And if your main char outlevels the other ones by far, then you have to level up another character, which might take some time. On the other hand, this mechanic forces you to be cautious. You can't just storm through dungeons. You have to keep track of your consumables, you have to plan ahead before entering a fight, and sometimes it can be better to just exit the dungeon and try again, rather than push your luck. I'm also leveling 3 chars: 1 str, 1 agi and 1 int char. This way,  you can rescue your char as soon as it dies and you can make use of all the loot you get. Still, this prison thing is a bit harsh and I don't know whether I would start again if I lost all my chars in later parts of the game.\n\nAnother downside is the merchant. Equipment purchase is like Diablo's gambling. You can't see the stats, you can't see the level requirement (though you get a hint from its cost). I believe we should be able to see the stats of equipments that we purchase and this \"gamble\" thing should be an extra option.\n\nEven with these negative aspects, the game is still fun and captivating. The fights are fun and it's not mindless button mashing; there are strategic elements to it, like positioning, pulling the mobs one by one, dealing with different types of mobs etc. I played most of the recent dungeon crawlers/board game type rpgs and Rezrog is way ahead of them.\n\nTl,dr: The game in its current state is playable and any dungeon crawler/roguelike/rpg fan should definitely give it a try.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 803, "steamid": "76561198084006548", "last_played": 1506941351, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 128, "playtime_forever": 803}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506764902, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506764902, "recommendationid": "35330466", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Too hard... i mean FAR too hard to enjoy.\nthis is a game for the maschoists.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198005688962", "last_played": 1498141407, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 306, "playtime_forever": 206}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505835383, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496436", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505835383, "recommendationid": "35066733", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": false}]}
