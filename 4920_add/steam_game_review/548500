I think it looks [i]beautiful[/i], but the actual play was underwhelming. It could have been more abstract and dare I say edgy. Yes, it has a [i]Stanley Parable[/i] feel, but none of the heart. \n\n[b]I will say that it's a decent achievement hunting game to 100%.[/b] Getting all of the achievements is fairly easy and there is a [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=898651478]sweet guide[/url] to help you. The gameplay is certainly far superior to most cash-grab achievement based games.\n\n[i]Essentially, this is a walking simulator with a series of fetch quests, and some interesting secrets.[/i] It is very short; in fact one of the achievements is to simply play the game for 2 hours. Controller support is nice, and the whole game feels polished. The dev obviously put a lot of care into it. [b]I just wish it was more of a thinkpiece.[/b]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+It looks beautiful\n+Overall has a lot of polish and controller support is good\n+Good for 100%ing and achievement hunting\n+Cheap\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Ah, that music is too generic for me\n-Not a whole lot going on, or to think about really\n-Not something I care to play after getting all the achievements (compared to another short game - [i]Thirty Flights of Loving[/i], which I would showcase to friends)\n-What is all that 'payroll' dialogue you forced me to sit through? It went on forever and didn't really make sense\n\n[b]It's cheap, this is true.[/b] Buy it if you are looking to get fairly decent games to 100%, but if you are looking for something with the quality and tone of [i]The Stanley Parable[/i] - I fear you will be disapointed.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040884867", "last_played": 1499543449, "num_reviews": 618, "num_games_owned": 1196, "playtime_forever": 86}, "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_created": 1499543142, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1499694891, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534146", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1499543339, "developer_response": "Really sorry that the game felt boring. It's true that it's not going to be for everyone, so if you don't feel happy about the purchase feel free to contact us via http://astrojone.com and we can help you get a refund. \n\nAlso, one thing that might help with the enjoyment (maybe) is trying to look into the whys and whats of all the details of the game. The point doesn't lie so much in the gameplay as much as it lies in the symbolisms and references that we injected into even the most mundane aspects of the game, and which can sometimes be hard to uncover due to being age-specific or in other ways esoteric. So that's where the core of the experience is supposed to lie, and maybe that's something that you could get enjoyment out of, if it's the kind of thing that interests you.\n\nReally appreciate the feedback though, and again, send us an e-mail if you want a refund.\n\nThanks for trying our game!", "recommendationid": "33383909", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
