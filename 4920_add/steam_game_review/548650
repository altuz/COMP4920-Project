Im just getting started and glad to support the development of this type of game, especially since there aren't many decent ones available for Mac users. \n\nMy only issue so far is that my MBPro uses a touch pad for a mouse. 1 touch pad press = left MB click  and 2 finger touch pad press = right click and everything else is gesture based such as scrolling by light touches etc. My point is that in this game the \"Target Lock\" is seemingly locked to MMB with no controls or binding reassigning where this MMB action is done?  \nI could be mistaken but cannot seem to bind the MMB to another key or anything? Thus making combat extremely painful. \n\nAnyway aside from that early and likely rookie mistake (any reply with solutions welcome) I find this game to be heading in the right direction.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "steamid": "76561198365022292", "last_played": 1506726675, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_forever": 2434}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500718004, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497129", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1500718004, "recommendationid": "33717295", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
