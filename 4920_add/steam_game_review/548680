I get really hungry playing these games.  If there was an award for the best looking pixel art food these games would win hands down.  Especially the sausage, but it all looks delicious.\n\nThe gameplay is still solid.  This is my favorite sort of top down twin stick roguelite shooter.

The gameplay is something like Smash TV crossed with Binding of Isaac.  Graphics are lovingly detailed and animated pixel art, and soundtrack is satisfying synthwave.  It's a retro style, but it feels less like a SNES-era game, and more like what a SNES game would aspire to grow up to be someday.   \n\nThe food chaining is useful for score but key for survival: Pick up 8+ foods in a row to get an upgrade.  Getting hit, or going too long without a pickup, resets the chain and you have to start it again.  A couple of helpers: missing a food pickup doesn't break the chian, and picking up coins extends the time limit.  The rooms get more frantic on later floors, so getting powerups lets you keep up with the enemy power curve.\n\nI'm glad I bought this and gave it a try - it has a lot of nice little touches, as well as satisfying moment-to-moment, in-the-zone play.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197979036698", "last_played": 1502766272, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 607, "playtime_forever": 823}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500756024, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500756024, "recommendationid": "33729372", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A rock-solid twin-stick with a slower pace (a la [i]Smash TV[/i]) and a fun progression layer that's not overbearing on the core gameplay.
