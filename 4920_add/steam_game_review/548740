Its not a fucking wave shooter, it has depth, large levels, better than many Ive bought, long story short, it was less than the cost of 3 long island ice teas, and I  had that much fun in the first 30mins I played. I know I probably sound like the devs GF or something I assure u Im not, (300 lbs white guy here) but if u got $20 to spend I suggest giving it a shot.\n\nI bought on a whim cuz I desperately needed new VR CONTENT Im jonesin man. Anywho its a great base. One thing Id like to say is my inventory thing does not all fit in my fov. And its super annoying AT TIMES.\nBattles are abit sword wiggily ATM. I suggest something that makes u have to swing maybe velocity sensing. Still very early into it. I love it so far im sure it may even be as cool as vanishing relems, it definitely has the potential.. For me it scratched an itch that aint been scratched for a month. ITS FAR FROM PERFECT\n\nBUT I SPOKE WITHTHE DEV ON REDDIT LAST NIGHT AND HE SEEMS VERY ACTIVE AND WANTING TO HEAR FROM YOU TOO AND DEDICATED TO MAKING IT A GREAT EXP FOR US.  so for me I WONT be refunding it I got maybe and Hr into it so far and still feel new to the game. THATS A GREAT SIGN FOR ME.

Disappointing melee combat: this game makes the same major mistake some other VR games are doing, you feel like swinging around a stick that floats through all enemies. Even haptic feedback is worse than in most games.\n2. False advertising: while you do have a sword and shield at your disposal, in the end the sword is actually used to shoot out projectiles. The game is more like a shooter than a sword fighting game.\n3. Active VR combat? Another lie: you are simply teleporting around and actually don't have to move your own body that much. Just aim with your sword (how ridiculousis that!) and shoot your enemies. With your sword.\n4. Bad animation: the enemies move hilariously bad. Most of the enemies I've met only had 1 (one!) single attack animation. Of course melee combat won't be exciting that way.\n5. Bad sound mixing: there are some sounds that are way too loud, others are the opposite. Very jarring experience. Voice acting sometimes sounds like it is coming from a poor synthesizer, while it was much higher quality in the intro.\n\nThe core gameplay is flawed. It looks more like to me the developer here did put more effort into the quantity of loot and upgrades (mostly cosmetic and just increases some arbitrary numbers) rather than trying to actually make the core gameplay work and be fun at the same time.\n\nI don't recommend this game to anyone. We have so many good VR games right now that are more polished, nailed the core gameplay and are simply fun.
