However, the game in its current state barely contains enough content to be standalone game and it lacking some polish that makes it worth its price.\n\nGameplay:\n* If you liked playing Time Crisis at the arcade growing up, then you'll like this genre of gameplay. The player uses duck-and-cover to dodge incoming enemy rounds, and at times the game will go into a bullet-time mode to allow the player to dodge rounds or shoot grenades coming straight at them.\n* The story is fairly basic and some more realistic sound effects and voice over narration could definitely improve the production value of this title. No one likes to click through endless crawls of text to understand a thin storyline. \n* The story consists of three missions and can be beaten around 30 minutes. There are no difficulty settings. \n\nWeapons/Interactions\n* This is one area of the game that needs wide improvement. Switching between weapons pretty hit or miss. I could only manage to switch between the SMG and pistol around 50% of the time. \n* Having both grenades and reloading mechanics available at the same time in your left controller is very confusing, especially when the meshes/objects both show up on your left controller at the same time. I had no idea what it was and the objects themselves are bulky and block your vision more than it needs to. I think the left controller should only do one thing at a time at most. Perhaps switch the grenade mechanic back to the right controller as a different weapon. \n* Reloading is more of a pain than it should be. Trying to get a clip in your hand from your belt doesn't always work and I find myself trying to reload with an empty hand frustratingly often. Replace the \"belt\" placeholder with a actual belt object might make the game look more polished.\n\nUI\n* Navigating between menus and pressing buttons is kind of a pain and could be more intuitive\n* It's not always abundantly clear where the next dash area is when trying to proceed between scenes in a level. I found myself standing and looking around to find how to advance more times than I could count and it really broke the flow of the game.\n\nTl;dr: The game in its current state does not have enough content and polish for $15.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002434175", "last_played": 1498176652, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 123, "playtime_forever": 34}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1498177797, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514446", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1498177855, "recommendationid": "32658034", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Likely abandoned - No update in months, or a peep from the developers. \n\nA damn shame too, because it feels like your standard Time Crisis arcade game which is the reason I got it.
