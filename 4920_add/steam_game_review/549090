The graphics can be difficult to see as everything is more zoomed in or out depending on how large the map is. The only thing you really have to care for is 1) where can you chill, 2) flashlight scopes, and 3) where is the loot. The game is fairly easy, but can get dull in single player mode as you just do the same thing over and over again. It also doesn't even matter if you take forever as things don't really change despite the color scheme changing. The game controls can be a little unforgiving. Using the WASD, I try to stop the character, but the character will continue in the pressed direction for a little bit after the key is released. This frustrated me as it got me caught several times and it is an annoying mechanism. \n\nOverall, amusing game to play as it was free. Not terribly fun for a puzzle platform, but fun if you have some friends to entertain. 6/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198365236399", "last_played": 1487383255, "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 129, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487383598, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487383598, "recommendationid": "29997981", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
