It's not reallly a point-and-click adventure; the point and click is to get you from one arcade section to the next. And I'm not really into the arcade sections: they are simply a lot of mashing the mouse button over and over again until you win, and if you don't mash fast enough, you'll die and have to start your mashing over. It's a decently cute story, but I'd prefer to avoid the RSI strain on my mouse hand. I'll recommend it for the cute concept, but if you're not into arcade minigames, you'll find it a bit borning.\n\nOriginal First Impressions:\n\nThe first thing I noticed is that the boy doesn't emote. He has a blank face even when he's supposedly laughing happily while playing with his dog. And that immedeately put me off: how am I supposed to be invested when the boy isn't even invested? Even the apparent villian introduced shortly after has more emotions on his face than the boy does! (Also, I'm not a dog person, so the game's obession with dogs isn't going to automatically tug at my heartstrings.)\n\nIt also doesn't bode well for a point-and-click puzzle game when the game forces you to open its in-game strategy guide as part of its tutorial. Only some of the things that are clickable on screen result in a mouse pointer cursor. And make sure you don't cancel out of the first minigame game too early, or it won't give you the thing that advances the storyline.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198045474972", "last_played": 1486440844, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 580, "playtime_forever": 101}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1486436172, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513773", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1486441227, "recommendationid": "29753757", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
