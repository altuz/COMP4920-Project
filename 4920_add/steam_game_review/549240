I continued to play because the story was ok, but then there was a game breaking bug that halted my progress. In level with the drones that spy on you, I saved, quit the game, and the next time the game started, the spy bar kept filling up without any drones around, so I couldn't complete the level. This is made worse by the fact that there is only an autosave slot and a regular slot, so I had no clean / earlier saves to work with. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197962984046", "last_played": 1499484967, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 262, "playtime_forever": 158}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1499716104, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519781", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1499716104, "recommendationid": "33439186", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I erred on the side of recommendation, even though I'm not fully confident it's worth the full price for everyone in the state it is now. But I'll be likely replaying it many times, so this is subject to change. Yes, there are bugs. Do check the community page, where developers has shared some advice- and no, the warp code does not mess with the achievements. Don't think of it as the cheat, think of it as a fix. Ignore the obnoxious \"cheater\" in the menu involved. (If you're going to call people out, fulfill your side of the bargain - a fully polished game, that mystical unicorn of gaming industry - first.)\n\nWhen I say I'll be replaying it many times, it isn't because I'm invested in following the fixes - it's because the game is what I was looking for. Really low pressure, basically unchallenging, but still letting you feel a sense of accomplishment. Mind you, this might displease someone who prefers challenge. If it had windowed mode, it would be perfect for multitasking, which is another thing I was looking for - as it is, it's easy to switch with Alt-Tab without experiencing problems so it still serves the purpose somewhat. \n\nEven if you aren't into multitasking, you might wish you were able to run it in the background at times, because there are quite a few rather slow moments. Some levels mitigate this by adding additional problems to handle, but not all (and even there, the frequency of interferences seems to be random or at least unevenly paced). Even then, the level of challenge is really low. Also, I'm a bit iffy about the order in which they pop up - the ones I found a bit challenging to deal with come near the start and in the middle. You'd think there would be difficulty progression. The progression does make sense narratively (the framing devices for said difficulties being key parts of the story), but I feel there was a way to have both things.\n\nDespite this, I was only really disappointed in the final level. Without going into the details (just general structure),[spoiler] it has two sub-levels. The second one seems to be reached once a criterion you have no real influence over is fulfilled, regardless of whether you fulfilled your progress goals or not. You get new goals and setup provided. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad the game hasn't decided to throw in a last-minute huge difficulty bump, but it's rather unsatisfying. I wish you had an opportunity to finish those goals, or have them reflected in the second part in some way. And I feel like the final level should have had a complication like the added difficulty levels I mentioned above had. And maybe a bit more to do in the final stage.[/spoiler]\n\nThat said, while this review ended up sounding rather critical, I still really enjoyed this game. Devs have hinted at the possibility of additional content (for Halloween at least), so it looks like it will be worth coming back to for more than just a revisit. I also really liked the humor and the concept, which delivered all I was expecting and more.\n\nIf you want a really low-pressure tycoon game, if you like North American coffee shop culture - or just like poking fun at it, if you want to run into an obvious in hindsight but pleasantly surprising character suspiciously close to a certain celebrity - this is a game for you. Maybe not at a full price yet, depending on your spending criteria, but do keep track of it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198328061484", "last_played": 1500475768, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_forever": 543}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1499569865, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507792", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499570061, "recommendationid": "33392537", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Is entertaining when you are playing for the first time, but the problem is, is actually pretty easy and pretty short.

This is the me-ist game I've ever purchased. And yes, it's riddled with bugs, but that doesn't warrant bad reviews. (It really doesn't - I finished this game despite the bugs. There are cheat codes you can use to warp to the otherwise unreachable subsequent levels, and you'll find ways around the glitches. More on that later.) These bugs are definitely a shame, but I beg you to stick with it, or at least pick it up again when the patch rolls around. It is so worth playing.\n\nThe storyline is absurd. I love it. Gameplay is peppered with memes and mickey-taking, and it's worth taking the time to watch the cut scenes and read all the little tidbits of humour. The amount of work that went into this is just incredible - while the graphics aren't mindblowing (and I love that, to be honest), other aspects are laden with little details that make this game so fun.\n\nAnyway - cheats. IDDQD was a life saver (warp to any level without losing your achievements) because during the cut scene at the end of the boardwalk level, one of the characters just gets stuck, and there appears to be no other way around it. In the mall level you must destroy drones to move on - well, these drones have a habit of turning invisible. As there's only one save file, saving the game with an invisible drone on the loose means you can't complete the level (unless you use the warp cheat). But I think the bug that causes this is pretty random, as I managed to surpass the level by saving the game every time I successfully killed a drone. If I got caught out by an invisible one, I simply quit and began from my last save point - and from then on, the drones never appeared at exactly the same time or place. It's a slow solution, but it works.\n\nBelieve me, this game will be better when the glitches are ironed out. I just want to defend it, though, because it is still absolutely hilarious and so enjoyable. The downtown level made me cry with laughter intermittently. Honestly, it's worth working through the glitches just to have Yasmar von Nodrog call you a donkey.\n\nGive this game a chance!

This game is fun but I feel like it isn't fledged out or going in the direction to be as fun as it could be.
