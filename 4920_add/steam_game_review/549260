If you are UBER LEET NINTENDO HARD then this will be a fine experience for you.  For the rest...be wary.  It starts out charming enough, but the last 3/4 of the game is a slog through instant death pits and poorly designed rooms and puzzles.\n\nThe graphical style and music are enjoyable in that they emulate the retro games of yesteryear well and the soundtrack itself is quite catchy.  The puzzles in the game are solid enough, but it feels stiff and the bosses and enemies are terribly unimaginative.  What's worse is this follow's the Simon's Quest model of hidden walls...completely invisible, but still there.  Some are obvious, some are necessary, but stupidly hidden.  The last dungeon in particular is a huge slog.\n\nWhat frustrates me most here, however, is that they adhered too closely to retro.  Whereas some games like Shovel Knight are willing to throw away stuff that didn't work in retro, Alwa's sticks too closely to ideas that...were better left in the 80s.\n\nI enjoyed the first 3 hours of the game, but not the last 2.  That's my takeaway.  If you get frustrated by the instant death traps, you may want to give this a pass.  If you are a player who likes the old school, you're welcome here.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 312, "steamid": "76561198041995956", "last_played": 1506238028, "num_reviews": 84, "num_games_owned": 153, "playtime_forever": 312}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506238284, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506238284, "recommendationid": "35173492", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
