The game is so poorly optimised that the game doesnt support 1080p and my screen had all black bars around it. The game also doesnt have any basic functions towards it, meaning there is no exit button on the menu, you actually have to tab out to close the game down. And finally the worst one of them all, the game is intended to play with friends, but the GAME DOESNT HAVE AN INVITE SYSTEM TOWARDS IT. Very poor should not be on steam as the game is so poorly made and them asking for the money is ridiculous, DONT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079654924", "last_played": 1493248106, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 95, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1493248480, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507030", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1493248574, "recommendationid": "31384385", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}]}
