Forklifts feel quite a bit different from the first game. They seem to get stuck on things more often, and seem to struggle picking up boxes at certain angles that were possible (and encouraged) in the first game. I haven't dug too far into the maps, but i'm fairly certain that a lot of these are just copies from the first game. The lack of new content in that department is quite dissappointing. Menus are not controller friendly at all (I have a wired xbox 360 controller for those interested). You cannot choose any on-screen options with the controller and must instead use a mouse. You can 'pause' the game with a controller, but that's as far as you can interact with the menu system if you're using a controller. \n\nSpeaking of the menu system, Storage Inc. 2 has one of the worst ones I have ever used. Menus are annoying (why can i choose a map from a button on the main game screen and not by pressing 'esc' at any given point?) or straight up confusing (1] getting into the 'choose a map' screen reveals a bunch of maps that you can choose from and add strange icons to with mouse clicks? 2]  when I 'finish a map' i don't feel like I actually did. The only time the game lets you think that you beat a level is when your deliveries have been done flawlessly and you have been greeted by a string of text that says 'perfect' at the top of a menu that pops up. If you don't have a flawless game (not missing one delivery, adding every + box that pops up, never letting a delivered box blow up thanks to a new one being delivered behind it) the game presents you with a 'try again' screen for committing just one infraction. This is weirdly discouraging).\n\n[u]The good[/u]:\nThe voxels look pretty nice, especially when you deliver a package and it explodes into little bits. Multiplayer is as fun as ever, and I love how anyone can play this at any skill level. The game's action is just as hectic as ever, and it is still very satisfying to create an ordered warehouse and pull off shipments quickly. I like the added + box to keep things extra tense and interesting while you sort boxes. \n\n[u]The verdict[/u]:\nThis is a step back for the series in many ways, but it's still one of the best games in the genre. For 10.99$(CAD) this isn't worth it, especially when the 360 version of the first game retails for 2.99$(CAD) and is better in every way that counts. If the price were less, or if the game were at least as good as its predecessor i'd recommend it, but until either one of these things happen I cannot recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960673098", "last_played": 1495688907, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 283, "playtime_forever": 446}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1492370314, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492372420, "recommendationid": "31185056", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
