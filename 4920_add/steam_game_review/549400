Unfortunately, for some bizarre reason, the game designers started the time period of this game after the loss of the Huascar and Independencia (note that the painting used for the game's webpage shows the Huascar).   Then, to make up for this omission, the game's designers inserted the ironclad Pachacutec for Peru, which didn't historically exist but appears to be modeled after the Independencia!   Moreover, in an apparant effort to balance play, they added the naval corvette Callao and the armed transport ships Pachitea and Isluga on Peru's side while ignoring Peru's historical naval corvette Rimac (Chilean transport that was captured very early in the war and converted into a naval corvette) and the armed transport ships Oroya, Chalaco, and Limena.   Bizarre indeed!\n \nThe game would be more balanced and fun if the game's designers kept to the historical ships, especially the Huascar and Independencia.  Without them it is a rather strange and historically disappointing game.   \n\nMaybe the designers will fix this with a patch???
