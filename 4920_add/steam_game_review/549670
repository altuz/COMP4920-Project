But as you advance through it, becomes an imposible to play game. It was intended as a game where you have to buy stuff to pass it, and then it was changed to fit into this format.\nFinal result: some levels are just impossible to pass no matter if you play in easy mode, you simply can't do it. \n\nWhen complained, some levels were adjusted, but then got tired of posting about it hoping the devs would do their jobs. Apparently not cause after advancing some levels got stucked again and there is no way to go further. Hope I can change this review in the future.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198167901192", "last_played": 1504662032, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 274, "playtime_forever": 1941}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1493932775, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501862", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1493932775, "recommendationid": "31548352", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
