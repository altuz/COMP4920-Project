It's like the playable equivalent of Indie Game: The Movie, with good mechanics and a strong message, combined to create a great package. It's fresh, it's original, and it's fun, I think it's well worth your purchase.\n\nThe game plays out in three modes. First, you create your levels from an ever-increasing list of blocks. Like minecraft in miniature, as you progress through the game you unlock new blocks and discover new ways of combining old blocks to create levels that will challenge you and your players.\n\nSecond, you test the levels you've built, tweaking the block layout to increase the difficulty and improve the timing. The mechanics are simple: you can run, jump, and interact with blocks. Mechanically, the game feels like a faster Super Mario Brothers, or I Wanna Be The Guy. As you play your levels, IGS shows pop ups like \"FUN!\" and \"DANGER!\" as you encounter different objects like spikes and jump switches. I'm pretty sure that this is the game hinting at how it internally 'scores' your levels.\n\nIn a neat touch, you can also send your completed levels to anyone with a browser. Recipients do not need to have purchased the game itself to play your levels.\n\nFinally, you 'release' your game into a marketplace which more than superficially resembles Steam. NPC players score your game on the variety of blocks you used, the \"FUN!\" and \"DANGER!\" counts, and how much of the level they traverse during play. If they like your game, the NPCs purchase your work, become fans of your brand, and leave you reviews. Like what I'm doing now. Way meta.\n\nI wanted to highlight the persistent feeling of exploration and anxiety that come across while playing. Designing your 'indie games' is FUN. I really enjoyed putting together a level and then tweaking the layout so as to require split second timing to reach the goal. But even when my NPC reviewers really liked the games I released, I couldn't help but compare myself with the other game developers (yes, there are NPC developers releasing games alongside yours) that had created what I felt were better games than I had. And when you get reviews in the marketplace - when you release a good game, you'll get a ton - you'll notice that there are a handful of random, unhelpful negative reviews left by players. \"worst game ever\" and \"die more\" were two I remember. We've all seen these exact same reviews on Steam store pages, but seeing them on my \"games\" gave me a new appreciation for how developers must see them. It made me feel vulnerable, which is really impressive for such a bite-sized experience. And I went back to design another level, hopeful that this time I could please everyone and release the best game in the marketplace. I'm still trying.\n\nIGS is a ton of fun. The theme and mechanics really reinforce each other, and combine to create a great product. The ability to share your levels alone is worth the buy. I've bought copies for my brother and fiancee, and I'm looking forward to playing together during the holidays.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197966058913", "last_played": 1484357274, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 97, "playtime_forever": 324}, "votes_up": 13, "timestamp_created": 1481240125, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516620", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1481240683, "recommendationid": "28261937", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I've been waiting for a long time and here is it :D 10/10, a lot of minigames included, not only management, you have a lot of possibilities to do an awesome game and share it! \n\nMy top earner game: https://goo.gl/6kc0Zg", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198130627315", "last_played": 1482674799, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 60, "playtime_forever": 543}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1481227266, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498278", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1481227266, "recommendationid": "28258888", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Cool game that doles out its fun in bite-sized chunks, allowing you to play for 10-15 minutes at a time.
