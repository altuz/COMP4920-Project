First of all of course it's a cheap game, there is a few good and a few bad things.\n\npros: \n\ngraphics, even though it looks childish the background is fine and there is a lot of color which I like.\nTutorial, makes it really easy to understand the mechanics and know how to play.\n\ncons:\n\nLevel design: as stated on the store page it is terrible... not in a good way\ncontrols: they are responsive to a certain extent, there is some issues that could be fixed with the jumps other than that                        it's okk\n\nHitboxes: some issues to fix with the hitboxes mostly with the head of the character but also with the first boss of the game ( havent beaten the second one yet ). \n\nAll in all,it is a 1$ game worth about a 1$ game.. usualy I want to have an hour of fun per $ spent. I'll play this game again for sure to see the other bosses and stages but nothing more than that, not even going to try the battle mode. Even though I put more cons than pros, I've seen a lot worse for 1$ so I'd recommend the game for someone who want to play a cheap game and have a challenge\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EXvtSk7PJZY", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198058489095", "last_played": 1478590210, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 180, "playtime_forever": 48}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1478595203, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511533", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1478595203, "recommendationid": "26486117", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "worst game", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198194547222", "last_played": 1487364573, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1487364341, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499701", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1487364341, "recommendationid": "29993008", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}]}
