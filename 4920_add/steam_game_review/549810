Disadvantages, which significantly spoiled the game, is the speed and mechanics of the player's movement so poor that you instinctively try to press the keys harder, even your hand gets tired. Levels are complex puzzles, saving settings is not. Hardcore game in which you really need to carefully remember the whole level, otherwise you just can not pass.

Yes, the game is deceptively difficult, but it never felt unfair to me, which is my major complaint with most of the \"challenging platformers\" out there on the market. Levels also reset very quickly upon death, which helps to keep mistakes from feeling *too* punishing.\n\nAdd in the trading cards and a bunch of rare achievements and this game is a winner in my book. (Seriously, most of the achievements have a 2% acquisition rate or less).  To me, a price of $0.99 feels about right for this game, so if you're thinking about purchasing it you may want to wait for a coupon or a sale. Just make sure that you understand that this game is difficult.

The only difference between them is the food. You will need to eat all of the food within the 30 second time limit and dying to open the exit door. Your character will die in a single hit if it has been touched by an enemy and forces you to restart the level over again. As much as i like to play platform games. This one is pretty bad as the game only contains \"moving platforms\" that are raising up and down or left and right. That is basically the game, you jump onto moving platforms timing it right and get to the goal or eating the food.\n\n\nThere are around 28 levels.\nMeh music.\nTheir is only \"eating food\" sound.\nGameplay is pretty basic and easy to understand.\nIs repetitive.\nCould be annoying.\n90% of the game contains only moving platforms.\n\n[h1]Other things.[/h1]\n\nThere are better platform games but i guess 1 buck seems reasonable for this game.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 4/10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041949592", "last_played": 1495642038, "num_reviews": 482, "num_games_owned": 1112, "playtime_forever": 332}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1495582877, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497596", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1495582877, "recommendationid": "31926050", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Poor Interface!\n\n2.5/10!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198296453854", "last_played": 1499806084, "num_reviews": 41, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 97}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1498592064, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498112", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1498592064, "recommendationid": "32880906", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
