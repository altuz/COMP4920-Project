Now then I definitely recommend this game. \n\nWhile I was hesitant to purchase this game at first due to the price I eventually did - after many reconsiderations.   Once I started to play it I found my self completely absorbed to the point I have devoted almost 3 consecutive days to read it.\nThis is the kind of book/visual novel that is very confusing at the beginning and every time you feel like you understand everything that is going on it throws another twist at you and you think what just happened?\n\nFrom everyday peaceful life and cute moments to amazing action sequences, and from happy and lovey cute moments to horror and despair this novel has it all, complete with a great sound track.\n\nThe art style was in my opinion very good and the characters where well written filling their roles excellently. While personally there are one or two characters I didn\u2019t like that was just because of their personality and not how they were written.\n\nThere\u2019s only one place that you can influence the story so potential readers might not like that. However, as that one place can determine which of 4 endings you get- it is still quite influential.\nAs for replay value- honestly -only 3 times are necessary if you save at the choice point. The first enables you to see 3 endings.  The 2nd to see the 4th ending and the 3rd allows the reading of extra content. I wold recommend using the jump to unread section in the options menue one the 2nd and 3rd time\u2019s due to the very long story.\nAlso as a warning this game does contain scenes of Yuri which might put some people off but these are few and far between so it won\u2019t ruin the story.\n\nLaugh, cry, love and annoyance you will feel all from this amazingly written visual novel\nThe shadows of Pygmalion gets my 100% recommendation", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198196931803", "last_played": 1504820725, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_forever": 2125}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504824857, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504824857, "recommendationid": "34804090", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
