Nothing most office workers haven't experience, but it is handled well enough here.\n \nWhen the black fog will chase you, you have to do very trial & error maze running through an office building which to it's credit actually has variety in its corridors, so the problem isn't that it all looks the same, but it feels like the fog is too close, so if you make a wrong turn then you get sucked in & killed & have to do the section over again. It feels like a minor balance issue, because the map is well designed, rather than the annoying same corridor labyrinth trash we've all seen on Steam before.\nThese sections aren't long but they are long enough that you could get killed 5 times before getting the path right.\n\nThat's the only major downfall, it can get frustrating repeating the same section a bunch of times trying to find the right way.\nI'm recommending but it's a cautious one; 'you are locked in a office building' games have been a bit of a gamble as a genre, but this one is better than most unless trial & error really annoys you quickly.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198086542708", "last_played": 1478507017, "num_reviews": 77, "num_games_owned": 3590, "playtime_forever": 100}, "votes_up": 11, "timestamp_created": 1478312076, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516988", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1478312380, "recommendationid": "26427161", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "There are some pretty frustrating aspects to be found in this game, but for the price it's a solid purchase for a horror enthusiast. It will probably take you 1-2 hours to fully complete.\n\nFollowing instructions from a phone found in your office, you'll explore the building looking for a way to escape a strange force that seems to be following you. In doing so, you'll check computers, find items, hide under desks, climb through vents and anything else you can do to solve some basic environmental puzzles and survive. The game offers little in the way of handholding (outside of the messages on your phone), so you'll need to use your own initiative and imagination to get out of some of the bad situations you'll be faced with.\n\nThe game uses the unreal engine fairly well creating a nice looking, detailed office environment to explore. FPS performance and loading times were great throughout my own experience. My only real complaint as far as this goes is that I think the game is far too dark in some areas. If there are no nearby light sources you'll be staring at a completely black screen quite often. I recommend sliding the gamma right up.\n\nThe audio leaves a little to be desired as you'll be treated to a range of sounds from your surroundings and... Whatever the hell is following you, but I couldn't help wanting a little more to increase my immersion and terror. It's currently quite basic, but it works.\n\nStory-wise, you'll have to check nearby computer terminals and check on your colleagues e-mail to piece the story together. It's fairly interesting, but I have to say I was a little disappointed with the conclusion.\n\nThere are currently a few bugs and glitches to be found within the game, but no more than you would expect to see from an indie game with a small team behind it. Nothing game-breaking to worry about.\n\nOverall I would say it's worth a go if you're a horror fan. If you're not, then I would suggest looking elsewhere. It's nothing that new and it won't blow your mind, but it's not a bad way to spend an hour or two.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLDfsRGYiu8", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197975093091", "last_played": 1478358728, "num_reviews": 59, "num_games_owned": 434, "playtime_forever": 174}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1478384739, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516294", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1478558362, "recommendationid": "26444869", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great Developer who is quick to respond and patch any bugs when reported.\n\nThe actual game itself is atmospheric and in a common yet unusual setting for a horror game: an office complex.
