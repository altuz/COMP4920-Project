I hope the developers actually reads this because I actually want something like this, but done better. I would love to see any game with fixed camera angles, with a survival horror theme. I thought that the roguelite elements like permadeath and procedural generation would enrich this, but it did not for me.\n\nThe game is playable, it works well and I can see the love poured in it. It's highly stylized for a PS1 game. It beautifully mirrors the style of Resident Evil 1 both in visuals and controls. You can have some fun with it, but believe me - I'm a huge fan of classic RE games and Vaccine let me down.\n\nI think it would actually work better if it were a linear adventure, with everything handcrafted as beautifully as these backgrounds. The game itself right now feels like an unfinished minigame for this non-existent Story mode.\n\nProcedural generation of rooms kinda works fine, but the repetetivness kicks in fast, and the lack of any kind of a map gets confusing, especially when you have identical rooms generated in one run. Random enemy placement is actually fun and I like it. It would work in a linear adventure and it also works here. RE1 had a few different monsters and it was okay. Here this variety is a necessity if you wish for it to be an engaging roguelite game. Maybe take a hint from Raid mode in RE:Revelations 2 where there are maybe 10-20 different monsters, but they have many different and interesting modifiers to them.\n\nAlso the monsters in vaccine are really unfair. Zombies are okay, bats are pushovers, but these crawlers are insanely strong to the point where the moment they appear, I know it's a game over. Hunters in RE1 were also very dangerous, but you could ooutrun them somehow, and blowing a shotgun actually knocked them over for a brief moment giving the player a chance at fighting them. Here you just wish you manage to kill them before they kill you.\n\nAnd then there are the controls. DOn't get me wrong - I like tank controls. I to this day play the classic RE sometimes. But here the controls feel wild, unresponsive and unpredictable. also there should be a larger margin of error when picking up weapons. It feels as if you have to be in an exact spot to pick the item up.\n\nSo again: I hope you are listening devs. I hope you maybe polish this one up, change it, or move alogn to a new project entirely. And I want you to succeed. I want to see something like this. But maybe try going with a Linear story but add a mode like this as a bonus? And flesh it out more. Add variety, add incentive to do just one more run. Maybe look at Raid Mode in revelations and don't go the roguelite route and instead do short missions with random drops. Whatever you do, I hope I will see something from you guys in the future.
