I really believe that the dev could charge quite a bit more for this game and it would be completely justified. You cannot find a better game for this price point at all.\n\nIts a rpg that has a series of colosseum battles called leagues that get harder and more varied with mechanics as you go up in the ladder. You will collect experience points, money, crafting materials, items, weapons, armor, friendship points, skill points, and fans as you battle your way to the top. You will also find secrets hidden around every corner in this game and it will let you know exactly when you found one. If you like collecting things it does have quite a bit to offer on that aspect.\n\nYou can build your characters to be a melee fighter, magic user or a battle mage that does both melee and magic quite well. Some characters are better suited for one roll over the other and you can tell by looking at their stat allocation and skills when you get that character which role suites them the best. You use either BP for melee type skills or MP for magic based skills. Each time you land an action you will gain more BP up to the max of 100 BP. It will carry over to the next fight so that you can save and store up your BP for the bosses. Each character has a special skill that they can use for 100 BP and it fills pretty decently to where you don't feel that your character is too op and you don't feel that it doesn't come around enough. Its a pretty well balanced system i think. \n\nThe story isn't the strongest i have seen and it isn't the weakest i have read either. Its about par, but you can tell that the dev's 1st language is not english so expect some of the grammar to be just a little off. I don't find it that bothersome at all but it is noticeable so people who are pretty big sticklers you could have issues with that. Do i think that it would ruin your experience in the game, i don't think that it will but it might be bothersome to you\n\n As a rpg maker game the graphics are actually done pretty nicely. The game looks pretty good as you play it. The animations are clean and crisp, the sprites have good detail to them, and the environments are pretty decent as well. Never once as i played did i look at the screen and think that what i was seeing was badly done or not good to look at. I think the art is definitely nicely done\n\nI don't remember much about the music so it neither bothered me nor was it memorable enough to stand out. It fits well enough within the game. With a game like this though you could just find your best epic battle music and let that play instead while you decimate all the foes one after another as you battle in league after league. \n\nOverall i just flat out enjoy this game and i am really looking forward to where this little gem goes. For 3 USD you cannot find a better rpg to waste away your free time. It already has quite a bit to do now and by the time it is done i foresee it having a lot of content that you could waste a lot of hours into. To me this is an easy buy if you like rpgs because the price point is just to hard to pass up for what you are getting now and for what will hopefully come in the future.\n\nThe dev is active in the forums as well and you can tell that they listen and take into consideration what you have to say. You can see the passion and the want to create a game that people will love and enjoy as much as they do in creating the game.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198123930832", "last_played": 1494636642, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 159, "playtime_forever": 1020}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1494131737, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515557", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1495065071, "recommendationid": "31596000", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So far, so good.
