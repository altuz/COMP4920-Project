Love the retro, look, sounds and music. Put on your headphones for this one. Controls are smooth once you get the hang of them, and the handy tutorial at the beginning provided the opportunity to do just that. I played using my xbox one controller and it worked beautifully. \n\nWorld Destroyers is easy to get into, but hard to perfect. I'm thankful for the variety of difficulty modes. Looking forward to becoming a master. Reminds me of a newer, better version of the classic arcade game, Asteroids. \n\nIf you love games made by people who love games.
