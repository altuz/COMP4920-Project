Yea.\n\nThe game has terrible voice acting which left me unmoved in any manner, left me unconvinced emotionally, so I couldn't really attach myself to the story, which is what this game is supposed to do. It's mostly about story, and it is presented in a walking simulator format.\n\nThe graphics are terrible which is a huge negative, it is a walking simulator, one of the things you have to nail is a world that is pretty to look at.\n\nThe soundtrack is in the same realm as most other walking simulator type games, not bad, not great, just... the norm.\n\nI played it for 20 minutes before I quit so I can't go super in-depth about the entire game.\n\nIn short it is an ugly walking simulator with bad voice acting that is unable to convince you.\n\nI don't recommend this to anyone, but I wish the developer good luck in their future games, this seems like their first game.\nI hope they take more time on the next one and are more self-critical next time.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198014763908", "last_played": 1494105052, "num_reviews": 107, "num_games_owned": 2277, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1494105650, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496367", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1494105775, "recommendationid": "31590309", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
