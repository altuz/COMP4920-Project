I enjoy indie games and I love the idea of helping to support new or upcoming artists and creators. Having said that, I was incredibly disappointed in this game. I also don't recall seeing that information prefaced on the game's product page. If I missed it, my bad. If I didn't, please put this on there. It does not bode well. People should be aware of what they're buying.\n\nFirst, the game glitched out on me, freezing everything upon just opening it.. twice. Second, I unlocked 17% of my achievements for the game without doing anything at all, just pacing back and forth for 20 minutes looking for clues. Literally, I did nothing here. There are no control settings; typically every game I've played so far has this. The English translation for the captions are not like the ones in the trailer; I understood them but they simply look to have been translated incorrectly. I couldn't go upstairs nor go into any of the rooms/doors on the 1st floor, not even the one I came from!

Creating a coherent, bugfree game isn't easy so just because of that I'm giving this game an A for effort. The house looks pretty good overall, not AAA quality, but I've definitely seen much, much worse. The puzzles are good, ranging from easy and predictable to clever and original. The atmospere is appropriately creepy with some well timed jump scares. And there's a creepy story that is told through cutscenes (so no endless reading of notes, scraps of paper and diary entries) with decent voice overs. \n\nBut there are also a bunch of problems with this game.\n\nFirst of all it's unclear where and when the game is set. Most clues seem to point at turn of the century England (around 1900), with the investigation taking place about 20 years later, so around 1920. But there are many items in the game from later time periods. There are cardboard boxes in the hallway and kitchen with the date 15-5-2007 stamped on them. On a chalk board displaying a calender the word \"yoga\" is mentioned. Yoga was invented in America in the 1960's and didn't exist before that, certainly not around 1900. In the living room a 1960's style television is seen (and used for a puzzle that is inspired by the lcd styled numbers like the ones you see on an electronic calculator). A 1950's style telephone is also found in the living room and I could go on. I could have lived with one or two minor mistakes, but the more attention I started paying, the more anachronistic elements I discovered.\n\nWhile the puzzles work well and some are rather clever, they aren't well integrated into the story. There is no (contextual) explanation given why there are so many puzzles strewn about this house. Some of the more traditional point-and-click style puzzles work well, but the others break any immersion of being in an actual haunted house.\n\nThe story is creepy and I like the fact that it is told through flash backs rather than through a series of diary entries. But the mental state of one of the characters makes no sense. First she is presented as being psychotic, but later she mentiones that she no longer has short term memory (like the main character in Memento). Which is a completely different kind of mental illness, often caused by the brain being damaged after an accident and not something that is the logical conclusion of being psychotic. At the end of the game the developer mentions that he/she was trying to convey some ancient bhudist wisdom. Without going into detail I can only say that what is seen in the story doesn't match at all with what the developer was trying to convey. Which is a pity because I admire that he/she was trying to do more than just tell a creepy story.\n\nAs many reviewers have pointed out the English seen in the game is badly translated, which seems to be a returning problem for a lot of non-western based indie developers.\n\nYou're given journal early on. This is usualy used to give subtle hints on what to do next and to summarize the story so far. Not is this game. Three entries is all you'll get and they're kind of pointless.\n\nMy last annoyance is the fact that the main character is called a telepath, psychic and exorcist. He never shows any signs of being telepathic (being able to read minds or project thoughts in other minds) or of being an exorcist. Calling him a psychic detective would fit the bill with what we see him do. But telepath and exorcist?\n\nIn conclusion I'd like to give this advice to the developer:\n- Do some research about the geographic location and period of time you set your games in. Find pictures, paintings, examples of news papers and magazines of the appropriate period and location and use this to determine how the game should look\n- Try and blend the puzzles into the environment or give a good reason for the obviously gamey puzzles to be in the game (like in the 7th Guest)\n- Find someone to proofread and correct all texts, preferably someone who speaks the language natively and if possible uses it professionally (f.i. someone who writes, translates or teaches a language for a living)\n- If you use a mental illness as a central part of the plot, again do some research, find out how it would effect someone and use this to advance the story\n- Similarly if you have a message that you want to convey that is based around some key ideas, look up the defintion of these words and make sure that the characters representing these ideas behave appropriately and that their motivations are clearly convoyed to the player", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017392185", "last_played": 1504783037, "num_reviews": 117, "num_games_owned": 3097, "playtime_forever": 201}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504788291, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498180", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1504788291, "recommendationid": "34793650", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
