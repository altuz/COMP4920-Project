At first, I thought I made a mistake, as none of the games I tried quite captured MiaB's charm. This one was too [strike]hot[/strike] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xander77/recommended/561000/]buggy[/url], this one was too [strike]cold[/strike] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xander77/recommended/544710/]underdeveloped[/url], and that one had [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xander77/recommended/494230/]the wrong sort of gameplay altogether[/url].\n\nHopes and Fears finally recaptures the charm that drew me to the series in the first place. Really addictive, varied, challenging just to the right degree gameplay. Variance between the levels so that one restaurant isn't [i]just[/i] a palette-swap. A new optional challenge on pretty much every level, so that you're never too bored and the levels don't feel too samey.\n\nThe plot is about the family's daughter falling ill, and the father trekking to the north pole to get a cure. I wasn't exactly worried that the Delicious series is going to end with a toddler dying, but it's nice to have some stakes. The different locations and sense of urgency also improved the writing (sitcom cliche though it continued to be). I could do without the Eskimos moving to the big city after trying some chocolate (by no means the most ludicrous thing that happens in the game) but overall - I laughed, I \"awwww\"ed, I thought the whole thing was pretty good.\n\nReally recommended, if you can stand casual gameplay, bright colors and sitcoms with a laugh track.\n\nEdit - As always, make sure to delete the \"branding\" folder in the game's directory to make it launch quickly.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197978806930", "last_played": 1500238165, "num_reviews": 95, "num_games_owned": 1143, "playtime_forever": 764}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504110031, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504211802, "recommendationid": "34611982", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
