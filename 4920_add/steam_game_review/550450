If the ball-snake reaches the hole, you lose the level.  After a few levels you get some power ups that randomly appear after making matches.  Every 4 or 5 levels you get a key that lets you unlock more power ups.  You can choose which power ups you want to unlock.  It's always nice to have control over what special powers you have so you can play in your style.  The levels get tougher as the game progresses:  2 ball-snakes at once, zig-zag paths that make it difficult to shoot balls where you want them, tunnels where you can't get at part of the ball-snake while it goes through, etc.\n\nPower ups include:\n\nSlow - always useful!\nBackwards - the ball-snake creeps backwards for a few seconds\nShooter (I forget what it's called) - you shoot a fire dart, first only one but later you can upgrade to 3.\nBlast - creates a big blast that takes out all balls in the area of the blast, small at first but can be upgraded\nOrb of Decay - This is a good one, though it sounds like it would slowly decay them it actually does it instantly.  A trail of black smoke destroys orbs in a certain area when you use this one.\nAnd more that I have not unlocked yet.\n\nThe main gameplay area is shown as a map that you progress across (I can't remember if there was some kind of story).\nThere is also a Challenge area where you try to play levels as long as you can.  Those unlock as you go along in the main map gameplay.  I'm not sure if there are leaderboards or if you are just playing for your own record.\n\nThere are Achievements.\nThere are Trading Cards.\nThere are 3 Difficulty settings including \"Nightmare\" for those who want a challenge!\n\nGraphics aren't the greatest (looks like a phone game) and the music is probably that free stuff but I just want to play, I don't care how things look and sound.  There is one music track I like that is fun and quirky.  I assume it randomly picks a track.\n\nIt's a great game for short bursts of play.  \n\n((For the record, I bought this on Steam with my own money.)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198064050389", "last_played": 1494363818, "num_reviews": 59, "num_games_owned": 3500, "playtime_forever": 819}, "votes_up": 22, "timestamp_created": 1491263269, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548330", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1492120896, "recommendationid": "30932831", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "You get pretty much exactly what you see here on the store page and you should know before you buy this game if you're into this sort of category of games or not.\n\nI am usually but this game got a bit dull after 1 and a half hours of playing.\n\nMostly due to nothing new happening.\nMost of these games have some sort of new aspect every now and then, a new thing that gets added to the game-play every 5-10 levels.\nThis game offers literally the same game-play throughout the entire game except for the power-ups that you unlock, and you quickly get all of them and they do not really add anything unique to the game.

I loved Sparkle 2 -- the previous game.  So the pros:  great graphics and when they work great mechanics.  Cons: the ball you are shooting changes color between strings and if you don't waste the time to double check your colors your shots get messed up.  Additionally, when the line is close to the lower edge and you want to shoot the ball -- too bad.  It will just sit there until you move to a location where the ball and shooter are separated enough and then it will allow you to launch.  These seem to be pretty big bugs to me for an otherwise slick game.\n\nFrankly, I'd get Sparkle 2 again but you can skip over this one as just a major frustration.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 294, "steamid": "76561198020400276", "last_played": 1506547011, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 562, "playtime_forever": 5395}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506547611, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506547702, "recommendationid": "35249739", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
