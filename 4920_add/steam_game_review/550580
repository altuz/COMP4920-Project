The game is really short, you can beat it within 2 hours with dedication and paying attention to some little jokes to make the combinations. The game has 2 main screens, the Crafting, where you click on one stick and other to combine, and the Inventory, where you have all the sticks that you've unlocked so far, and cliclking on it make it appears on the Crafting.\n\nThere is a little button that shows you some sticks that you can unlock, he shows a shadow stick with the name Zebra, and in your inventory you have Black & White stick and Animal stick (There is also horse stick that could make more sense, but I get in there soon.), combine it and \"Zebra\". Some of them are more literal as, \"Horned Monkey\", \"Winged Monkey\" and others. But some of them are just impossible to guess just by the name. \"Rare Fish\" (Ok, let me fish sometime and soon this appears) No, you combine Lake + Dinamite... What? And what about Pirate? It could be simple as Human + Ship, no man, it's Cyclops + Human, what's this? (If it's some mythology reference, I'm sorry, I dind't get it.).\n\nThe hints are very useful here when guessing by the name is impossible, but you can only use 3 per day. Since I dind't want to use a guide I played this everyday for the last month to get some hints, because I really got stuck on some stickers. In the end I used a guide because of Wild Sticks. They are special sticks that appears with some conditions. Like Rare Fish (A lot) and mountain, no you don't combine, you just put it on the screen and then Cyclops (Wild) appears, so you use Stickerizer (A special stick to catch the Wild ones [Gotta get'em all!] and you can use it).\n\nThere is also the Day and Night cycle, that follows your computer time to set it, if it's before 6PM it's day, after it's night, until 6AM (I think so). Why this exist? Only to get 2... 2... TWO!!! Wild Sticks, and nothing more (I think it's only 2 because I played all this game on afternoons, and changed clock to get those). \n\nThe soundtracks is 2 musics, really happy and that, somehow, works very well with the game, the bad side, it's just 2 musics, end one play the other and restart.\n\nThere is a lot of combination with some jokes, others that just don't make any sense and others that is too much literal. The game is good, the soundtrack got me, even been only 2 short musics, and after a time annoying too, but the game has no dificult and what is hard to combine it's because is impossible to guess without a hint or a guide. The game's price isn't good in my opinion, for what this game could be, yet it has a lot of sticks on the game that could combine to get new ones, right now it has 221 stickers, but while playing I bet I did more than 300 ideas for it. I hope the developer (s?) can come with a new update with a lot of new sticks, because isn't hard to make new ones, the art style is really kid in my opinion (and yet I love this kind of art). You can buy it without fear if:\n\n-You like indie games;\n-You like cheap games;\n-You like fast games;\n-You like kid art style;\n-You like puzzle games;\n-You like to say to yourself \"This makes no sense.\"\n\nBut if you want something \"harder\" I recommend Doodle God games, and you can play on your browser for free...\n\n63/100 \"Good, but could be better.\"", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 90, "steamid": "76561198128624096", "last_played": 1506621449, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_forever": 232}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1506623602, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506623717, "recommendationid": "35268322", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
