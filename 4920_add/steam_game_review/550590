Only if a game really excels in what it sets out to do I feel I have to give my 2 cents. Archaica is without a doubt such a game because it does everything it wants to achieve in a mesmerising way.\n\nArchaica is a light redirection puzzle game. It contains 87 separate puzzles that split into 6 chapters with a total of\n[list]\n[*]68 campaign puzzles, and\n[*]19 side quest puzzles.\n[/list]\nThe player is gradually made familiar with the basic puzzle mechanics in the first chapter and more intricate mechanics are introduced in the following chapters. Generally speaking you have to direct light beams of different colors through crystals of the same color by using mirrors, splitters, filters, etc. As to the difficulty curve, I'd say that starting from chapter 3 puzzles are getting pretty hard to solve even though some may be less difficult.\n\nEach puzzle of Archaica is very well designed. Your goal is clearly defined and most of the time I had a pretty good understanding of how the light has to be directed in general. Puzzleing therefore mostly consisted of trying to make this general solution work with the limited resources available. It follows that in many cases, finding the actual solution resulted in a very rewarding experience.\n\nI never had to resort to fundamental trial and error which is also due to a hint system that perfectly fits my needs. Almost all puzzles have so-called cells hidden in them. Each cell you find allows for a hint to the puzzle. And for a hint you have to select a couple of neighboring squares in the puzzle area and the game will show you in which of these fields you have to place one of your puzzle items ... not which item though. So hints only very gently nudge you into the right direction.\n\nFurther things to look for in the puzzles are so-called cryptoglyphs. Most puzzles have between two and four of these items hidden around the puzzle area. If you find all of them, you will get some explanations as to the background and the items of Archaica. Which brings me to the 'story' of the game: generally, when you solve a puzzle you will get background information about the history of Archaica or about the Path of Light that you, the player, are wandering on. In my opinion, those text bits add to the feel of the game but I can appreciate that some might find them superfluous, after all they are quite generic.\n\nFinally, and [u]quite importantly[/u], the game has beautiful visuals that perfectly support the feeling of intrigue when solving the puzzles. There are deserts, caves, fiery pits, jungles, and more.\n\nHaving said all that, Archaica stands out amongst all light redirection puzzles I've played and I have played quite a lot. So my advice to any lover of puzzle games is to get it right away, it is well worth it's price! If you think 15\u20ac is too much get it in the next sale.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198070453188", "last_played": 1505413129, "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 404, "playtime_forever": 977}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1505072413, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509213", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1505072413, "recommendationid": "34869743", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Archaia: The Path of Light.\n\nIs exactly what it seems a puzzle that allows you to use your skills to get to the finish line but not without a nice challenge.\nWith beautiful grahics and interesting view angles you might as well play this game for a few hours.\n\nAlthough there are some minor cons. \nMusic can get irritating repetitvely or make you sleepy.

As a kid, I was enchanted by one of these old light reflect games, in the early days of PC games when people ran MS-DOS. Archaica is like an evolved, modern version of that. The visuals are beautiful, the sound creates a nice ambiance and a magical feel to your actions. There are plenty of different puzzle pieces to influence light in many ways, from reflection and splitting to teleporting and refracting. \n\nThere are two things that I find less good. The first is the story. It doesn't matter much, but if you're going to put a story in your game, make it fitting. This particular type of story is not one I would put in a puzzle game. It seems at odds with the atmosphere of the gameplay. \n\nSecond: the difficulty. Maybe it's because I don't play puzzle games often, but this game is hard. I often find 4 or 5 near-solutions, where I could solve the puzzle if I could turn one mirror into another, or have one more tile of space. Sometimes after a long time of staring at variations of what I already made, I find the \"real\" solution, but sometimes I don't. \n\nThere is a hint system, but it doesn't help with this. Knowing the location of a piece but not knowing which piece is supposed to go there barely reduces the difficulty at all. The only thing that worked for me is using the hint system to get all locations, but then it's suddenly very easy and just a matter of swapping stuff until it works. So instead, I've been using the solutions post on the Steam discussion forums when I really couldn't figure one out. Usually it's one small thing that I missed. For example, \"a color changing lens can be used to change the color of 2 orthogonal beams\". I had one puzzle all figured out except for that one fact. The hint system does nothing in that case, except funnel you into the right direction until by pure coincidence you stumble upon the solution. \n\nI think this game could benefit from a difficulty setting, where the current, single-solution game could be the highest difficulty, and one lower (medium) could give you a few extra tiles of space or an extra mirror here and there, to allow for secondary solutions for the non-hardcore puzzlers. \n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] Great game, as good as puzzle games get, as long as you don't care too much for story and don't mind a high difficulty.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049127589", "last_played": 1505303956, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 429}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1505304221, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499412", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1505304221, "recommendationid": "34918160", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very enjoyable!
