This game is very good, so smooth, so easy to get into.\nIt feels like CS:GO and Call of Duty had a baby, thats Free to play. All weapons seem balanced, and are overpowered only in 1 way and always has a trade off. \nSo far the player base is at the moment a bit too easy, and every once in a while you'll come across decent players. Its really competitive, and addicting.\n                Yours Truly, ChhimPanzee", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "steamid": "76561198292502583", "last_played": 1506077215, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 4474}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1501747401, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511786", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1501747401, "recommendationid": "33987444", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great combo between COD and CSGO.

Before I even played it I thought \"Hey if its that good of a game the Founders Package should be worth it too\" Well turns out the Founder's Package is just a complete scam of $30 and the game mechanics are shit. Everyone camps and I find the game to be unplayable. Just a ripped off version of Call of Duty that tries to be CS.GO. What a complete was of my money.
