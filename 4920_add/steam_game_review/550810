I do think the delay could be reduced a tiny amount but you know... even that is very authentic because I often thought the same kind of same when playing the \"real deal\" games.\n\nSUMMARY: Perhaps the most authentic modern retro inspired game I have played. It is very well done and is enjoyable to play. I hope the devs continue to make more retro style games like this one.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "steamid": "76561198188065497", "last_played": 1506307052, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 175, "playtime_forever": 36}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499652957, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499652957, "recommendationid": "33420140", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pros:\n\n-Gameplay feels 100% retro\n-Game perfectly feels like an arcade game from the early 80s\n-Good controls\n-Well-made level design\n-Simple concept that works\n-Co-Op feature\n-Achievements\n-Trading Cards\n-In-Game difficulty that grows well\n-Good retro graphics\n-Cheap price\n\n\nCons:\n\n-No in-game music\n-Partial Controller Support\n-Game tends to be repetitive (Single Player)\n\n\n\nOther infos:\n\nGame is family friendly: Yes\nLow-Specs computer friendly: Yes\nGame's overall relevance: Very recommended", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198125460456", "last_played": 1502417955, "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 903, "playtime_forever": 38}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1502424450, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502424450, "recommendationid": "34160674", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
