If you like The Binding of Isaac (+ Rebirth) or whatnot, this game-- you most likely will like. I cannot gaurantee considering the fact I'm not whomever whose thinking on getting this game. Though, I thought about getting this game at first and decided to give it a go. This game has a ton of potential and I sure do hope more monsters, maps, and tons of which-ever is coming is gonna come soon. It's quite interesting! Also I really hope there will be a chance to even customize your own character. ;P\nSome of us like to create our own character, however in this current state. We can only play as a male.\nNot a big deal, it's just some of us feel uneasy being a \"he\" in game when we prefer to be a \"she.\"\n... If that makes sense.\n\nThanks for reading!~", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198105679917", "last_played": 1504750702, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 96, "playtime_forever": 1679}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1503282381, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464328", "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_updated": 1503282381, "recommendationid": "34386420", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Interesting but not quite as cool as i was hoping.
