Tires don't give traction, they push you away from the object you are trying to climb. Tires \"fall\" between objects that are too close together to fit a tire through. +more annoying stuff. \n\nAnd the vehicles move too slow. I understand it's about trials and not about racing, but it would be fun to open the throttle on practice mode at least.\n\nThe 'fun::frustration coefficient' is to strongly biased on the frustration side.
