The game is relatively short and I do not recommend it at the full price right now, but for a couple of dollars it is somewhat reasonable.\n\nCurrently there are 25 levels with varying difficulty and it took me about an hour to get through it. The only major issues I noticed did have an impact on gameplay, so it is worth noting. Texture issues can cause part of the screen to become blocked and obstruct the view of the puzzle. It happened a few times on different levels (as seen in the footage) and made solving one puzzle in particular annoying. \n\nFundamentally, the mechanics work and it can be challenging. There are currently three colored nodes that include blue (always on), yellow (triggered on or off if hit multiple times), and red (timed deactivation). Some powers are available to help aid in hitting the nodes, but you can complete the puzzles without them. \n\nThere is a disjointed story involved as well, which I hope gets fleshed out and organized better so it feels more coherent. Music is decent. Sound effects are minimal, but appropriate. UI is passable. \n\nIt isn't terrible, but it might not be enough content to warrant the price right now. Discounted, it is reasonable, but with puzzle games skill is a big factor.\n\nThis has been a EAW PSA.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000561257", "last_played": 1486078629, "num_reviews": 87, "num_games_owned": 2901, "playtime_forever": 124}, "votes_up": 9, "timestamp_created": 1478671048, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506577", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1478671202, "recommendationid": "26499468", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pretty brain-wracking, but in the fun kinda way.
