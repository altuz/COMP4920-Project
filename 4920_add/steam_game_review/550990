Not too easy, but also not too hard, it makes you go exploring the most bizzare combinations and playing options that latter become your every first option (but they might still not be the correct ones).\nGreat soundtracks and unusual and very likeable drawings are nicely mixed with a good storyline and charismatic characters. Viktor brings a good (European/Slavic) humor and places some of the very familiar historical names in an alternative but maybe possible historical situations.\nSeveral flaws with the audio and music background leveling throghout the game, but otherwise, 5/5.\nAnd I do hope for a sequel :)", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198373323626", "last_played": 1495745861, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 347}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1495748874, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504431", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1495748945, "recommendationid": "31960401", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}]}
