I have 2.3 hours on record because an hour of it was spent running out to get lunch.  Don't expect to be satisfied.  The game ends abruptly.  It looks like you're reaching a crescendo in the story when instead it's just, \"thanks for playing!\".  I suppose in $/h this is cheaper than a movie ticket (just barely), but at least movies have a beginning, middle, and end.\n\nThe GOOD:\nThose are my frustrations with the game, but also, it does contain some dry humor.  Nothing that will make you actually laugh, but it tries to be funny, which is nice.  I liked the plot and the story.\n\nThe MEH:\nI would say that the controls are good, since it is just a point-and-click game (I guess tap since it's a mobile port).  However, in some areas, it can get pretty annoying when it shifts from click near the area you want to go to click exactly on the specific thing you wish to jump on.  Since the controls are so simple, it greatly reduces the excitement in the game.  You never need to combine objects as it is done for you.  You don't need to fight anything, because that's just a cutscene.  At one point a rain of arrows is coming at you, and you have no option but to just click and hope that this time the random-arrow-placement-generator doesn't hit you.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040266597", "last_played": 1497730388, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 284, "playtime_forever": 140}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1497731281, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521170", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1497731281, "recommendationid": "32516839", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
