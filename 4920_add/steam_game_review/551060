I saw Creekside Creep Invasion and figured it would be right up my alley. Well it is, and actually the game is even better than I expected! This is one of the only really challenging twin stick shooters I have played, I can't seem to make it past the first part, but that's a good thing, most games like this have been a breeze for me. I'm getting a bit better each time I play so the game isn't impossible.  \n\nAs it's description says, CCI is a rogue-lite, and the gameplay is somewhat similar to Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne. Does it play just like those games? no, but if you've played and enjoyed those 2, then you should give CCI a shot. To me CCI is a lot like a game that few people are familar with, which would be a game called \"All Zombies Must Die!\". CCI is much better than that game, because for one, that game was way too easy for me and I also like the pixel art style of CCI much better!\n\nCCI has a unique system of randomly switching your weapon out every time you run out of bullets. It adds to the challenge and reduces boredom of being stuck with one weapon. The levels layout changes each time you play and enemies are random. You've got permanent unlockables, different power items you can find, power-ups for yourself, like health, speed, etc..., you also have different costumes you can find and unlock which allow you to perform specials, each costume having their own unique special...The game is set during the 80's on Halloween, so you can't get a much better setting than that.\n\nTo top it all off, the devs are awesome, I had a slight issue with gamepad aiming, so I brought it up in the forums...The dev not only responded extremely quickly, but actually implemented a fix within minutes, that actually fixed the issue! I cannot say if I've ever experienced this, I might have once before from another awesome indie dev, but it's been rare for me to even get a reply from a dev, let alone a fix the same day. Incredible. Needless to say, I really like this game, but I also really want the devs to be successful, because they know how to treat their customers right. I cannot say enough good things about this dev.\n\nI highly recommend, yes even in EA, Creekside Creep Invasion. I really think a lot of people who like rogue-like/lite will enjoy this game, and those who are huge into twin sticks, like myself, should really enjoy it as well. I really enjoy the music as well, and the game overall reminds me of a beloved NES game or old school computer game from the early 90s. I don't often have time to play video games these days, so don't let my play time fool you.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988113155", "last_played": 1498182810, "num_reviews": 84, "num_games_owned": 889, "playtime_forever": 35}, "votes_up": 5, "timestamp_created": 1498184627, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505136", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1498184943, "recommendationid": "32661012", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A very fun game that reminds me of those old arcade classics.
