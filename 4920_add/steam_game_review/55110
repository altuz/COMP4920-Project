I purchased the game a while back on a Steam sale and just recently installed it and tried to play it so that I could knock it off the list of games that I have.\n \nI read a lot of the reviews complaining about the crashes that they were experiencing while playing but I still wanted to try it anyways because it doesn't always happen to everyone. Well, I got about 20-30 minutes in to playing the game before my first crash and now I can only go about 3-5 minutes while playing before it crashes. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and made sure various crap was updated on my end but nothing proved to work.\n\nSadly, through my experience I cannot recommend this game as I am afraid that others might experience these same issues. I got it cheap on a Steam sale a couple years ago so I am not going to complain. But it is still disappointing."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506402661, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35216021", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198045599303", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506402611, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_forever": 257}, "timestamp_updated": 1506402661, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Totally fun game, that doesn't work."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506875393, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35388348", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198018674119", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1352880000, "num_games_owned": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 9380}, "timestamp_updated": 1506875393, "received_for_free": false, "review": "You know in bad movies or television shows when the 60 year old executive writing the script wants to show teenage boy characters being teenage boys, so they put in a really out of touch scene of some boys playing the \"Hip New Video Game\" but they don't want to mention an actual one so they just make up the most generic game possible that sounds so boring, soulless, and nondescript that no one on Earth would actually play it?\nRed Faction: Armageddon is that game."}]}
