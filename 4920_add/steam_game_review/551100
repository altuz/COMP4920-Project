It brings me back to my days of pumping quarter after quarter into machines in the arcade, except with MUCH better graphics. The four different game modes are challenging, especially Minefield mode, where you don't have any offensive weaponry at all and must rely on your defensive armaments to take out your foes. Survival is probably one of the more difficult ones; Classic is more like Galaga/Galaxian/Space Invaders where you can't let the aliens get past you (since you're the last line of defense). Defend is more like a Tower Defense-style mode, where you have to keep your satellites safe for a set time period (thankfully there are turrets to help out).\n\nI already mentioned the better graphics; I think that the artwork on this game is really good. Sound effects are pretty good as well, although unlike the previous reviewer, I didn't have an issue with the music. I thought it fit pretty well. Finally, I would highly recommend using an Xbox controller to play this game; controls are much more fluid. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game, especially if you love 1) twin-stick space shooters, and 2) a challenge!!", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970816451", "last_played": 1479846382, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_forever": 81}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1479737683, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496977", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1479737683, "recommendationid": "26731369", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I am a fan of twin stick shooters and space shooters so I had to give this a try. Overall I am really enjoying this game. Its fast paced action provides a challenge. I also like the variety provided by the four different modes of gameplay. The mine mode is unlike anything else I've played. I also liked the art style. The music was good as well, though I felt the tempo was a little to slow for the game. It felt heavy. I was not a fan of the keyboard controls on this game, but for the most part, I don't like keyboard controls, so that may just be my bias coming through. The Xbox controller worked flawlessly.\n\nThis is a reccommend for anyone who is a fan of twin stick or space shooters.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198031829492", "last_played": 1494634155, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 182, "playtime_forever": 49}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1479521706, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496977", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1479521706, "recommendationid": "26682815", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Thoroughly disappointed to find out that this is terrible. Your ship moves slowly and clumsily, enemy weapons frequently have better range than yours so you'll be shot from off-screen, there's almost no visual feedback when you get hit and what little there is - like a brief flash and a tiny, decreasing meter along the bottom of your ship - is really difficult to discern and notice amongst the obnoxious amounts of neons, reds, oranges and bloom. Consequently it's hard to work out what's actually hitting you and from what direction, so suddenly dying because you didn't notice how low your green bar was and failed to spot an off-screen enemy lining up a perfect shot happens far too often for my liking. There are so many twin-stick shooters on Steam that are far better than Oblivion's Edge, so I really can't recommend it, not even at sale price for fans of the genre.\n\nAlso this game absolutely refused to work properly with a controller plugged in; neither love nor money would make it shoot down, the ship was constantly rotating left, and I honestly didn't care enough to bother looking up a fix beyond \"unplug controller\".", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000919706", "last_played": 1498490391, "num_reviews": 37, "num_games_owned": 748, "playtime_forever": 221}, "votes_up": 0, "timestamp_created": 1498491686, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498491686, "recommendationid": "32819500", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
