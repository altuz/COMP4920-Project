The game never holds your hand and the difficulty curve is so ridiculous that even if i did a brain transplant with a quantum super computer that computer would just melt and immediately look for a walkthrough. \n\nThankfully there are several walkthrough's available which immediately makes me ask who are you people that produce these walkthrough's? I seriously thank all Gods of this world for such heavenly blessings. It humbles me to know that there are people with giant sized Moai brains who not only walk among us, but are willing to devote their time and almighty video recording skills to the common people who like me share the iq of a damp piece of seaweed. May the fanning of palm branches and grapes being dropped into your mouth be constantly rewarded to your steam profile thrones.\n\nThe game was produced within 2 months by 2 Ukrainian developers found here http://www.konstructors.com/ . The speedy construction and delivery is all thanks to very minimal UI. There is no high scores, no timers, a limited repetitive soundtrack and 6 levels with a very basic backdrop which merely alternates in colour and sometimes direction. In a nutshell it\u2019s just you and the puzzle.\n\nThe concept of this puzzle was largely inspired by the game 'Lights Out' the basic concept which is that the adjacent tiles to the one you press will systematically move in the opposite up or down direction. Hence the main goal is to turn all the tiles lights off on the map by having them eventually all pressed down. If you achieve this on all 100 + levels in the minimum moves possible you will be rewarded with the 'final puzzle'. A puzzle so great that it would cause a NASA Super computer to hide behind a couch scared.\n\nThe tile mechanics are slightly spiced up eventually with 'Special Tiles'. Problem is the game really doesn't properly explain the mechanics of such tiles and more often than not you will only learn the tricks through laborious trial and testing. The satisfaction from this is albeit because of the sudden steep climb of difficulty and many will simply succumb to walkthroughs because of the sheer volume of time needed to be dedicated to this game if one was to choose to go it alone.\n\nWhile I appreciate the fact that there are many gamers who may cherish a difficult puzzler like this, personally the satisfaction I got from it was very fleeting all due to the unreasonable difficulty coupled with poor difficulty progression. Also thanks to its minimalistic presentation there wasn\u2019t really enough to hook me and reel in an enthusiasm beckoning me to progress. Due to the sum of how much time was needed for a trial and error approach and being present in a very busy world with many games on offer, really pushed me to scurry quickly for a walkthrough, and after that moment, any real satisfaction in puzzle solving that this game had to offer was immediately lost. \n\nBelow is two video's. The first is someone playing 'way out'. The second is 'Whackamole'.

Of course, the puzzles themselves are key to the experience and in many cases present quite a stiff challenge, especially if you're aiming to solve the puzzles with the minimum possible number of moves - I'm not ashamed to admit to having referred to a guide to help with a fair few of them.\n\nAs you get towards the later puzzles, there are some interesting variants to the standard [i]Lights Out[/i] puzzles, with special tiles that behave in different ways from standard ones, and it can be quite satisfying (albeit briefly) to work out each new mechanic and how best to make use of it to solve each puzzle. The one major criticism that I have with the game is linked with this, though, to an extent - while the game doesn't really need a tutorial as such (and doesn't have one), the puzzles don't necessarily come across in such a way as to teach techniques for solving later ones, instead feeling in large part to need a trial-and-error approach. Overall, though, the game easily justifies its low price, with its 120 puzzles providing a good length and the game's positives outweighing its drawbacks.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993148381", "last_played": 1499907435, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 1550, "playtime_forever": 379}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499981648, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499981669, "recommendationid": "33512578", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I generally really like puzzle games, but for some reason this one just didn't click for me.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198093623419", "last_played": 1499404951, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 135, "playtime_forever": 70}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499405201, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500865", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1499405201, "recommendationid": "33333575", "votes_funny": 2, "voted_up": false}]}
