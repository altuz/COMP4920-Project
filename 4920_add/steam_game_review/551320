It's very short and I had completed it quickly and you seem to be rewarded with a runner game where you need to pick up pumpkins, Once finished you unlock the levels to try again, It's good for the cheap price but would be better with lots of levels and more for the player to do, The game has no mechanics to use except jump run and use, Been nice to see some monsters as it's so creepy and some weapons to shoot them with, As it is it's great for free (thanks) but ok for the money, Its a cheap hours fun.
