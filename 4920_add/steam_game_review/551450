Furious Angels is an exception.\n\nYes, each game will probably last five minutes or less.  Yes, there is no grand strategy involved.  Just reflexes and think-on-your-toes sort of tactics.  It is so very well executed though; probably the best game of its sort that I've played in a long time.\n\nThe basic mechanics are rock solid; the controls are smooth as silk, the difficulty ramps slowly and steadily because of a well-designed wave pattern and consistent upgrades.  If you dawdle, you can easily get overwhelmed in the early stages, but FA definitely rewards good play.  Though there is some luck involved, in what game is there not?\n\ntldr: I can heartily recommend FA for any shoooter enthusiast, especially if you're looking for something you can pick up for five to ten minutes and then put right back down.  If that's not your bag, probably don't bother.
