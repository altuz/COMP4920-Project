The 3rd person gameplay element is a nice change up in the series considering most of them are rts's or board game like releases. Combat feels fluent and smooth, story is interesting and voice acting is is on par. It does take quite a bit of time for the enemys to vary but apart from that it's a great game."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504803562, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "34798326", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198065348856", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1503520907, "num_games_owned": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 266}, "timestamp_updated": 1504803562, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Tehre is noh time to beh lohst!\n\n\nBatul Brothas!\n\n\nSpehss Mahrens, todeh the enemeh is at oua doar!
