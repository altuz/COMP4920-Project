This game has so much potential. Its ship builder is incredible and it's paired with a cool system for research. These 2 systems complement eachother well and are fun to use. My problem with the game(and the reason I refunded it) is that it got stale in my 2 hours of playing it! There are 2 enemy types(4 if you count the tiny supply and fighter ships) and all of my battles played out the same:\n1. Get into range on queen so she sends out fighters.\n2. Destroy fighters and suply ships.\n3. Destroy queen.\nAfter awhile the downtime between battles and the lack off any variety sucked all the fun out of the game. If you want a ship builder to make your dream ship in and test it out in a simplistic playground then Navalia is for you. If you want a simple yet fun conquer the galaxy game then you should probably look elsewhere.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198108935358", "last_played": 1502035381, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 175, "playtime_forever": 124}, "votes_up": 4, "timestamp_created": 1502212134, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511373", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502212134, "recommendationid": "34107800", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
