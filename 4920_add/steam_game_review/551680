The birthday does not happen to be good; in fact, it's quite the opposite! Yes, this birthday is bad.  For example, a typical \"good\" birthday would not cause you to somehow die from opening a door.  Or cause you to fall through solid earth into an abhorrently dark cavern full of water, bat noises, and stretched out textures.  While I have only played 0.3 hours so far, and gotten to the part of the game where elderly men show me their teeth until I die, I can confidently proclaim this game lives up to its name, and if you come into this experience expecting a good birthday... boy howdy will you find yourself sorely mistaken!\n\nAlso I've found that doing a lot of drugs before playing this helps", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027445739", "last_played": 1493940535, "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 197, "playtime_forever": 40}, "votes_up": 29, "timestamp_created": 1479414056, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539952", "votes_down": 14, "timestamp_updated": 1479414056, "recommendationid": "26650301", "votes_funny": 19, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I haven't had a chance to finish Bad Birthday yet, but so far I'm loving it.
