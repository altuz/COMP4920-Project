First-things-first, as we write this review, this title is in early access.  It's not perfect.  There are bugs (and not just the extra-terrestrial insects that seek to blow your head off in-game).  Sometimes it freezes, sometimes it crashes.  Sometimes the enemy AI makes them just stand there and stare at you as you shower death from every corner of the periodic table of elements into their buggy little face(s).\n\nHaving said all that, it's still awesome.  When it works (and most of the time, it does) it works really well.  Gun handling, while not entirely realistic - and why would it be - is super fun and satisfying (try a pair of upgraded pistols; imagine the reanimated head of John Woo directing a reboot of \"Starship Troopers\" set 600 years in the future).\n\nSo far, the community of Gunheart players is a good one.  Everyone we've met playing in early access really seems to want to help the game succeed.  Haven't come across too many Negative Nellies to date.  There is a lot of emphasis on teammates helping teammates; it's downright tough to clear some of these levels on your own.\n\nJust a couple things we'd like to see:\n\n- More levels!!! (duh)\n- More physics-based, damage-specific enemy deaths. When I shoot a bug in the face with the sniper rifle, I'd like to see it die a noticeably different death than when I shred its wicked little carapace with the chaingun.  Ditto the shotgun, bow, mines, rockets, etc.  Some good-natured dismemberment would be nice... just sayin'. Currently, the animations can seem a bit... canned... at times.\n- This may border on greed, but... I'll just say it: more weaponry!  There is a nice little arsenal to start with, but we want more!  MORE!!!\n- Various bug fixes, which the devs are already all over, no doubt.\n\nFingers-crossed that these things are on the way.\n\nReally impressed so far with most aspects of the enemy AI, when it is working (which, again, is the vast majority of the time).  They seek cover fairly realistically, try to flank you, snipe you, frag you, etc.  It generally feels like you are in a realistic firefight (to the extent that 6 foot tall insectoids carrying laser rifles can impart realism). \n\nBottom line:  This game is fun to play, and makes you want to keep playing it.  It's already nicely polished, and has gotten even better with the handful of updates so far.  We come back to Gunheart several times  a week and are really looking forward to seeing what comes next.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 105, "steamid": "76561198309611655", "last_played": 1506586642, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 218, "playtime_forever": 1816}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505669118, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505669118, "recommendationid": "35028903", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "For now this game is my favorite VR game who keep me back on it.
