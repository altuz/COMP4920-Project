What this game holds over the Gallery is the fun boss battles, which test physicality and reactiveness as imagined in any VR game to date. It's a treat to try, and may take a good handful of hints from your buzzingly-annoying robot friend, but it is very worthwhile to play this game from start to finish, just to experience what it has to offer in this new generation of gaming. Be ready to use not just your brain, but also your body to duck, dodge and attack your enemies in this immersive experience that will, at the end, leave you hungering for more. I would compare this game to The Gallery: Call of the Starseed, but with more action and less direction.\n\n8 / 10", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983271114", "last_played": 1481977449, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 181, "playtime_forever": 131}, "votes_up": 17, "timestamp_created": 1481977872, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527335", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1481977872, "recommendationid": "28424096", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I was unfortunately unimpressed by this game. Playing through is more of a fetch-quest than puzzle-solving, and routes to progression were very unclear at times. I had to continually rely on hints to find out what objects were useable or reactive. Playable area is fixed, and there is no freedom to move about the game environment, which was infuriating at times. Some segments of the game involve placing an object into a distant receptacle, which could easily be accomplished with the ability to approach the receptacle. Instead, you are forced to play virtual ski-ball for five minutes, and no margin of error is given. Thank merciful cthulhu I live alone and no one was able to witness the spectacle of a grown man flinging his arms about in his living room while cursing the programmers of this game. The story itself is paper-thin and not immersive, which is compounded by the short nature of the game. Playthrough can be completed in 90-100 minutes. Game experience is not commensurate with a price of $25.

This can be a bit difficult for people who are more interested in solving puzzles so keep that in mind if you pick up this title. There\u2019s also a mine cart scene which may be troublesome for those who experience VR vertigo.\n\nOne issue I had with this game was that occasionally some important items were in nonsensical locations and/or would plop onto the ground getting lost in some grass. Since the game\u2019s movement is waypoint based and not free-roaming, this means you might knock some items out of view. Thankfully your floating robot companion can fetch them via the hint system but I feel like maybe if the items glowed or twinkled I would have been able to find them on my own.\n\nUnearthed Inc is not a very long game (about 2.5-4 hours) but the experience you get in that short time period is equal to that of other high-tier VR titles such as The Lab. I would recommend this game to people who want a puzzle game with a bit of action and those looking to demo VR gaming to friends or family.\n", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197967229781", "last_played": 1484893056, "num_reviews": 272, "num_games_owned": 425, "playtime_forever": 189}, "votes_up": 7, "timestamp_created": 1484894352, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516360", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1484894352, "recommendationid": "29370348", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Honestly, this is one of the best VR games I have played yet. To me, it is right there along with \"The Gallery\" and \"Vanishing Realms\". In saying that, I normally don't write reviews, but I felt like I had to with this one. The game is challenging, fun, and is extremely immersive. I really like the game mechanincs and it ran very smooth, even on High detail. (I have an AMD 8350 w/ a Nvidia GeForce 980 TI) Along with that, unlike most others it seems, I really enjoyed the \"Minecart\" gameplay. I know, I know, a lot of people get VR sick from this kind of motion, but since I've been playing VR for so long, I don't get sick like that anymore and it makes experiences like the Minecart ride enjoyable! I can truly say that there were a few times where I actually almost lost my real world balance because of how real the ride felt. Now, this may sound bad, but personally it was really cool because I felt so immersed in the game.

There are things you can do. You pick things up, stuff them into other things and more things happen. Yay, puzzles! Just don't expect the things to make any sense. Part of an emblem need to open a cupboard (Resident Evil much?) is hidden inside a coconut. Why? How did it get there? If you don't mind randomly doing stuff without any more reason that \"I can do it and I am not done until I have exhausted all combinations\" these are your kind of puzzles.\n\nCombat. Pick up rock. Telekinetic-shoot rock at spider. Get randomly hit by spider. Repeat. Yay, combat! \n\nSidekick. At least now Navi (the \"Listen!\" Fairy from Ocarina of Time) isnt the most useless and obnoxious sidekick in the history of gaming anymore, thanks for that. A few stupid oneliners that get repeated over and over (and this is after the \"shut that stupid droid up\" patch) and no assistance worth mentioning. True, it occasionally points you to a interactable item that you missed in your pixelhunt but that is just a crutch for what is a horrible mechanic in the first place.\n\nEven with all its its faults I would have muddled through, since there isnt much in the way of alternatives.

A very simple puzzle that lasts damn hours because you keep accidentily hitting panels you already rotated correctly.  It's almost impossible to throw right if you can't feel the logs weight.
