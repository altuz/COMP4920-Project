One location, pistols only, 4 zombie types and complete waves until your health is depleted. Based on the cheap price it's acceptable, the graphics are decent enough and solid enough gunplay. If it was priced higher I'd say don't bother and spend the extra and go with Arizona Sunrise or Brookhaven.\n\nIs this a great game, no, but neither is it terrible either.

Why? Developers need to look at games that already came out the last several months and not simply copy or use the same ideas as other wave shooters. This game is in no way innovative and it is not \"more fun\" than any of the other ones. You are on the same level shooting the same zombies wave after wave. The progression is kind and that is the only thing I do like about it. The assets used are not original ones so it is like deja vu. If you want something that is more fun than this I would say Smell of Death for a more adventure shooter experience (free roam) and definately Containment Initiative if you want a thoughtful wave shooter with gun upgrades and maps to choose. My conscience can not recommend this game but if you just have to have every VR game out the price is cheap but you will get what you pay for. Sorry developers but if you had something new and different to add to the wave shooter VR experience I would have surely thumbed you up. I won't refund this game though just in case you do add something worthy. New game modes? A campaign? A change of maps each wave? Original enemies? Free roaming through a city,suburbs and/or subway? I will change my review if the devs innovate and make this much much better than it is now with new ideas and not just a repeat of others ..... \n\nHere is a video to watch below:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DSsQYo44LMQ", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197974765747", "last_played": 1480453174, "num_reviews": 221, "num_games_owned": 477, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 8, "timestamp_created": 1480455162, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469360", "votes_down": 20, "timestamp_updated": 1480455162, "recommendationid": "28084179", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}]}
