I'm a big fan of sneaky gameplay, but one of the things that I personally find annoying in most games with a stealth mechanic is that, unless you're perfect at it from the get-go, the gameplay loop often becomes incredibly repetitive; either it's \"sneak until you get caught, fail mission, go back to checkpoint, repeat\" or \"sneak until you get caught, mumble expletive, hit quickload, repeat\" or \"sneak until you get caught, say 'oh screw it', murder everyone in the area until the game says you're hidden again, repeat\". In this game, though, every time you hit a blackout/reboot, the \"echoes\" forget about you, at least until the see you again. So, instead of repeating the same section over and over again, you can continue toward your objective even as you get caught, evade capture or fight off the enemy, and the blackout period just before the reboot gives you an excuse to break stealth and go hog wild for a few seconds without devolving the entire section of the game into a murderfest.\n\nBut, the reboot also does something else: it teaches all of the \"echoes\" how to do all of the things you did in the pre-blackout part of the previous loop. So, if you opened a door, they can open doors. If you sprinted, they can sprint. If you fired your weapon, they gain weapons to fire at you. This encourages you to consider which actions you want to take, knowing that you'll have to deal with them aimed right back at you (\"I have to collect two keys in this room, but because I snuck to the first one and grabbed it before the blackout hit, the echoes learned not just how to sneak but also how to grab keys, and now my mission objective is in the pocket of a sneaking, angry-looking murder-clone.\"), and also to switch up your tactics frequently, using all of the game's systems instead of just sticking with one or two. (\"OK, they have guns this cycle, but at least they can't sprint, and they can follow me through doors and across water but not over railings, so I can dive off the balcony if I get caught.\")\n\nThe mechanic is certainly the most unique thing about the game, but the rest of the game is no less interesting. The art style is a compelling juxtoposition of baroque architecture and sci-fi advanced technology, the in-game-universe UI is minimalist and inobtrusive but conveys a lot of information both cleanly and clearly, the story and game universe feel very much like something Iain Banks or Alastair Reynolds could have written, very \"hard sci-fi but with highly advanced technology\", and the writing says just enough to imply a rich background while leaving gaps for the imagination to fill in.\n\nI'm only probably an hour and a half into the game at this point, so I can't speak to the length, but already it's one of the more compelling game experiences I've had this year.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197968676667", "last_played": 1505883670, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 707, "playtime_forever": 140}, "votes_up": 147, "timestamp_created": 1505887358, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686261", "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_updated": 1505887884, "recommendationid": "35078400", "votes_funny": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "\"Haha, you cant walk in water!\"\n*Round reset*\n[b]*Walks in water*[/b]\n\"sh!t, sh!t, Sh!t, SH!T,[b] SHIIIT[/b]\"\n\n\nThe game started a bit slow by telling some backstory and getting used to the movement but is in full speed in the first hour. I didn't know what I was getting my self into when I bought this but neither did I think it would be so challenging.

It learns from them but in the same it forgets the previous things it learned after a reset. I just glad that it does because in other case you would make it just too smart in just a few rounds. The AI will always beat you unless you think about your actions and stamina/energy managment.\n   If you like to beat yourself and try to be tactial, this is a game for you.

I paid $20 and finished it in 8 hours, whilst actually exploring most of it. By the time I finished, I was pretty glad it was over though and do not see myself replaying it, mostly as it is too repetitive/lacking in depth.  \n\nHere's the pros and cons without spoiling too much:\n\n+It is pretty amazing to first piece together the enemy \"learning\" mechanic in the stealth/action segments.\n-After you figured it out, that sadly is all the game has to offer and very little is done to vary up the experience\n-There are 2.5 types of enemy in the game.

They also respawn indefinitely.\n\n+The story ties into the gameplay, although most of the development occurs inbetween stealth/action segments.\n-It's not really a story that stands out in its genre. No major twists or surprises and the pace was too slow to really grip me personally.\n\n+Vast levels with interesting lighting effects make for some nice views.\n-The vastness caused me to sprint whenever I could, because although large the levels were mostly empty (apart from pretty worthless collectibles) and very similar in design. Smaller levels with a more interesting layout or just more variety would have been more fun to explore. \n\n+Very pretty artwork and surfaces. \n-Many assets were reused and repainted and ultimately contributed to the levels feeling like empty copy-paste jobs.\n\n+Music/sound was generally appropriate, at times unsettling, but that is fitting for a slightly creepy sci-fi game.\n\nOn the whole ECHO is decent, but I feel like the developers could have made it a lot better if they'd set their priorities on the gameplay and level design, instead of just building massive levels without thinking how much fun it would be to traverse them. I'd also say these issues really only become apparent 2+ hours in.

The copies, or echoes, learn from your actions. Going guns blazing isn't a viable strategy in the long run because of limited ammunition, enemies that respawn, and worst of all, because the enemies will become trigger happy aimbots. Let me preface this review by admitting that I don't really play many stealth games and Echo is essentially a stealth/puzzle game. That being said, I quite enjoyed the experience and would give it a 7/10.\n\nPros:\n+ Visuals: Clearly the visuals were inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey, especially early on in the \"white\" levels. Some of the levels really took my breath away despite the redundancy of the palace. I especially like the details on the character art. The glitched echoes and the \"black light\" effect from shining your flashlight on them in the dark phases are nice touches.\n+ Unique gameplay: I found the strategic element of gameplay very well thought out and unlike anything I've played before. The light/dark cycles where echoes learn/unlearn your actions leads to some tense moments as well as allowing the player to devise strategies for solving the puzzles. What the levels lack in overall variety these smaller \"moments\" of strategy are where the game really shines. Also, being able to cut loose with the gun during the dark phases is pretty cathartic after sneaking around for a while. \n+ Voice acting and Audio: Nearly all of the story is conveyed through interaction between the voiced protagonist (Rose Leslie) and her AI partner (Nick Boulton). Both actors did a fantastic job, as one might expect given their reputations. Without these exchanges, the game would have been far less intriguing. I only wish there was more dialogue during the actual levels rather than being constrained to the interstitial zones. The music and sfx are very well done, but there isn't much variety.\n+ Story: Echo gets points for being an original Science Fiction story that doesn't really fit the mould of any other modern games. This was the first game in a while that I felt compelled to see to it's end, and I think the story did have something to do with that. Although a lot of questions remain unanswered, it adds to the intrigue surrounding En, her quest, and her motivations. Despite all of this, I did feel a little nonplussed by the conclusion.\n+ Collectibles: Oh yeah, the game also has collectibles and unlocks as well.\n\nCons:\n- Reduntant level goals: Basically, you will either have to collect keys to open a door, collect glowing blue energy balls to unlock an elevator, or sneak your way to an escape route. Occasionally you venture into \"safe\" spots where most of the narration takes place, but even these get fairly repetitive since they are essentially just linear paths to follow. Only two puzzles really stood out for me, which both occur near the middle/late game.\n- Redundant Visuals: Get used to seeing lots of gilded palace in all shades of the rainbow. There were also a few bugs (misplaced 3d assets) early on that I found amusing.\n- Patrols: all of the enemies follow patrol paths unless they see the player. There is a little variety depending on how well they can traverse the palace (e.g. opening doors or vaulting changes their patrol routes slightly to incorporate those features). Eventually, once you figure out the limitations of the AI, the difficulty of the game drops significantly and you can abuse their patrols (personal favorite was walking directly behind one enemy throughout their entire route).\n- Chokeholds FTW: Seeing the same animation for choking the echoes really got old after the 500th time. I kinda wish there was a bit of variety in the animations. Also, some of the animations feel like they have been slowed down significantly and look \"floaty\" (the jogging animation comes to mind).\n- I am a Golden God: You will know when you get to that point of the game, but I felt that they made the game easier rather than more difficult. In fact, as a whole, the game peaks in difficulty at the midpoint. Furthermore, I found it unfortunate that the final levels encouraged (or required) gunplay despite how the rest of the game was structured around stealth.\n-Reverb (or lack thereof): despite its name, there is a conspicuous lack of audible echoes in the game despite some fairly appropriate conditions. I think they could have done a bit better job with the sound-space design, but that's really just nitpicking.\n\nOverall worth the money and time despite its flaws. If they trimmed down a few levels to reduce the redundancy and increased/included some randomized patrols to increase difficulty the game would be improved vastly.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 361, "steamid": "76561197986654645", "last_played": 1506203452, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 240, "playtime_forever": 808}, "votes_up": 31, "timestamp_created": 1506042827, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557482", "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_updated": 1506121378, "recommendationid": "35117435", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I ended up refunding this game because it wasn't really my type of game.

My current playthrough ends at around chapter 3 because I was getting frustrated waiting for the darkness in order to do anything without being copied by the AI in the next reboot. Again, in a stealth sense this game is a masterpiece. The AI learns from your pattern of play and adapts to it later. I find this to be absolutely stunning and scary. One time during my playthrough I shot a ton of AI and also hung around \"energy\" dispencing spots. By the next reboot the AI were spamming shots at me whilst camping the energy dispesing spots, absolutely fucking my strategy right up the ass. The visuals for this game are also stunning.

It's not a traditional puzzle game in the sense that you need to actually solve puzzles but more of what to do and when to do it. Everything you do is replicated (very nicely I might add) by the A.I.

The first hour of the game just sets up the atmosphere which I really appreciate. If you enjoy an immersive experience Echo definitely has a good sense of pace and storytelling. I got to say that it managed to create a very interesting female character ( that is not over the top stereotypical badass ) So far I have encountered few technical issues but nothing too serious. I think the \"Adaptive Enemy\" concept works very well although the stealth gameplay is rather weak. I could nitpick the game all day but I am very much intrigued by unique elements  and honestly just really enjoying it.\n\n[h1] Technical Issues/Optimization  [/h1]\n\nConsidering that I am slightly below recommended requirements the game runs really well (it looks like not everyone is so lucky). I was having some significant audio problems the first few sections but they disappeared deeper into the game. Also some of the cutscenes are not working for me. Resolution options are limited (do some research if you looking for specific ratio) I would not be surprised if you run into some other problems. For my system optimization is sufficient although it feels like it needs more work.\n\n[h1] Adaptive Enemy [/h1]\n\nSo if you watched the trailer the game has enemies that learn from what you do. Actually, that part of the game is done well and seems to work as advertised. Basically, the game switches lights on and off while enemies copy your moves when not in the dark. (whatever you do, do not let them copy your run XD) These mechanics add a cool depth to puzzles. For example, your clones cannot cross water unless you did it in the light. Luckily for us, clone's skills reset after every big section so you do not have to crawl entire game.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nThe game encourages you to be stealthy and that aspect of the game is somewhat limited. You will unlock different mechanics overtime like a sprint, gun, AOE stun and some environmental benefits. Although because there are so many clones it seems you have to use force sometimes ( which is an enjoyable decision making ) This isn't Metal Gear so if you looking for some great stealth gameplay I would not recommend it. For me, the game shines in \"risk vs reward\" aspect. Is killing this enemy or running now worth it in a long run? ( unless you are about to die you probably want to avoid that )\n\n[h1] Narrative/Story [/h1]\n\nI will briefly touch on this since I have not beaten the game and don't want to rush through it. The is a good chemistry between our 2 characters and dialogue is very good.I would even go as far as saying that this game has one of best female protagonists. As much as I love my zombie shooting ladies they don't have that emotional tone I wanted to see.   Whoever is the voice actor for our main character did a really good job. She really brought the life into the model.\n\n[h1] Aesthetic/Level Design [/h1]\n\nI get very weird vibes of Cube (movie) It is a pretty claustrophobic game and I love that concept of someone being inside the giagentic trap. Your character is inside this planet size castle where you feel this unimaginable scale of the labyrinth. Aside from being a cool idea, there are a lot of eye candy moments. Apparently, there is virtually no face animation ( you can't even turn well to see it XD) Which did not bother me personally. Even if you nitpick certain things you can't deny that it has some cool levels and creepy themes. I only speak for myself but I am loving the atmosphere, music and visual immersion of Echo.\n\n[b] Initial Impression [/b]\n\nI think Echo has a good balance between action, aesthetics, and story which is more than I can say for 99% of these games. Invidivudal parts of the gameplay (like stealth) are not impressive but the adaptive enemies create a different kind of puzzle gameplay. Definitely a good game but your experience will likely depend on individual system problems. Overall I am enjoying the game enough to forgive some hiccups.

Whatever you do the Echoes do, and as such the game can change depending on how you want to play it. The depth of this system is pretty crazy- I shouted a lot to gain the attention of the Echoes, and in the next loop they would shout if they say me to get the attention of others. I shot at them in one loop, only for them to whip out guns of their own. I later found out that they get better at aiming the more you shoot, which meant that you could shoot to get out of nasty situations at the cost of potentially making the new loop harder to navigate. The levels are absolutely huge as well, with several nooks and crannies to stealth your way through. Unfortunately, this level design can lead to some tedium, as traversing these huge levels takes time and feels like padding. Speaking of padding, the first hour is a completely unremorseful exposition dump that has little to no interesting gameplay and is a glorified walking sim. It's boring, tedious, and i'll skip it on repeat playthroughs. In general the game has a tough time with it's story. While it is interesting (and the performances of En and London are very well done), the game cannot marry the two in a satisfactory way. You're either stealthing or listening to story, never both, which makes the game pretty tedious to play on repeat playthroughs. The gameplay does have some flaws though: moving En is a little stiff at times, and the rather limited amount of stuff you can do (crouch, sprint, shout, shoot your gun, vault over tables, sneak attack etc.) means that Echoes can only learn so much. Though the blackouts in which your actions are uploaded to the Echoes allow you to cut loose and do whatever you like, which is pretty cathartic. \n\nThe story itself, as I said, is interesting, but the complete lack of exposition can leave some players lost. You have to be paying attention to not only what is going on right in front of you, but also the themes of the story itself, which can be difficult for some people who are not used to the topics this game discusses, such as gene modification and the nature of challenges. The dialouge is also at fault, as while it is very well acted it is somewhat choppily put together, as though English is not the lead writers first language. It is understandable, just somewhat confusing at points. Also of note is the graphics, which are absolutely beautiful. The Palace you explore is ornately decorated, and the varied room layouts mean you're always seeing something new. The only mediocre part would be the animations, which range from okay to downright bad. \n\nECHO is very short (I finished it in just under five hours), though some people report anywhere from 7-8 hours, and I imagine getting all the collectibles of which there are many) would add on about three or more hours of gameplay. 11 or so hours for 20 bucks ain't that bad.\n\nOverall, ECHO is a unique stealth game that manages to stay fun despite having a limited gameplay hook, and I eagerly await ULTRA ULTRA's next game.\n\nECHO receives a 7/10.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 186, "steamid": "76561198081043975", "last_played": 1506134969, "num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 276, "playtime_forever": 277}, "votes_up": 16, "timestamp_created": 1506275392, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531275", "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_updated": 1506275392, "recommendationid": "35186990", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Having completed this game over the course of a dedicated \"get rekt\" session, I fully endorse this game.

It places this constant stress as you try to figure how to deal with a situation without becoming repeativive so the game doesn't use your tactics against you. And from what I've seen so far, you will NOT be able to just shoot your way through this game, as use of your gun is extremely limited, and killing enemies is only temporary. There is a blackout mechanic which I won't delve storywise into, but it happens frequently enough at the current point of the game that I'm at, where after a black out, every eliminated enemy respawns. All that being said, I enjoy the challenge it has given so far and the lore, which I won't go into, is mysterious enough that I'm willing to stress myself out more to find out what is happening.

Where I am in the game, there are only three ways to kill an Echo until the next reboot cycle: sneak up from behind and choke them out (only possible on an isolated echo, often results in detection), bash their head in with a crystal orb (crystal orbs must be found in the environment, picked up, and are destroyed upon use - they're also quite finnicky and I can't tell you how many times I've thrown one instead of bashing with it), or pull out your gun and shoot (ammunition is /extremely/ limited, and firing more than a couple of times in one cycle will teach the echoes to shoot back in the next).  There is a shove which can be used to knock enemies onto their backs, and a secondary fire for the pistol that knocks over a bunch of enemies at once, but the former only slows them down by a couple of seconds, and the latter has a range that's so short that it's basically useless.\n\nI love this game to death but I'm legitimately confused about how I'm supposed to play it.  The stealth toolkit is too limited to stealth properly, the gun is only safe to use during blackouts, and despite my best efforts, more often than not, by the time the blackout rolls around I'm sprinting desperately away from Echoes with my very limited stamina, praying that the reboot hits before they catch me.  Is this intentional?  Were reboot cycles meticulously timed to occur shortly after the average player loses track of one of the many enemies and gets spotted?  Are you supposed to be in an endless cycle of attempting stealth, screwing up, running for your life, catching your breath, and starting over?  Whether or not this is the case, I feel like I'm doing something wrong.\n\nThis might seem like a lot of criticism, but I do really very much like this game, more than enough to recommend it - it's so damn original that it deserves it.  I just hope that the devs either expand the player's toolkit, possibly adding executions from cover or some way to execute enemies that have been knocked down, or reduce enemy density.\n\nEdit: Good lord I need this game's soundtrack.\n\nAdditional edit: Having now completed the game, I think I can summarize my problems with it like this: if you are detected (and you will be detected given the number of hostiles), you lose your best weapon against them - the choke-out move.  You're left with two options: either shoot them, thus teaching them to shoot back in the next cycle, or run like hell and pray for the next blackout.  If you had a way to kill Echoes that had already spotted you without putting yourself at a massive disadvantage, I think I would enjoy the actual gameplay a lot more.
