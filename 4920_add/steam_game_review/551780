The 'theory lessons' are glorified youtube videos, incredibly boring, and occasionally unintelligible from the audio bugging out. If you're desperate to hear \"Magic Leone\"'s lessons then go to his actual youtube channel. \n\nBut, you might be thinking, surely the practice sessions give this game a good reason to be in VR? Not so. Half of them don't even have an element of interactivity. The lesson on self-deprecating humour, for example, prompts you to make a joke at a hologram girl. It doesn't matter if you say nothing at all, insult her- whatever you want, the game isn't taking any input, and the girl will laugh at your hilarious joke as soon as you indicate that you are finished.\nThe practices that do have interactivity are hardly any better, and verge on creepy. Anyone can see through these half-baked 'scenarios' and I fail to see how such obvious hollowness lets anyone build self-confidence.\n\nTo be clear, I bought this game as a joke intending to laugh at some terrible r/theredpill mentality, but I was disappointed even in that as the game has next to no content, no care for quality, and certainly nothing of value to teach. Fortunately it took less than two hours to arrive at that conclusion, so I'll be refunding the game and sincerely hope that Cerevrum follow other avenues in future. \nPlease, please, even if you subscribe to pick-up artist techniques, don't waste your money here.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004365264", "last_played": 1486468040, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 338, "playtime_forever": 72}, "votes_up": 28, "timestamp_created": 1486479616, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501438", "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_updated": 1486479616, "recommendationid": "29763033", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "18", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game absolutely changed my dating life and brought it to a whole new level. \n\nPrior to purchasing this title, I was a basement dwelling virgin with a facination for my pet spiders that I kept next to my bed. I was also addicted to spending hours on horsehub.com, because I frankly was unable to talk to women.\n\nAfter spending an hour with this game, I felt a surge of confidence rush through me. That same night, after showering and and throwing on some fresh new clothes, I went out to the local bar. This is when I met Janelle. \n\nI found Janelle sitting by herself at the bar. I approached her and touched her hair and said, \"Hi, my name is Mike.\" That's when I proceeded to explain to her how I wanted her to ride on my yacht. That same night, I brought her to my mother's house and had her bang the crap out of me. That's right, it turns out she was actually a dude, and I was actually fine with that. \n\nThank you Magic for helping me come out of the closet.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972692780", "last_played": 1484538396, "num_reviews": 45, "num_games_owned": 1234, "playtime_forever": 42}, "votes_up": 64, "timestamp_created": 1484538752, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547195", "votes_down": 32, "timestamp_updated": 1484588960, "recommendationid": "29288827", "votes_funny": 130, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Made a video for this \"Game/Experience\" so that you don't have to buy it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJXD6jHhsEI\n\nStay Rad Everybody!\n/RadiCarl", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198072349096", "last_played": 1484407252, "num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 205, "playtime_forever": 31}, "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_created": 1484515891, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506520", "votes_down": 19, "timestamp_updated": 1484515891, "recommendationid": "29283763", "votes_funny": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "4 out 5 from me.
