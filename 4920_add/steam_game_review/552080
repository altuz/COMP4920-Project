It looks pretty good, though a bit cramped even for a sub, and lacking in AI crew.\n\nHowever, it still needs work to match the current standards in sub sims:\n\n1. Periscope should show relative bearing, not just magnetic bearing.\n\n2. We need binoculars.  Modt night attacks were conducted from the conning tower using binoculars.\n\n3.  The sub needs a proper plotting table, to be able to mark the course of any moving objects.\n\n4.  We need a deck gun.  Many merchantmen were sunk by gunnery from submarines.\n\n5.  Torpedoes weren't instant kill weapons unless a warship's magazine blew up.  It took time to sink a ship, sometimes hours.  The way these ships sink is too arcadey.\n\n6. We need decoys and to be able to launch oil and debris to throw off persistent escorts.\n\n7. Pattern running torpedoes and sound-seeking torpedos, as well as sstraight-running steam and electric torpedoes.\n\n8. Torpedo depth settings and magnetic influence detonators so we have the choice of direct impact or a detonation beneath the keel", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198407770160", "last_played": 1505494324, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_forever": 73}, "votes_up": 6, "timestamp_created": 1505498429, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515106", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505498429, "recommendationid": "34977897", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Game is awesome, I love the hands on loading of torpedos.
