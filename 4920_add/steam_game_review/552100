I've avoided the vehicle editor because of some funky mouse detection, but just with workshop vehicles and the handful of maps I've already dumped hours into this game.   A get vague spintires vibes off the big trucks, so definitely part of the draw for me are the big vehicles and physics gameplay...\n\nMy recommendation isn't because I think the game is going to blow people away or that it's a must buy...  My recommendation is coming because I saw the official lego game that was pitched as digital legos... like everyone has been waiting for... and it was crap.\n\nProbably around 30 minutes into playing around in the sandbox in this game I said to myself \"Wow, this is everything the lego game wasn't....\"  If you like legos not because of the IPs they work with or the colorful shallow cartoony kids game versions, but because they are fun to build with and then drive your creations around while saying \"VROOOOM! VROOM!\"  and then crashing them together in a big shower of bricks, this game is for you.  If you like holding down the throttle on a high speed train until the forces are too strong and the wheels blast off and it derails, this game is for you.  \n\nIf you drive your first car into a rock and total the front end and you don't just respawn it but instead hop in a tow truck and have an undeniable urge to tow it all the way back to the garage before you despawn it, this game is for you.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 325, "steamid": "76561197975295638", "last_played": 1506967127, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 196, "playtime_forever": 984}, "votes_up": 10, "timestamp_created": 1505675429, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508552", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1505675500, "recommendationid": "35031019", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So..

So, whats exactly wrong with this game?\n\n1. The controls. The controls for cars and trains are fine, nothing spectacular but its your generic wasd. But it tanks, planes, and helicopters that have horrible controls. With tanks you can only control the hull, or the turret. Not both at once. And if you switch to the turret contols while moving, instead of the tank slowly coming to a stop it keeps going and going. Also if you control the turret in 3rd person the camera doesnt follow it, but more on that later. Planes: The center of gravity on planes and helicopters seems to be where the drivers seat is, making flying these things really wonky. When you enter 3rd person the camera doesnt follow the plane, so you constantly have to switch tetween flying and moving the camera if you want to see where your going. I would recommend that the game controls somewhat like War Thunder, because thats tanks and planes done right.\n\n2. Strength of vehicles. Everything is so fragile in the game. Lets say your driving through a city in a tank, and your gun barrel accadentally taps the side of a building, well it just falls straight off your tank. Wheels constantly come off while going over rough terrain, and landing planes and choppers is hopeless, you lightly TAP the ground and the whole thing falls apart. There needs to be a way to strengthen vehicles.\n\n3. The vehicle creator. I havent messed much with this but from what i've seen, it f*cking sucks. Its way too dificult and poorly optimized, I get a constant 60 fps while playing, but in the editor i get 20 fps MAX. The controls are strange and feel uncomfortable, like all the controls in this game.\n\n4. Optimization. This point can be forgived because its an early access, but this game's optimization is pretty much non-existant.\n\nThats all I have to say for now, I know this game is an early access and this is alot to ask, but this feels like the BARE MINIMUM of what can even be considered a \"game\". I'll keep it for now to see where it goes, but for now dont buy this game, save your hard earned cash.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "steamid": "76561198274976134", "last_played": 1507154803, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 224}, "votes_up": 25, "timestamp_created": 1505527118, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526498", "votes_down": 20, "timestamp_updated": 1505527118, "recommendationid": "34985464", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": false}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Lego but for adults", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 107, "steamid": "76561198131839406", "last_played": 1506759345, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_forever": 1217}, "votes_up": 3, "timestamp_created": 1505798794, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505798794, "recommendationid": "35058415", "votes_funny": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "a promising game indeed", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198306434506", "last_played": 1504614032, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 13, "playtime_forever": 3183}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1504888036, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504888036, "recommendationid": "34818118", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is incredibly fun and you can do so much with it, Only thing I have against it is in the new update it crashes alot for me, Other than that 10/10 Reccomend it for someone who likes cars and lego destruction.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 3465, "steamid": "76561198145782063", "last_played": 1507188547, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 17963}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505048730, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505048730, "recommendationid": "34861508", "votes_funny": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Amazing game if you enjoy lego and destruction.", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004788906", "last_played": 1505114342, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 366, "playtime_forever": 2695}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1504940369, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504940369, "recommendationid": "34830744", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Its an amazing game and you should defintly check it out besides its little bugs its a fine ass game", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "steamid": "76561198095522135", "last_played": 1506687595, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_forever": 1191}, "votes_up": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505504280, "written_during_early_access": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501650", "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505504280, "recommendationid": "34979721", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "IMPORTANT:\nif you have friends who like to build stuff and then blow em up or even playing a little zombie mode, buy this, but please consider that they make sure they will buy it with you, because if you dont have any (like my case) you will get tired of it pretty quickly because you will not find this game funny for a long time.\nI know i have just played it for a while, but i can say a lot of things with the stuff i've seen so far.\nStarting with the controls:\nThere is no tutorial, which makes this a big issue for everyone because there's like 20+ buttons you must use to create or even drive a helicopter/plane or a car with something attached to it.\nGraphics:\nThey look pretty good pointing the fact that its a game made outta just lego, but not everything has to be, so they made some awesome textures with the terrain and items.\nSingleplayer & Multiplayer:\nYou can do pretty much whatever you want, but as some say you do need friends to get fun.
