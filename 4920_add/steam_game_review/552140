The fact that you have to play it on local networks means you only really play with friends. And friends are the people to play it with. This game is 100% guaranteed to make you and your friends have a great time as pitched battle erupts at a new pace. The grappling hook mechanic is really what sets it apart. I love flying across the map to deliver a crushing blow to my enemies. I don't know if I'm just crazy or this game is hilarious\nor a combination of both but whenever I play against mates I crack up. Maybe that is another thing good about this game. It is not serious. But I am serious about you getting this game. 11/10\nNeeds bots tho to practice alone", "received_for_free": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198272742794", "last_played": 1500428358, "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 43, "playtime_forever": 224}, "votes_up": 2, "timestamp_created": 1485578670, "written_during_early_access": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499113", "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_updated": 1495086703, "recommendationid": "29533916", "votes_funny": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The movement in this game is very interesting.
