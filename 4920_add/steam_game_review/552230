I was surprised when I found out you had to jump in the game, something that is super challenging and on the fringe of frustrating, however. \n\nBe prepared to get a work out with this one. There is lots of crouching, jumping and just moving around in general. The visuals are not all that impressive, as the lasers look more like red Liquorice than they do laser beams.\n\nI can still recommend the game as it is something different and the first of its kind (I am unaware of any other laser dodging game). One could argue for perhaps a cheaper price too, maybe $5-7.\n\nMy overviews: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GJ_StC0cjk", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484072805, "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198021655072"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502728", "timestamp_updated": 1481315250, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28276397", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1481315220, "votes_up": 3, "review": "Such a simple idea, but there is really some fun in this game.\n\n+ Simple idea\n+ Graphics are ok\n+ Nice exercise (not as exhausting as Holopoint)\n- Could have more levels, there is content for 2-4 hours\n\nThis is the first VR game I played where jumping is part of the game.
