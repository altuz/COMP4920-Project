Well look no further than this game. This game is insane, and I mean it. For (just one) example you can use a giant sexual toy as a weapon...yup, the definition of quality. The city of Steelport is full of countless hours of activities, collectibles, secrets, shops and buildings to buy, and so much more, and that's not even mentioning the amount of fun you can have in co-op.\n\nSeriously if you have a friend, tell them to get this game as well, co-op is much better than singleplayer and it just makes the whole experience even better with a partner to screw around with. The game is just as fine in singleplayer but co-op is the way to go. The main campaign is action-packed and full of memorable and great missions scattered throughout.\n\nBut this wouldn't be a review without discussing some of the game's flaws. For example if you compare this to the previous game Saint's Row 2 then this game is just terrible in comparison, SR2 has just much more content than this on it's own without DLCs to aid it. While there are a lot of awesome missions throughout the game the number of bad missions also are just as equal in size to the good ones, making you sometimes not want to progress through the main game. The city is actually pretty barren and deserted with almost no interactivity with the enivronment, which makes Stilwater in SR2 a lot better by comparison.\n\nThis game also has legitimately the WORST pop-in I have ever seen in any game to date, it's really REALLY BAD with the pop-in issues. You might think it might have something to do with my rig but I assure you my PC is well over the reccomended specs and I have everything turned up to the max settings and even then the pop-in is extremely noticable.\n\nThe game can also be very boring once you finish the main campaign, with the only thing left to do is try and find all the collectibles scattered throughout the city, destroy all the remaining gang operations, and complete the last activities. Even then the activities are not as good as they were in SR2 and have been extremely downgraded with almost everything else for that matter in comparison to 2.\n\nAlso what the hell is with all the DLCs for this game? Goddamn I'm sorry but it really is annoying to have to shovel out even more cash just for some extra costumes and such. Although if you do intend to get DLC for this game then I would reccomend Genkibowl VII for starters, it expands on the whole Professor Genki madness a whole lot. Also did I mention how adorable Genki is?\n\nEven with this game's flaws, you still love it for what it is and at the end of the day it is still worthy to stand on its own as an entry in the series. I prefer SR2 over this like many of you might but I still love this game for the amount of fun it provided."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505211166, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34898228", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198212490921", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1491189005, "num_games_owned": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 954}, "timestamp_updated": 1505211166, "received_for_free": true, "review": "The game really good, with many interesting ideas.

It sat in my games list for a long time before I even touched it. Then SRIV went on special (just as I was finishing with another game) so I bought it as well and then thought I should play SRTT first.\n\nI'm so glad I did.\n\nThis game is spectacular. I'm not a fan of FPS games generally and I've never played a GTA other than the first two which were top down, but from the moment I started this game I realised it wasn't taking itself seriously. When the game started in earnest, I came to appreciate the depth of the game, how it almost forced you to explore every nook and cranny of Steelport to find things and complete activities in conjunction with the primary storyline. It's a sandbox game primarily, even though the storyline is there to be completed as well.\n\nI love just driving around Steelport in a customised car, people watching (if you could call it that) and seeing how the sims react to you. Make no mistake; Volition have made a light hearted and fun game but they were very serious about their attention to detail. Dress in a modest outfit and passers by comment one way. Dress in something a little more risque, and they comment completely differently. Passers by even react according to the state of news reporting on the Saints as the story progresses. The customisation options are unbelievably intricate, from your char design, to clothing options, to car fit outs; it all adds up to an almost intimate reflection of who you want to be in this world.\n\nThe consequent immersion in the game is outstanding. Just listen to the radio; I'm not talking about the songs, but to the DJs and what they talk about and how they interact with other callers et al. Add to that the depth of the characters you interact with and you start to see a pattern. Sure, it's campy and even ludicrous in places, but that's the point. Just because the game doesn't take itself seriously does not mean it wasn't built seriously well. The writing is superb; the characters intriguing, even the day to day life of Steelportians has been modeled in a manner that takes into account every possible detail.\n\nI'm not an Xbox user, so I've never played the original and probably never will. SR2 from what I've read had some glitches because it was an Xbox port. I've now read about their plots, but I'm glad to have entered the series from SRTT as now that I've played SRIV, I've come to realise that this one is actually the better game. I know; that's a big call and many will disagree with me, but I've found the SRTT storyline a little more fun, and the environment a little more engaging.\n\n[Edited 2017-10-03]\nThe few negatives for me; unlike most games where you have multiple endings, SRTT doesn't consider the final mission complete until you've played through BOTH endings. This means that if you've only just played through the final mission (to credits) once, your homies will be unavailable to you (and so will phone enounters) until you play through to credits again, this time following the other ending. This is not mentioned anywhere in the game but I found it on an obscure forum entry which made all the difference to my enjoyment of the game post-story. Also, the game restores NPC traffic through the lockdown zones but doesn't lower the drawbridges at the end and I think that's actually a bug. I've actually written and posted a mod to fix that and get rid of the zombies if you're playing on a save that has finished all the story line missions to solve that.\n\nThe other thing that is a negative for me is that the homies should randomly appear in the cribs between missions. Once the storyline is complete, the only way to interact with them is to call them in during phone encounters, which is still great but it's not the same as it would be if there was a chance to hang with them outside of combat. Ideally, they would also be a source of additional non-storyline quests and missions, handing them out during some of the random appearances. This would give the game a far less linear feel.\n[/edit]\n\nUnlike many gamers, I don't get a lot of time to play games and I tend to play on casual because I'm not interested in hard corps weapons 'twitching' games. I just want to shoot a few things and drive around looking for trouble. SRTT allows me to do that and when you power up you're almost invulnerable which for many will suck I know, but for me it's perfect. I don't have to hack in a superweapon or something just to enjoy myself with some light gameplay.\n\nIf I was asked to describe this game in a word, I'd say FUN. It's a very well constructed game with high production and design values, superb writing and a flair for the outrageous. I deeply suspect it's the peak of the Saints' Row franchise (especially given what I've read of Agents of Mayhem) and what I've played so far of SRIV. The only thing missing is post story random encounters or activities which would be nice (even just recycling the old 'dial-up' missions after the story ends at random intervals) and I'd be playing this game forever.\n\n[Edited 2017-10-03]\nI'm now through SRIV and I'm now spending a lot of time in the original Steelport and plan to for a long time. Props to Volition for their effort on this one and if you want to build a new DLC to expand the post storyline random encounters,  I'd pay for it! This now seems unlikely given what's been stated online about job losses at Volition over Agents of Mayhem which is a deep shame. I'm not sure if a SR5 (or SR6 if you count Gat out of Hell as SR5) is still in the works but I'd be just as happy to have them take the SR3(ish) engine, add the Stilwater map in alongside Steelport and turn the whole thing into a re-imagining of Saints Row. Add a lot more non-storyline quests and the like and I think you'd have a perfect game.\n[/edit]"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506784870, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495094", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35342451", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048552956", "num_reviews": 38, "last_played": 1493315610, "num_games_owned": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 436}, "timestamp_updated": 1506811101, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Ever read a really crappy comic about over the top modern day gang wars?
