I say Yes.\n\nThere is no teleport it is locomotion, so just be aware and dont try move too crazily. If you move with the forward pad and use your head movement to guide you, you will prob do very well. I normally get motion sickness on a medium level and I played for an hour so I see no problems there. The graphics. It is pretty good, but don't expect AAA graphics at this stage, is that a bad thing, I say no. they enemy do have reasonable ragdoll effects ehen dying, but  dont expect arms and legs to go flying in pieces. The GOOD thing is that the enemy has pretty decent AI. They don't just stand there and shoot at you. they run, take cover, will try hide when shot at. I really liked this. nothing worse than just a static shooter with no challenging enemy. Cover system is pretty good also. Hide behind a pole or wall, hide in a tunnel. Pick up a shield to protect yourself instead of using dual guns. \n\nEndless mode I played to level 35 then I quit it, why, well it is what it says an endless wave shooter in that mode. It was good though, cover system like hover junkers, you can repair the wall, upgrade your ammo and shields and stats with cash earned from the waves. Different strength of enemy through the waves. It is pretty good. the only thing I found weird is I could put my hands through the shield and shoot the enemy which is a bit unrealistic, you of course you can channenge yourself and not shoot that way and stay behind the cover. But the enemy will shoot the cover down anyway and you will be left out in the open. There is also target challange modes to break up the waves.\n\nStorey Mode. this is really good as the developer has incorperated some challenges for you so you dont just shoot, shoot shoot and get bored. The levels aer good and you have free roam to play as you wish to attack and defend in that level which I liked.\n\nI don't think therre is anything else atm that is like this with the above mentioned.\n\nWhat I would like to see.\nDifferent types of guns, maybe upgradable magazines. Probably a bit better polished enemy but I am fine with the existing ones if not. The wave shooter needes bosses or maybe after a certain wave you move locations might be an idea.\n\nOverall I say buy it, you can always refund it if your not happy, but I think you will be.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1490553814, "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197975312920"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500788", "timestamp_updated": 1490577361, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30763726", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_created": 1490577361, "votes_up": 3, "review": "It throws you right in it.  No time to waste before waves of enemies come at you.\nYes, another VR Wave Shooter.\nThis one however you aren't stuck in one spot.  You can actually move around and take cover.  I LOVE ducking IRL to hide.  It beats pressing R2 or ctrl like in every game in history.  The actual movement IRL going into a game is why I love VR.  I'm not pressing A or moving a mouse, I'm moving my head.  \n\nAnyways, is it worth 20$?  Maybe, if you want something new after playing all of your other games.  Which is the situation I found myself in.  I had it saved on my account so figured I'd use it.\nIf you don't like it, can always return.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
