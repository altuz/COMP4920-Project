And it shows. Forrest Keel uses a lot of the game's default assets, including tilesets and music, and used the built-in character creator for his characters. But enough about the assets, let's talk about the gameplay. The story is really shallow -- or at least, what little I've seen of it, since there's this chase scene literally two minutes into the game that is near-impossible to get past. Furthermore, there's a very limited range of view that makes the whole thing really tedious. It's like playing Mario Kart in near pitch-black with a steamroller on your tail. And the worst part is, they completely removed any way to close the game normally, forcing you to use ALT+F4. \n\nLong story short, don't buy this game, not for $0.99, not for 50 cents, not even for a single dime. It's a wonder how Anguished even got greenlit in the first place...\n\nEDIT: I just saw the trailer for this piece of garbage, and WOW. They used DEFAULT RTP MUSIC for the trailer.
