I have just killed a big boss and concluded the main game. I am about to start on 2 different DLCs of this game.\n\nNow after 40 hours of this game, I have seen a number of shortcomings and bugs, and will try to write about them in this update, so that I present an accurate picture of the game.\n\nShortcoming of this game.\n\n1. This game is an ABANDONWARE, like what many other  previous reviews have said. It was originally a Kickstarter game, where backers paid money directly to the developer to create this game and some DLCs. The developer got the money, created the game and 2 DLCs and left in February 2017. What this means is that currently there is no tech support of any kind, and there are many small bugs and irritating features which are not fixed. However, the game itself is still good enough to be played, and I have completed the main game. For the price of $6.99, I think it is definitely worth it for me.\n\n2. My biggest complain about this game is the high monster encounter rate. However since the developer is gone and there is no tech support, I just have to bear with it to play this game. \n\n3. There are also several game breaking bugs, like being trapped in a certain wall. However they can be avoided by reloading an earlier save and taking a different route for example. There are also minor glitches in several of the quest. However, I was able to finish the main game and all the quests after 40 hours of game play. I also read up on the forum about possible bugs and avoided them.\n\n4. This game is unpolished as there are various spelling errors and small glitches that will never be fixed since the developer got the money and left. Arrh. It's irritating.\n\nStrength of this game.\n\n1. Excellent story. The story is really excellent, but is a bit on the dark side. It is the story that keep me playing despite all the glitches and bugs. The story just drive me to play 1 more hour and 1 more hour. I just have to find out what happen next. Also there are many dark twists to the game and that create suspense as well. I love that.\n\n2. I love the combat mechanics, the various spells that have to be learn by discovery and not obtained automatically from leveling.\n\nOverall, I will give this game a 70%, and would still recommend this game despite the fact that the developer abandon the game. It is interesting enough for me to finish the game, and I will look forward to playing the 2 DLCs. I will give another update after I spend more time in this game.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis was my original review after 10 hours.\n\nI normally write reviews after I completely finished a game, or at least spend about 50 hours into the game.  However, this RPG Maker game is so much fun that I feel compelled to write about it after just 10 hours of gameplay. I am still really far from completing this game, but am impressed by the quality of the game to write about it comfortably.\n\nWhat is really fun about this game is the preponderance of quests. Furthermore, many of the quests are proactively thrust upon you, instead of you making efforts to find them. For instance, when you enter a zone, the barkeeper's daughter will come running to you to tell you that her father have some key information for you and you should go to the bar immediately. That will start a quest. Another example would be that your fellow team member would initiate a conversation with you saying that she needs to visit her parents and that will lead you to a series of events which trapped you, leading to another quests. This is a game that keeps you on your toe all the time. There is no need to grind or wait for things to do. In fact, from the 10 hours that I played, I am flooded with so much quests that I am always behind. In the time that I take to solve a quest, 4 or 5 other would have sprung out on their own. Talking about an immersive gaming atmosphere, WOW !!!\n\nThe storyline is a bit on the dark side. You are teleported to a fairy tale universe with strange twists instead. Many of the childhood fairy tales that you used to know are presented in this game with strange alternate interpretations. \n\nVisually, the graphics is stunningly beautiful and the gameworld is extremely detailed. I also like the samller (thinner) game font, and the high resolution display. The game also implement many useful features to make life easier. For example you can selectively chose which few quests you want to track and they will display key information on your game screen in the crispy small fonts. I also like the fact there there seems to be no upper limit to the number of quests that you can accept and keep open at any time. I will feel overwhelmed and pressured if I have to drop quests due to any kind of limitations. However, that does not happen in this game.\n\nAnother thing I love about this game is that your skills (called affinities in this game) are not automatically given to you when you level, like most other games.  Many of the skills, including spells that you can cast, are given to you as rewards for solving certain quests. This enable me to really appreciate each spell, and understand how difficult it was to acquire them.\n\nOne of the most fun things about old school rpg is called \"chest scumming\" and it is present in this game as well. When you come across a big chest, it will give you a key weapon or armor. The type of item in the chest is usually fixed, but that item will have variable statistic. For example a certain overcoat may increase your defence, agility and luck, but the actual increase is variable, and changes with each time you load the game. Normally, I would reload the game a few times until I feel satisfied with the item. As a completionist, this is something that I like and missed in many of the fast pace newer games.\n\nOverall, this particular game does bring back happy memories of the old school rpg that I played many years ago, like Wizardry and Ultima. However, what is nice is also the excellent graphics and useful tools (like quest tracking, etc) that comes with the old school game :)\n\nI highly recommend this game, and know that I will be spending many more \"10 hours\" in this game as well.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
