It deserves your support.[/h1]\n\nI'm fond of games that don't overreach, that pick a gameplay concept and refine it and offer a focused polished experience., and this is a good example. We especially need these in VR. Too many Vive games out there feel like rough drafts, or like \"my first dev\" experiments, or try to do too much.\n\nAnyway. In RUMA, you stand in a chamber with energy blobs appearing randomly around you, in red, green or blue. You have to feed them to a robot that stands there with you. Combine blobs of the same colour to make them grow and get more points when feeding. Don't let blobs of different colours touch, or they'll raise the radiation level in the room and eventually lead to game over.\n\nThe robot asks for a different colour every time. Don't feed it the wrong colour or it will spit it back out, leading to radiation. On medium and high difficulty, force fields and laser beams appear in the room as well, forcing you to work around them (and protect the blobs from the lasers, which also burn them into radiation).\n\nWith your controllers you can grab the orbs, slap them around, or force-pull and force-push them with the touchpad. With the game's floaty bouncy physics you can have a lot of fun and do trick shots.\n\nIn terms of physical demand, RUMA is a low-key workout. You'll spin a lot, crouch, lean, but nothing very intense. The gameplay is compelling enough to keep playing for a long time.\n\nI definitely recommend it. It's roomscale, with no need for locomotion. It plays well even in the smallest playspace. It's a good experience for VR demos as well, since the concepts are so simple. And it's polished and reasonably priced, which is something to support when it comes to VR games.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483376283, "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198011936841"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1485892586, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "29613058", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485892586, "votes_up": 0, "review": "Nice casual game making good use of the medium. You collect blobs of the three primary colors floating around you and pass them on to a robot. Blobs of the same color can be joined, yielding larger blobs that give more points, while blobs of different color bounce of each other and mutually reduce their size (and thus value). The robot's accepted color changes randomly. After getting a knack for reliably grabbing blobs (grabbing a bit too soon or a bit too late as it approaches, you repel it instead), increasing difficulty arises from larger numbers of blobs and a limit imposed if there are too many around.\n\nThe principle is simple and the gameplay casual, but it's still fun to play it now and again and a good demonstration of the immersion VR offers. Runs well on my GTX 1070 OC system, plays well with a limited play space (mine is currently 2.4 by 1.8 meters), and involves no artificial locomotion. Graphics are nice and polished.
