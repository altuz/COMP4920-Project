So it kinda pissed me off right there.\nBut that would be okay, if the game was good. It isnt. The whole game it just running the same parts over and over again to find stuff you need to open another door. Behind the door you have to find other stuff and so on. You basically just run around and collect things. Some of the voicelines (eagle and final \"person\") are russian computer generated voice. The disappointing \"finale\" after running around like squirrel searching for nuts was a russian dialouge i couldnt even understand. So dont buy this game. It's boring, it's repetetive, it's not well made and the soundtrack is one song repeating for the whole time (kinda good song atleast!)\n\nTL;DR : Dont buy.

This is nice short game about druid who wants to find master to teach him. There are many good riddles that good for any age. Also i liked the simple graphic style and music.\nAbout few minuses i\u2019ve found: some sound are not suitable for characters, for example hedgehog and bird? it sound strange. And again - repetitive song, please add another soundtrack!:)\nNevertheless this is good quest (i think this genre is more convenient) to play.
