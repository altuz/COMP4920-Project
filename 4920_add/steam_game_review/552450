The devs understood that there is no silver bullet locomotion method that'll satisfy everybody, and implemented a bunch of options. There's both blink teleportation and traditional stick locomotion. There's also smooth or snap turning. I went full oldschool with smooth rotation and analouge stick movement. There are even 3 options for \"forward\": Head direction, hand direction and room orientation.\n\nEmulating my old mouse/keyboard playstyle with these controls was a bit iffy at first, but once I got the hang of it, it was second nature again.\n\nOne of the biggest differences in gameplay vs the flat version is that you can dual wield ANY weapon. This means the devs had to re-balance the damage model somewhat, making the weapons feel a bit weaker. Still feels awesome having a minigun in each hand mowing down hordes of enemies :)\n\nI don't know if the scaling has changed from the flat version or if it's just VR making you perceive it differently, but one thing is for sure: Everything is so impressively gigantic. From the building structures to the big enemies. It really adds an epic element to it all.\n\nOf course I would've loved improved assets for the VR version, as the 3d models and textures don't hold up very well compared to other 2017 VR titles, but it's tolerable.\n\nHaving some new custom animations for chainsaw kills would've been awesome. Instead you get the same old animation regardless of which angle you slice 'em. This made the chainsaws feel so unsatisfying to use that I abandoned them completely within 10 minutes.\n\nThe only bugs I experienced was during the last boss fight which still hasn't been fixed with the latest patch. Since the devs felt that jump pads would be too intense in VR, they changed the mechanics of activating the big laser gun, and they messed something up, so that the rings are sometimes unreachable, or simply not working. I finally managed to cirumvent the bugs and kill the boss, but the achievement didn't unlock. \n\nDespite the mess they made with the last fight, imo Croteam succeded in bringing FE to VR. Even though there are some discounts when you own certain other SS titles, I find the price a bit steep. \n\nStill, there aren't many VR fps shooters out there that can scratch the same old school itch like this title.\n\n70%", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
