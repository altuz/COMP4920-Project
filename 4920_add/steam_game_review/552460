While watching them, THIS was the fantasy VR game that glimmered in the back of my head. I knew this new technology would one day let me fall into a world with rich, varied environments to explore (and be rewarded for exploring), quick movement, tonnes of bad guys and a sh*tload of weaponry at my disposal. I'll be honest, I've never played anything from the Serious Sam series before owning VR, but this was one hell of an introduction to say the least.\n\nI just want to say thank you to the guys at CROTEAM for taking the time out to do this for VR. In a market full of wave shooters, teleportation and slower paced full locomotion, this was exactly the itch I needed to scratch. Now for my list.\n\nPROS:\n- FULL LOCOMOTION... need I say more?\n- Great, old school arena styled fast paced shooting.\n- A crap-load of weapons. Pistols, shotguns, sub-machine guns, chainsaws and even giant cannons are all dual wieldable and make you feel totally bad*ss.\n- Rich and varied environments that you feel inclined to explore for hidden gems.\n- Online multiplayer and co-op support.\n\nCONS:\n- You may feel uneasy during and after first few sessions. THIS DOES GO AWAY!\n- Cutscenes are buggy and crash the game if I try to pull up the weapon menu.\n- 1 second long loading screens sometime come up when moving between environments. Can be annoying when in the middle of a shootout.\n\nUPDATE SUGGESTIONS:\n- Perhaps a player movement speed slider option to compensate for both first time players and elites.\n- Option to turn off thumb stick rotation (I know there is one but it resets to right thumb every time I restart game)\n- Maybe the jungle environment on the main menu screen could change up as you progress through the game?\n\nNot much else for me to say. I f*cking love this game and can't wait to finish this review to jump back into it.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
