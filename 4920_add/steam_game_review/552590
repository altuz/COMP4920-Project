The game looks good (when it doesn't take ten seconds to load a room), sounds good (when the audio engineering doesn't screw it) and plays... well, it's servicable, if a bit clunky at times (at least with a controller). The puzzles can be quite interesting, and the game play loop rather fun. Except the first are heavily signposted, and the second gets stale, since it also means a hell of a lot of waiting. The story is decent along, and it's interesting to uncover more and more of the Sexy Brutale's secrets.\n\nBUT:\nAnd this is why I wrote this review, the ending is... a thing. It'll be a matter of taste. Maybe you'd like it. I didn't. It left me profoundly dissappointed.

Unfortunately, given what the game actually is, I can't recommend it.  \n\nWhat I liked about The Sexy Brutale has already been covered in depth by others: the artwork and the atmosphere are quite beautiful (I especially liked the combination gasmask/playing card idea for the staff).  The characters have good backstories which keep them from becoming two-dimensional.  The brochure, which contains information and backstory for the hotel and updates as you play, is an excellent idea.  The dialogue is passable and appropriate for the characters.  A shadowy, chained figure waiting for his cards is something I find very intriguing.  \n\nAnd there the list of positives ends.  I will list the negatives in order of importance.\n\nThe first negative aspect of the game is the name itself, \"The Sexy Brutale.\"  While I don't necessarily agree that use of the word \"sexy\" will lead prospective gamers to expect sex, I still think it was a mistake.  You simply don't find casinos or hotels with the word \"sexy\" in the name.  In fact, you don't find any high-end establishments where the word \"sexy\" is featured.  It doesn't need to be.  \"The Brutale\" by itself is a superior name, and it's not even my first choice. \n\nSecondly, this has been referred to as a puzzle game, but the actual puzzles presented to the player are so simple that it's tempting to call them pseudo-puzzles.  All too often the object needed to solve the problem and save the guest is laying in the open for no apparent reason.  I assumed (incorrectly) that the puzzles would become more complex as the game progressed, and more than once found myself overthinking the problem; the solutions are uniformly unsatisfying because they are so simple, and sometimes that simplicity makes them seem downright unrealistic.  Guests can only be killed in a specific time and place, so that saving them can be as easy as keeping the staff away from the appointed place during the appointed time.  If you're expecting the target to be chased through the hallways by a determined killer, you will be disappointed.  Once the initial murder is foiled, the game considers the guest in question perfectly safe. Furthermore, foiling the murder usually comes down to using a single quest item one time.  There are no intricate problems to untangle.  \n\nLastly, the ending is absolutely abysmal.  \"It was all a dream\" kind of abysmal.  There was a period of time, maybe in the late 90's, when every other horror movie ended with the revelation that the main character had multiple personalities, and none of what you just watched actually happened.  The Sexy Brutale's storyline ends with a silent, wet fart.  The reveal is the definition of anticlimax, where the original sin of the antagonist and the premise of the entire game are shown to be incredibly mundane and well-traveled.  It also accidentally destroys the backstory (as revealed through dialogue) of the protagonist, Lafcadio Boone, without any explanation, so that the lack of originality is exacerbated by sloppiness.  \n\nThe Sexy Brutale could have been saved by better puzzles and a decent story.  As it stands, it isn't worth anything close to the asking price.  \n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
