You collect hidden powerups, defeat bosses, and gain new skills abilities (double jump, wall climb, etc.) as you advance through the game. However, the game is constructed in such a way that progress is quick and the next (or last) save point is never far because it is also a mobile game. As a result, it has the hallmarks of a metroidvania, but it has a much more arcade-y feel.\n\nYou can expect to get about 3 hours out of the game for the first playthrough, but completing your first run unlocks three new heroes with different mechanics from the main character. If you really like the game play, I imagine you could squeeze another few hours out of these bonus heroes.\n\nThe sound effects and music could be implemented better. If the game chose randomly between a few different sword strike sounds and had unique sound effects for secondary weapon hits, it would go a long way to reducing the monotony. Better transitions between areas and more varied tracks would help on the music side.\n\nOverall, I'm impressed. Most of the games I get on Steam for $5 dollars are underwhelming, even at that price point, but playing Ninja Smasher has me hoping the developer finds some success. There is a lot of potential here and I'd be happy to buy a full-fledged metroidvania from Q-Cumber Factory!", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480026382, "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198339421398"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.386098", "timestamp_updated": 1480026393, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "27334734", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 51, "timestamp_created": 1480026393, "votes_up": 1, "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WGcJDM7KXk", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
