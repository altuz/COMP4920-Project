The game is so scary you almost have to play with two people - one looking at the monitor and telling you when it's okay to open your eyes! The map isn't that large but it doesn't feel repetitive or get boring. One or two bugs here and there but for the most part an excellent game - you can't go wrong for three dollars!

I know its an early access title, but still very entertaining and playable. And of course scary as hell! :) Here is a VR and Mixed Reality capture from my gameplay on HTC Vive:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy3jWFTdQbA\n\nKeep Watching VR is a thrilling horror game for HTC Vive inside of a creepy abandoned mental hospital, where scary Clowns are chasing you in the dark. Your only weapons in Keep Watching VR are a flashlight and a DSLR camera, so dont drain the flashlight's batterys out, keep watching after those nasty clowns, and dont turn your back on them!\n\nI think the game has great potential, and the whole idea of being chansed by Clowns that only moves while you are looking away is awesome! I hope the developers can spend some time polishing some bugs, and make the game bigger as well. Its surely one of the better horror VR experiences so far. \n\nI will continue this review as soon as I have played more, and of course when more content is added, but for now I recommend this game to all VR horror fans!
