Which is a good thing.\n\nThe art is great, there's so much extra little touches of animation and effects on everything that really are fun to look at.\n\nThe gameplay can be a little hard around ther edges at times. The game is designed to reward players for building up a shot over multiple moves, by adding and moving things around but keeping the same ball trajectory. The only problem is some obsticles work on a world timer, and not a shot timer, so the physics wont always be consistant between shots.

I'm not a big fan of them and while I've played a few they are a genera I tend to ignore.  That being said, there are many positive qualities about Fantasy Fairways.  The sound design for the game is lovely and relaxing.  The art is pretty and the animations are interesting and just as beautiful at times.  I enjoy the little touches in the game, like how the flowers get sucked into the hole after the ball goes in.  The game offers a nice challenge as well.  It isn't just try to get the ball in the hole and avoid the opsticles.  It challenges the player to think and to really figure things out.  Getting a hole in one is going to take a fair bit of skill and spatial reasoning.  It is this unique spin to the game that really makes it stand out from the rest in its genera.  (Honestly, I think they should add puzzling to the genera list.)\n\nAll of this being said, the game is not perfect.   It is still in its infancy and it shows through the various glitches and limited features.  The tutorial especially could use some work as the player has to figure out a lot of the features for themselves.  However, the foundation for a good, if not a great, game is there.  This is a excellent game for those who enjoy challenging puzzles and people who like mini-golf games.  I look forward to seeing how it evolves.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
