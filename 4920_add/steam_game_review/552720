For a game with such an onerous main plot, where you play a central role in the fate of your entire people under the volition of the gods, you meander far too much and far too distractedly on your journey to the plot's destination.\n\nAn example: On your way to the game's pilgrimage site, which involves the traversement of a tedious marshland (this is not to be confused with the journey which came before, involving the traversement of a tedious highland), you can be captured by slavers. who bring you to a random city utterly unrelated to your quest, an event which the gods bewilderingly allow to happen despite their propensity for intervening in more trivial pursuits. You spend far too great a portion of the game in an arena where slaves are made to fight each other to the death, isolated from your oblivious tribespeople.\n\nImagine the angst of playing through the storyline of an RPG, say, Skyrim, where one is to defeat a terrible dragon. And on your journey to its mountainous lair, you were abducted by slavers and hauled off to the bloodied sands of a coliseum halfway across the ocean - what a bewildering tangent! I am all for encumberments to the resolution of a quest, but only insofar as the villains are related to the quest itself, such that the fatal viccisitude would have been a trial to overcome, rather than a lengthy detour of misfortune devoid of your antagonist's malice, and empty of pertinence.\n\nAnd thus I was away from my tribe for a drastically long period of time, separated by oblivious enemies from oblivious allies and when the time came to return to them - I was forced to leave behind the slaves who were yet in the arena, their fates unresolved and unintervened. This riles against me because what the game has done was introduce an entirely new playing field of story and morality, separate from the main questline, and then with a panoramic flick of the wrist dismissed the entire saga as though it didn't matter! A few sentences of guilt, and the entire tale vanished, never again remembered as we resumed our marshland hegira. \n\nA tangent, and an empty one at that!\n\nThe problem with all of this is the lack of a sense of interconnectivity, which is exarcebated by the lack of a way to establish emotional attachment. A plot where you are chosen by the gods, and are leading your people on a diaspora to a hallowed ground, should be one which encourages you to actually care about the people and the gods. Apart from your advisor or two (you are limited in your interactions, being forced to choose from a rigid rubric of socialisation) you do not interact personally with individual members of the tribe. They are not a tribe of individuals for whom you care deeply, they don't even have names! None of them are family or friends, none of them are capable of dialogue or recurring interaction, they are all simply colourless pieces of resource meeples for you to collect and gather, and perhaps inspire on occasion with flaccid speeches.\n\nI recall with amusement one of the scenes where you were forced, before a terrorist, to choose between two innocents who would be executed upon selection. You had to pick one over the other, and yet neither the damned nor the survivor in the aftermath of the damned would make any comment about your choice. I wanted to shake the survivor: \"don't give me generic comments about our prison setting or how you in your infinite triteness want to be rid of it, I just murdered a person for you! Her decapitated head is right outside our cages staring! Talk to me, damn it, talk to me!\"\n\nWithout a core of humanisation, there is no basal site for the player to establish emotional connections, no skeletal structure of plot to support small branching side-quests, let alone the meandering and convoluted monstrosities which had led me off the map several times to engage in unrelated storylines which were fleeting in significance and yet felt like an eternity to play through due to their abysmal and narcotic tedium.\n\n[u]TLDR:[/u]\nThe flaws of the game may be summarised thusly: You may collect and acquire members for your tribe, but will never speak to any of them. You may recruit members after a quest in which there is interaction, but once they're in your tribe, forget about ever seeing them again. They are now no more than a number on your screen as you trail from one scene into another, like an old-timey movie presenting a flickering series of images - between which the only connection is that you remain inexplicably the viewer.\n\nThe game was a terribly lonely playthrough for me. None of the tribe struck me as alive, and even those few clip art people capable of dialogue had cardboard personalities, being incapable of memory and utterly imperceptive of the dramatic events which unfolded around them. Saga of the North Wind was a long meandering adventure, which [i]could[/i] have been a good thing, but unfortunately, there was no one there to talk about it.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1479479663, "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065977773"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503429", "timestamp_updated": 1479479788, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "26672673", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1479479788, "votes_up": 7, "review": "Although a bit short, this story carry the sense of adventure and leadership that i love in a game. 6/10", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488463857, "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198077130175"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510881", "timestamp_updated": 1488465142, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30278470", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1488465142, "votes_up": 4, "review": "Nice!
