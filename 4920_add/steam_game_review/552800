Honestly, the gameplay is very good, very intense. The controls are a little tricky to get the hang of, but once you do, you will be swinging around like a champion. There is a fun timer system to complete each level, and you can pick up little timer boosts as you go through the game. It almost has old school NES Ninja Gaiden levels of frustration (that is a compliment\u2026 I loved that game). Something I disliked about it was the character. It does not seem to fit with the cover art. But the scrolling backgrounds were very well done, and the intense gameplay had me hooked for hours. I definitely recommend trying it out.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
