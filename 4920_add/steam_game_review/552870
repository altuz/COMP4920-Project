I remember holding small mazes in my hands as a kid and now I can do same thing in VR. There are different mazes with various difficulties, sometimes you have to simply go from one side to another other times you have a puzzle to solve, like open door or avoid enemy balls. \n\nThe whole gameplay is simple but fun due to responsive controls. Since this is Early Access I am curious about next updates with more mazes. Good game for a Sunday afternoon.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
