I am currently working on polishing some of the earlier content. The introduction sequence has been completely overhauled and have been looking where the early content can be improved.\n\nI'm also currently putting my focus on fixing some other issues before I can move into new content. But once these have been dealt with I can shift my focus back on completing the game.\n\nAgain, very happy the game turned out to being able to give you a good time. :) I'l do my best to deliver a great experience when the final game is done.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1505123931, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485653", "timestamp_updated": 1505089498, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "34873849", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505089498, "votes_up": 3, "review": "So far it's a fun puzzle game, good storyline, nice graphics, and good voice acting. No regrets buying this one at all. The initial copy I bought I refunded because of an issue (that turned out to be my laptop's issue, not the game). Playing it on my desktop it runs like a dream. Good framerates, smooth graphics, and well images. I hope the developers keep up with it and there are many more chapters :).", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
