I have always been interested in sailing and in past years tried 3 sailing simulators, all of which were bad to awful.  I decided to give this sim a try.  I was immediately impressed with the graphics in calm water. The realism of simulating the standing and running rigging, management of the sheets and sails is extraordinary.  I am amazed at how well it reproduces the experience of sailing. However, I was disappointed in the graphics  in \"bad\" weather. In mid Atlantic heavy seas, the graphics seemed really primative, not at all realistic.  Today I had my boat on a track I set  a week ago with no idea Hurricane Irma would be in my path.  I was shocked as the graphics came on screen, showing detailed enormous waves, wind-driven spray, foam on the waves--exactly as I believe it would look if I were at sea. I'm still struggling a bit with setting new sailing tracks and teleporting, but I hope the updated tutorials that I saw were part of today's update will help me.  I highl recommend this sim for sailing enthusiasts.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507013822, "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 81, "steamid": "76561197972248673"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "weighted_vote_score": "0.523928", "timestamp_updated": 1507014519, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "35437946", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_created": 1507014519, "votes_up": 16, "review": "Great to learn sailing, probably, but not very exciting.  Doesn't seem like it's possible to capsize or damage the boat (the tutorial mentions that \"gybing\" can snap off the mast in fast enough wind but I tried it in the strongest winds on earth right now and nothing happened).  Not very exciting visually, couldn't find any crazy storms or anything, even the worst storm still had sunlight and was pretty meh-worthy, especially given the aforementioned inability to capsize.  Running aground is not exciting either, you just get a popup saying \"help me\" and your boat resets off the coast.  No human constructions (cities, NPC traffic) or other landmarks (like the Golden Gate Bridge).\n\nThat said, the sailing AI is pretty cool, it's neat to put it in auto-trim and watch it move the ropes around.  It explains why it's doing this, to a degree (\"raising jib line to 40% to open top sail\" or whatever).  However I wanted to watch this from an angle where I could actually see the sail moving, and that didn't seem to be possible: I couldn't find a good vantage point on the boat, and if you position the camera in an off-the-boat \"3rd person\" angle that shows the sails then the auto-trim button no longer works.  So all I really got to see most of the time was the rope (\"line\") moving in or out as the AI made their adjustments.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the best and onlyest sailing simulator I've played, and if you enjoy playing flight simulators for long-haul flights over the ocean in realtime then you may enjoy this game also.  If you have the patience it will doubtless teach you a lot about sailing, and the tutorials are somewhat helpful in that sense as well.  But it's not so much a game as it is a simulator, and I suspect it's not something the average consumer will enjoy.  The addition of real hazards or goals (e.g. transporting passengers to raise money to purchase better boats) could possibly change this in the future, but as it stands I would not recommend this to anyone who is not specifically seeking a sailing simulation program for educational purposes.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506962347, "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 113, "steamid": "76561198281987820"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509968", "timestamp_updated": 1504898616, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "34821410", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504898616, "votes_up": 7, "review": "So... how about we start with bright sides...\n-Sea life (yes they are awesome)\n-boats (soo many of them)\n-challenges (its the perfect way of practising to races)\n-races (really awesome)\n-bost customation (so much to customise)\nNow for the minus side\n-few bugs\n- quite many bugs with the 50'\nOverall this game is a 9/10.

As an avid simmer since the mid 1980s, I cannot stress enough how important it is to have an actual arrival and destination point in the scenery. Arrival at such a point gives a real a sense of achievement , even if its crudely implemented -  like a buoy with a name pinned to it.

This simulator is pretty much unplayable to me. While you are in the boat, your point of view is rididly attached to the boat, meaning that when the boat heels, the horizon gets tilted. This is extremely unnatural, and after a while it actually made me kinda nauseous. In real life, you have the feeling of gravity to keep your head upright - it is instinctual in real life that the horizon will be level to your eyes no matter how much the boat heels. \n\nSomeone in the forums said that the creators intend you to tilt your head in real life to keep the simulated horizon level as the boat heels, but I really hope they aren't serious. It is very uncomfortable to keep level a simulated horizon when it disagrees with the gravity that you feel in real life. Furthermore, by tilting the horizon on screen, you lose a lot of space that could otherwise hold more visual information. \n\nThe view angles overall feel very wonky. I find it slightly frustrating that the tell tales are completely out of view when I am adjusting the sail trim.\n\nI am considering trying to get a refund for this game, but I am conflicted. The effect of sail trim seems really accurate and the waves are really well done. I desperately want them to succeed in making this a great sailing simulator, and I see great potential here.
