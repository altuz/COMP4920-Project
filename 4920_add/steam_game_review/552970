I don't know what possessed me to buy it, I never play games like this but I'm very happy I did. \nYou play as a Sumo adventuring your way to a village(? I haven't finished yet, correct me if I'm wrong). For some strange reason every person you see is fast asleep, despite your best efforts (which honestly aren't very effortful) you cannot awaken the slumbering inhabitants of the lands you venture through.\nThis is seriously fun stuff but.....\n\n[b][u]TLDR:[/u][/b]\n[b][u]Verdict:[/u][/b]\nAUD$12.00 in the sales. Stick it in your wishlist and wait out the price. It'll drop lower.\n\nThis game is worth the pain of its f**king abysmal controls but at a price below $10. Say, $8 would be kinda generous. If the control issues were fixed, I'd recommend this game at $15-$18+ but not in this condition.\n\n\n[b][u]Issues[/u][/b]\n\nThe controls:\n\nCtrl, Enter and \u2191 \u2193 \u2190 \u2192\n\n[list]\n[*][b]Sumomans response to control inputs is too laggy, and nonresponsive:[/b]\nWalking- hit the direction, say you want to position near the edge of a post to make a jump, by the time the input has registered Sumo is waltzing off into the depths of what lies beneath. So adjust the way you hit the inputs: tap it, it doesn't register; hold it for a teensy second*, he ends up taking three steps; hold it properly (as you should honestly be able to and have the input end when you release the button) and he goes too far and can't be interrupted until he stops completing the action and the associated animation plays out. This leads to my next gripe -\n\n[*][b]Once you start an input it is -for the most part- uninterruptable:[/b]\nOur little fat friend will not stop what he is doing until his entire animation has played. Accidentally strike up a monologue at a villager? uninterruptable. Accidentally make an immediate second jump facing the wrong way? turning around mid-jump is strictly forbidden, you'll have to wait for the California Roll King to land (probably on his backside) and then rewind the entire thing. In delicate areas -where the ground breaks after a few seconds- this is not fun after the 16th time he double jumps.\n\n[*][b]Once he starts to walk a little way he doesn't stop for three steps:[/b]\nIt doesn't sound like much of however three steps can often spell the difference between the edge of a ledge and the bottom of a cliff.\n\n[*][b]If you dont release the jump button a billionth of a second after hitting it, Sumy [u]will[/u] jump again:[/b]\nWhen you're trying to time and land jumps perfectly to collect nommy sushi before the ground crumbles beneath your feet making it impossible to repostion and jump again to the next ledge and piece of sushi, these inadvertant second jumps can screw up everything.\n\n[*][b]To make our hero jump in any direction don't hit jump:[/b]\nYou MUST hit jump only after you have already clearly and fully hit left or right, unless you want to just jump on the spot, directionless fool. Usually, getting a moving jump correct involves having Sumo begin moving in the direction you want the jump to go, but there oft' isn't room or safety enough for Sumo to be taking any steps -on the ground-  to anywhere. This isn't an issue in wide open spaces but it becomes a bane and a pain when things are close.\n[/list]\nWell may you reply that these input sensitivities are part of the game, that it is supposed to get more difficult when things are.... difficult. However, good and great games aren't good and great because the developers made the controls as jumpy as a donkey with PTSD. They are good and great because of difficulty gradient, because of good story, because of non-repetitive objectives with obstacles and puzzles (this game has all that stuff too though), not because of a hungry man who wont turn around when you ask him to.\n\n\n*Yes, I know all seconds are of the same length. A 'teensy second' is still a second. Yes, I could have said 1/12 of a second but I didn't because we're all adults and know how to handle this sort of colloquial language abuse.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 2}, {"author": {"last_played": 1494469960, "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976822079"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486986", "timestamp_updated": 1492962672, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31322902", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1492962672, "votes_up": 12, "review": "This is the most innovative platformer I've played in years.  Most platformer protagonists are agile, so it's a breath of fresh air to play as a rotund guy who isn't very well-suited for this type of adventure.\n\nThe creators went above and beyond, too--not only did they make an interesting game mechanic (you lose just by falling over, not just falling into water, etc.), but they made the sumo wrestler have a jovial and light-hearted personality.  He seems like a decent guy, just clusmy to a fault.  The guy is voice-acted, which is a nice touch.\n\nOnly two complaints I have with this game.  The first is the difficulty of some of the puzzles.  You don't have to collect every sushi roll, but even the normal progression of some levels (especially final part of river and final part of monastery!) can be downright mind-bending.\n\nThe other complaint is that it isn't obvious from the menu that you can press Delete to reset to the last gong checkpoint.  If you think the time-rewind feature is all you have, you'll be restarting the entire level over and over, which is punishing for this type of game.  Maybe they'll patch this later.\n\nSo go knock yourselves out--preferably not by fighting a sumo wrestler.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1496234158, "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198039582381"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480927", "timestamp_updated": 1499019395, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33144745", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499019395, "votes_up": 1, "review": "Great and funny puzzle game.
