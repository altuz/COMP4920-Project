I appreciate that it takes the route of making the room allign with the size of your play space so that you don't have to do any teleporting or sliding, though this does alienate some of the playerbase with small rooms. The only thing that really distinguishes this game from other escape game is the light focus on destroying things, but as entertaining as smashing things is it's done kind of strangely. You can't just pick up a brick and smash it against a bottle, for example; you have to find the rod to use as a handle and stick it into the brick, after which you can start smashing things. The game also defaults to Epic settings, which didn't run very well at all for me even with fairly high specs (though still fairly average specs by VR standards, a GTX 970 and an i5 3570k @ 4.4GHz) even with async reprojection turned on, so I'd recommend turning down the settings, though whether or not you need to will probably be obvious when you get into it. You shouldn't go into this one expecting anything amazing, but it can at least be completed, which is more than I can say than other games I've played recently.

I hope that was a bug and not the actual solution.  My biggest critique, though, is that the environment was way too dark.  I had trouble seeing things because of this.
