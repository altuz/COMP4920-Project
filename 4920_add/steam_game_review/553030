Is it has a chance or formulation? Don't know because it is not said in the tutorial.\n[*]As it says on the title and the tag, but there's no single element of RPG and tales on the game.\n[/olist]\n\nTime killer game?

It swaps the exponential difficulty for multiple color tiles, regular board-cleanup through attacks, opening treasure, healing and whatnot. You need to collect enough Mana to open a portal to win the level, and better you are at stacking numbers, the faster you can beat the level before you're exhausted by taken damage. It's much easier than 2048 but that opens it up to a broader audience.\n\nTiles & Tales has relatively engaging game loop - there're multiple upgrades, daily and weekly quests, and very generous free hard currency (a.k.a. gems) gifts every 4 hours. Given that first respawn in a failed level costs only 1 gem, and a 4-hour free chest contains 3-7 gems, this is a very generous, soft-paywall game. There are premium characters, but even the most expensive takes 15-20 days play for free (only running game to get your free gems). I hope authors have enough revenue to cover for the Steam port, but the game as it is too generous, maybe unsustainingly so.\n\nSome people complain that it costs LOTS of coins to upgrade, forcing you to pay, but the game actually rewards skill (or luck?) by stacking coin tiles up to 9,999. I was able to achieve such a luck run around Level 14. It shot me 5-6 upgrades further in the game, making it very easy. It definitely is not \"PAY or GTFO\" game. \n\nPROS\n\n* Great visuals for mobile title, at par with Zynga and King.\n* Engaging, addictive puzzle RPG mechanic.\n* Okay upgrade system.\n* Daily, weekly quests, timed gifts reward retention well.\n\nCONS\n\n* Very few uses for hard currency (a.k.a. gems)\n* Very few permanent purchases for hard currency", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485412175, "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 341, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197998455537"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500742", "timestamp_updated": 1485412307, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "29496475", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 11, "timestamp_created": 1485411804, "votes_up": 13, "review": "Tiles and Tales is a mix between 2048 and Match 3. The objective of the game is to go through each level collecting a specified number of Blue Crystals. You use the arrow keys or WASD keys to move the blocks in a similar pattern in 2048. Blocks of the same colour combine with one another and go up in value. At the end of the round, the required coloured block with the highest value is broken and used.\n\nRed blocks deal attack damage to enemies at the end of round, green blocks heal you at shrines, purple blocks unlock chests, coin blocks give you coins and so on. You can use coins to buy passive skills that can aid you in game. You can also buy potions that give you temporary buffs.\n\nConclusion, I think this game should not be on Steam. It's better suited for Facebook or a mobile platform and I don't think it's a good idea to encourage more of these games to port over to Steam. The Pay To Win system is also a major no-no. The cash currency in this game is called Diamonds. Best price was 7000 Diamonds for $140.\n\n[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]\n1. Decent Game\nIt's playable.\n\n2. Heroes\nSome variety at least.\n\n[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Another Click-and-Slide Game\nWhile I like these games, I don't think they belong on Steam.\n\n2. Pay To Win\nYou can use cash to buy more coins, which turn into upgrades, which turn into a gameplay advantage, which is Pay To Win.\n\n3. Scripted/Random Blocks Appearing\nNo way to predict what colour block will appear where on the grid. Either it's scripted or totally random. The game can spawn different coloured blocks just to block you for no reason other than to frustrate you and force you to pony up cash. \n\n4.
