I was totally having a lot of fun with this game. Was on a great run, lots of health, cool items. I really liked it. Until I fell down a trapdoor pit trap into a small section of the map that did not connect any way to the main secton, nor could I get out of it, as the trap was the only way into it. Crossing the trap was the only way I could continue, so it wasnt an option to find another way down and not step on the trap. I had to take my chances, and when I didnt make it across, figured oh well, I'll just find my way out. Nope. I was trapped, and since I was doing so good, the enemies couldn't really hurt me so I had to quit.\nTotally sucked.\n\nDev tip: If youre running a procedurally generated game, please make sure situations like this can't happen. Give your player an out always, even if its tough to get through. At this time, I can't recommend it cuz you shouldn't be forced to quit solely due to bad level design.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488680600, "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198333363120"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511608", "timestamp_updated": 1480113679, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "27560854", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1480113644, "votes_up": 7, "review": "I said to myself, \"Hey, Fuck it I'll try this game out.\" Wasn't dissapointed.\n\nI played 2 lives so far, and I am already hooked!

When buying these games, you are not paying for great graphics and sound, that is not the point. You expect the gameplay to hold it up, and this one does.\nIt's a fairly basic premise, survive as long as you can whilst trying to reach the depths of the dungeon and hopefully meet the final boss and face your destiny.
