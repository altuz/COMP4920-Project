Every object can be picked up and Jess\u2019 voice comments on it like older adventure games which adds to the immersion. \n\nMost puzzles aren\u2019t too challenging, except for the last one which is more difficult but makes sense once you \u2018get\u2019 it. Not the longest game at 2 hours and could be finished sooner if I didn't listen to all the voices... But I suppose that's part of the fun.\n\nLoved the dialogue and attention to detail making the world feel like her real house. Even the radio announcer was subtly part of the game if you listen to it closely.
