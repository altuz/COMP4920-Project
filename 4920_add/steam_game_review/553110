You look around and suddenly ..whoops.. you tilted your head a bit and start moving without wanting to.\n- My biggest immersion breaker though is that the motion controllers are simply used as a binary on/off button. It doesn't matter whether you make a slow gentle motion or a fast violent one - they just act like a button press that tells the game to move forward at a certain speed. Totaly immersion breaking for me and i wouldn't have wished for that even with a non-vr game - hopefully the devs add analogue motion here.\n\nIn conclusion i recommend spending on this game whatever you're comfortable parting with moneywise, as long as you understand this is more of a tech demo show-to-my-friends kind of thing right now.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
