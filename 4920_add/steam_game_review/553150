VR Dungeon only has two types of puzzles, one is a basic math problem that involves silly symbols and the other is an \"alchemy\" problem that once again features a silly symbol, but now lets you mix colors together. In fact, the entire 'answer key' fits in rather large print on a single piece of paper. Compare this to the variety of different puzzles you see on KTANE (and the huge length of the manuals) and you'll see where this game lands.\n\nWhile nice in concept, you will experience both different puzzle types within five minutes and after that it's just mundane. With some more puzzle types and teamwork opportunities this could work out very well; but until then I would not recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
