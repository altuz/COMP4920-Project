I didn't run into any bugs that I'm aware of, as far as I can tell it runs perfectly. However, after playing it for the last couple of days, I've got some bones to pick with the gameplay. \n\nMaybe it's because I've been playing DoW the past several years, but it kind of bothers me that the range for all of the weapons is so short. For example, the missile launcher shoots 4 squares? Really? And the sniper rifle has a range of five? You're kidding, right? Nope. So, that's the first thing that started getting on nerves. Plus, firing at such short range, how is it I'm missing almost half my shots? The technology in the 41st Millenium really seems to have gone downhill with aim like that. \n\nPlus, having enemies spawn right on top of you is just stupid. I'm ok with enemies spawning in during a battle, but don't put them right on top of me after I've cleared an area. Jeez. \n\nLastly, it seems the AI is beefed up (i.e., cheats) by having more accurate and damaging weapons than my own troops. I understand it's easier to do that than develop a good AI, but people have been doing AI in games for decades, this kind of trick is just disappointing.\n\nI've only played the campaign and challenges so far, so maybe multiplayer is a lot more fun (wouldn't be hard!).
