I'm quite enjoying it so far.  It's kind of like a successor to Superpower2, but with the art style of Civ5.  And being able to colonize space and Antarctica in vanilla are relatively unique in this genre (\"this genre\" being the genre of map-staring grand-strategy).  \nMy criticisms of the game have to do primarily with historical accuracy (ie, the USA shouldn't start with only 100-some nukes), realism (ie, Angola isn't suddenly going to rise up and conquer 1/3 of Africa), and the AI (This last one is a pretty common complaint for this genre of game.).  However, these have a pretty minimal impact on the game's enjoyability, because they're all good-enough.\nI'd say that if you like map-staring games, you'll probably enjoy this one, too.  Also, if you're looking for deep strategy, know that this game is pretty casual, but it's not insanely simple, either.\n\nEDIT:  There *are* some serious, game-breaking issues in late- and post-game, but early- and mid- game are still playable and fun.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507138892, "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2895, "steamid": "76561198079370517"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508024", "timestamp_updated": 1506872792, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "35386497", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506872719, "votes_up": 4, "review": "I have owned Realpolitks for a week now, so far I love it. It is a very good Grand Strategy Game, many people don't like it and I see why, however here are the pros and cons in my opinion.\n\nPROS\n- You can play as every country in the world, minus a few very small countries (e.g Figi).\n- You can start in the years 2020, 2050 and 2222, which all have different countries and starting points.\n- Very good starter game for anyone wishing to get into the Grand Strategy Genre, not to many aspects to learn, quite minimal.\n- Easy to look at, even includes a plain map mode for an easier looking map.\n- Money is shown in thousands (usually, depends on how much you have, can reach 0 or even millions) which makes it easier to read, e.g America starts at ~35,000 instead of ~318,166,660,000.\n- The rest of the world's economic situations actually affect your GDP, which can lead to interesting moments of either panic or making alot of money.\n- Every nation in the world is engaged in gameplay at all times.\n- On each timeline (2020, 2050 and 2222) there are suggested countries, these all include grand campaign, just like every other nation in the world but they also include their own seperate challenges and campaigns. These give you a certain task to complate by a certain year.\n- On the 2020 timeline on the suggested countries boxm, in the top left there is a button, if you click this it shows some europian countries. These are all included on one scenario in which you have to rebuild the Austria-Hungarian Empire from WWI. These are fun to play through as well as other suggested countries and nations.\n\nCONS\n- The war system isn't great, it is pretty much left to chance, a country with 100+ units fighting a country with 10 units might take longer than expected. Sometimes it is quick, or someone with considerable less units may start winning. I would call it simplistic, and random.\n- The scoreing system can be very important, being in the top 5 brings help, but it is very difficult to become first as it is almost permanently the U.S. If you are playing the Grand Campaign to win you need to reach score #1 by 2100 (if start in 2020) which is very difficult unless you are playing as the U.S.\n- You cannot be invited to other countries Blocs, you can only invite them into yours. This can be annoying as you may want to experience wanting to be a part of a Bloc and not run one.\n\nNOTICE\n- Once you finish a set task of a suggested country or one of the Europian countries from the Empire tasks, the game just ends, you cannot continue to play on that save unless you go back onto a previous one i believe, this may have changed sinse i last checked but im putting it out there, i know for a fact however you can continue past the winning date of the grand campaign.\n\nSUGGESTIONS FROM MYSELF\n- I reccommend you play as one of the following countries if you are just starting out:\n    = The United Kingdom (2020)\n    = Germany (2020)\n    = Canada (2020)\n    = Brazil (2020)\n    = France (2020)\n    = Sweden (2020)\n    = Japan (2020)\n    = Europia (2050)\n    = Intermarium (2050)\n    = Scandinavia (2050\n    = Maghreb Union (2050)\n    = Roman Empire (2222)\n    = Hundo Khast (2222)\n    = Africhola (2222)\n- I do not recommend playing as the following countries if you are starting out:\n    = The United States (2020) - Extremely high debt.\n    = China (2020) - Low relations with world.\n    = Any African Nation (Minus South Africa) (2020,2050,2222) - Difficult to build economy.\n- Only buy this game if you really want to, or if you are relatively new to the Grand Strategy Genre.\n- Do not buy if you like good war standards in games.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
