It's mostly a futuristic industrial setting with some random rooms that look like parts of an office building. Most of the rooms are pretty minimalistic. Overall it's a pretty clean aesthetic.\n\nThe puzzles aren't very difficult or complicated. If you've played through Portal or Talos, these will be a breeze. (But they're still fun.) Only a few of them require you to time your moves just right, but several require accurate jumps. Nothing super frustrating, though. I completed the game in about an hour.\n\nAs for the puzzles themselves, most of them revolve around little energy orbs that you can shoot (in limited quantities) from your hand. You can also reclaim these orbs if they're no longer needed. There are also the staples of the genre such as killer pools of liquid, lasers, switches, and (of course!) the generic cube/box.\n\nIf you're looking for a story, I'm sorry to say that you won't find it here. There's no text or dialog in the game. It's obvious that there's some sort of back story here, but they don't really put any effort into telling you what it might be. There are various office building type rooms scattered around as well as rooms that look like experiments have taken place in them, but you're really left to make up the story on your own. It's all vaguely reminiscent of Portal.\n\nAll in all, I definitely recommend the game if you're into the first person puzzle genre. It's a good deal for the $0.99 I paid.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501446742, "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198036777325"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419156", "timestamp_updated": 1501284957, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33868241", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_created": 1501284957, "votes_up": 7, "review": "a very cool little puzzle game. you use light orbs to help you traverse areas and open doors. the graphics are great and the puzzles are very cool. i highly recommend this game especially for the price.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMfjD1uKuwU&feature=youtu.be", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501424340, "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001172020"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502187", "timestamp_updated": 1501272363, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33864331", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501272363, "votes_up": 4, "review": "Damn!

I believe this game found a good medium that can be enjoyed by many people.\nThe controls are easy to use and not glitchy \n\nCons:\nI use a MacBook so most games aren't at top quality and this one was no exception. So for anyone who plays on OS, it doesn't run the best.\nThe world in the game is too large for the linear path of actual gameplay. There's many rooms that can be explored, but exploring them is pointless to the advancement of the game. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game very much!
