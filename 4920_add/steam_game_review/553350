What is the game? It's a silly slice-em-up top-down view game of a pirate dual wielding curved swords whilst floating above the ground, slicing his way through armies and armies space zombies.\n\nThe controls are very simple. WASD to move. Left mouse button to attack in a direction. Space to use your super ability. The game is also controller friendly, which is very nice. However I think the keyboard is the better selection for gameplay because with the controller you have to face the direction in which you want to attack and the keyboard you do not have to do that, you can attack in a direction without facing.\n\nYou can collect gold coins or small piles of gold coins off of some defeated enemies and after you collect a certain ammount of gold you can start buying upgrades for your character in the upgrade menu. You can access this from the post-death screen or the main menu. You can also check the leaderboards to see your score, your friend's scores, and other player's scores.\n\nThe soundtrack adds to the silliness, as when you begin your slaying, the music in the background is What Shall We Do With A Drunken Sailor. It's very funny when you first open the game and you hear that playing as you slice up zombies in space.\n\nI believe this game is definately worth the two dollars and a playthrough.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
