Just checking, this review pertains to user-led breath mode, right?  What you described (having the orb grow during in breath, shrink during out breath), is how the orb is programmed in this mode.  Your suggestion that the orb continues growing / shrinking *until* the game senses the opposite breath is interesting.  That's something we'll have to look into that!  In the meantime, you might try the computer-led breath mode.\n\n2. To your point, we'll be adding more complex scenery to the scenes in an upcoming update.  In our MVP, we wanted to avoid anything that distracted the user from their breath.\n\n3. We have 12 different pieces of music in the music menu item.  They're randomized, so if you try turning off the waves and try a different track, let me know if you like that one more!\n\n4. Is your Windows 3.0 comment specific to the menu?  Or just in general that you think the app is in an early state?\n\nYou can bet that we'll be updating the app soon.  I hope you'll give our next revision a shot when it comes out!\n\nBest,\nKevin", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1480265113, "comment_count": "3", "weighted_vote_score": "0.508162", "timestamp_updated": 1480216987, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "27767127", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_created": 1480216987, "votes_up": 5, "review": "This concept has potential, but it is nowhere near the $15 price tag on it. A dollar at best as it is.\n\n1. I could not focus on my breath while I was so intently focused on why the orb did not match my breathing very well. It was clunky and unresponsive. I would recommend to the developer that you have the orb begin enlargening continually the moment breath inward is noticed rather than requiring continual breath in to continue enlargening. Few people are going to simply hold their breath so a smooth motion outward with assumption of still breathing in would be far more relaxing. Same with the out breathing: keep shrinking until noticing the inward breath. As it is, it is very distracting rather than relaxing.\n\n2. Scenery is way too simplistic like staring at at jpg on my monitor. \n\n3. The sound of waves is far too gimmicky of a relaxation sound. \n\n4. The entire feel is too Windows 3.0 to really relax at all. I can see potential with an update in graphics, music, and breath matching.
