Glad I didn't pay full price.  Game starts off really nice with a nice story book intro.  Then you're stuck with a stationary wave shooter.  \n\nThat wouldn't be so bad if it were semi-interesting, but the enemy types are pretty uninspired.  They just walk slowly towards you.  The aiming seems odd too with a targeting reticle always in the distance.  Throwing a grendate is also very weird.  \n\nJust a very bland game overall.  There's so many wave shooters and this one is just average to below average honestly.  \n\nI played this with Oculus Rift and Touch contollers do work.  \n\nRating 4/10 bleh", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
