There's a bit of strategy in how close you get to animals and when you shoot before they start running. \n\nStill needs some polish, but it's pretty fun as is and worth the ~$10 price tag!  I'd like to see a few more gun types, different  animals, and multiplayer would be awesome.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
