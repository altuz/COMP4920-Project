No need for set up (we are already standing up), and it's well adapted to current VR tracking.\nThe score, achievements, random pattern and overall presentation are an extra motivation.\nHaving some profiles, history and graph would be nice, but I won't ask for too much from a free game.\n\nCurrently I try to do 2 series 2-3 times a week:\n- One around the middle of my VR session, then a short pause to breath and refresh.

What makes this 'game' good, is how its presented:\nVery chaotic. Very eccentric. Very computer. Very enjoyable. \n\nYou're in a large gym-like room, with benchpress benches that have weights being lifted by nobody. In front of you is a track. A large structure emerges, not long followed by a weird, blob-like structure; the shape that you have to squat down into. While each structure is the same shape and depth (the position you have to get into, and how long you have to squat for), the structures may be joined one after the other, so you have to hold the squat for longer.\n\nYes, this could be recreated with a friend telling you what to do/how long to do it (or perhaps a stopwatch), there is something fun about the mad and chaotic world this game is. \nAnd this is just a game about squatting; it pulls no punches. If you don't squat this might take a bit of time to get into, but it's certainly enjoyable. \n\nI'd love the devs to include other things too - there was/is a japanese gameshow where the contestants have to fit into specific shapes (rather than just squatting). This could - probably quite easily - be included in this kind of game.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487550681, "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025082190"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1487577648, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30052794", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1487577648, "votes_up": 2, "review": "Nice and simple - this is exactly what it says on the tin.
