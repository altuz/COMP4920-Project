Unfortunately its bow mechanics are quite poor. The bow hand controls aiming and the arrow hand only controls the pull of the arrow. That means twisting your bow hand completely changes the aim regardless of where your other hand is. The hit boxes aren't clean, and the armor on the mobs doesn't matter. The free bow games are much higher quality than this, sadly.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 2}]}
