The time it takes to code every aspects of the game,\nthe quality of the assets and environments all the way down to the initial planning phase was portrayed in the easter eggs scattered across the game world featuring interesting fourth wall breaking narrative. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Just like the hidden agenda demonstrated by the developer of Icey, Icey itself is a humanoid android created solely for the purpose of destroying the evil trying to cause chaos to the world. The directions to take, the instructions in any circumstances were provided by the narrator. It begs the philosophical question whether AI have thoughts or not and as reflected in game by the player's choice to follow or to do things your way could potentially leading to something unexpected.

I fought enemies, and not my controller so that's always a plus. I enjoyed the art very much, as well as the music. But where the game really shined IMO, was the narration. The voice from beyond getting annoyed at me when I ignored his directions genuinely amused the hell out of me. The naggging, the whining, the outright begging that occurs when you \"go off script\" is brilliant and a lot of fun. Especially since I'm a player who likes going past where I'm supposed to turn to see what's around the next corner instead.\n\nLike I said, I'm not sure what made me buy the game.
