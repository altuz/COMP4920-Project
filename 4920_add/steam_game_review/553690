Worth the price of admission alone. Took me by surprise actually, tight game that gets pretty addictive fast. Very nostalgic kick back to games like Desert Strike. Great viduals.

Lots of companies try to push their games from the mobile market on to steam and on many occasions have I seen them run horribly, have features stripped out and controls that just plain suck.\n\nThis game runs well, has removed the paid features; yet not removed the gameplay elements and it controls fairly well; I would highly recommend a gamepad though.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what they do with this.\n\nFeel free to check out my video below for some gameplay and more impressions:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeE-EBGTu4g", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1490697441, "num_games_owned": 1312, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970532816"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494336", "timestamp_updated": 1490689806, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28666135", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_created": 1482748277, "votes_up": 1, "review": "EDIT : Almost 2 months since I reported a few problems (including 3 achievements not unlocking), and 1.5 months since the last post from a dev. Changing this review to negative until I see any evidence that this game is actually still alive.\n\nEDIT2 : After 3 months of silence, the game is back on track, with a new update (on beta at the time I'm writing this, but should be released quickly), which fixed the last 3 achievements not unlocking and a texture problem on level 30 (and probably other things, but I don't have time anymore to retest everything). So this review goes back to \"recommended\" :)\n\nI had great fun with the first one (review over here : http://steamcommunity.com/id/merfab76/recommended/341730/) and so far, after 5 hours and nearly half-game I think, I have as much fun with this one.\n\nThis early access is very polished, and from what I can tell, the game is pretty much complete. I don't know what the devs have planned (apparently VR support ?), it could have easily been a release instead of an early access, it seems.\n\nAlmost everything I said on the review of the first one is still valid for this one (I have the feeling this one is a bit more difficult than the previous, though), if you want a little more details, here's the feedback I sent on the forums : http://steamcommunity.com/app/553690/discussions/0/154644787617726234/", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
