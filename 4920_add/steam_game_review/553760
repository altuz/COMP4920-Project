Anybody who has a background in loving older RPGs, such as the first several Final Fantasy games or games like Earthbound will find much to enjoy in Einlanzer. Since it is a very story driven RPG, which made me a fan, I will do this with hopefully zero spoilers.\n\nThe main thing that I look for in RPGs of this kind is the story and the characters, and in that way this game delivered. Just about each member of the party was individual, interesting, and carried story elements to play out later. Just about each of the several characters you can play had a good character arc, along with varied abilities that made each of them useful in specific areas. Also, the ability to customize each slightly allowed for an even more balanced party. Finn, Salome, Abel, Galadin, and Lucille in particular were great characters. \n\nLike all RPGs, a good party needs some good villains, and they were also multi-dimensional, with twists and turns in their development that were very well thought out. Also, the ability to alter the course of the action with your own decisions, shaping the game as you go along, is a really nice touch, making it more than just a hallway, or a game with little choice on how to proceed.\n\nTo be sure, you have to be down with old school sprites and turn based combat. The abilities and combat will also be very familiar to players of other RPG games of that type, especially those with familiarity with RPG maker. Some people will find the homages to other games and media either heavy handed at times or fun, depending on the player. However, if those suit you, and you are looking for a good older style RPG quest with great characters, caves, mountain tops, airships, and realms beyond, then I think Einlanzer will be worth a play through.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506905280, "num_games_owned": 702, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 159, "steamid": "76561198086087452"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504030", "timestamp_updated": 1506911843, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "35402608", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506911843, "votes_up": 2, "review": "Thus far its a pretty solid rpg-maker game.  I feel like it was made by someone who got what made older jrpg games fun to play, and doesnt necessarily feel like a shoddy rpgmaker halfass cobbling together of assets to try to make some side cash off a few hours of slapping it together.\n\nStory is servicable, not nearly the worst rpgmaker story, but no FF level of writing.  Combat is good but lacks the bells and whistles graphically, which is expected.  Havent gotten too far into the game but i feel like the balance is pretty good, not overly hard but not a total pushover in combat, the quest flows nice, there are lots of things to find ect.\n\nIn a sea of shit rpgmaker games this one is one of the better by far. If you are into old school jrpg games like this but hate how most rpgmaker games are just half assed attempts put this on your wishlist buy it...\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506360616, "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "steamid": "76561198246600384"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1506360256, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "35207147", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506360256, "votes_up": 1, "review": "This is a very good, solid RPG in the style of oldschool  final fantasy games.
