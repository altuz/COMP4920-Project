It shows us society from a different perspective than usual, and you could learn a lot from it.\n\nThis game reminds me of the old times when you only played those point and click games, but this game makes it a whole lot simplier.\n\nEven though I didn't understand a singel word, except for \"\u0434a\" and \"\u043d\u0435\u0442\", the plotline is simply stunning. At the end I thought something sad happend, so I almost cired myself to sleep. The black screen with the repeating text indicates that something sad happens, and maybe something that we have lost, and will never be able to get back.\nI also like the interfaces; they are amazing. In the main menu, you can click onto the credit screen and back, without it \"flashing\" or \"clip\" over like in other games, it just moves smoothly from one tab to another.\nIt wouldn't be the same without the multiple choices. I like that the way I play could effect the ending in so many different ways, but it should be said that I only found one ending. There are more endings to be discorvered, but the developers have done a good job of hiding them!\n\nThe pictures they have selected creates a good image of the living conditions some people are living in everyday of their life. You really begin to feel for them.\n\nTo summon up; this game is not in english, and i can't understand a single word, but i began to laugh my ass off when I saw the guy with the big nose and half his face cut out. I spent my hard earned 7 Norwegian Kroners on this game, and it was worth every penny. So I give this game a solid 10/10.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485803156, "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198087826135"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501736", "timestamp_updated": 1503581773, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "34460011", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1503581773, "votes_up": 2, "review": "horoso 10/rush b", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500259852, "num_games_owned": 2624, "num_reviews": 183, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198112866114"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501199", "timestamp_updated": 1500353401, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "33622647", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 6, "timestamp_created": 1500353401, "votes_up": 6, "review": "I online translated what's on the steam store page from the developer into English for your convenience.

Most people have become jutuberami, tape drives and other fraud, almost no one wants to be working cattle. No one has their own opinion. All imagined ourselves nigilistami, atheists, intellectuals and other elite readers. But the life of cattle has not changed, because all the people that sent this beast it is. So Jaissor is no longer Europe, it is now Ateisto-Rednecks. Led Ateisto are the people themselves, but rather those who engage in online activities. At the head of Cattle worth Nitup and it is this part of the country provides all necessary production Jaissor, because Ateisto people who believe that working for development of the backward people. \"\n\nDo you feel enlightened now? Personally I feel like I should have ran it maybe through an online decryption as well as an online translator. Will Russians ever stop speaking to us normal people in code?\n\nIf you\u2019re after a terrible low res pixelated visual novel in drunken broken code ramblings then this is the game for you. It's easy to 100% for achievement hunters just press space and option 1 till you get to the 161 mark and then press option 2, followed by spacebar and option 1 for the rest of the novel.\n\nSomeone wrote a review who claimed to understand both Russian and English and in their review informed us that it had a lot of Russian swear words in it, had a great story compared to that of the 'bibble' and had a sad ending.\n\nMy interpretation is that every Russian word looks like a swear word to me. I fully understand why they were swearing as they were really worried about this new disease which made all their incestuous faces look like they come from a mine craft world. They all go to Moscow to see a doctor who seems to have the same disease. The doctor fails, they all die, leaving empty buildings. Not sure if that was the actual story, but if it is i can see why it was compared to that of the 'bibble'. Who would have thought that God would bring an end to the world using a pixilation Armageddon. Well done dev.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3tUF84CxzfY\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502405258, "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995722368"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504341", "timestamp_updated": 1499684464, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33428028", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_created": 1499684464, "votes_up": 3, "review": "I can't understand shit  11/10\n\nWould buy again", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500112693, "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197990697658"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502297", "timestamp_updated": 1500111079, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33555268", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500111079, "votes_up": 1, "review": "\u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b, \u043d\u043e \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}]}
