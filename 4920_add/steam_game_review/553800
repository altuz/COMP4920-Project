If you want to try it out WAIT FOR A SALE!\n\nPros:\n\n- Music is original and fitting for the mood of the game\n- Graphics and settings are nice\n\nCons:\n\n- The pacing of the game made it near impossible for me to understand what was going on, it was basically one boss after another with one or two lines of dialouge about events that are never explained in between\n- The dodging system, in VR it's instinctive to try to dodge attacks by physically moving your body. For me it was really immersion breaking to dodge by holding the grip (only on the LEFT CONTROLLER) and shaking my head.\n- The voice acting, I can't say it's the worst I've ever heard, but it's pretty bad (granted the script they have to work with is really weak)", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
