You fail and then adapt from what you did wrong. You will be clumbsy at first. If you learn fast, you'll reach a little farther with each go. It's not for kids who aren't up to the challenge. Gridd forces you to develop your skill and doesn't skimp in the reward for your growth as you unlock the next mind-bending level of gameplay.\n\nTo properly enjoy Gridd you must absolutely pump the volume to a nice & loud setting with a halfway decent sound system. It doesn't hurt to sit as close as you can to your screen, either. \nI personally play with my blacklight humming in the background as ambiance.\nYou will achieve maximum nostelgia slipstream dizziness via audio-visual overdrive. \nGridd has a great sense of cyber space and its aesthetic value is neon.\n\nGood work.\n\nAnd it's just over 64 megabytes.

It's a high octane 80s synthwave that gets your pulse going and fits the sci-fi theme perfectly.\n\nIt's really hard to believe the game is only a 68 mb download.. if the game itself doesn't impress you, the developer's ability to compress data will..\n\nPS.
