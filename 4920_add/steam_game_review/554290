There's still a good portion of content I haven't seen in Himawari yet, I'm assuming that's the bad ends and the side story. After experiencing these routes I can say I have a new appreciation for this game as its plot is very interesting and much more than just simple humor. I loved realizing how all of the characters were 'related' to each other upon finishing all the routes. I'm not sure which route was supposed to be the true route or whether or not there was one at all [spoiler]I personally think it would be Asuka's route because it shows what happens five years later when there's been greater progress as far as space travel goes, Youichi has a position in the Saionji Group and has a daughter named Himawari. (Really curious what Cosmos was talking about at the end there, wonder if there's any continuation to that.) Where as the ending to episode 1 simply leaves off with Airies returning to space with Aqua and Akira after apologizing for causing the accident with her code (which we of course find out in Aqua's route that it wasn't her) and Aqua's route leaves off with Youichi and  Aqua traveling to various different countries. Asuka's route gave greater insight to Asuka herself as well as what would come in the future and seemed more like a true route, however, unfortunately Youichi doesn't remember Aoi fully in that route nor is it ever uncovered (to Aqua, Airies, and Youichi) that the accident was actually purposefully caused by Souichirou to get rid of the Lunar Virus. Nor is it revealed that Youichi is the only one who still has the Lunar Virus (I believe he got it from Aoi through there kiss because it can be transfered by mucus? I guess that means that now Asuka also has it, if she is still alive that is.) I hope that Youichi is able to learn all these secret in the Asuka route regarding the experiments on the Sunflower, Daigo, Aoi, and the crash as we know them.[/spoiler] All in all, I've enjoyed Himawari thus far and say it was well worth the read and money spent.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501826859, "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198160224136"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1501785160, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33998961", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1501785160, "votes_up": 1, "review": "Great VN.
