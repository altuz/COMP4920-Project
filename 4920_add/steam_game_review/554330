Playing the game rewards you with coins that you can use to upgrade your \"bird\" with better tougher chassis, more powerful engine, and taller ladder.\n\nLevel 1 starts and the handling is like 'mmeh, could be better' as the choppa responds to keyboard controls a bit slowly. The first couple of levels are just a piece of cake but then it gets a bit trickier. The rescuee may be standing in between to vertical cones and the ladder on your choppa is too short, and that darn seagull is on to get you. As it leaps onto the blades your dear choppa is going down in one black piece of charcoal! And you had just figured out how to swing the short ladder to the person!\n\nFortunately you can use your hard earned coins to opt in a replay of the level where the turmoil that darn bird caused is still visible. This is an interesting game mechanic as the levels are randomly generated but if you waste your choppa to clear out an easier fly patch that is blocked by, say, explosive barrels, you may replay the level and get more easy access to the rescuee.\n\nAnd once you've earled enough coins and you always seem to crash land at level 5, then that is the time when you remember the upgrades. The coins you earn and collect from rescues and and random coin boxes are good for an extension for the ladder. And maybe you also want to spend some on that engine, too, and some shields so you can fend off those haunting seagulls. Off you go! Oh, how smooth the ride is now! You may want to update that feeling of 'mmeh' to 'oh, cool!' at least once you reach max engine level 'cos that is when the game really begins to feel fun! It shouldn't take more than 30-45 minutes to reach that level so no heavy griding required.\n\nThe more you play, the more fun it gets. It is interesting to notice that at level 15 you will need to rescue two people on opposite sides of the map and the reward for the rescue of each is equalent to the amount of coins replay costs so you may want to make sure you get at least either one of them rescued before you end up sleeping with the fishes. That way should you crash and burn, the (replay) fun never ends! =P\n\nHardcore grinder gamers, rejoice!\nCasual gamers, enjoy!", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488164927, "num_games_owned": 913, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010424891"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1488242529, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30212461", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1488167619, "votes_up": 2, "review": "Choppa is an amusing little helicopter rescue game that plays a bit like Choplifter, but with bigger explosions and psychotic seagulls.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487883068, "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198138101163"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499028", "timestamp_updated": 1487967013, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30149390", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1487967013, "votes_up": 3, "review": "An odd little physics base game that has its ups'n'downs and even some that are both at the same time....\nThe latter is that you get to face a different \"playing field\" if you die which is good as it keeps the game fresh and bad as you can't really learn the level and how to improve through mistakes.
