I love PC golf games and to show my age, started with the wonderful \u201c Links\u2019, thru all the Tiger Woods series, and was so excited when I discovered The Golf Club 2. Well after over 30 hours of play I am still puzzled by this game. First off, it is EXTREMELY difficult. There is no difficulty setting, so expect horrifying scores for quite some time.  The steep learning curve for chipping and especially putting will have you wanting to put your foot thru your monitor, its that frustrating. I am no better now than when I started; I just can\u2019t get the feel of chipping and especially, the putting. Reading long puts is a joke, you often cannot see the hole, and speed and slope are all over the board. I\u2019ve taken 6 or 7 putts as I flail to gauge a green.  This is with a mouse and keyboard, maybe a controller would be more effective. To add to the misery,  the swing meter can also be unpredictable. You can make 5 perfect swings in a row and the sixth will hook you into the water. Bad shots can come out of nowhere and you just scratch your head.  Much has been written about possible server overload and swing lag. I don\u2019t know, but the you must be connected to the internet to open up all options; It would be nice to disable that just to see if it makes a difference. So this is a long way of saying I\u2019m not going to give up on this sim yet, but after 30 hours of game play I would have hoped for some improvement. At times its like you are battling the game rather than the courses. And, a career mode progression like the Tiger Woods series would be welcome. On a plus side, if you can break par for a round or two (which I'm not even close to doing), there are online tourneys going on reguarly which would be fun to compete in. This game is not for sissies....", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505416740, "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018000686"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502168", "timestamp_updated": 1505417319, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "34955765", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_created": 1505417319, "votes_up": 5, "review": "Certain things that are not appealing other than the game play.  One to be specific is the limited online play, while some of the scores there are way beyond competetive.  Amature golf leagues that have 18+ under par handicaps.  The swing mechanics are really cool though and the graphics are super.  But the reason I gave a thumbs down is the annoying announcers voice.  It also has unrealistic geometric plotting.  If the game is a traditional golf game it would have many options to choose from.  Club selection, skill level increases and putting green graphs that were more accurate.  All in all a good game for a person that likes to only play golf but for those of you that want more of a reward mechanism, I would look elsewhere.  No branding in game either.  Customizable looking clubs and shirt paints based on how much money you can make.  Overall the game is boring and not a winner for me.  But as always this is only an opinion.  There are others out there that are more than happy with this game.\n\nPros: Graphics, sounds, some customization\nCons: No actively realistic online play, Other players are posting \"Hack Like\" numbers on the golf courses.\n          No meter option and only the slide of the mouse is available.

The swing mechanic's are inconsistent in that not only do u have to be perfect with your controller being str8gt but ur timing has to be spot on if using the tour clubs and that timing will change as the game goes on . When using my controller , the timing on the backswing has to be held at the top for a period of time  before swinging or the swing is  very fast / fast  per the game function . The timing should be as the top of the backswing reaches the top and not held to get a perfect/perfect swing but that is not the case . With my controller I could not get a perfect/perfect swing without holding it longer . Distances on the clubs when in the rough or sand  penalize u with less power with that club but if u swing the club such as a chip , expect it to go farther than the club says if hitting with full power , because it rolls more than it should . When playing in tournements in the societies expect harsher penalties and clubs not reaching the specified distances if ur swing is lets  say slow / perfect by about 10 to 12 yards . this has just started happening . I CAN NOT recommend for someone to spend $40.00 on a game that its goal is to frustrate u more than the ENJOYMENT that u get out of it . Buy TGC1 , its much more playable than this version , especially since the same issues that were in it weren't fixed and they are still in TGC2 , such as when playing online with friends , 1 person seeing the ball go in and the other seeing it roll down the hill when he's the one that hit the shot ! Do not waste ur hard earned money on this game . The developers don't care about fixing any of these issues or what u think or say about the problems with this game .

That said it has some flaws (as you may have read) and also some MAJOR issues with difficulty scaling.\n\nAt first, I struggled with the game and I accepted it. No game should be immediately easy.  It took a good 5/6 rounds on standard clubs and very easy difficulty before I was breaking par for a single round, 2 under par being a big achievement. After setting up a career mode, 4 tournaments, 4 rounds with standard strokeplay. I found that I won 2 of these 4 events so decided to up the difficulty. Firstly from \"very easy\" to \"easy\" and secondly upping the distance and quality of my clubs from standard to player.\n\nTo give you an idea, on very easy I won 2 out of 4 tournaments with only 7 hours practice beforehand. My winning scores were Even par and +4. The other two events I struggled on and used as practice.\n\nNow compare that to when I upped the difficulty to \"easy\". The winning score on the same course (with similar conditions) was 45 under par. 45 UNDER PAR FFS! Now even on extreme hard difficulty that would be ridiculous. If you turned on your TV and saw a player shooting 45 under par for a 4 round tournament you would think you had entered the twilight zone!!!!! This needs fixing, desperately as it knocks the confidence of the player. Some players will not have the extra time available that is needed to just even hit 50% Greens in regulation or even +5 over for a round.\n\nMy other whinges are as follows; More information needs to be readily available as regards the lie of the golf ball. You are given a % gauge of how clean your contact will be but it's a complete guessing game half the time. Some shots require you to club up 3 clubs from the heavy rough and other times you will go sailing 50 yards over the green with the exact same conditions under ball.\n\nMy minor whinges are that some greens appear to play like glass, even when they are listed as \"medium speed\" you can be sat waiting for your ball to stop moving for upwards of 15 seconds a time, which brings me onto my final gripe that your shot should be skippable by pressing enter. It would allow the player to enjoy more of the game other than feeling exrtemely frustrated at having to watch your golf ball skid around on a glass like green 80 yards from the cup.\n\nOverall, as I said I will score the game positively. Despite its flaws it does have potential, it hasn't been out too long and if some scaling of dfficulty could be better implemented then this is the best golf game on the market. \n\nI recommend a purchase ONLY if you are patient and ONLY if you really really like golf. Otherwise you'll get pissed off, real fast.\n\n6/10", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505960045, "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960456204"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499035", "timestamp_updated": 1505960282, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "35095717", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_created": 1505960282, "votes_up": 4, "review": "This game could use some work.
