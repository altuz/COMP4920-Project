The high points are the writing, the music, and the environments.  \n\nThe writers really should give themselves a pat on the back.  Great characters and dialouge choices, and some of the books really had me chuckling.\n\nThe music is beautiful and really works with the forest environment.  Together they're quite transportative.  The only downside was the contrast was a little high and there was no way to reduce it.  After a while it made it a little uncomfortable to look at, but not game-breaking.\n\nThe first quest is where I stopped playing as I was playing with a laptop trackpad and had trouble finding all the items in the training ground.  I felt it was a bit of a lame quest to kick the game off with.   I get that you want to build up to more epic things, but that doesn't mean you have to go all out cliche with the early quests; \"find X items and put them in crate Y\".  I was surprised after all the lore in the intro and the scattered books that it wasn't a more unique quest.  \n\nAll in all, beautiful environments and music, and well written.  Looking forward to playing more!\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
