The game deals solely with resource management. One of the new game mechanics that come along with the newest generation of little kingdom. Is the ability to steal your enemies resource given that you have enough \"relationship\" with that particular enemy. This gives you a fighting chance if you happen to be behind at a later stage in the game.\n\nGiven a few bugs (Mainly text going off the screen) and spelling errors this game is rather fun. The AI (depending on the map) can give you a challenge. Although in most of my games the weakness of the AI happens to be its lack of defense around important resources. Ofcourse it will be more fun with local multiplayer friends.\n\nI want to note here I did not play the games campaign whatsoever.\n\nMy main complaints about this game are...\n\n-It is always about the next tier resource. The player who gets the next level of tower first will dominate. The ability to steal resorces gives losing players a saving chance. However, capturing a tower of the next highest level is far too difficult. My example; there are 4 resources clay, wood, stone, and iron. Capturing a lone stone tower takes 5 wood towers. While capturing a lone iron tower takes 4 wood and 3 stone towers. The cost to capture enemy towers seems a bit expensive.\n\n-No custom map making, you can give the map generator custom options but if you wanted to replay a specific map it is highely unlikely to regenerate the same map twice.\n\n-Text goes off the screen very often\n\n-It is far too easy to accidentaly to terraform land into water when trying to build a tower\n\n-Trading items over the market takes ALL of the resource you are trying to trade. The exception is later in the game when your market is high enough you can trade for 250 of a resource exactly", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505280691, "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198228961260"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "timestamp_updated": 1487524158, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "30039787", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1487524158, "votes_up": 1, "review": "Game is fun to play although since the Latest update both my friend and I have found ourselves unable to load the game.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
