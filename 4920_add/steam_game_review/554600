It's painful how serious that statement is, but at the same time my hat is off to the devs.\n-They cleaned up the answer table in the combat system from hiragana battle. It is much easier on the eyes\n-The voice acting is straight up better than like 75% of dubbed anime, which was a pleasant surprised\n-Inclusion of a 'practice' mode unlocked through normal gameplay (I think it was chapter 5 or 6). Didn't use it yet, but I might come back to it if I feel I need to review.\n-This game has a bit more personallity than it's predecessor which was a nice touch\n\nCons:\n-A few bugs, Couldn't get WASD controls to work. Final affection cutscenes lagged / froze to the point where I thought it would crash the game (it did not). The game did crash on me once after running it for  about 6 or 7 hours, I'm not sure why. I didn't bother checking the error log and it didn't happen again. And yeah, I played this from start to finish in one sitting. I know, I'm such an overachiever, stop, y'all gonna make me blush.\n-If you played Hiragana battle you probably remember when they switched the Hiragana enemies for Romaji ones and you had to answer with the corresponding Hiragana. It really helped etch those suckers into memory IMO. This happens in Katakana War as well, but it's too easy. That new cleaned up Answer table makes it a little too easy to common sense your way to the correct choice (Ie. If you remember which column is which vowel). This is essentially nit-picking as any practice is helpful, but I figured I'd mention it.\n-They cleaned up the combat gui a bit which, while asthetically pleasing, leaves me with one eensie-weensie bone to pick. In Hiragana Battle when selecting the Hiragana to answer there was another box in the menu you could look at to select the hiragana as well as the highlighted sprite. This was nice because the hiragana were displayed there in a more normal text-like font as opposed to the sprite's more artistic / calligraphic versions. I can't read the common text katakana nearly as well as I could the common text hiragana right after finishing the game. It's not a huge deal, there are only a few that look all that different, and if I stop and think for a minute I can usually figure it out without having to check an appendix or anything like that, it's just that the comprehension isn't quite as well as a result of not seeing both for the 8 or 9 hours I spent playing / learning. Ironically the best resource for reading the texty fonty katana is that Romaji Answer table I just whined about. After unlocking all the Katakana I took a moment to look it over and screenshotted it for reference.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Will teach you Katakana in an entertaining fashion. Eagerly awaiting Kanji Combat which I believe was confirmed by the devs on a forum post somewhere, although there is no Kickstarter page as of 9/2017.\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
