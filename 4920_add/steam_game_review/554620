Mostly because of the relatable characters. the art style, amazing soundtrack and the fact that the people behind the games have taken a big risk by making games about high school girls, even tho those type of games are rarely popular.\n\nIt's shame to see people hating the game because of they know what is going to happen to Rachel after all this, but guess what, people die, after every story (Unless it's a story about immortal people or something, I dunno.) I wanna know how that happens in Rachel's case and I wanna know more about her as a character and how she changed Chloe as a person so much. It's not important what's going to happen in the end, the journey how we get there is more important.\n\nAlso people who are hating the game, because they hate Chloe as a character. (I don't understand you, but it's okay.) Personally Chloe is a really important character for me, she has tons of flaws for sure, but that's what makes her interesting, more interesting protagonist that Max ever was, even when Max had her time traveling powers. Max's only flaw was basically that she was a shy girl, she didn't have any childhood trauma, she had basically nothing about her to make her interesting in any way. Just like every other Tv-Serie/Movie/Anime protagonist, but that makes her relatable for many people, which makes it okay. But I think it's a good change to get a character with more depth than that for once.\n\nAlso people who think Chloe doesn't have big ol' crush on Rachel, what are you even doing here. I think it's ridiculous how after all the billion times that Chloe talked about Rachel in the first game all \"You're putting it mildly\" when Max said that \"[Rachel] was obviously a good friend.\" Some of you still manage to think they are just some good pair of gal pals.\n...Whatever floats your boat, I guess.\n\nIf you hate the cringey voice lines... well... I'm not going to say anything. Except for me it really makes the game and makes the game little bit less serious tbh.\n\nBut yeah, I'm going to approve this game for now. The first episode was great, I love the new facial animations and lip synch is much better than in the first game. Graphics look the same, so that's cool. Soundtrack is amazing, fits into the game very well. Story is interesting so far and the new characters are great.
