Don't get drawn-in like I was by the stillshots of the whole bar in chaos and people shooting each other.  That doesn't happen at all.\n\nThis bar serves as about a 5-minute play-around area with nothing more to do than to house the minigames which are, sadly, pretty boring and, in explicably cost money that doesn't seem to have any other purpose in the game.\n\nThe graphics are pretty poly for a game that's not in Early Access and over the $3.00 price range.  I get that it's part of the \"art\" of the game.  But, when that's ALL you have in the game?  I don't count that as a positive characteristic.\n\nI don't recommend this game unless you're looking for a very short diversion since most of the minigames are literally a 1 to 2 minute task (besides bartending which just kind of ends when you run out of glasses and have to figure out how to end the minigame gracefully and keep your cash).  Not worth the $10 they are asking by any stretch of the imagination.  Definitely a good buy as part of a bundle or a cheap addition to round out a game library.

While the mini games aren't really anything you haven't seen before (with maybe the exception of the \"Chicken Feast\" game that has you bobbing your head like a maniac), they are all designed well and provide a pretty good challenge. The cartoony art style is very charming and the saloon provides enough stuff to interact with to make the experience worthwhile.\n\nThat said, I still feel Cowbots & Aliens is the superior Wild West VR game, as it also lets you mess about in a old-timey saloon but with the added bonus of being able to do it with your friends.
