In many ways the combat system makes the game and ButterChain has done a great job on the pacing. Its loads of fun, well worth the price, and extremely engaging.\n\nGameplay - Gameplay consist of story, followed travelling across overhead map (more on that in a sec), followed by a boss fight and then more story (with story potentially pushed in at any point in a stage). \n\nOverhead map - Each stage consist of overhead map with various routes (all leading left). Each of these routes has various sprites distributed on it. These can signify battles, money, items, traps, etc. The arrows along the bottom of the screen choose your route. Along with the arrows are various other effects that are only good when used in battle such as special attacks and health recovery. This is interesting as it introduces an element of resource management into each stage. As you use an arrow or item the remaining tiles will slide to the right and a new tile will show up at the end of the line. Some of the arrows allow you to go more than one direction and you get to choose which one.  If you choose an item that is not an arrow it sends you in a random direction. Once you reach the far left hand of the stage you have a boss fight.\n\nCombat - the arena is broken up into three different areas. You are controlling three characters (fighter, general, magician) that share a health bar. So its all or nothing for everybody. The enemies will attack by moving from left to right towards you. The fighter is the one you will controll the most and who is in the main portion of the arena. You attack by click into empty space in the arena and your fighter will do a dash attack to the place that you clicked. The fighters attack power will go down over time but can be recovered by standing still (but this opens her up to attack), The General controlls a line of troops that are protecting your magician. They do this by firing projectile weapons and bouncing the enemy back, The magician fires projectiles across the screen with more damage being done the closer the enemy gets. Additionally attacks can be pulled off by using any of the arrows or items on the row at bottom of the screen. Those arrows now literally fire lasers across the screen. The main attack area is split into three lanes, so if the enemies are up top it helps to send a laser down the top lane and so on. Its always awesome to have a laser that fires down all three lanes at once. This is where the resource management comes into the game by controlling the row of tiles on the bottom of the screen - because you need a balance of health by holding on to hearts, choices of where to move on the map by holding onto arrows, and choices of attack by holding onto anything else. One strategy I would often use is barrelling through as many of my attacks as possible in an attempt to load up on hearts right before the boss battles. The combat continues to grow and evolve througout the game - I could cover it detail but it would only detract from the experience. Needless to say there is a rudimentary elemental system to the attacks but it soon becomes easy enough to switch that up to suit the needs of the indvidual stage. ButterChain did a great job of introducing new gameplay elements/mechanics all the way up to the end. This really helps keep the player engaged and stops the game from becoming what might otherwise become a tiresome experience. \n \nMusic - Great, fits the mood.\n\nGraphics - very entertaining, lots of small details kepts making me smile\n\nStory - cute in a way that makes you like the characters but without being sappy or filled with sexual innuendo (but warning the english is very broken - to the point that there is an apology for it from at the beginning of the game - but its serviceable and eventually grows into part of the game's charm). \n\nOverall I say Overwhelmingly positive for my review. Supposedly all created by one guy... maybe 2? Maybe a girl, not a guy? I don't know. Props either way - beautiful, engaging, JRPG with a unique battle system.\n\nTL:DR - You get to fight pastries who charge at you carrying bibles, crucifixes, and lots of jam. Play it, good luck.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
