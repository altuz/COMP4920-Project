I thought it was loading forever when it first started up and I am staring at blackness. Eventually I have the sense to look around and see the night sky through a small opening in the darkness. Then I look to my feet... aaah. Now I am there, in a viking tomb, immersed. Really cool. \n\nUnfortunately I am stuck though. I have no idea how to open the box and even less idea about the tumblers. From the comments here I did look very closely at the floor and have passed that stage, but it just confused me even more! \n\nOne small issue is that it is possible to walk through the walls and see things or even stick your head in the box. Other VR games usually make everything black beyond where you can see.\n\nAnyway if someone could point to a walkthrough or give me a hint about how to open the box I would really appreciate it!", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
