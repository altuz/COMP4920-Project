Stay away from this. You're welcome.\n\n---\n\nThis is a tough one for me, because I legitimately want to recommend this game. Every time I start it up I get a little excited, the game just looks so promising. You know it's not going to be Madden but it looks like one of those neat little PC gems with so much potential. However, pretty quickly things go off the rails.\nThe customization options are nice, every player's skills can be modified from 1 \u2013 99, but unless you want to make a team of absolute beasts with 99 skills all over the place what's the point? Kicking 80 yard field goals is fun at first but it obviously gets old quickly. You can also customize your team's jerseys, again pretty cool on its face, but this isn't enough to get me into the game.\nThe actual football of this game is borderline atrocious. Players fly into the air after being tackled or, alternatively, magically dodge every tackle even when players slam directly into them. Passing with the mouse, for me at least, is rough; lotta interceptions and incompletes. There's no penalties, no trading in franchise mode, no free agents, no injuries, and I didn't play it long enough to find out but it doesn't look like there's any  kind of draft; so essentially you just play the same season over and over again, there's no progression. Also, if you ask your coach to just suggest a play on offense it doesn't even tell you if it's a pass or run play. The whole presentation of the actual game is fairly lacking as well, just bland. \nOverall, if this is your only choice for football I guess ... I mean... maybe? It depends on how desperate you are, and that's the key word here: desperate.  If you have Madden, stick with Madden. I know it's unfair to compare this game to Madden but what else is there to compare it to? Maybe get Blood Bowl instead, that game is fun as hell. This would've been a really fun game in the PS2 era, but even with the lowered expectations that go along with indie PC titles this just isn't worth it.
