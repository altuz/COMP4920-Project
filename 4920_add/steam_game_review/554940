The music suits the game well, and the narrator's dialogue has a 'portal'esque sarcastic feel that was entertaining (if a little out of place given the world-ending alien invasion), and the controls are quick to pick up. However, the feel of the droid you control, the weapons you use, and the enemies you fight have no real substance. There is no feedback to being hit, no excitement to killing enemies, and you'll find yourself standing next to the objective unloading your clip x3 without much of a feeling of accomplishment. The game feels largely uninspired, and plays mostly like an extremely short '90s FPS. For <$2.00, I'd go for it for an experiential 30 minutes, but as is I can't recommend.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
