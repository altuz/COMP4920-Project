That's it, that's all that I've found good about this.  Mercs are ugly and you have no customization ability.\n\nSquad control is where this game falls horribly flat.  Very clunky camera controls and, even worse, switching between squads in order to try and flank enemy units is a nightmare and potentially game ending when your unit becomes blocked by the un-interactive scenery and you can no longer see the enemy units to fire at them.  Your mercs will not fire at enemy units unless you tell them to engage.\n\nYou go from a very simplistic tutorial into a hard-core, very unforgiving story-mode/side missions.  And the scenarios are all-or-nothing.  If you do not successfully complete the mission you get zip, zero, nothing.  There's three hours of your life you won't get back.\n\nNot sorry that I paid money for a game that I've already deleted off my computer.  I don't mind helping game developers put new products on  the market.  But this game is very frustrating and the fun-factor is about equal to a bent-brick.
