Great jobs, devs.  \n\nFor the devs (and these are nitpicky, I admit) - maybe I'd like to see losses maybe give slightly more coins than they do now (like 2 coins, which is almost nothing) - I think that'd be slightly more forgiving to people new to the sport and help with gameplay motivation.  \n\nSecondly the in-game controllers show the Vive wands - I really hope the dev will one day consider the native Oculus SDK so in-game controllers / buttons show the Touch controllers, and Oculus Home users would get the bonus if the game automatically showing up in home vs launching in Steam VR (which at the time of writing is a recently added Oculus Home feature)", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503270696, "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198323020498"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1501720164, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33982193", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1501720164, "votes_up": 2, "review": "ok i just want to be clear for everyone wondering... this game is 100% playable with the RIFT + TOUCH. granted you see the vive controller on your left hand but so what thats gonna get updated in a few weeks. all the buttons work, everything is repositionable (height, angle, direction of the table and the degree of tilt you want on your paddle) i highly recommend this game.i play table tennis everyday at work during lunch and i also own Eleven: table tennis and even tough i would recommend that game aswell i think Racket Fury feels more realistic.

I'll give a positive rating because it has a lot of potential, but right now it's a very mixed bag with a lot of room for improvements. The graphics are very good, superior to Paddle Up and Eleven TT, Sound is nice, but right now multiplayer isn't working and you can only play against the robots. The most important point in such a game is physics, atm the simulation grade is something between Paddle Up and Eleven TT. The ball seems to be too heavy or air friction too high or a mix of both. The racket needs more realistic behaviour (effect of rubber and sponge in different situations, how bounce and dampening work with or against each other), i played around with the settings but couldn't find something that matches my real life experience. A cool feature would be separate settings for fore- and backhand rubber properties. I requested a refund and may come back later, but i think the price is just too high. Setting the price range permanently to something between 9-15 bucks might help building up a bigger multiplayer community.\n\nI changed my review after re-testing the free demo. Unless the devs give more info about the roadmap, including heavy work on the physics and AI, i can't recommend this game. Ball and racket physics aren't anywhere near the real thing, the racket just plays like a piece of hard wood and the ball is way too slow, feels too heavy and doesn't behave like in real-life.
