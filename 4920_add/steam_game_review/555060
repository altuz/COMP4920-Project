When I first bought it I was able to play as a goalkeeper only, but recently the devs have added a mode in which you can shoot the ball with your feet into the opponent's goalpoast as well (you will need a Vive tracker for that, and if I remember correctly, you might be able to strap one of your vive motion controllers to your feet and achieve the same result. \n\nGraphics is excellent and so is the physics and overall gameplay. A large play area is highly recommended, and my space size is only 2.3m X 2.3m but I have played with motion assist set to 125 percent with no issues. Has simulator, arcade, freeroaming, multiplayer and story mode. \n\nAs for the gameplay itself, you really do feel like you are catching the balls when they hit your gloves. Immersion is guaranteed! The game is very easy to master at first but gets harder progressively. \n\nI give it a very positive 9/10 rating. \n\nP.S. Gives you an excellent physical workout too :-)", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500681185, "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198062547070"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502127", "timestamp_updated": 1500688570, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "33710301", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 5, "timestamp_created": 1500688570, "votes_up": 5, "review": "as a free mobile game maybe, but not worth over a tenner. i know vr is a new market but this game is so basic.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
