I originally bought this game to remove an awkward $8 from my wallet. What I received was a thoroughly interesting story told through unique methods which further entice the player.\n\nPros:\n-The story is well written, and (without spoiling), David Wehle does an amazing job at telling an emotional story, and speaking personally, did a brilliant job with the pacing. This can be described by the popularly coined \"walking simulator\", but the pacing was well done to the point where the walking didn't seem boring, and the distance wasn't long enough to disengage the player from the story.\n-The visuals are absolutely mesmerising. The game does an exceptional job at using light and shadows to create a vibrant and beautiful landscapes. Whether it's a starlit night sky, or an Autumn grassland, this game is an artistic masterpiece, and fully immerses the player in the game.\n-The soundtrack for this game really impressed. The music was composed by Josh Kramer (with other musicians contributing in part, but primarily by Kramer), who seems to have a brilliant understanding of how to use music to evoke strong feelings of sadness and nostalgia with a powerful score. Music can be an area which is subjective to a lot of people, so it can be hard to unanimously impress, but the overwhelming result in the review section agrees that this soundtrack is astonishing, and I am yet to hear a negative complaint.\n\nYou can tell a lot of energy and care went into this game, and it really reflects.\n\nI genuinely can't think of any cons of this game. However, there are factors to be considered before purchase.\n-This is a game with a particular niche. This is a storytelling game which excels at what it aims to do. However, if you are more of an action based player, this might not be a game you will enjoy. It mainly consists of walking from point A-B. You may find it boring if you expect it to be an action game or one with multiple functions, but the devs dont lie about what it is. If you purchase expecting it to be a massive game with gruelling action, it's your fault.\n-The playtime for this game is short. I completed it in 1.3 hours. I would replay it in the same sense as I would re-read a book: knowing how it ends, but to relive the experience I had reading it prior, to a slightly dulled extent. If you don't want to spend the money on what is essentially a 1 hour game, that is understandable. However, I don't regret buying it in the slightest, and would encourage others to buy it.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best storytelling games I've ever played. The entire team obviously cared about it a lot. Everythng, from the voice acting to the design is very well done, and thinking of real, unambiguous cons felt really forced. HOWEVER, the $8 pricetag is a bit excessive for a 1.3 hour game, and I would encourage to wait until a sale to buy it if money is an issue. I would absolutely recommend this game to someone looking for a short game with a big reward. However, I would encourage one to think before purchase to make sure it fits their desired criteria.\n\n8/10", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505553388, "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079607854"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526165", "timestamp_updated": 1505612887, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "35011563", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505612812, "votes_up": 11, "review": "I have mixed feelings about this game, but ultimately recommend it if you enjoy walking simulators. The atmosphere and feel of this game was amazing, and I really liked the art style. The story was good, if not a bit short, but I really liked the message, and I enjoyed the ending.\n\nThe most polarizing thing about this game, however, is that it rewards exploration inconsistently. On the one hand, there are 150 little pieces of light in the game, many of which involve going very out of your way to find, so the game is imploring the player to explore. But on the other hand, I would sometimes get genuinely lost and have to start the level over to find out where I was.\n\nI'm going to be a bit vague here to avoid spoilers, but this is especially a problem in a couple of the later levels where you are expected to follow something to get to your destination. I lost track of the thing I was following and got completely lost in giant patches of forest that had no apparent reason for being there. After twenty minutes, I restarted the level and followed more closely.\n\nOther than that, I enjoyed the game quite a bit, and would recommend it for players who like this style of game. Recognize that it's short, though. Many players report beating it in about an hour. I went out of my way to do things like find the edge of the world, or find glitches to climb mountains I was not supposed to be able to climb and get to areas I was not supposed to be in, and I still only played for about 3 hours.

It really is a beautiful game, with perhaps an even more beautiful message. \n\nI wouldn't really call The First Tree fun to play. It was very challenging to collect some of the stars and I ended up giving up on some of the ones you had to jump for simply because it was such a pain. I suppose that's the whole point, though, that parents go out of their way to do things for their children. There were times when I got bored running across the map looking for things, and despite all this running around I did things out of order and I missed a major part of the fox's story which I was super bummed about. It messed up the experience for me quite a bit but I still got the message and it still grabbed my heart to the point of tears. The point is not to have fun, though, but to listen to a story while experiencing it within another. In other words, you experience the main story through the fox's journey. It does this very well.\n\nThe music is what makes this game as successful as it is. It's slightly forced but very powerful nonetheless. Not to discredit other aspects of the game, because the landscapes are simply gorgeous. The most exciting thing was to come up over the top of a hill and look out on a beautiful horizon with new lands to continue my journey on. \n\nI would not recommend this game to someone who is looking for action-packed adventure. This game is not for the shallow or the impatient. Wait for a sale. \n\nI would, however,  recommend this game to someone who can see beauty in nature and enjoys taking their time, or anyone who is going through a rough point in their life.

Screw those children you're supposed to be looking for, wooden trains are cooler. \n\nAll in all I think it's worth ten bucks, but only if you specifically want a good story, not exciting gameplay. I'd only really play this if I wanted to relax, but given I have other games for that, I don't really have a need for it. I think I'd be interested if the game got more things and activities wheren't limited to prop-hunting, but until then I'll keep watching and my money.
