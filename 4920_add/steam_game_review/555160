It's basically CS:GO in VR and after a few hours of playing I can say that I had a ton of fun and give this game an 8/10.\n\nPros:\n- The game runs very well on my PC (GTX 970, i5 4670k, 16gb RAM)\n- Gameplay overall feels very good. Gun handling and reloading takes some practice, but after a while you can get really good at it. I feel like I improved my aim and reload speed by a whole lot since my first round.\n- Maps and game modes are fun. Currently there's Search&Destroy (think defuse in CS:GO) and Team Deathmatch. New maps can be easily downloaded ingame from the workshop, which makes the play sessions feel fresh and exciting. In addition there's remakes of popular CS maps like de_dust2, de_aztec and cs_office etc. Playing these maps in VR and actually feeling like you are there is a real mind-blow.\n\nCons:\n- Spawn mechanics in Team Deathmatch are awful. It feels like the game doesn't do any checks for nearby players. This means that you'll sometimes spawn 2m next to an enemy and either get lucky and get a free kill or get killed before you can pull your gun. This aspect had me frustrated a couple of times. Maybe spawn protection would also be a good idea? This even happened when playing 1v1 with a friend, so there were more than enough available safe spawn points on the map. davevillz please fix ...\n- Body shots only do minor damage while headshots kill instantly (without helmet). This needs some balancing in my opinion. Maybe some sort of optional hardcore mode could be nice. I feel like this game could be a direct competitor for Onward, if a hardcore mode would be added. More realistic damage models would certainly get my adrenaline pumping in this game.\n- Map loading bug: Once every other hour the game refuses to load the selected map and instead loads the default one, which is Datacenter. This can be quite annoying since a lot of people will leave the server, because they don't want to play Datacenter yet again ...\n- Occasional menu bugs: Sometimes the menu gets stuck or doesn't let me switch to European servers. Only a restart fixes this. Not a biggie but still annoying.\n- The game lobby feels very bare bones. I guess this is work-in-progress, but should be mentioned imo. An atmospheric game lobby, maybe a proper shooting range with animated NPCs would be really cool. Or let the player base create their own through the workshop? Currently it's only plain grey walls with a rudimentary tutorial.\n\nIf this game receives frequent updates and the dev listens to the community, then I'm certain that this game will get huge in the long-run.\n\nWell done davevillz!", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505595240, "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960456231"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1504978292, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "34842560", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504978292, "votes_up": 1, "review": "CS:VR \n\nHonestly, I was skeptical.
