The play times of these reviewers vary from 2-3 hours to as much as 13+ hours (which contradicts with the play times of the most recent reviews, some of which are less than 1 hour). Two of the helpful/recommended reviews are almost identical; to paraphrase, they both praise the true ending, and are both one sentence long in total.

It had, in my opinion, a very interesting story that hooked me to find out more and characters that I had formed close bonds with! \n\nIn a quick summary of the game's basic plot: You are Axel, a 17 year old highschool student who goes out on Halloween night with his two friends Alfred, and Steven to investigate a strange forest where people have mysteriously disappeared. It's from there that the game is a roller coaster ride of effective atmosphere, tension, and emotions. The music is great and add's to the scenes, the characters are memorable and are easy to get attached to, the story is interesting and emotional, and the overall vibe of the game is dark and lonely.
