Or if you are a chinese like myself, heard stories like these growing up, Detention will definitely make you shit bricks. For example, much like how holding breaths works in this game, Our elders used to tell us, that if you are walking at night alone and hear someone call your name from behind, DO NOT turn your head around. Chances are whatever calling you is not human, and if you do turn around, you will blow out the \"candles\" on your shoulder, weaken your Yang spirit and allow the unclean to hurt you. We also know that jade will protect you from evil. Some of my friends actually claim that their jade bracelette shattered after a supernatural encounter, otherwise they'll fall ill. Also, you must never walk over the burnt joss papers or sacrificial food for the dead, lest you provoke the spirit and get latched onto. \n\nThere are so many creepy lores like these, I have always been wondering, why won't anyone make good use of them. But here we are , red candle games nailed it! It managed to bring my worst childhood nightmare to life. \n\nBut Detention is more than just ghost scares and creepy sound effects. It has a tragic history behind it.  The 1950s was the time of \"White Terror\" in Taiwan. During the decade martial law was enforced and numerous people were arrested, tortured and killed due to...well, due to political differences. You can google it further. The terrible truth behind the game really gets under your skin. \n\nDespite that it may be the best chinese game ( I realize that tagging it ' Chinese' may trigger some people, but really, go educate yourself before you jabber about xxx independence in my face ) I have seen in the recent years, I personally think that the puzzels are a little too linear and easy.
