So that's good. The written English instructions need a lot of revising. Most of it is formatted strangely/incorrectly. The ability to hurl a lightning bolt at enemies is very nice, but feels very difficult to execute. I think you have to swing your controller at a certain speed and then hit the trigger, if you're swinging too slow then the lightning bolt never leaves that player's hand. Because you have to control your velocity, you also have to somehow set your aim to hit these small targets on the field. It would be better to allow the player to aim the lightning bolt with their gaze, and require them to use high velocity swing and trigger to release at gazed target. Or, remove the velocity based throwing requirement altogether, because it's quite frustrating to reliably use it when you have to wait for the meter to get to 100% before it does its full damage potential.\n\nI found there was too much to dislike with the user interface and the type of physical actions you expect the player to make with the controllers to get simple actions working. Interface concerns aside, I also felt deck building seemed nonsensical. Why not just build a deck with only enemies that require 10 \"turns\" to cast? There seems no benefit to the smaller creatures at all, or even a tactical advantage to having them. There seems to be a maximum amount of creatures you can have in your deck, but all creatures seemed to do the same thing: charge into enemy field, and eventually die while fighting your opponent's summoned troops. \n\nThis game kinda looked like fun, and I'm glad I had a chance to try it, but I'm not ever going to play it again unless some of the concerns I have are addressed. It doesn't seem like there are any other people playing this, or if they are, they're not active on the forums, I don't know what to expect from this game's future.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
