It's compounding a punishment when there is absolutely no need for it.\n\nAlso, I don't like the tactile feel of this game. Hitting enemies with weapons is unsatisfying, as there are often no hit markers and even the basic enemies require multiple hits. Because of this, the game feels sluggish, even though the ship moves quite fast.\n\nVisuals are pretty OK, but overal I just dislike too much about this game and can't recommend it to anyone.
