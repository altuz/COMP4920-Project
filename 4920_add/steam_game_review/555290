Paradiso/[/i]\n\nOnce upon a time I bought Little Briar Rose (a game made by Italian developers from Elf Games Works) because I\u2019m fond of stories about true love. It\u2019s a pity that true love can be found mainly in fairy tales.\nAs you can see Little Briar Rose is based on the well-known Brothers Grimm's Fairy Tale Briar Rose which contemporary audiences might better remember this fairy tale as Sleeping Beauty (named so by Charles Perrault).\n\n[u] Graphics[/u]\n\nLittle Briar Rose makes a good first impression with its visual style. \nReally the very colorful stained glass artwork in the game is delightful eye candy.\nThe sprites are big and detailed (put attention of what happens with the main character when you lose). The places, and the characters themselves, are designed in a beautiful stained glass style, enhancing the whole fairytale atmosphere of the game. \n\n[u]Story[/u]\n\nThe game tells the prince's journey through the thorn covered path to the sleeping princess\u2019s castle. Along his journey he\u2019ll meet various communities of fairy folk (gnomes, spriggans, mermen and fairies themselves) and complete a number of quests in order to clear the thorny path and eventually wake the sleeping princess with a kiss of true love. The story may sound straightforward and clich\u00e9 but it has its own quirky sense of humor and an interesting twist at the end.\n\nDialogues with NPC are humorous and flesh out the magical world that players will find themselves in while playing Little Briar Rose. \nThe only issue with the dialogues is that the developers\u2019 native language obviously is not English as they should really have hired someone who could do a better job localizing the text.\nYou can find some odd typos in the game.\n\nBesides the game ends rather abruptly which I honestly found disappointing. To my perplexity there\u2019s not any sort of real climax in such a graceful game.\n\n\n[u] Gameplay[/u]\n\nAs an adventure puzzle game Little Briar Rose blends point and click clue finding with puzzle solving and fun mini games for entertainment. \n\nAlthough the game takes place over seven screens there\u2019re some mini games which pop up at pivotal moments and range from fishing to following a woodland creature's cooking instructions, are nicely presented and easy to understand, but rarely provide much of a challenge.\n\nIf players are stumped they can get a hint but they\u2019ll have to solve an easy jigsaw-puzzle first (four kinds of them).\n\nOne little detail I like is that the intro mentions that hundreds of princes have attempted to break the spell and failed. If you fail a puzzle, you stand a good chance of being turned into a spriggan (or any other fairy folk), and a new prince will immediately pick up the inventory where your previous prince left off, effectively restarting the puzzle. \n\nI must say that certain things can\u2019t be picked up at first but then all of a sudden can after some completely unrelated event. Or that items will appear that weren\u2019t there before, again with no real explanation. I understand if it\u2019s triggered by a very obvious related event that would make you think of looking for or checking on the item. [spoiler]But I couldn\u2019t figure out why I couldn\u2019t pick up the rose in the beginning of the game but could after clearing out a path unconnected to it. Or why a mirror suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Since there\u2019s no \u00abhot spot\u00bb locator players could miss this vital object simply because it wasn\u2019t there the last time they were in the gnomes\u2019 village.[/spoiler]\n\n[u]Sound and music [/u]\n\nThe sound effects are almost nonexistent, or not good to be noticeable (the only one I remember clearly is the \u201cbroken screen\u201d effect every time you fail in a mission). \nIn regards of the music there\u2019s one main theme (standard \u201cmagic\u201d one) you\u2019ll hear for almost the whole game. \nBut if the developers had no composers in the team they could use the classic music, e.g. music to a ballet Sleeping Beauty composed by Pyotr Tchaikovsky.\n\n[u]Steam achievements [/u]\n\nYou can take all the achievements during two or three walkthroughs (less than three hours) but there\u2019re some problems:\n\n-   To get Hey! Listen! achievement you must know who is Navi. She is a first fairy you\u2019ve met in the game but developers don\u2019t name her.\n\n-   Maze achievements. You must know that mazes have alternative solution but game doesn\u2019t allow to complete the maze other ways than developers see. \n\n-   The Disneyan achievement. It reads you must finish the game with the second prince (Stephen), but the problem is Stephen is the first prince. It\u2019s a mistake in the achievement\u2019s description, second prince named Philippe.\n\n[quote=Wikipedia] Rosa rubiginosa (sweet briar, sweetbriar rose, sweet brier or eglantine; syn. R. eglanteria) is a species of rose native to Europe and western Asia.[/quote]\n\n\n[u] Verdict[/u]\n\nI know it sounds like I have a lot of complaints but there's really more here to like than to hate. \nI really enjoyed playing Little Briar Rose but the game really did feel half-finished.\nAs far as I know this problem was likely due to contest time constraints because the game was created for the 2014 Indie Game Maker Contest. \nAll in all even if you\u2019re a point-and-click adventures fan then buy the game [u]only with discount.[/u]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q4aCMEaja4", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501884128, "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198031032248"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497441", "timestamp_updated": 1501884304, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "34024947", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1501884304, "votes_up": 1, "review": "I really liked this game.
