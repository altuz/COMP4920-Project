While returning home, Mia receives a secret visit from a human admirer Robin and also happens to notice a mysterious cloaked figure. Over 4 days, Mia will be introduced to a dark elf detective Maximilian Blackwood from her uncle and guardian Ascold Silverlight who are both investigating a series of murders on half-elves and have predicted Mia will be the murderer's target next.\n\nThe game has its share of humour with witty dialogue, CGs are good and there are published community guides to help players unlock all CGs and get all achievements. On the minus side, there are 2 glitchy achievements which require reaching the game ending with the game language settings in Russian to be able to unlock them at the time of this review.

This is a mystery game without any real mystery (sadly, that is a case with quite a few otome visual novels). You will probably figure out, who the killer is, during your first meeting with him and even if you won't, you will surely know before the final confrontation. There are two things that could save this game in my eyes: if it was a good thriller (it isn't and trailer pretty much spoils any \"surprise\" there could be) or if it was a good romance (which it also isn't, because characters simply do not have enough time to grow and develop their relationships). I think it would be much more interesting game, if the \"killer\" aspect was cut of completely and it would be just a magic-school life type of visual novel. There just isn't enough time, nor build-up to convey any sort of message, make you feel bad for the killer or for his victims, or even get some satisfaction from getting good endings with the guy, that you've encountered, maybe five times during the whole game.\n\nEven for the low price, it's still a disappointment.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489618118, "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198327901000"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500891", "timestamp_updated": 1499945485, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33501229", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1499945485, "votes_up": 1, "review": "A nice little classic visual novel, modest in size, but quite appealingly written. The story is heavily romanticised but plays the classic genre conventions strongly and unashamedly. There is a surprising level of threat, some genuine humour, and while the heroine is rather girly, she is a sympathetic character with thoughts and feelings. Some story options and routes appealed to me, or seemed to actually gel with the game's overall themes, considerably more than others. But I personally found it all the more satisfying to ferret out the best parts, and kick that silly dark elf boy to the curb. There is a decent bits of worldbuilding for a short game, and themes of seizing the day and coping with prejudice, but romance and avoiding death are the main orders of the day.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
