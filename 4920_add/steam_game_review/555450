All the strong gameplay from MD is here, just in bite sized packages this time, and Breach offers its additions such as a double/triple jump, overall the gameplay is solid and fun. I'd like to spend more time with it, but this is essentially a Freemium Mobile Game disguised as a PC Game. Its got all the signs, constant online connection neeeded, incredibly scare resources, pitful exp and credit rewards for replaying missions, gameplay driven by loot boxes, and a level select screen straight from any mobile game. The only thing missing is a godawful energy system, which it thankfully lacks.\n\nI managed to get 1 hour into it before I hit my first wall, a mission where you have to take out a tough enemy, unlike the other missions takedowns and sneaking were useless (infinite resources), so I'd have to use ammo to defeat the enemy, unfortunately ammo cannot be looted, it must be brought directly with credits or acquired through loot boxes, in fact everything must be brought, theres no reliable way to get an item without grinding or paying up. This is incredibly bad free to play design worthy of a Supercell Title, there are better ways to do free to play and breach falls into all the traps of bad F2P.\n\nIn Conclusion: It 'costs' a 7 gig download, so if you want to give it a try and can spare the bandwidth you'll have some fun within the 1st hour atleast, and maybe more if you're willing to burn through your resources.

Not here though, enemies sometimes instaalert you from mile away and sometimes you poke at their kneecaps with your newly unPACKed magnum without them noticing.\nMelee kills are 50-50 for alert too, even if you do them from behind a cover without enemy seeing you.\nBut dont worry, you wont see them either since they're colored in bright-af-white on a bright-af-psychodelic colored map.\nSpeaking of maps, the design is all over the place, with some maps being a size of your mum's basement and other huge vertical skyscrapers. Graphical design looks cool for first 10 minutes, after which you realize that you've been running in circles in a white room with no points for orienteering. There's also no coherency between them, as you choose your next map from a tile board, akin to FF:Dissidia, Mobius FF etc, so don't expect any variety or sense of progress environmentwise.\nBut hacking was fun in HR and MD, I hear you say... None of it here. To \"hack\" you simply press E and... wait. Neat, eh?\nThey also forgot that the weakest point of any Deus Ex game was the gunplay, so instead of trying to improve it, they just shoveled low-polly white guns, all of which you have already seen and used, coloring a couple of pseudopoligons in gold for higher level of drop.\nSpeaking of drops, there aren't any. Instead they have packs, which you can buy with ingame currency, and which usually grant you shit you never going to use. But you can pay real cash for a pack that grants you two of highest lvl of gear possible... Not pay to win at all ;)\nSpeaking of p2w, there is no direct multiplayer. Instead you can challenge somebody to beat your highscore, time or % of data extraction. This is ultimately irrelevant, however, not only because of how unbalanced leveling up your Jensen is, but also because people found a way to beat levels in 0.1 secons, proudly displaying it in the highscore board.\nIn conclusion, this game is almost as bad as \"The Fall\", whilst not being a mobile bootleg to begin with.

I personally disagree with this decision, but I am biased, having bought Mankind Divided on launch with the season pass. So when Eidos starts giving away half the base game for free, as well as the preorder bonuses, it doesn't sit well with me. If this was a multiplayer mode with a dying playerbase, going free to play would make some sense, but breach can be completed completely without any interaction with other players - the only social interaction is by challenging other players to beat your high scores.\n\nThe game itself is great and is in my opinion what deus ex needed. Breach mode plays like a cross between Deus Ex and Soloing Payday 2. Because unlike mankind divided, there are no quicksaves. You can't just reset a mistake you have made by loading the last save. Breach is the arcade version of the game - Rewards are given for speedrunning levels and for obtaining the most points. Modifiers can be applied to make levels harder or easier - the former of which will increase the score multiplier.  Because this game is fast paced, some of the slower elements of the main game are removed.  Bodies of enemies will disintegrate when killed, so you dont need to hide the corpses.  But on the other hand, you can't pick up their weapons or ammo to help you out.  The social pillar of the game, AKA having conversations with npcs, both with minor ones and major ones, are removed.  They just aren't necessary in this mode, and in fact would detract from the main experience.  Although, there is a social aspect that is between levels of a Darknet file, where you text chat other Reapers who will help you on your misson, and an enemy reaper who will be pissed at you.\n\nMaps can have different objectives, not including the optional challenges of getting the high score, beating the speedrun requirement, or securing all the data in the map. The most basic is data extraction - where you have to download a certain amount of the data in the map for the exit to open. And when the exit opens you have a limited amount of time to reach it and the alarm automatically goes off (Which doesn't break stealth unless you are detected), etc. There are also missions where you must kill a certain number of enemies, as well as missions where you must kill a \"Prime\" unit - a boss fight. A more recent objective for some maps has been to make your way to a ball and carry the ball all the way to the exit.\n\nSome missions have modifiers built into them, such as failing on breaking stealth, disabling all your custom augmentations (Character ability upgrades you gain by progressing), having enemies do more damage or you doing less damage, etc.\n\nDespite being arcade-y and not directly related to Adam Jensen's story in the story mode of Mankind Divided, there are narrative mission chains that do have permanent choices you have to make in them.\n\nItems are rewarded by completing the darknet story missions, buying loot drops with ingame currency, and some with real currency.  Despite what some say this isn't really pay to win. While you can buy high level loot crates with a currency bought from real cash, you don't need them to beat the game - you can acquire everything you need by completing missions and buying the loot drops with the main ingame currency. These crates will drop several items of varying qualities and types, with some crates having specific types of items such as special ammo for your weapons(Regular ammo can be bought cheaply for each gun without needing random chance, although some special guns only use special ammo such as armor piercing rounds) and the main crate has different versions. buying the more expensive models will give you a higher chance of really good items and at a minimum will give you decent quality.\n\nYou earn ingame credits by completing missions as well as their side objectives (speedruns, high scores, and getting all the data), earning booster packs by progressing through the server map, and a special bonus by getting %100 completion on a server.  Replaying a mission you've already beaten gives you a small amount of credits if you are replaying them on a day you've already completed them, but if it's your first time on that day, you will get a much larger amount.  So farming credits isn't as bad as you might think.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487007997, "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063907842"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "weighted_vote_score": "0.487616", "timestamp_updated": 1487009286, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "29905850", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 14, "timestamp_created": 1487009286, "votes_up": 16, "review": "So A lot of people really hate this game, but it's for the wrong reasons.
