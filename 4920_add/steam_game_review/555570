I came into this game thinking it would be horrible.....boy was I wrong.\n\n\nThis \"game\" is beyond horrible. In fact, words do not exist that could describe the horridness of this program.\n\nYou spawn in the same area every time. Upon which you're nearly instantly sniped by some autistic kid. Also when you die, you have to wait forever to revive or PAY REAL MONEY TO REVIVE YOURSELF. If you manage to get away, you can literally find weapons everywhere. Literally everywhere. Like fucking literally fucking everywhere. I cannot stress how often you'll find weapons. But who needs weapons when you can literally destroy an entire army base full of zombies with your bare fucking hands. In the few minutes I was on,  I watched at least 15 people get caught hacking. The graphics are disgusting and look like they belong in a PS2 game. In fact this entire game reminds me of a poorly made PS2 game.\n\n\nI also noticed they're beginning to copy even more games like State of Decay.\n\n\nIt's like if Dayz and H1Z1 had a baby but threw it in the dumpster behind wal-mart, and then State of Decay and Miscreated had a baby but Harambe died saving it and then those two babies grew up and fucked.

It is amusing for a week or two...but after that you'll start to notice these flaws:\n\n*Hackers are rampant.  The anticheat only bans a handful\n*Riot shields are ridiculous and abused\n*3rd person view is ridiculous and abused\n*Sniper rifles are far superior to every other weapon in ANY combat situation and are abused\n*Spawn points do not vary.  It is not uncommon for players to spawn on top of eachother.  It is also not uncommon for servers to be filled with spawn campers.  People literally camping a spawn point just to fuck you out of your stuff.\n*The shadowing in the night-day cycle is not fluid.  The shadowing just suddenly changes.  This makes the graphics annoying.\n*Bullets fired at range do almost NO damage.  The exception are sniper rifles.  For instance...I was shot in the head with an assault rifle at a pretty decent range and it took away 2% of my health.\n*Going prone or crouched makes the same amount of noise as running or sprinting.  This is just plain dumb.\n*Weapon spread is stupid.  A skilled marksman can make weapons such as an M4 or M16 fire much more accurately at range than they do in this game.  Sniper rifles are unbalanced by having 0.0 spread.\n*You pretty much have to depend on a headshot to get an efficient kill.  Body shots are mostly useless.\n*No ability to hide in grass/foliage/overgrowth.  Hiding is futile except if you are at range with an unbalanced sniper rifle\n*Zombie AI is horrible.

You can also revive instantly for 15000 in game $ that takes less than 10 minutes to farm from zombies.\n\nSevers are fine and populated, some more some less so you can decide if you wan't to mostly loot or have more PvP. There's no lag as far as Im concerned and my ping (east coast) actually stays pretty low. \n\nPerformance is really good. Don't listen to idiots that play on potatoes. I have an i5 with gtx780, pretty mediocre nowadays and I get minimum 70fps in major cities with 30+ people on the map. \n\nPlayer and mouse movement is smooth AF. None of that Arma/DayZ 10 year old bullshit clunky movement. Mouse looking around/aiming smoothness and responsiveness is comparable to CS:GO.\n\nIn almost 11 hours of gameplay, only cheaters I saw were the ones getting banned in chat announcements, never encountered one and all I do is PvP in a major city.\n\nThe loot is everywhere, which not only makes it easy to gear up to immediately PvP, but it also makes it easy to farm $ and XP from zombies. \n\nThat being said, make no mistake, this isn't DayZ. Sure you have water and food stat that you gotta replenish, but this is NOT  survival game this is a LooterShooter, you loot gear and then kill other players. Zombies are easy to deal with and are merely an annoyance/extra layer to add some tactics to PvP because other players can see zombies being agroed to you so you gotta decide how to move around unnoticed.\n\nPvP is SUPER FUN and can bring some of the most intense moments in any shooter. You can stalk 1 or a group of players until you decide that the moment  is right and your positioning is good to take them out before they even realize what happened and take all their loot. You might have close quarter fights where you gotta outplay others or you might see someone camping on the roof and try to flank  and maneuver them, the possibilities are endless.\n\n\nAll in all, this is like an 8gb F2P game, you lose nothing by trying it out and if you're not a complete scrub who never played an open world shooter before or you're not an impatient person who is willing to give yourself time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay, you will have a great time PvPing especially with friends.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 14}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488146704, "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198116477585"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "weighted_vote_score": "0.514940", "timestamp_updated": 1486933575, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "29882886", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 14, "timestamp_created": 1486933575, "votes_up": 39, "review": "Where to start.... first, the game is buggy as hell.

Maybe just get it because it's free and play it till you can't use beginner severs then uninstall it.
