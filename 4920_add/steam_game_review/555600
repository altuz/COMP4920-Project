That is really all I can say.  The locomotion in this game is genius.  Probably not a game I'll keep coming back to, though it is a good workout if you don't cheat.\n\nSo the way you move in this game is by pretending you are a 6 year old kid riding a broom while pretending it is a horse.  You do this by either doing the Monty Python Horse skip:\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/ee1bc44624178bc23f2c9c08529d9ad5/tumblr_ntt3d3IyeU1qz5q5lo1_500.gif\nor by hoping up and down in place.  The faster your skip/hop the faster your horse runs.\n\nWatching someone play this game is quite entertaining as they look ridiculous.  Playing the game also is ridiculous because in the game you are holding a stick with a stuffed horse head on the end of it, so you know exactly what you look like to those watching.\n\nThere is some risk of motion sickness here.  I found that when I stopped the horse, I instinctively leaned backwards and if I was going particularly fast it would sometimes almost cause me to fall over.  Also, when riding the horse down a slope it can be pretty jarring and I found myself again leaning backwards.\n\nI recommend only playing this if you have a bit of space.  It is _really_ easy to get immersed into the game and not realize that you are hopping off towards a wall.  The VR chaperone is still there of course, but if you are close to a wall and then stop your horse in the middle of a gun fight it is easy to lean backwards into the wall.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1496025700, "num_games_owned": 770, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044352174"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496759", "timestamp_updated": 1491699223, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31029604", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1491699223, "votes_up": 1, "review": "Easily one of the best VR games I've played.
