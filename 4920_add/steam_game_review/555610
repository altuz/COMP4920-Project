I'm used to level design from this dev so tight it crackles, with a sophisticated, interwoven metroidvania layout and satisfying and at times hard-as-nails platforming. This game, in contrast, is as linear as it gets, with simplistic and boring level design. The mechanics, largely borrowed from one of my other favourite games Zelda II, aren't given much room and feel under-utilised.\nThe game is very short, the lives mechanic is uneccessary and annoying, there's few secrets and what secrets there are are easy to find and contain nothing interesting.\nSorry Mr. Pittman. I really hope Gunmetal Arcadia is better...", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
