Simple, but fine. It's an aesthetic that really works for a dev team that can't afford a real artist. I like it here and in Paint The Town Red. This game also has a good variety of characters populating the world. \n-Though humor is a con below, I thought the collectible Playboys with blocky tits was sort of funny. Sort of.\n\nCONS\n-The default top-down camera option sucks and doesn't even let you see half the store names. You can change it to third person, but it never sticks and you'll have to do it every time you start the game.\n-The controls are terrible. The game is about attacking and shooting, but you can only attack right in front of you. So instead of using the mouse to aim, you have to point yourself at your target. This might be fine if not for my next point.\n-In a game pretty much all about wreaking havoc, they sure make that a difficult, unpleasant experience. It's sort of fun to blow one person to bits with a shotgun, but when the whole room starts to chase you, it's not fun anymore. You'll empty your gun missing every shot, then get mobbed to death and start over (or refund the game if you know what's good for you).\n-The sound is just bad. The developers did take pity on you and mute all sound by default, but if you go against their will and turn it on, it's just annoying music and a stock \"bustling crowd\" sound. That could work for the mall setting, but the thing is the only sound effects in the game are the guns and there's only one music track. It gets grating fast.\n-The coding is really, really bad. I'm not sure what engine this is made in, but I'm assuming it was made by the devs because it's godawful. If you turn on infinite ammo to make the game SOMEWHAT fun and start killing everyone, the game will very quickly slow to a crawl with a lot of bodies on-screen. For some reason, your walking is broken when this happens, and you start to slide to the side while running. It's very strange.\n-The humor is low-effort and completely unfunny. Gabe Newell and other EPIC Valve PC Master Race references, Gangnam Style button (seriously), generic sex humor. It's just dull and makes me roll my eyes.\n-Very little content. Two small maps with pointless goals and no fun mechanics to play with.\n\nI gathered all of that from playing for only twenty minutes. Twenty minutes and you've seen everything there is to see, and it's nothing good. If this was released five years ago by a one-man dev team for free I might have considered it endearing. But it's none of those things. This thing came out last year, it's got a sizable dev team, and it cost me a dollar. I could believe this was some kind of laundering scheme.\n\nThis game did not deserve the effort spent reviewing it, and I'm not sure what compelled me. I guess because the price, the screenshots, and the positive reviews (seriously guys what the fuck) made me curious enough to sink a dollar in and I want to warn you that it's just not worth it. You might get one laugh out of the bugs.
