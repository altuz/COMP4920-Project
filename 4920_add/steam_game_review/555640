Basically, it\u2019s about Brian, an American student living in Japan and we follow him as he learns more about the culture and makes new friends.\n\nThe glossary during the dialogues was useful, and both main heroines are cute and interesting. I understand that the game was made for a certain audience, but I get this feeling that they lost a chance to make it more \u201ceducational\u201d. It goes from an interesting subject to fan service pretty fast in a few scenes, and that bothered me a bit. Also, there\u2019s the endings; [spoiler]It\u2019s basically the same for both girls, and they just changed a few lines.[/spoiler]\n\n7/10. I liked the concept, the art style is really pretty, the songs are catchy. But as I already said, I think they could\u2019ve done a bit more here. Also, the story gets fast at some point, one day you\u2019re celebrating Halloween, and then suddenly it\u2019s Christmas and it goes on.

I feel like I've been here a few times before. \n\nAnyway, this game is cute and teaches you a little bit of trivia about foods, places and customs but not much about the school life in the title. The story is about 75% cute fluff and 25% educational. It also paints a view so positive that it feels somewhat ingenuine.\n\nThe art and animations are quite good, but the two main characters are the only ones we get to see and interact with. \n\nThere are 2 routes and endings, but there are only a handful of lines that are different between them, and the ending is the same either way- no feeling confessed and it all feels kind of unresolved for this type of game. \n\nNot a terrible way to spend a few hours and I got this at a good sale price so I'm going with the thumbs up.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489038735, "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198247612580"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505481", "timestamp_updated": 1499368754, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33321408", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1499368754, "votes_up": 2, "review": "A fairly simple and cute VN.
