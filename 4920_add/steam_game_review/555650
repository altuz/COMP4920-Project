You want a long 6+ hour game. [/u]\n\nI played this game for about an hour or so each day and ended up finishing it in three days. Although it may depend on your reading speed and whether you listen to the voice acting all the way through, I was playing on auto-mode for most of the game, so three to four hours is probably the natural length of the game. \n\n[u] 2. You want an erotic game with explicit images. [/u]\n\nThe Steam version of the game does [i] not [/i] include the nudity that the original game does. All of the erotic scenes are removed, but nothing from the storyline is altered or changed besides this. There is no patch available to add to the Steam game's files to add the explicit scenes to the game, so if you want the 18+ version of the game your only option is to buy it from Denpasoft themselves. \n\n[u] 3. You want a slow-paced romance story that develops over time and events. [/u]\n\nThe romance in this story is [i] not [/i] slow-paced at [i] all[/i]. In fact, the romance is very fast-paced. However, their love does [i] continue [/i] to develop greater over time and you can tell how much their love for each other grows as they experience new things together.\n\n[u] 4. You want a choice-based romantic visual novel. [/u]\n\nThere are no choices in this game, no routes, and no self-insert. It is a visual novel all in itself - a story you read with a soundtrack, voice-acting, and various images and backgrounds. \n\n[u] 5. You are uncomfortable with homophobia and abusive family themes. [/u]\n\nThe game does not condone homophobia or abuse in any way; however, it is a prevalent key in the characters' hardships and backgrounds. Family is a huge factor in the storyline, as well. If these themes are harmful to just read about to you, this probably isn't the game for you. \n\n\n[h1] This game probably [i] is [/i] for you if: [/h1]\n\n[u] 1. You want a cute romantic story between two women. [/u]\n\nThe two main love interests in this game are lesbian women who are [i] not [/i] minors. Their romance is cute and enchanting, and there are no explicit scenes, only suggestive themes. You do not need the explicit scenes to enjoy the game, unless of course nudity is a main factor of what you're looking for. The story is able to be understood regardless and the romance still blossoms between them. I know not about the 18+ scenes of the game, so I cannot tell you with absolute certainty that you will not be missing something important to the storyline, but it did not seem that way to me when I played it. Nothing seemed to be missing.\n\n[u] 2. You want an intricate, thoughtful story. [/u]\n\nIt is evident that quite a lot of thought was put into the game. The game revolves around a variety of real-life locations and describes them impeccably and with great detail. It is a very realistic story that touches sensitive family, religion, and homophobia themes delicately and in no way offensively. It does so in a way that you can relate to the characters and their thoughts and backgrounds. \n\n[u] 3. You want a well-executed game with lots of effort put into it. [/u]\n\nThe soundtrack and voice-acting in the game is flawless. The soundtrack is very nice to listen to and the voice-acting is beautiful. The voice actors for [spoiler] the two main characters [/spoiler] are very skilled; they show emotion in their voices very nicely. In addition, the art style in the images is absolutely stunning and gorgeous to look at! The main characters look mature and not childish or cutesy like in many other lesbian games. The CGs (special full-screen images) prevail in both quantity and quality. There are [spoiler]eleven[/spoiler] CGs with different variations of some.\n\n\n[b] Opinions [/b]\nMost of everything under this subtitle is pure spoilers pertaining to the storyline and is not objective. \n\nTo be frank, I was disappointed that I would not be getting the full game when I purchased the game from Steam, but I purchased it regardless, and was definitely [i] not [/i] disappointed. I completely fell in love with the story, the characters, the art, the romance, and the entirety of the game. [strike] This is the first lesbian visual novel I have played, and even after playing a few more, this one is definitely my favorite. [/strike]\n\nWith the soundtrack and the voice-acting, it was able to make me cry in one of the more solemn scenes. [spoiler] When Julie started crying and yelling about her past, how her parents treated her poorly and told her to leave before she tainted her little sister and how even with leaving she still couldn't satisfy them, I couldn't help but tear up and cry. That line, \"What would it take to finally make them happy, my death?\" had so much emotion in it from the voice actor and the CG was nicely drawn. It is definitely a memorable scene. [/spoiler]\n\nThe game was able to make me smile widely and want to squeal in the romantic events. [spoiler] Namely, the scene when Julie revealed to Amanda the birthmark on her back that she was so insecure about, and then Amanda kissed her back as if to show that she loved her, no matter what her past may be. The CG that pertained to it definitely moved me, it is so sensual and absolutely gorgeous. It is one of my favorites, along with the CG of their first kiss.\n\nIn addition, the final scene seriously made me squeal, wide-eyed and all! I was extremely furious that the game was going to end with Julie just disappearing like that, because [i] \"Really? [/i] You're going to woo me with this amazing game and then end it so horribly?\" Shortly thereafter, however, Amanda chased after her, describing how \"She is my princess and I am her knight in shining armor, chasing after her in my chariot\". I absolutely [i] love [/i] that comparison! The icing on the cake was the finale CG, with Amanda kissing Julie after finally finding her again - so beautiful! [/spoiler]\n\nI love how the characters are drawn; I have got to say that that this is one of my favorite art styles I've come across - perhaps my third favorite from every other video game, manga, or anime I've experienced. I'm especially grateful that the art style isn't cutesy and lolita-type, but that is just a personal preference. \n\nI love each and every one of the CGs, especially the cover image which blows me away! I can't help but replay the opening whenever I open the game because it is very nice to watch.\n\nI really can not count the number of times the game has made me smile. It made me yearn for [spoiler]Julie and Amanda[/spoiler] to reach happiness and frown when they hit an obstacle. Each day, I looked forward to playing the game in suspense of what could possibly happen next and what new images I would see! [spoiler] Amanda and Julie's love is just so pure and I want nothing more than to see them happy together! [/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nAltogether, the game has outstanding voice-acting, art, story, and love - the whole package! \n\nI will definitely remember this game forever, as it touched my heart and has made me cherish it deeply. I will probably re-buy it on Denpasoft to support the developers and to get the full story. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys lesbian romances, especially for its price! This game is definitely [i] not [/i] worth only ten dollars; in fact, I would pay thirty to forty dollars for this masterpiece! \n\n[u] [i] I give the game four stars out of five.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
