I'm not gonna lie I did in-fact get stuck on a few parts of the game, it was really thought out and I really enjoyed the challange. Since each of the characters do different things/different abilities, I found myself really getting into that intrinsic part of the game. I can't remember the last time I've played a game quit like this and thought that in order to progress you need use Dante, Malice, and Elliot at different times just simply neat. \n\nI would say one of my favorite things in Grave Danger was the banter between the characters, it wasn't over done and actually quite funny.  The music was also really fun and really good. One last thing I would like to comment on was the fact that I ran into very few bugs, considering this was from what I can tell the first game from this developer.\n\nI would highly suggest playing this sweet little game.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1490889332, "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198070957357"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510193", "timestamp_updated": 1482482457, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28553581", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_created": 1482482457, "votes_up": 11, "review": "I'll be honest.\n\nThe second I saw the fact you play a cowboy, a wizard, and a skeleton at the same time, I was sold. I'm only a few levels in, but so far the gameplay feels nice and solid, and characters feel varied without actually changing too much of their moveset.\nThe cowboy, who you start as, has wall climb and a nifty -if kind of tricky to time- dash jump.\nThe wizard, who you add to the party second, has a double jump. I also find his attack my go to if I can.\nThe Skeleton, who comes last, has a hover, though it does not last forever and it's more like a slowed down fall.\nAnd just with those, the level design works perfectly to give each of these characters completely different ways to cover terrain.
