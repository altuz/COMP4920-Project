It's like a Tron-esque disk battle arena with many cool play elements. It has an easy to use matching system that pairs you with a player or AI bot of your skill level, and you are just immediately throwing disks and scoring points to the cheers of robo-citizens.  The throwing mechanic is very nuanced, allowing skill to play a huge part in the action.  I have a feeling that as I play I will discover all the tricks for controlling the disk.  My kids were able to pick up the concept without coaching and I was anxious for them to give this seasoned FPS player a second (and third and fourth...) turn.\n\nI feel like the replay value is high on this title and with a pure multiplayer experience and varied strategies, this early access game is one to watch.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483150347, "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994409059"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "timestamp_updated": 1482471694, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28549915", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1482471694, "votes_up": 3, "review": "Robot City Stadium is a pretty cool Tron inspired competitive multiplayer game.  In many ways it reminds me of other skill based competitive multiplayer games like Paddle Up or Pool Nation (when playing with someone else and not just goofing off) but instead of adapting a real competitive sport to VR, this game takes advantage of VR to create a different virtual sport with elements and factors that can't be found in real life, yet still require a great deal of skill and muscle memory to get good at.  \n\nThe gameplay is challenging at first, but rewarding once you find a throw that works for you.   The reflective walls also add an interesting Pong-like element to the game, making bouncing discs off walls to fluster opponents a viable tactic in losing track of the opponent's disc.  I can see a lot of potential in this title, as the core mechanics are simple to learn but difficult to master.  I especially like how the AI works as a filler while waiting for another opponent, since that means as long as there is at least one person playing  you'll be able to get into a game.  \n\nOverall I'm pretty happy with this title and I think it'll be great to watch a community form around this game :P\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492021190, "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988487699"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497606", "timestamp_updated": 1482372728, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28520062", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1482372728, "votes_up": 4, "review": "Yes!
