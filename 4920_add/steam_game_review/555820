There is one puzzle in which I have to open an envelope to continue (about 30 minutes into the game) in which the game shuts down with an unexpected error and that is it. As the game was released in Novemeber 2016, do not expect it to become more stable in the near future.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
