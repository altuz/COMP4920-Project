Next day patch: bug fixed. So this should really go to the PROS section, however it might be annoying to some people that an alpha/beta game has bugs. (not sure why but I've seen it before) \n\n- Optimization is not the best yet, a bit laggy(sometimes even in the menu, depending on how many items you have in your inventory).\n\nTL;DR:\n\nIf you want something fun, with the best movement so far out on the market, and like to kill stuff with Xena glaives, and darth maul lightsabers... this definitely worth your money.\n\nHats down to development, best one I have ever seen in my life, and I've been playing since I had my first 486.\n\nThanks guys.\n\nEdit: Removed some CONS as development is already working on those features for the game.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506407306, "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 133, "steamid": "76561197972913619"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "timestamp_updated": 1505428748, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "34959137", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505428748, "votes_up": 3, "review": "This is my first review here on Steam.

It is unique in it's movement from any other VR game I have played and I did enjoy playing, BUT I can not recommend you buy it for a multiplayer experience at the current price tag. First of all, the game was not originally multiplayer and the multiplayer is in beta. I played a few matches with some friends and it was great fun, it actually ran surprisingly smooth with the slow motion and all, but there is not enough to do for $30. There are 3 mission types and 4 maps on multiplayer. After you play 1 or 2 games you notice the repitition, the only thing to do after that is raise the difficulty. While it was fun, I will likely be refunding due to lack of content in multiplayer.

Jumping through the air and landing multiple headshots on enemies as I soar over their heads, and then chopping a dude in half near where I land is just...it's rad. Totally rad. It's like Genji Simulator 2017, but with a hell of a lot more options for projectile weapons. Also reminds me a lot of Shadow Warrior 2, but the gameplay style works a hell of a lot better in VR.
