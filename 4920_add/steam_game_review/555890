This game is a mission based arcade shooter with leveling, different weapons, and upgrades. The graphics aren't stunning but they definately fit the game well. When you first play you are greated by a hard boss fight but don't let that discourage you because after the introduction the game gets a bit easier to allow for a more casual play through. You can go whereever you want and just level up and kill aliens or you can just take the missions and progress the storyline. From what little I have played so far it seems to me that even though the game starts off simple it expands into a great arcade shooter with tons of different enemy types and weapons. Though the price point of $7.99 might feel a little steep if you have an extra $10 this is a great game to pickup and play when you are bored.\n\n\nCurrently not far in the game I rate it a solid 8/10\n\n(still have no clue why the name is Burgers 2 because the only time burgers are in the game is as a health pickup dropped from dead enemies)", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 2}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483739599, "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994868319"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496118", "timestamp_updated": 1483747506, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "29073917", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_created": 1483747506, "votes_up": 7, "review": "Quick: Very tight mechanically, offering a good base twin stick shooter game with a couple of extra layers. Some options through the game offer a good second play through but nothing beyond that, and more impressively you have a resource management decisions with money that you earn from missions and occasional drop you can use to replenish ammo or stock different weapons. With each weapon offering a different approach to the game it was well thought out and you can see some of thought in the choices of enemies not only offering varied differences but good designs to tell them apart. This is not a world changing game but if you are new to the genre it is a very good entry point.

You use the left control stick to move, and the right to aim. Nothing new here, you can find this sort of game for free in droves on Newgrounds or Armor Games.\n\nThere is one absolutely unique feature, however. When you level up, you are given the choice to increase.... something. You go back to base, talk to the psychiatrist (huh?) and choose something to upgrade. But not only is there no description of what the upgrade does, but you don't even get the name of the upgrade itself! Do you want to upgrade the fist, the clock, or the circle? Probably the fist is melee attack, the circle is accuracy... but I have no idea what the clock is even supposed to mean. Come on guys, practice this stuff so you can make a good game before you try to sell it.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}]}
