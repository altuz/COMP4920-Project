All the controls and movements that were clunky on the Vita now feels like second nature. The gameplay is actually fun now, and many details that couldn't be seen on the small Vita screen are now in full HD glory to be appreciated all over again.\n\nTLDR The PC version of UDG is hands down the definitive way to experience this game.

The whole psychopop universe is there, returning characters are still the same (and still developing as characters) and brand new characters will pop into the tale and enrich the plot in a very visual novel fashion despite the genre shift.

Danganronpa isn't known for their amazing gameplay. Danganronpa 1 and 2 could have been masterpieces, if you actually had to solve the murders like one would in real life, as opposed to solving it by playing minigames. Luckily, danganronpa makes up for that by having the most sickening, disgusting, incredible stories, making it still one of the best games I've played. \n\nBecause of this weaker gameplay, I decided to play this game on normal instead of hard, so I'd spend less time doing that. This kinda... backfired because as bad as the gameplay was, it now became even more of a snoozefest. \n\nThe game is some sort of shooter where you use different bullets for different occasions. A rather familiar concept. The opponents only don't really fight back so it doesn't really matter what you do. It becomes boring fast. In between the repetitive shooting, you get thrown into a game room time and time again, where you have to 'solve' a puzzle to unlock the door. Only the puzzles are incredibly dull and simple and require almost no thinking if at all. I say 'solve', because, as I later found out, you don't have to solve them at all. The room says: kill them all in one explosion.... buuut, it doesn't matter what you do. If you just do everything but use explosions, the door opens as well. \n\nNow, the storyline. The main thing about the game series. It took about 20 hours before it finally got... a bit interesting. At the end there were some interesting twists, but it still was a lot weaker than the other two... and having to choose the very same thing over and over (you literally got the choice to either do something or don't do something, and you got that choice like 10 times in a row with a few seconds in between) was really annoying. \n\nSo. This was by far the weakest of the danganronpa games. I suppose if you have no expectations and are not familiar with the other two it could be enjoyable, but if you've played the other two this is a real disappointment.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505788766, "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197987495699"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "weighted_vote_score": "0.401931", "timestamp_updated": 1505789074, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "35056735", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 56, "timestamp_created": 1505789074, "votes_up": 6, "review": "dont play", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}]}
