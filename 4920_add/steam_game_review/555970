The ball physics are smooth and reliable, and the surroundings are minamalistic, but pleasant.  The standout on the surroundings is of course the animal whose attention you continually get more of as you solve puzzles.  The items you use and interact with all have a decent amount of detail, nothing feels like placeholder art, unlike SO many VR games currently.\n\nThere are small touches that most devs just don't deal with, like \"what happens when you get too close to an object\"?  In Awaken, it sort of melts away so you don't have it blocking your entire field of vision, yet you're completely aware that the object is still there.  The spheres emit light that reacts beautifully with nearby objects, which helps everything feel more...real.\n\nI purchased the game during a sale, when the devs released the second island, doubling the number of puzzles from 30 to 60.  I'm quite pleased with the content for the price I paid, although the non-sale price is a bit steep for the two islands.  When they add in a third, then yes, the full price would easily be justified.  There's also a level-making area, but the devs are trying a LITTLE too hard to make the game text-free, and it's incredibly confusing.   Hopefully they'll sort that area out later.  Another VR game I love, Cloudlands Mingolf, thrives on its amazing level editor, and I'd love to see this game with piles of user-generated content as well.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499218990, "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025015702"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500555", "timestamp_updated": 1494340908, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31647461", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1494340908, "votes_up": 1, "review": "I love this game.

I just wanted to say that I'm impressed with this one, it's got some really nice game design and nice little touches (they make clipping into objects with your headset look neat). It's really nice; the surroundings, sounds and gameplay are pretty relaxing. I'm reminded of Crazy Machines with the rube goldberg style gameplay and Sound Shapes with the sounds that go with it. Another nice thing is that it runs really well, I don't have a GTX 1060 (yet...) so for now I'm stuck with a GTX770 and limited to what I can play but this runs well on that and not many games outside of AAA Oculus titles seem to.\n\nCan't wait to play more when I can", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
