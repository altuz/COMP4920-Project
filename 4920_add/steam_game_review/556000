You start off in an open hall, and it doesn't matter which door you take, they all lead to the same type of procedurally generated dungeon, with the same 4-5 types of monsters. \n\nYou swing your sword by left-clicking, that's all there is in the way of attack variety. You have a player level, which as far as I can tell has no bearing on anything. There's no player stats, no skill tree. The gold you collect is used to craft other weapons at the table in the starting area (each weapon has differing levels of attack power and 'gold find'), but there is no inventory, so for example, if you replace your Axe with a Templar Sword, the Axe is gone, and you have to buy it again if you want to use it.\n\nChallenge is pretty much non-existent, seeing as how there are boxes aplenty lying around that give you gold, or refill your health to 100. You just walk through each dungeon to its end, collect gold, and repeat. I assume that once you've grinded enough to afford the most powerful sword, you've done what little there is to do.\n\nOne last detractor, it appears as though the achievements are half-broken. I know I've stored 10000 gold in my vault, but I don't have that achievement, among others I know I've qualified for.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: If the developer adds some variety to the dungeons, fleshes out the character levelling, puts a few spells or special attacks in, adds some challenge, fixes the broken weapon purchasing system.. etc.. etc... well, that's a lot of work now, isn't it?", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1479849488, "num_games_owned": 751, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989794105"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509476", "timestamp_updated": 1479849985, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "26753191", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1479849515, "votes_up": 10, "review": "No.. sorry but it is boring if you ask me, it is super easy and you don't really do anything.

Inexpensive and wanted to check it out.\n\n - Fantastic art style. The avatar in particular, a Dwarf whose entire body is basically his head, is adorable.\n - A nice dungeon feel with good music.\n\nGameplay right now is super basic; you use WASD to run through the dungeon, which is a single, procedurally generated level. Monsters appear; left click attacks, and right click blocks. There's a blocking animation, but no sense of contact or weight when you do block. Hitting the monsters does produce a sense of contact. They all die easily and you automatically pick up gold. When you get to the end of the level, you're healed to full, transported back to your home room, and get credit for the gold. There's a crafting station there where you can spend gold to upgrade your weapon damage, but nothing else. Then it's back into the dungeon for another short, random level.\n\nPerformance is fairly poor. I was not able to get the game playing full-screen, and I recommend you not change the default resolution, as you can get into a situation where the game won't start at all. There were noticeable framerate drops and video lag issues even with my fairly good hardware, though I didn't toy with the detail settings to try to improve this.\n\nThe basic game could be made into a nice story-based roguelike with some extra work; right now it's not much more than an excellent tech demo. If you buy it knowing its limitations, you might enjoy running around for a while. Young kids would probably enjoy this as it is.\n\nTo the developer: This is cute, and has a lot of potential as a basic engine to become an enjoyable rogue-like, but doesn't have enough content yet. I'd like to see you continue working on it. Just one idea off the top of my head: add another Dwarf at the crafting table, change it to an anvil, and make him do a smithing animation. Allow the player to trade things found in the dungeon, and have him \"craft\" the upgrades. Change the fictional wrapper to two Dwarf brothers going into the dungeon together to loot / recover gold, a minor fictional wrapper but more satisfying.\n\nBarrels to smash for goodies, direct item drops, buffs (potions, scrolls, weapon enchants, whatever), traps, etc. All the standard things ith this great look you've created would be amazing.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
