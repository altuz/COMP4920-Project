It's actually a very challenging game.  I kept dying without gettting too far into the game.  But I had fun trying to kill as many enemies as fast as possible whilst getting as many powerups as possible.  \n\nBasically, it's a frantic top-down twin stick shooter for VR.  The neon colors will definitely challenge your bearings.  But you get used to it pretty quick and the game ran fine for me (no stutters or crashes so far on i7, 1060 GTX).  Waves keep getting bigger and will challenge your skills.  Floors go up and down and open new pathways on at least 1 level.  There's only 2 level designs and only two different modes (elimination and survival).  Powerups include shotguns and turning into a tank.  The UI is a bit rough around the edges.  \n\nI figure if you get entertained for at least 30 minutes, you've already gotten a deal.  \n\nRate at sale price 7/10  ... Rate at normal price 4.5/10", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
