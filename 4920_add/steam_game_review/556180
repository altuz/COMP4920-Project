I didn't realize when I purchased the game that Mysterium was based on a board game. I still haven't had a chance to play a physical copy yet. But if the physical copy is better than the Steam version, I'd like to try it one day.\n\nIn the Steam version of Mysterium, there are two different roles a player can take: a ghost or a psychic. There is only one ghost at a time. There can be any number of psychics up to seven in online multiplayer. Each psychic is given three cards that they have to guess - a person, a location, and a weapon. The cards they're guessing are unique to them. However, anyone can guess any card that's still available on the table. The ghost helps the players guess their specific cards. They do this by handing over vision cards that match up with the target cards in some way. Using the images on the vision cards, the psychics can work together in order to determine who has what cards. At the end of six rounds, the players then determine what murder the ghost was killed in.\n\nPros:\n- Comes with a story mode that doubles as a tutorial.\n- The story in said story mode is actually pretty interesting.\n- Graphics are smooth and polished.\n- Cards can be expanded and magnified so viewing is easier.\n- Has local and online multiplayer.\n- Online multiplayer has a chat so psychics can easily speak to each other.\n- Audio enhances the game nicely, but is easy to turn off.\n- Many promos and expansions can be unlocked - only one requires DLC.\n\nCons:\n- Visuals seem clucky because there's so much on screen.\n- Sometimes it's hard to understand why the AI guessed certain cards.\n- The parts of story mode where you play as the ghost can be frustrating.\n- The story mode killers are always the same, so story mode can't be played twice.\n- Navigating the multiplayer window is a little confusing at first because the screen is so busy.\n- It's not clear how the promo/expansions unlock, aside from the ones offered to you when you complete story mode.\n\nIn truth, I really would like to play this game with my brother still. In fact, I plan to. But if it wasn't for that, I likely wouldn't pick up the Steam version of Mysterium again. It has a lot of potential, which is why I'd love to play the physical version of the game, but something's lost in translation. Unless you're aiming to play this with friends in person without AI, I wouldn't really recommend buying this. Even then, you might be better off buying a physical copy.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505100702, "num_games_owned": 631, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018226920"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.400013", "timestamp_updated": 1504588040, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "34750002", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 11, "timestamp_created": 1504588040, "votes_up": 2, "review": "god I hate my \"friends\"", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 2}]}
