Ahoy, me mateys.  A pirate themed solitaire game awaits thee!\n\nIt's the \"3 Towers\" type of solitaire (the kind used in Faerie Solitaire) where you have to clear the board by clicking on cards with a number either higher or lower than the current one in the discard pile.  You can work up some pretty good chains by going back and forth like this: 5-6-7-6-5-4-3-2-3-2, etc.  you can use a cannonball as a wild card (it shoots off one of the cards on the board) and continue your chain.  \n\nThere's a story for those interested in that.  Something about boy meets girl, fall in love, but girl's father doesn't want her to marry boy.  Blah blah blah.  I've been skipping it since stories are not my thing.  But it's there for those who love stories.\n\nGameplay is solid, they give you enough cards in your deck to clear the board most of the time.  Of course, luck is a factor and sometimes you'll have to replay a level if you want all perfects.  Some cards are locked and  you have to do something to unlock them, and some have to be used twice to be cleared.  \n\nUnlike other solitaire games similar to this, there are no wild cards with numbers, just cannonballs that can be used on any card, but you don't get many cannonballs.  Most I've ever had at one time was four.  And there are no other special powers, like in that dragon one where you have to wait for the meter to fill up and you can use their power to slash a card off the board.  However you can buy upgrades like \"Remove four random cards at beginning of a level\" and it does it automitically.  So there are upgrades you can buy to help you out but they are not ones you activate yourself.  Mostly you gotta rely on your pirate wits, arrr!\n\nThe graphics are decent, pirate characters on the faces of the cards, even a monkey and a kraken!  Or you can switch to just the normal number card faces if you like.  There are nice touches like the journal log of your journey that tells the story, and after clearing a level the results show up on a piece of sailcloth with a spar above and ropes dangling.  Stuff like that really sets the scene nicely.\n\nMusic and sounds are okay.\n\nCan't think of anything else to say right now.  I've played a lot of different solitaire games and I really like this one and (so far) highly recommend it!", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504823237, "num_games_owned": 1791, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198045536164"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "weighted_vote_score": "0.540252", "timestamp_updated": 1498779991, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33015299", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1498779991, "votes_up": 17, "review": "Seven Seas Solitaire is a simple, sweet and really fun game to play.\n\nThe gameplay is straightforward, you pick a card higher or lower than the one in your hand and make chains to clear the deck. Easy as that. It follows the same rules as a lot of other solitaire games on steam, and as a huge plus it even has the option to redo the last hand you played so that you can try again (and again) for that perfect 3 star score!\nThe usual items can be bought with in-game gold to improve your gameplay and these come in the form of upgrades for your ship (The Falcon) and island- very nice idea!\n\nThere's a chance to unlock mini-games called Tides of Fortune and these can either help or hinder your progress in your current game and I found them to be a nice little addition to the solitaire aspect, one of them is very hard to aim because its moving so fast but it was still fun nonetheless!\nThe artwork is simple yet effective and the sound effects/music is just right for this type of game, nothing too distracting whilst you line up those big combos :)\nI haven't completed the game yet but the story so far is light-hearted and flows smoothly, and I love the way it's portrayed in a journal format.\n\nOnly a quick review but this game I feel is spot on for a solitaire game and it's one I'm very glad I picked up. The \u00a36.99 pricetag may be a little hefty I suppose, especially as I don't know how long the game is yet but if you can get this gem on sale or in a bundle then you really should buy it!", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500824114, "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198159911377"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515383", "timestamp_updated": 1498593969, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32883774", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1498593969, "votes_up": 6, "review": " solitaire with sweet little  storyline", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
