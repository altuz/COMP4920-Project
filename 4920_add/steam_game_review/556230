However, there is still a lot of work to do before calling this rock crawling \"simulator' a finished product.  \n\n[url=https://youtu.be/NMnoQpKg3oQ] My video on it - caution - lots of swearing[/url]\n\nThe first true annoyance is the vehicle audio.  It's awful, simply awful.  It's super loud, sounds like the recording mic was directly in the engine bay of a semi-truck.  It sounds nothing like what you'd expect from whatever vehicle you're using in game.\n\nThe very next, second, annoyance you'll find is with the camera.  I swear the camera in \"orbit\" mode is literally trying to get you killed.  It's actually worse than the obit cam from BeamNG, which is saying a lot.\n\nPhysics model seems ok.  However, the suspension set up, amount of grip, and power are completely out of wack.  The suspension is way too stiff.  Vehicles bounce all over the place because of this.  Tire grip is greatly exaggerated, so much so that you can actually flip the vehicle back on it's wheels in some roll-over situations.  Lastly, now I don't think I've ever said this before, but the power these vehicles put to the wheels is just way too much.  290hp, sure, but the vehicles all feel like they're pushing well over 1000 ft lbs of tourqe,  Wheelies are cool on a strip of pavement, but not when you're precariously positioned on a rock.\n\n\nGame crashes occasionally.\n\n\nThe game has tons of potential, though, don't get me wrong.  It's fun, too.  But I just can't recommend the game in it's current state for $11 cdn.\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485664835, "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992523182"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "3", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504326", "timestamp_updated": 1481317846, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28277068", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1481317846, "votes_up": 5, "review": "I really like this game, its  beautiful, fun and the vive controllers do fantastic as a steering wheel... the game runs fanstastic", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492091504, "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198155754531"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507141", "timestamp_updated": 1489531628, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30515932", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1489531628, "votes_up": 3, "review": "I liked this game. I love my Jeep and  I love driving it on trails so naturally this game drew me in. I have played spintires and once this game works out a few physics issues I would say it is as good at capturing the offroad experiece as spintires. Spintires never really gave you the opportunity to do any real crawling and this game does.\n\nHere's my main issue. The vehicles are far too bouncy. I wish there was a way to air down the tires or fine tune the suspension set up because you drive over a wooden bridge with any form of speed and your vehicle is bouncing off the trail. It's almost like the vehicle has no weight. When you go over a crack you bounce out instead of the tire going down in and requiring a bit of work to get out. When you approach a rock instead of hitting it nice and slow and crawling over it you bounce and bounce and hope you dont bounce off the trail. \n\nThe tires are another issue. I want to be able to lower my tire pressure to increase my grip on the rocks. These over inflated tires are like riding on balloons. They're jsut too bouncy! They also do not grip like real tires do. It's too easy to slide on obstacles that wouldn't slide on in real life.\n\nOverall I really enjoy the game and will continue to play it despite my issues because it is fun and you can just group the bounce issues into part of the challenge. But at the end of the day, I would like it to feel a lot more real so I can experience the challenge of crawling when I can't take my own Jeep out on the trails.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498199256, "num_games_owned": 744, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976314677"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "3", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505377", "timestamp_updated": 1486222221, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28289343", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1481378688, "votes_up": 4, "review": "I love it.  It's like having a big R/C car right in front of you that is slightly heavier and floatier.  (really depends on the vehicle, they're all different.)  I went from the first Jeep to a Range Rover and the difference in weight was night and day.\n\nIt also has 2-player Local Multiplayer.  One gets VR, other gets the screen.  You both race at the same time.\n\nThere's some \"Arena mode\" that says, \"Coming Soon\".  I imagine it being some kind of destruction derby because the damage models are amazing!  It's almost like BEAM NG or something.  I mean, you can pancake these things and have the doors and wheels fly off.\n\nI can hold the left grip (VIVE) and move the whole map to whatever perspective I need it to be.  I like to drag the water right up to my nose. \n\nIf you've ever played Tilt Brush.  You hold grips in both hands and expand them.  And everything becomes MASSIVE.
