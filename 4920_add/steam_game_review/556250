I really like the feeling of progression you get as you build up your ship and unlock new abilities, and some of the later bosses were really hard to overcome. The alternate game modes were fun and helped alleviate the main flaw of this game, which is that it gets repetitive. The passive multiplayer is a fun way to play against other people, but other players rarely chat. The art style is minimalistic but fits well with the gameplay, as does the music. If you like small arena shooters and ship building, definitely give it a try!", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497248355, "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198087872877"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1495497086, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31909653", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1495497086, "votes_up": 0, "review": "Remembered playing the original from gamejolt a few years ago and thought I'd look and see how far it had progressed.
