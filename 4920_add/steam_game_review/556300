I was hoping for either a business management sim or an indepth tiered type of casual game where you can unlock things, to produce more complex ways of farming/animals, to make more money, and build even more things.\n\nCurrently there is none of that, just a whole lot of micro management.  As in, you even have to guide all vehicles in small increments to the fields and to the seller market, because it can't make it there on it's own without getting hung up on things.  Vehicles literally go in a straight path wherever you click, hanging on the first thing in it's path.\n\nIf this were an alpha/concept, expecting to be done in a year or so (while raising it's price over time as more content is added) I'd be excited and hopeful.  But in their EA Faq as of this review, they are suggesting completion within 3 months and that it is currently in beta...removes all my hope.\n\nCurrently, there really is no game here, even for $5 CAD.  Even on a casual scale this is extremely bare bones.  Hopefully they change thier minds and develop it on a longer scale.

THIS particular game is absolutely terrible.\nA HUGE let down.  It's like the developers simply gave up on it.  This could have been a great game, but there is just way too much that was forgotten about before they released it.  You constantly have to direct the vehicles which is tedious at the best of times. There is no actual tutorial on the game and no help either, you have to figure it all out by trial and error and trial and error and so on and so on. The mechanics of the game are bad.
