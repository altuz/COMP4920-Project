This means there are areas that are obviously not in the final stage yet. But I guess this will be polished with the next updates.\n\nThe main feature that is missing is a step-by-step tutorial. It took me some time to understand how things work and what I have to do. However after getting used to the game dynamics it is a fun and challenging skrimish game.\n\nThe AI is tough enough to keep me almost every time loosing at medium difficulty (there is also easy and hard as option).\n\nIf you can accept that there is still some development progress going on (see Krystal Skies video) then you can have fun with it :)", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
