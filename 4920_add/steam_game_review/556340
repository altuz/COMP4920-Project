It ought to have been awesome to stomp through and destroy a town, but instead you end up painfully bent over waving your hands frantically at nothing. The look of the game is nice and the feel of smashing things is satisfying but it's hard to enjoy.\n\n-You ought to be able to play this game standing, but instead the structures are at knee-height. It calls attention to the fact you wish you had feet rather than gracefully designing around it. I ended up sitting on the floor.\n-You get punished for teleporting with an annoying fade to black, so you don't want to do it, but you constantly have to. \n-You can kind of pick things up and throw them, but they don't do any damage to other structures. You want to be able to smash a house with an ice cream truck, but you can't.\n-The objectives of the level float oddly out of your line of sight, so you aren't really aware that you're supposed to be doing something besides smashing as much as possible (why would you want to do anything else anyway?)\n-The screaming humans become disturbing after a while. \n\nThe game is cheap and has some interesting things about it but I'm still waiting for a good godzilla experience.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504419110, "num_games_owned": 846, "num_reviews": 210, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1505057528, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "34727409", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504499297, "votes_up": 1, "review": "Easy recommend at the current sale price of $2.99.
