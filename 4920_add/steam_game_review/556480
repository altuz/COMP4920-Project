Was it Perfect? No, but it was probably the best attempt yet. Waiting for this game was torture,the devs and publisher kept everyone else in the dark and now that it has released its just another notch in the bow of failures this game has. \n\nTo start with, character movement and control is awful. the players movements feel heavy but also slidey, they dont go exactly where you want them to go when you want them to get there. The passing from dummy half is a joke. you can click \"LB\" or \"RB\" with \"A\" asmuch as you want but its still a mystery whether or not your hooker will pass the ball. this leads into the passing between general players, and tyhe new passing mechanics will work a treat one set and then curse you the next. its impossible for players to take the line on because everytime you pass in the near vacinity of a defender he'll intercept it. The game gives away high tackle penalties way too frequently and doesnt explain how to avoid giving them away apart from timing which is so vague its funny. The defense and tackling in the game is broken. Players from cpu controlled teams will autimatically magnet towards you while the cpu players on your team struggle to get within the distance of an attacker. this leads to opposition teams making so many more linebreaks and scoring more tries. \n\nI really want to like this game. the graphics are nice as far as players models are concerned but the background environments look like garbage. The career mode (when working properly) is good fun but its essentially the same layout as RLL3s career mode and doesnt expand on it nearly enough to make it any better. \n\nOverall, this game, right now, is a waste of 60 bucks. Im really hoping the devs continue to chip away at it but given the state it is in right now i dont think its gonna get much more attention from those who worked on it. \n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505397118, "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198103159242"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "timestamp_updated": 1505485696, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "34950315", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505401683, "votes_up": 5, "review": "[h1] Disapointing.  Too much focus on player models = poor gameplay and lack of content [/h1]\n\nIn my years I've played many rugby league and union games, and I can say this is poor.  I really wanted to like this game.  Having read other negative reviews I had hoped that they were overly critical, but no, this game is mediocre and you should avoid it right now.  \n\nPROS: \n[b] Head Scanning / Player Models [/b] - The players faces look realistic and adds to the viewers immersion into the game.  I'm interested to know how much time was spent on face scanning and player models because the game is constantly zooming in on their faces.\n[b] No Phil Gould commentary [/b] - less annoying commentary allows one to enjoy the game \n[b] Graphics [/b] - In general good! Considering rugby league live does not have close to the same budget as EA Sports FIFA or 2k's NBA2k the game looks nice\n\nCONS:\n[b] No improvements from RLL3 [/b] - Aside from creating a stadium, there is not anything new to incentivise people to buy this game.  This game does not do anything better than RLL3, except player faces.  \n[b] Poor/Frustrating gameplay [/b] - Frustrating.  Forward passes seem to happen at random.  Running from dummy-half is pointless.  Tackling system is awkward, holding down the player in the tackle to slow the play is worthless.\n[b] Terrible AI [/b] - Players stand still for no reason.  Attackers make a line break and the defending fullback will run next to the attacker to the tryline when it could easily move closer and tackle.  AI runs on the last tackle far too often.   AI doesn't position itself well for kick returns.  AI runs past tryline.\n[b] Long Animations [/b] - Similar to RLL3, if you pass just before the defensive line the player in possession with break the line by a few metres before passing without being touched because the defenders can not tackle during the passing animation, just looks ugly and does not flow well.  I've seen the AI run past the tryline because the putdown animation took too long.  Tackle a forward 8 metres from your tryline? Watch as he slowly walks over the tryline and scores while you do nothing because the tackle animation will not allow another player to enter the tackle.\n[b] Career Mode [/b] - Beyond Disappointing for many reasons. Exactly the same as RLL3.  The season statistics does not show how many points a player has scored.  Want your player to win top pointscorer at the Dally M Awards? Good luck because unless you count the tries and conversions yourself you'll have no idea how many points they've scored, or any other player for that matter.  There is no way to look at other teams roster, annoying because those who play career mode want to see players move teams and develop.  I played career mode as the Cowboys and Lachlan Coote improved to a 95 rating, wow I wonder how he compares to other players.  I couldn't compare him to other players unless I was in the recruitment section in which you can only see the ratings of players with expiring contacts, or by managing representative teams and comparing myself.  Player contracts were unrealistic, Shannon Boyd a 94 rating as one of the best (he could have been the best, but there is no simply way to check that) wanted a $350k contact.  In an era of rugby league where top players are earning million dollar contacts the game does not reflect that, allowing you to stockpile top players on small contacts.  \n[b] Random Spelling Mistakes [/b] - Simple spelling mistakes on loading screens really annoyed me.  \n[b] Lack of recorded statistics or records [/b]  I accidently skipped the Dally M Awards screen and there was no way to go back and see who won!  There was a headline on the Dally M Team of the Year but you can't open it to see who made the team.  What is the point of including that in the game?  A major part of a career mode is seeing progression and recorded statistics of seasons one plays is important.  \n[b] Repetitive Commentary [/b] - Not annoying, but noticeable\n\nHopefully in patches this game will improve and it will be worth the listed price, but in it's current state I can not recommend this", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505929075, "num_games_owned": 511, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198085455728"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504154", "timestamp_updated": 1505407006, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "34927829", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1505339575, "votes_up": 6, "review": "As a massive fan of Rugby League live 3.This game is a let down!!\nI'm sorry to say this but this feel's like a Step down from RLL3.\n\nAudio - Repeat's itself and overlap's itself alot.\nI don't feel the punch of tackling like i did in RLL3\nthe atmosphere is just the same need more crowd chant's or somethink keep you emerged in the game.\nSound and Audio is just not good in RLL4!!!\n\nGraphic's - There good really good!! one place it looks amazing but is that all they did this time around because the ground's and grass don't look the same as Rll3 which Killed it field and stadium design.\nThe lighting itself is just MEH!

It is fundamentaly very different to RLL3 even though it may look very similar.\n\nOne of the things I found very hard to get used to was using the left trigger and right analog to \"wrestle\" the ball runner to the ground in the tackle. If you don't implement this in pretty much every front on tackle you are going to get smoked and the other team will make easy metres. After 15-20 games though i felt pretty comfortable doing this and like the extra element it brings.\n\nGang tackling is heaps better, the AI will often come and join in to help get a difficult player to the ground which is pretty cool.\n\nOne other problem I had initially was I was head highing people all over the show, in RLL3 you could tackle the opposition while holding the turbo button without much of a worry of giving away a headhigh penalty, this isn't the case anymore and personally I think it adds another good element to the game once you get used to it.\n\nSame goes for the \"big hit\" button (in defence), spamming this isn't happening anymore and you have to be more selective with who you try to use it with.\n\nIn game kicking is fairly similar, although I find standard kicking to be a lot hader to aim accurately but I am slowly getting the hang of it and it's pretty satisfying having to think before you kick and making good metres.\n\nField goals are essentially the same and still easy to pull off, I find Grubbers, chips and bombs are better utilised now and add more of an attack to the kicking arsenal.\n\nIn terms of attacking running, I like the fact that if you spot a gap and hit it hard you can run through it without the AI defence seemingly able to \"morph\" into your path.\n\nThe line and support running of AI players is another improvement i've noticed, delivering inside balls and cut out balls to players running the right line can truly look spectacular.\n\nLinebreaks are a bit too easy to make due to being able to spam the big hit button on attack although actually finishing into a try is a lot harder. I'd like to see the big hit/hitup button tweaked in upcoming patches.\n\nI've seen lots of people complaining about \"floaty\" passing, unresponsive passing especially out of dummy half etc. Can't say i've noticed this issue although I got the game after the latest patch so it may have been rectified somewhat.\n\nOne little thing that is annoying is there is an unusual amount of intercepts, I thought this was an absolutely horrible thing at first but in retrospect the more I play the more I think about where i'm actually passing instead of spreading it out to the flanks quickly to get it to the wingers like RLL3 to score. I do think that it could do with a tweak in the next patch though.\n\nKnock ons and forward passes are pretty much in the same boat, I swear some of the forward passes I've been pinged for are backwards or lineballs at best.\n\nI find the offloading to be almost non-existent and when I do get one away it feels random and clumsy, maybe i'm too used to RLL3 where I could offload at will but it seems like it could use some tuning in future patches.\n\nGoal kicking, kicking off etc is different in this, not worse, just different but doesn't detract from the game at all and if anything adds an extra bit of realism to it.\n\nI find fending and sidestepping a bit harder to pull off (in fact I don't think i've actually managed 1xfend in the 12 hours I've played lol).\n\nCONTENT- All the usual you would expect, career mode is very similar to RLL3 which is a bit of a shame as I feel it could have been expanded on. Fanhub is cool, being able to create and download old school players and as a rugby fan it is pretty cool to be able to download the Hurricanes and All blacks and use them.\n\nI love stats and what we get with this is pretty standard fare. Nothing to write home about.\n\nHaven't actually had a game online yet, had a lot of bad experiences on RLL3 of people rage qutting and It used to piss me off big time, not sure if they have found a way to punish rage quitters yet, i they haven't i'm not really interested in playing online unless it's against someone I know\n\nSOUND- Thank god there is no more Phil Gould is all I have to say. Hah, not really all I have to say though.\n\nCrowds sounds OK, can hear players shouting and calling for the ball, can hear them grunting etc in tackles.\n\nCommentary is probably better than RLL3 although some of the phrases have obviously been lifted from that, Vossy and the engish guy tend to repeat themselves a fair bit but I'd say it's of a better standard than RLL3.\n\nThe soundtrack is better than RLL3, at least to me, has a bit of a metal theme to it.\n\nOVERALL\n\nAll in all I will say the first 15-20 games I played I absolutely hated this game with a passion.\n\nI was on the verge of getting a refund for it but thought \"i'll have one more game of 20min halves and see if I can get used to it\" (had been playing 10min career games before then with 5min halves). \n\nAbout 50-60 mins into the game I started getting used to all the little new nuances in the gameplay and started finding it extremely enjoyable and rewarding.\n\nSo what I'm basically saying is this- it's not RLL3 or RLL2, this feels like it's got a whole new element of tactics and fundemental gameplay, I think you need to go into this game not expecting to have an extremely polished version of RLL3, because like me, you will be dissapointed.\n\nIf like me however you persevere and try to understand the new elements Big ant have introduced I am fairly certain rugby league video game fans will find it as rewarding as I do.\n\nHopefully in the next patch Big Ant can sort out some of the little annoying bugs that still exist and deliver a more polished experience.\n\nIn the current state the game is in I'm happy to give it a 7/10.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505751240, "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198052551184"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_updated": 1506172419, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "35153229", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506172419, "votes_up": 3, "review": "AS SOMEONE WHO LOVES RUGBY LEAGUE DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!\n\nThis game is shit, Dont buy it please, The whole game feels unfinished, The passing is awful, The amount of bugs are unbelievable, The my pro career is useless, So many voice lines are overused \n\nPoor game", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505825751, "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198236343708"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_updated": 1505830063, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "35065123", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1505830063, "votes_up": 3, "review": "Feeling disappointed\n\nAs a massive rugby league fan, im left with a bitter taste in my mouth after spending \u00a339.99 on the biggest pile of garbage on steam.
