Very physically active and you really get the 'thrill of the fight' in this game.\n\nThe arena is great - even just the training - I haven't actually progressed to the campaign yet! There is a great amount of content and replay-ability here.\n\nThe recent addition of chariot racing is really nice and completely unexpected - I recommend using the 'advanced' dual mode for immersion. Control each of your horses individually and winning takes actual skill. New in depth features are being added fairly regularly in addition to balance and useability tweaks - clearly a very active and passionate dev.\n\nThe game is not polished to a very high level particularly in the menus but a large variety of control schemes are supported and the graphical, audio and gameplay are finished off to a high standard. Make sure to set up your control scheme in the menus at the beginning to avoid utter confusion as to how to drop or pick up objects etc - once you know how you've set it up it works great.\n\nAt this price it would seriously be a crime not to own this game.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506732166, "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "steamid": "76561198037254541"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1506246256, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "35070037", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505845937, "votes_up": 2, "review": "This game is Fantastic! yes there are occasional bugs (it is an Early Access) it's seriously playable in it's current state and very under priced. I play alf hour every night as an alternative work out and I sweat buckets playing it!  Using the track pad instead of the teleport to move is a game changer.\n\nIf you want to use your Vive for keep fit then look no further.\n\nLooking forward to further updates, but even in it's current state this is my Number one VR Game and I have 66 of the top rated VR Games.

Either my entire computer hangs, or my Oculus display stop working but the game keeps running on my computer. What could be the issue? The game also may have damaged my Oculus screen because there is now a slight discoloration on the Headset. Am I the only one with this issue? Is this supposed to work on Oculus rift cv1? Will change my review to positive when the issue is resolved.
