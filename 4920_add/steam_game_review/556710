The fantastic and creepy artstyle drew me in, and the challenging gameplay kept me hooked until the end. The difficulty is no joke, the game really is [i]brutally[/i] difficult and many of it's secrets are well hidden behind cryptic puzzles. At times it can even feel almost unfair against the player, but usually that is because player has missed some key item or strategy. Player is required to keep careful eye on his surroundings, as very minor detail can be a clue to solving a problem and progressing further. I also really liked the soundtrack. It really fits well the game's atmosphere.\n\nIn short, this game requires a lot of skill and attention. Otherwise it can be quite frustrating. But if you put the time in, every bit of progress feels extremely rewarding.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
