You can walk right out of the ship.. in fact, you do often since you can't turn off trackpad movement, yet you are expected to use the trackpad for other mysterious things that are never explained.\nNo tuturial.  The trackpad has some symbols on it that are never explained or detailed in any way.  One turns on an inventory screen that you can completely walk away from and leave hanging in space and never realize is open until you try to open it again.\nTeleporting only works in certain areas.  You can't even move down hallways with it.  You have to use the motion-sickness inducing fast-walk trackpad movement.  Which is ridiculously ignorant to clipping planes and even the sides of the ship.\nThere is no aiming reticule on the pistols which were the weapons you start with.  Yet you are punished for not getting headshots?  Again, a tutorial might have been nice.\nNo way to open any kind of menu or option screen to adjust buttons or settings\nNo explanation what the symbols are on the trackpad (which are the same on both your weapon trackpad and your off-hand trackpad and neither are helpful)\nThe interact button never actually works during pauses.  You press the \"interact button to continue\" which does nothing... then, after some random amount of time you are returned to the action.\nYou have absolutely no way of knowing how to interact with anything.  I found out it was pressing down on the trackpad (which moves you away, by the way) so you have to click it fast or end up too far from what you're interacting with.\nThe \"monsters\" barely react to any kind of damage and end up running at you (with no real animation, mind you) while your poor balanced starter weapon tells you it's overheating and can't fire.  \nGood luck interacting with anything once you actually figure out how to open menus (the \"interact button\" dialogues are vague at best) based on instructions written on the walls... was there really such a low budget they couldn't afford someone to TELL you what to do?  Once you get the interaction open (the store, for example) you have no way to close it since aiming at it, shooting it or anything else does nothing.   You have to finally get lucky and get the close button to select and hit all your buttons to close it.  Again, some kind of tutorial on what the hell the \"interact\" button is exactly might have been helpful.\nSO, you're dumped into a room with a sign on the wall telling you nothing about what's going on or how to proceed. I got lucky and found a list of open missions in the TRADE market room?  Of all places...  which, once you figure how how to actually select the mission (there's no pointer interaction or anything) which I did by accident it would seem, you are teleported to another area in a totally dark room with zero instructions about how to overcome the next obstacle.. doors.  \nApparently you have to stick your hand inside the green parts of the door and press buttons until it opens?  At this point morbid curiosity kept me going... the rest was as much of a trainwreck as what I've already typed.\n\nYes, this game is EA, but it's not even in a playable or testable state 4 months after being released.\n\nI have over 100 VR games in my library and this is BY FAR the worst game I've played.  I would expect MAYBE a game like this MIGHT be in this state of disaster in the first week after release.  But, this game's release date into EA was November 2016...\n\nI would avoid this like the plague, on sale or not until it releases.  Even then I think I'll pass since the developers seem to have no concept of what they need to put into the game to get people to be able to even test it or help provide input on it, much less play it.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480138528, "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198117885798"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517741", "timestamp_updated": 1480142820, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "27607303", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 9, "timestamp_created": 1480142820, "votes_up": 15, "review": "I played Star Phoenix until I literally got stuck in the game world next to a locker and couldn't move no matter what I did. That being said, the game is buggy other than that it does seem to have great potential but needs a lot of crucial elements to achieve greatness but at least the devs should know that the bare bones of the game seem good and it is possible to make it great. Most importantly the devs need to implement rag doll physics, this would greatly improve the game tremendously the player wants to see the impact of their actions and gunshots and rag doll physics help implement this by visually showing enemies reacting to impact. Add in a decent weapon and charicture leveling system and a quest like system and you would have a game that people would really have a great experience with . Word of mouth spreads on great game experiences and I'm confident that it would do well with these implantations. Until then, it's just too uninteresting killing the same zombies over and over and then watching them falling over the same exact way every time to keep my interest and the fact that I got stuck in the world and couldn't move makes the game unplayable therefore I give it a thumbs down and will ask for a refund.
