Because that game could be a game changer in fps tournament/arena genre if it was VR playable with these visuals!!! The music choice is really good for this kind of game \"but\" it needs a lot of work on sound design cuz the sound effects on weapons and explosions etc. are kinda killing the atmosphere because they sound like if they don't belong there and gives you that uneasy kind of feeling. Definitely needs more maps and play modes but the game is on alpha stage and the developer is taking care of his child for now and i think this game is a hell of a fun!!!
