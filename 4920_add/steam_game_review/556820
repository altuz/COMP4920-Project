Not that I've played many digital minis games, but bear with me. I'll throw out the the one low point first, the English isn't great and can be confusing (though there's a thread to help them update!). It's enough to get by on, but some unit descriptions are fairly confusing until you see them in action a couple times.\n\nWhere Warbands: Bushido shines is in it's short, tactical PvP battles and the incremental rewards it dishes out that keep you searching for just one more opponent. There are single-player campaigns but since they don't help you level up your units or acquire more than a small handful of units, they're never going to get you into the heart of the game: collecting and maturing a group of Seven Samurai-esque killing machines while planting other people's would-be heroes in the ground. \n\nEdit: Interestingly enough, once you've acquired a number of levelled legendary units, the Insane difficulty scenarios are very challenging, rogue-like experiences which will stretch your tactical expertise to its limits and reward you with a bonus Legendary figure! It's a bit brutal that you'll need quite a few maxed out Legendary figures to even attempt these higher difficulty scenarios, so they're effectively gated behind a lot of PvP time and effort.\n\nUnits are varied and interesting, though fairly dull until they earn XP; which, again, is only available from PvP battles... but you'll acquire some every battle. And your options seem to stay limited for quite a while as you build up player levels and slowly unlock more army points, army size, and collect units and cards in randomized booster fashion. There are a lot of options in the game, and they're not terribly well explained, but if you follow the gold trail of tutorial missions (marked with a college graduation hat icon) until they stop coming you'll get a taste of it all.\n\nAs an avid XCOM player I'd say that this game strikes a wonderful balance between XCOM's tactical battles and Pokemon's collect and upgrade mechanics. Unit balance is solid and well considered, I see no one true path to victory besides collecting legendary versions of whatever units you use best... and before I end this, let me give you some advice: Legendary units (gold rimmed bases) are the best, keep every one you get if you're lucky enough to pull one. Because your max level is limited by the rarity of your soldiers, these bad boys will be able to gain an extra point of almighty 'Toughness' as well as all the abilities that lesser version can gain from levelling. Other units are fine, Epics (blue) are suitable for use in your army at any time, until you can replace them with the golds, but greens and greys are expendable for dust... the currency which, if you can acquire 600-800 of, you can build your own Legendaries without relying on the booster RNG gods.\n\nEdit: After acquiring a band of Legendary units it's clear that balance is geared around max level Legendary units and powerful card combinations, some abilities seem pretty lackluster until you combine them with the extra Toughness of a level 6 unit and/or some of the more devastating cards. A unit may feel more like a Magicarp until it hits that final power-bump and reaches its final form.\n\nIn the end, if you want to play a highly tactical, dice-rolling battle RPG... get this game.

After 20 hours you'll likely have a large and experienced enough warband to see tactics and positioning become dominant over simple exchange of blows and dice-rolling. In other words, the game is not RNG heavy.\n\nWhile gaining early levels, you'll be pitted against near equal human or AI opponents, a skirmish match taking around 5-15 minutes. The battles have a timer to keep players from stalling with analysis paralysis. After reaching level 25 (40 hours game time maybe), it's mostly fully leveled 8-man warbands that clash, and skirmishes take usually 15-25 minutes, depending on players' aggressiveness and the potentially staggering skill difference. The AI still needs a bit work, but all fights against humans tend to be exciting.\n\nBasically you just need to use a right mix of units (30+ available) and their abilities, positioning tactics, and order cards on different maps and against diverse opponents. It's a fun ride to get skilled and get killed by the veteran players with a better eye for the game. Your units only gain skills through skirmishes against AI or other players, and even when you lose a fight, it's no big deal, as your units still gain some experience, and you as a player gain insight to the game dynamics as well. The feeling of progress is encouraging as your player level and your units' levels increase along with your actual skill as a player. Experience requirements for unit levels have just been reduced again, making it much less grindy than before.\n\nThree single-player campaigns are ready with cool units as completion rewards, but don't expect to breeze through the campaigns with a fresh level 1 warband. A 4-man arena ranking mode is available for nerve-wrecking quick fights between experienced players. No microtransactions available, so no pay-to-win or pay-to-save-time. You gain in-game currency through quests like \"kill 10 enemies\" or \"gain 20 morale\", and use the coins to buy random units and order cards. Crafting units is a good way to get exactly the kind of warband you want.\n\nI have not played any similar PvP games, so can't really compare.

I really got tired of the bogus dice roll grind... Seemed like no damage would get done whether using the 3 attack archer or the heavy armor (4) and 3 attack nodachi.  I think their stuff is severely glitched as my nodachie would consistently roll one die when they had a 3 die attack with no movement on an adjacent.  Further the dice would keep producing the stupid dimonds (not damaging anything), I had no problem play cards, but to what end.  Its just very poorly thought out.... Refund requested. \nAdditionally... Maybe they should better explain how the dice system actually works.  As the rules of the game are murky at best.\nYep ... I hate it.\nNo...
