When you go to choose your server If your american you get 2 servers to choose from la or la =(.  Then when you start just like a lot of survival games you wont know wtf is going on.  But the real kicker is you dont know what your harvesting or how much of it your harvesting.  And when you have it harvested theres no clear idea how to build outside of some weapons and tools.  Base building and pvp are the 2 reasons i play survival games. So when you cant figure out how to build something ie: A foundation. It can be a tad bit frustrating. while trying to build the tool tips bug some stuff is in both english and chinese.  Surviving seems meaningless since when you die of starvation or dehydration you just respawn with all of your stuff no concequence what so ever so dont bother farming up materials to stay alive also just log out with your stuff on you since your body dissapears from the game. From the pvp side of it a friend and i spent 30 minutes camping a poor soul bc theres only 1 respawn point on the map so he kept spawning infront of us and we kept killing him...lol right? probably not for him or the other people we did it to.  The pvp wasnt rewarding tho because you cant loot the player! Also sometimes the player could just slowly back step away from you and it would make it impossible to hit him.\n\nThe one thing thats super nice is at lvl 6 you can get a mount/bike and it makes getting around amazing just with the keys werent n to summon and h to get on.\n\nOther things that we expect from a ea game: Random dc. Random sticking and having to reconnect. Random lag while driving (that weird rubberbanding lag back and forth).\n\nI really cant wait to see if they make this game into something awesome tho I find it odd theres only like 7 people playing on release. out of 4 servers 2na and 2eu", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488600626, "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198021479262"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506013", "timestamp_updated": 1488573771, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30301570", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_created": 1488573771, "votes_up": 10, "review": "Unlike some people that say there are no servers there are 2 CA servers for usa and 2 servers for china under official. You may have to hit refresh before they show up. The game is not your normal survival game and you can tell its very early into the development. The guy making the game is not someone that speaks english and uses steam translation forums for the translations so hes not at fault for the translations being bad. The game is a bit empty at the moment but its only been 1 day and Yes it does need work but feed back will bring changes to make the game better. If you want to support someone thats putting everything he has into what hes working on help the guy out and buy the game. Then watch it grow. A tree starts as a seed and cant grow without water.

At this time I cannot recommend this game at all. \n\nPros:\nGame looked intersting and I liked the visial style. Had this nifty effect where the landscape became more animated/drawn looking at night.\n\nCons:\n1. Its only day 2 of it going on sale on steam and me and my buddy were the only 2 people on any of the official servers and there were no private servers. \n2. Couldn't place anything to make a base (foundations, walls, etc)\n3. Creatures WAY to sparce to get the needed resources stay alive and still go explore.\n4.  No instruction/tutorial at all. \n5.

Currently there are numberous key features missing or completely unbalanced. Add to the poor usability and it leads to a DO NOT BUY THIS rating. Don't buy it yet anyway. Maybe in the future with some work Route 66 will be able to get the features functional.\n\nSo as not to seem like I'm mindlessly bashing the title I'll put some things I found troublesome.\n\n1. User interface. Tooltips stay up and show the wrong item, even after you exit the inventory. The clicking buttons are not easy to see. Text is quite often layted over top of already existing text making it impossible to read quickly. Things that need explaining and tool tips don't have them when you want them (skill up items only pop up when you have points to spend). When receiving loot there is no indicator as to what you got. Other assorted quirks like not being able to craft items listed in the workbench even though you have all the ingredients.\n\n2. Gameplay. Crafting is very imbalanced, basic need items require many resources and resources are few and far between, unless you happen to find the never ending spawn spots. When using your power attack via the right mouse button there is no way to cancel the ridiculously long animation which has the potential to make your loot vulnerable to others trying to steal it.\n\n3 Building. Managed to get a Hammer of Build but was not able to place any foundation. There was  no indicator as to why I couldn't. Not sure if it's because I didn't have a foundation but none of the other piece previews worked.\n\nThat said I get that it's in early access but this was absolutely abysmal to play. I hope Route 66 gets this going because the idea seemed pretty neat.

First off I don't think they even hired an English speaker to do their translations so the story that is presented is pure rubbish. The graphics are so 1998 and not in a good way. Also when opening the game it runs my occulus Rift software and the game isn't even a VR game. In order to get sound I have to unplug my Rift first. WTF!!! \n\nAlso I was unable to find a server, correct no Official servers nor any private servers. The only way to play is to start your own server.
