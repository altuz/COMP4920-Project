This would allow it to be a sort of smooth transition and let all those in the school to get the training they need over all. If they reach you, you can reset it and put it higher to allow them to keep going, or leave them low levels and work with it from there. Another thing that would work to be added if having them automatically go into the hot bath when they are completely out of stamina. That way, you could focus more on the training instead of always needing to click all over to get them where you need them to. Even Idle, the jobs tend to drain the stamina quite a lot so it would keep them on tract with going forward and working while you train your fighters up. I definitely recomend it, but there is a lot to improve.

I would definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for a tycoon biased strategy game, or anyone  who enjoys gladiator combat. Although the game is a lot of fun, it still needs some more content. Basically, there is not a large amount of things to do, and you can dominate the game very quickly. Other than that, the game is really fun and really beautifully designed. I give a lot of props to the creators who have tried to bring black gladiators in a fun \"farm-tycoon\" sort of way. You should really give this game a try!", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
