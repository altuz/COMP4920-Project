You party is build as you want, 6 in a group and no classes. now it gets even better. \n You are lost in a maze of connecting portals to different maps, (lands) and with each layer or portal you enter thru, you will get points to add to your characters build.\n As in; \nWeapons - mace, dagger, etc. \nProfessions - alchemy, tailor, 8 types. \nSkills - lockpicking, linguistic, perception, 3more. \nMagic - holy, chaos, fire, plus 5 more. \n And finally the best one -Super-  does nothing but gives additional points, which can be distributed in the above four categories as you so chose. You want a bad ass fire mage who swings a good staff, or sword, you can do it. A barbarian who loves to cook, go ahead.\n Also you have personal stats to add points to when passing each layer, as in strength, accuracy, wisdom, intelligence, vitality, talent, speed, and fortune. (Also by putting points into wisdom you get more magic points and other conversions which will eventually give more super points. Which down the road is Hugh mungus.\n This all gives a personal touch to your builds, and good fun in trying to put a perfect party together.\nAs far as a story, other than being told to enter a portal, and more pestering from the same person who says they are working at the orders of the KIng, there is little story, but found messages add some anticipation of what the hell is going on and eventual discovery. \n Its the draw of making it deeper and deeper thru, just surviving, that makes the game grab and hold me. you can find a portal sometimes very quickly on a new map, and just go on to the next one, but the loot, materials, knowledge, and experience which may be very needed, will be lost.  Dont rush, but also remember that the next fight you have may be your last.  \n If one of  your party survives a fight, and you find a reincarnation well, you'll be o.k. and hopefully you have some stamina, food and magic to go on.\n You can play hardcore, which is the way the game is meant.  Or change gameplay by removing/adding rest, or make more Softcore by adding access to reloading last save,(Start of the map). \n Leaderboard is done by points added from score of each layer, for final tally. \n I found a well once, where you could throw whatever you want into it for additional points, lol, strip down boys and girls. the loincloth is getting tossed, we have a good armorer, just dont throw all the mats down.\n Great game, the graphics meh but np, map is a nice size and you can scroll view easily and see entire map, movement is easy by Kb, but mouse works everywhere except into unknown square, as when entering an unknown room, you will have to step in with kb. No real animation, is beta, so not sure of things in future. In fight members are in set spots, but can be moved forward or to the back of party. its a great party based tatical dungeon crawler right now.\n\nadded bother, if mob dies and you already put orders, why are they not smart enough to pick another target, thats about it, I understand the loot and backpack need and wells of sacrifice, but could we somewhat break down armor and weopons, for even more choices in the game?\n love your game btw", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
