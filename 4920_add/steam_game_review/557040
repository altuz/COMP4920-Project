The developers had agreat idea with a great art style and a good soundtrack. This game looks good. Characters have interesting powers, there's a combo system that is simple yet rewarding a decent upgrade system. \n\nSo why can't I recommend this game?\n\nSimple, the developers knew how to nail the look of a great brawler, but it appears they never figured out how one worked. Its like they never bothered play testing it with anyone other than themselves, and even then only after they had some cheat codes in. The gameplay on normal mode is beyond frustrating, and even on easy I find myself wanting to throw my controller. So we'll list out the major issues that cause this game to go from elevated greatness to dumpster fire after the opening sequence.\n\n1. Enemy grabbing: Players can grab enemies in this game. Thats a usual thing in these types of games, in some games SPECIAL enemies can grab the player. In this game, every enemy can and will grab you and take a good 1/4 of your life on normal and just under a quarter on easy. Most enemies in this game have a go to move of just continually grabbing the player. It s one of the most frustrating things in this game. Not every enemy in a game should be able to grab you continually. \n\n2. Enemy combos: You get caught in one, your done. A group of enemies get on you, your dead. Every enemy in the game is super aggressive regardless of difficulty. Enemies on normal will swar and stomp your face in like you were on the hardest difficulty on a regular game. \n\n3. Speed: Your character is always slower than every enemy so an enemy will almost always punch you before you punch them. The only way to never get hit is to jump into every enemy because if you even try to walk up to them, you will usually immediately get grabbed or combo'd.\n\n4. Enemy aggressiveness: On normal, every enemy runs at you full throttle swinging. they will constantly hit you with dash attacks and frustrate you to no end with how little chance they give you to do anything other than die. \n\n5. Suicide Attacks: Basically this is what I call an attack that hurts your character when you do it. This was a stupid and bad game mechanic in the 90's, its not gotten any less stupid with age. This is generally how you know if your going into a bad brawler these days. If your character has an attack that hurts them, usually the game sucks (not always (TMNT)). It means the developer didnt know what they were doing with the attacks. \n\nOverall I can only suggest you play something better and see what Beat'em Ups done correctly look like, because this isnt it. If the developer cared, they could easily fix this game, and move it into greatness, but I doubt they do. Go play something better: Scott Pilgrim Vs the World, Double Dragon Neon, TMNT 3: Turtles in Time, Foul Play, or Castle Crashers.\n\nTo the Developers: How to fix your game:\n\n1. Lower enemy aggressiveness. Play the games I mentioned above and notice how often and what types of attacs are generally used by enemies.\n2. Raise character attack speed or make it so their striking has a slightly further reach, this can balance enemies striking players problem. \n3. Remove the rebound from the suicide attacks. Having these attacks as free use until the super hard difficulty will make it easier for more casual players to get into and enjoy this game. Look at TMNT 3 for an example of why these attacks are stupid in the first place. If you want to keep players from spamming the attack, create an energy bar that refills slowly for that specific attack. Seriously, play TMNT 3 and tell me how often you used the suicide attack in there.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}]}
