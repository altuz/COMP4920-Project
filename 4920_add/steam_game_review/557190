But this game is really hard and it took me almost 10 tryes just to get past level 3 just because these knights come into play towards the end and at one point thats ALL that is there, and with the units I have there is too many to take them down and they will just kill me and make me lose yet there is one set of barbarians which is what I need but theres so many that I can fight them, but then I end up with the same number of troops. Which happens with the next level as well.. You get a good amount of units and try to get better ones and when you do only one unit spawns in a group and when you go to take them down to add them to your squad you end up breaking even and its annoying because you cant progress.\n\nSo in conclusion I would recommend it only if it is on sale or if this game looks like something you would really like. But watch other people play it first.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
