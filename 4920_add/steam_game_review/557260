Though in reality, that's as much as the developer of this title gives in the way of story; only a handful of e-mails, none relevant to any sort of plot, are found within the actual game.\n\nLet's go ahead and get the good out of the way, because there's a lot of bad that we're going to have to cover here. iREC actually does have decent visuals and optimization. Running on my i7 6700k/GTX 1080 rig, I maintained a solid 130-144 FPS at all times in 1080p resolution, with graphic settings on high. The graphics and lighting are nothing to jump up and down about, but they do help set up a realistic tone and atmosphere for the 40-60 minute duration of this title. That's pretty well the extent of the good here, now on to the bad.\n\nWhile I'm all for a game with little to no handholding, the amount of cryptic and hidden-away puzzle solutions within iREC is absolutely unfounded. A large portion of the people who've played this title become stuck within the first few minutes, while others become permanently stuck due to glitches and bugs. All but one puzzle is numerical based, with the odd-man-out being of the circular match variety. Therefore, if you're not good with math and numbers, you're not going to have a good time; there is not something here for everyone. It's hard to even classify this title as 'horror', given that there are only two or three jumpscares throughout the entire game; the rest is just droning ambiance and darkened hallways.\n\nNow let's talk about the entirely irrelevant inclusion of pro-Trump, pro-Hitler, anti-gay propaganda. It's minimal, but it's there, and it's never out of the way to find. In fact, to progress in the early part of the game you must find a DVD; once you put it into the player, you will be greeted with an entire 7+ minute film of one of Hitler's speeches. Now, it would be more understandable to include some of these things if the antagonist was some Nazi skinhead fascist... but nothing ever eludes to that. There's really no plot at all, and the game has only two short, disappointing endings to boot.\n\nIn short, don't support this garbage. Nothing here makes sense, and definitely not in a \"oh that's so artsy fartsy and creative that it needs to be looked at from an artistic perspective\" kind of way. It's full of prepubescent troll fodder, masquerading around as a \"horror\" game. There's nothing funny about millions of people who were violently killed after being put through hell on Earth, and there's nothing scary about this piece of soiled toilet paper.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.5/5.0[/b] - Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork#curation]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500769479, "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042519780"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501779", "timestamp_updated": 1500769334, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "33732831", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1500769334, "votes_up": 2, "review": "Terrible forced memes and hitler references, the only horror element is how cringey this game can get.
