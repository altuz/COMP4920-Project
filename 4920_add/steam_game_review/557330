The tutorials are only pages to read, so that isn't as good as the game teaching how to play. Game doesn't look like it will be that easy either.\n\nHacking comes down to running across the grids, trying to find the proper nodes to access and defeating ICE in multiple ways without getting knocked out yourself.

The gameplay just has a great \u201cflow\u201d to it and managed to be great fun even during my learning curve when all I knew was to run around and interact with random nodes, and even after I figured out what I was supposed to be doing it managed to keep that \"fun factor\".\n\nHowever, probably one of the best features of >//:System.Hack is \u201cOracle\u201d which allows you to code your own hacking programs, it\u2019s powerful, extremely flexible, and just \u201cfeels\u201d perfect for the setting.\n\nNow, as an Early Release, the game still has a few bugs a couple of minor quibbles here and there, but I\u2019ve yet to run across anything that was Gamebreaking or managed to dent my enjoyment of slicing through systems like a ghost or smashing ICE into oblivion.  The fact that the dev is extremely responsive to both bug reports and feature requests is a REALLY nice change from the usual as well.\n\nOverall this game really is a gem and I\u2019d recommend it whole heartily to anyone that are fans of the cyberpunk genre as well as hacking games in general.\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507049182, "num_games_owned": 508, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 484, "steamid": "76561198017827204"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510086", "timestamp_updated": 1499354423, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33314770", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1499354423, "votes_up": 5, "review": "Even as an advocate of early access and in-dev titles in the past, I've recently been avoiding them almost entirely. Something about this game just made me curioius and I bought it on a whim after playing a decent amount of other hacking games. \nJust keep in mind that early access means the very real possibility of bugs and crashes, unbalanced gameplay, and just the general \"unfinished\" feel. So you should expect this. That said, the dev on this project is EXTREMELY responsive to feedback and on top of any bugs reported. I have no question that he truly respects the opinions of the fanbase and honestly wants to make his game better. Every time I've posted a bug on the forum, it has been fixed in less than 24 hours!\n\nOK, but what about the actual game?\n-There's  a good bit of repitition as you can expect with most hacking games, but in this case you are navigating systems in an FPS style, rather than typing into a console. That may turn off a lot of people right away as \"totally not hacking\".\n\n-An RPG style upgrade system lets you get better at the things you want to focus on. If you like the combat, fighting more IC's will level you up. If you prefer to break passwords and spoof user accounts, your stealth rating will increase. Not an entirely new concept, but in a hacking game it hasn't been greatly explored so far.\n\n-You have a bit of work to start understanding how the gameplay goes, and it can be frustrating and confusing. My advice is to read all the tutorial screens and absorb the most relevant info at the time. You can refer back anytime for whatever starts to confuse you.\n\n- TL;DR version -\nWhat this boils down to is just so; \n-If you want to play a hacking game that isn't like most hacking games then definitely check it out. \n-If the screenshots interest you and you aren't afraid of learning how to play a game while playing it, download it.\n-If you want to support Indie devs who are here to make the best game they can, and not take your money and run, buy it.\nBUT,\n-If you don't like the idea of early access and want to play a finished game, don't buy it.\n-If you're looking for the next Uplink, Hacknet, [your fav hack game here], dont't buy it.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495766697, "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976281073"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502779", "timestamp_updated": 1495386950, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31887025", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1495386950, "votes_up": 3, "review": "Liking what I see so far.

(However, so far the game got better and better with each new update!!)\n\nWhen my characterI first logged into the net of >//:System.Hack I was just amazed how well this cyberspace worked for me. The game is also a lot of fun, accessing the systems and performing various tasks like cracking the access codes to a node via a real well-made and fun mini-game and 1:1 battles vs different intrusion countermeasure (IC) codes ranging from simple block programs to pretty difficult battle codes. So far I did only see a fraction of the IC variants, so I am eager to explore more of the net.\n\nThe game also has player stats in virtual combat and stealth, cryptology and programming. The latter is fun because it allows the player to create new programs for the character. For this an quite amazing script-like language is already in place.\n\nThe player-base is very active and seeing the development of the game first hand is a quite welcome experience. The developers are in close contact with the community and listen to the bug reports and suggestions.

(the same goes for Giants: Citizen Kabuto as well, both of these I went into not knowing what to expect, got something I didn't know how to play and came out on the other side loving...)\n\nThe game is a bit grindy considering the cost for upgrades and your earnings at the start of it all but the better you get at the game the faster you'll earn money as well so....\n\nOne big warning is that pressing the delete button means you'll leave the mission you're on - which I noted due to being a bit too fast with adding the password and wondered if you could delete the number... (adding a \"are you sure you want to leave?\" confirmation screen would be a good idea I think)\n\nGraphics and sound, very nice on both, the spinning things you have to be close to to do the contract do get a tad annoying, I personally focus as much as I can on the ground but I do suspect it may cause nausea with some people.
