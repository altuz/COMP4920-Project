Idle game at its finest.\n\n10/10 would make gold again.\n\nEdit after 270+ hours: Not like the others, this one kept me around this far and seems like I am going way beyond that.\n\nThere is always something you want to achiev and lot things to do , even tho there is a lot of grind walls, it gives you some ways around it if you plan yourself to. \n\nYou can assume it rewards some tactics to advance faster (sometimes WAY faster) than the normal, like combo raid loots with some well thought diamond/knowledge researches that you did at the right time, and also with the right reset to get the right ammount of diamonds.. \n\nWont spoil it so go on and think about the tactics for yourself, its fun and rewarding when you find it. And I didnt even unlocked the Midaeum yet, nor the war outpost. \n\nIt also has a mix of click, idle and combo points that change with the champion you unlock after earn some x of gold.\n\nSo much content and progression done the right way without everwhelming you.

Midas Gold Plus is so deep with restart systems, leveling up of skills and characters, raids, bonuses, boosts, etc, that it just pleases the player, left right and center. \n\n[b]A new reason to sit at the computer and lose yourself in a game[/b]\n\nI've been at the computer for a pretty lengthy time, already today, just leveling up stats, buying upgrades, and watching the gold come flying in. Even better, when I'm out and about, I am actually excited to come back and see what my idle time has unlocked and opened in the game. The fact is, the feedback loop of this game is extremely intelligent in that it rewards the player in very positive ways. \n\n[b]Rewarding experiences for different play styles[/b]\n\nAs you play the game, you begin to unlock advisors which have bonuses that you can use during your play. In the beginning, there are two, one rewards you with bonuses for clicking, one rewards you with idle bonuses. Later in the game (I've yet to unlock more) there are advisors with even stranger skill sets. You can change your advisor on the fly, so if you're at the computer, select the guy with skills that reqard clicking, if you go out, select the one who rewards idle time. \n\nIt's painless and easy to switch advisors, and each time you switch, you have a bunch of new bonuses and boosts to use your money on to upgrade. \n\n[b]A must download for clicker fans[/b]\n\nThis game is free. Simply put, even without paying a single penny, you'll enjoy this game if you enjoy clicker games. It's simply just perfectly thought out, very rewarding, and progresses at a wonderful pace, whether you pay real money or not.\n\nAdditionally, if you DO decide to pay real money, the packages are very fairly priced, and the \"Hot Deals\" packages are fantastic bonuses that supercharge the gameplay from the get-go. \n\nIf you are a fan of clicker games, and you are on the fence about this game, take it from me. It's well designed, rewarding, deep as the sea, and fantastic fun. \n\nQuit reading this review and download the damn game, for goodness sakes.

I think that was the plan in the orginal myth, but he dies or worse like any greek tragedy... Anywho here you do click rocks to make gold and start leveling up a little village set up, to become a major powerful kingdom. A clicker/idle game- its just profiting and reaching high gold production rates with your villages sawmill, ranger guild, barracks and such. More gold unlocks more stuff. Rinse by restarting to get more powerful and repeat.Now, this isnt just an AdVenture cap where its just making money...this is where the Plus comes in. Raids, Knowledge books, Diamonds, Blue rocks, Red gems, Relics and Champions are all things you use this gold to upgrade and buy and unlock to further more earn gold and make you kingdom awesome. Whew, Thats alot of stuff huh? well yes, but it makes the game have more microorganizing and micromanageing ,thus more fun. Raids and Relics and Diamonds and ALL THOSE things basically without nit picking what each does and its rewards is just to buff or increase production to make you gold. In some way. Clicking still works on the rocks...lol. Names of champions and places to raid and such seem to all come from some form of mythology. Major, I havent seen anything form like celtic or Mayan, but yes Greek and Norse mythology names are thrown around alot here. It is King Midas...
