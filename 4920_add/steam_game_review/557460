It is similar to a 1v1 MOBA, except the VR player is a god. The VR player is then able to control a hero and join the troops on the field and fight against the PC player. Sounds awesome in concept. I have enjoyed playing it with my friends, however it is pretty bare bones and leaves a bit to be desired at the moment. It is an early access game, so that is to be expected.\n\n[h1]PC: [/h1]The controls and fighting style of the PC player are slightly clunky and difficult at times. All around just not very smooth. [i]Yet[/i]. Fingers crossed. And while the flying is a nice touch, and levels the playing field a bit, the animations of it are slightly comical. The flight controls are acceptable.\n\n[h1]VR: [/h1]As the VR player the bow mechanics leave a lot to be desired currently. The melee combat coupled with the movement (which is done via the trackpad) is not that effective or enjoyable. It seems to put a hastily made FOV blocker to reduce motion sickness. It works, but it's just a picture with a little hole in the middle, instead of the usual fading black. It was also kind of weird to see under it. But it served it's purpose.  I hope that all of this changes with updates, as it easily could become my favorite local multiplayer game. \n\n[h1]tldr;[/h1] I'm going to recommend this game, mainly because I like the concept, I did have fun, and I want to see this game succeed and develope into something amazing. However, if you are expecting a fully fleshed out, local multiplayer game to spend hours upon hours playing with friends, you may want to wait a bit to jump on this one. \n\nCurrently: 6.5/10", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504374839, "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992506599"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504161", "timestamp_updated": 1487466785, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "29552232", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485644958, "votes_up": 2, "review": "Great game with promise, but right now the balance is off.  It is like an assymetric MOBA. \n\nThe problem with the balance is that the players can destroy towers without any need to kill the minions.  As of this writing, as the PC player, you may fly to a tower and kill it alone before it kills you.  I am sure with future balance patches this will not be possible and it will get much better.  \n\nI am looking forward to how this game evolves and finally turns out.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486452717, "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198031768565"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "timestamp_updated": 1486453823, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "29756964", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1486453823, "votes_up": 1, "review": "The game has obiously some issues as it is at a very early stage.
