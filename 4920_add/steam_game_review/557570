This is the updated Steam version of the original mobile version of the game.  \n\nThe way the game is presented is by two parts - the Story part, and the Puzzle-solving part:\n- The Story part consists of mainly text. You'll be presented with the story of Able Black and the overall circumstances that lead him to take the Citizenship Exam.\n- Then there's the Puzzle part, which consists of stories, imagery and options that you shall pick depending on the question or objective that's being asked for you to do. After solving the Puzzles, the cycle starts over with another Story part and so on.\n\nThe Story is, without fail, pretty good. If you're into science fiction stories, where you're given enough space to form your own conjectures until the story proves you what the truth is, then you sure are going to enjoy this. Though it's mostly only text and very few visuals appear, I found myself highly interested in it, wanting more. The few turns and twists that were slowly presented to me, were enough to make me continue all the way to the end. On the other hand, there's the Puzzles.\nThe Puzzles the game includes are not particularly hard, but they sure are meant to be given a focused line of thinking. You will be given all the information you need, so there's no need to worry about obtuse puzzles. In any case, you will be given hints for each puzzle, so don't be afraid to use them if you get stuck.\n\nSomething I need to remark, without trying to give any kind of spoilers: if you do NOT like psychological tests or the feeling of being psychoanalized by the choices you make, then I'm afraid to say this isn't the game for you. The game will present you with moral dilemmas and choices related to the Story and the game will present you with a result/conclusion based on what you choose. If you feel not interested or annoyed by this kind of gameplay, be wary if you still decide to try this game.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, it was a good experience and I highly recommend it. The overall design and presentation the game gives on both the Story and the Puzzles is very cool; even though \"simplistic/minimalistic\" looking, it works in favor of the game, making it enjoyable and giving it a more polished look, a detail that seems to be overlooked by several indie games.\nThough the main story is a bit short (around 1.5 hrs, puzzles included) you still are presented with secrets that you can feel free to explore in the game if you so desire. \n\nThis is a very cool little game, and I'm really glad I was able to enjoy as one of the last games of the year.

I've certainly never really wanted to recommend one. If you're looking for something that is somehow based in logic puzzles, existentialism, philosophy, challenge of authority, nostalgia, and deep rooted emotions, look no further. Play Able Black. Somehow, within minutes of play time, I was hooked -- not just hooked, but keenly aware of my own feelings.\n\nThe game is on the dark side.

I went into it blind and found the mix of visual/digital novel and puzzle game to be quite refreshing. It's an interesting experience, rather casual but with quite a bit of humor. If you're familiar with Sci-Fi works of Asimov for example you will feel right at home but it's by no means necessary background.\nI'm looking for experiences in games more than bare mechanics and in this regard the game delivered more emotion and intrigue than a lot of blockbuster movies. It has that curiosity factor of wanting to know how the story progresses.
