There are some really clever (or trolling) puzzles and so much of this game operates on a \"dream-like\" logic. The characters are well fleshed out and lovable so you'll surely find yourself rooting for them a lot, and getting upset when bad things happen. It's dark but also very funny at times. Plus the unique mystical yet minimalistic aesthetic is worth playing it by itself! Definitely a game I will remember fondly forever. And it's real cheap so what are you even doing reading this chaotic \"review\", just go play it and see for yourself!!", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500286109, "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198361103888"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1500190046, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33503614", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1499953339, "votes_up": 1, "review": "Are you a fan of surreal atmospheric gory creepypasta-esque games like Yume Nikki, OFF, Mogeko Castle, Mad Father and Fran Bow? \n\nDo you spend more than 10 hours a day on tumblr? \n\n\nThen you will probably love Hello Charlotte. \n\n\n\nBe aware that this is catering to a very specific taste of internet culture. It's exactly what you expect out of a cutesy-creepy RPG Maker game of this type. Well executed as far as style & writing goes but not much \"gameplay\" to speak of.\n\nI guess my main complaint is that i wish it had been a full blown VN or point&click game as i tire of these pseudo-RPGs...otherwise, yeah it's worth your time. And the first chapter is freely available over at itch.io. Go play that one first or you will be very confused.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
