There aren't tons of modes but for $2.99 it's good fun. Using a cannon is a nice change from using your hands/arms to chuck snowballs, and it's very gratifying. I got startled when the flying dudes flew into me at warp speed. I like how the bells works too, where your firing speed depends on the number of snowballs you have. \n\nA huge plus is having steam leaderboards too. Devs who make cheap games often opt out of this but it's a nice touch especially for a $3 game. \n\nMy overviews: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnitxI7LGDY", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
