Good characters, good plot, funny dialogs and suspense really go well together.\nI played the game in two days and to be honest, I wish there could be a sequel (but that's not possible since \t[spoiler]most endings don't end well\t[/spoiler] even the \"good ending\", that last one takes you on a roller coaster of emotions with a lot of informations to process.).\n\nUn tr\u00e8s bon jeu qui se joue comme un film interactif (avec les interrogatoires).
