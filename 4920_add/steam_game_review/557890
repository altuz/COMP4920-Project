You get it for free.\n\nAlso I've got the DLC in a bundle, so nothing to complain about. I also managed to get 100% of the achievements in less than 1 hour. You should definitely play this if you intend to improve your game completion rate :).\n\nAlso there's really no difficulty in it since it's a visual novel. Requires 3 playthroughs to unlock all story elements and all achivements, still takes well under 1 hour.\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
