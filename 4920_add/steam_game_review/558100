What you think your ennemy might play factors a lot into that choice, let's say you faced an oponent before, and you know he prefers terrans, banning terran skills and troops might force him out of his comfort zone. \n\nthen once in-game, MANY choices are in front of you, do you produce mass low tier troops? do you produce minimal amount needed to hold back the ennemies to save for early tier 2 or 3?? then you need to make decisions to counter the ennemy tactics, for example, they have no anti-air early on, instead of your usual tactics you then produce flying troops to force them to adapt, etc.\n\nAlso after playing a while and gathering a lot of currencies you start unlocking advanced troops, then again adding another level of strategy to the game, as some troops are \"weaker\" but have amazing active abilites you then must decide when to use.\n\nAll in all, GREAT game!! can't wait for the actual release!\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502121139, "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198135447714"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503237", "timestamp_updated": 1485104885, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "29426490", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1485104885, "votes_up": 3, "review": "This game is easy to understand and play but  very hard to master, Its great fun to play with friends.
