It is largely just reading, with a pretty limited interactive puzzle based on what you read. I think this is not really taking advantage of the medium at all, an education game should FOCUS on the interactive experience allowed by the fact of being a game. As it was presented here, it just felt like I was reading an \"Astronomy for Dummies\" book, like chapter 1 or 2, with some clicking periodically and extra story thrown in to give some kind of excuse. \n\nThe puzzles themselves are pretty simple because they rely so heavily on one or two sentences of what you read, a couple basic principles each. While that's not particularly bad, the fact you have to read so much for such short simple puzzles which boil down to simple concepts is definitely off putting and never really gives a feeling of accomplishment, or learning, really. \n\nIt really reminds me of being in the astronomy section of a science museum but with more reading and fewer interactive exhibits, actually. It might be worth picking up on sale for some specific purpose, but even then, I might wait until something better comes along.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
