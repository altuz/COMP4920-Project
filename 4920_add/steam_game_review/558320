The game feels a bit like what you'd get if \"Scratches\" and \"Dear Esther\" had a love child.  The game marries the best features of both to create a rare style of exploration-based adventure game that you don't see very often.  (I wish we saw games like this constantly).\n\nThe first half of the game is very, very strong.  Fantastic atmosphere, a real sense of exploration and wonder, an excellent union of beauty with a sense of the decrepit, and an impied mystery left entirely to your own imagination -- you'll most likely start to ask yourself, \"What the hell happened here?\"  Answering that question is arguably the main plot, but is left entirely to the player.  In terms of finishing the game, you can completely ignore that aspect of the game and focus only on the puzzles instead.  This gives a true touch of realism to the game, as you're FAR from hit over the head with the story.  It's fantastically there, but the option exists to go about your business nearly oblivious to it.\n\nPuzzle design is also excellent.  Difficulty is usually exctly right, and most are rigorously grounded in logic.  This does begin to break down towards the end though, as the game features two puzzles that are arguably far more difficult than they should be for tenuous reasons.  [Update 2/19/17: The game has been updated to make these puzzles far more fair to the player.]\n\nThat leads to the game's only real negative: the second half of the game is less strong than the first.  I don't want to get into spoilers in a game review, so suffice it to say that, eventually, \"an appearance of supernatural elements\" bubbles up.  As the game was managing to be a near-perfect example of realism-based atmospheric horror before then, this change actually feels unwelcome when it comes.  The ending, however, puts a renewed ambiguity on even that which makes up for it.   \n\nThat said, the only REAL flaw I care to highlight is the two not-exactly-sensical puzzles that will likely grind your firstplaythough to a long, abrupt halt where you'd least enjoy that.   [Update 2/19/17: The game has been updated to make these puzzles far more fair to the player.]  However, if you have a gentle walkthrough to fall back on for just those two moments, this is definitely forgivable for the rest of the experiece.\n\nHighly recommended.
