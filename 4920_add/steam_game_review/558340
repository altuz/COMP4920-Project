That's this game in a nutshell.\n\nAnother game published by Artifex Mundi that falls flat when it comes to interesting and fun game play. The story seems extremely rushed. The protagonists have no motivation and even less background. The voice acting is pretty bad and the dialogue is poorly written.\n\nThe presentation is pleasant, but there are long stretches of sewers and caves which are clearly filler material. Combine that with the quite short length of the game (around 90 minutes for your first play through) and it leaves a bitter aftertaste. Usually I don't feel to bad to spend just under 5 \u20ac at launch for these type of games, but this one is surely not worth that much.\n\nThe puzzle design (both minigames and the inventory based ones) are either recycled from other games (you even get to keep coins through half of the game to use them as a 'screwdriver' again later and I'm not sure if that is supposed to be an insider joke or not...) or just very bland.\n\nOverall the game doesn't have an intersting story nor interesting game play and it's far too short for the price. I can't recommend this game except if you pick it up in a bundle.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484949432, "num_games_owned": 4199, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025257831"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514498", "timestamp_updated": 1484944415, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "29383128", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_created": 1484944415, "votes_up": 10, "review": "It's your average hidden object game although I'd say it's slightly below the average Artifex Mundi quality.\n\nThis game is the essence of a \"casual\" game, its difficulty level is quite low, even for this genre. Minigames require barely any thinking or planning, but HO scenes are actually quite clever and managed to get me stuck couple times. I enjoyed the mini-HO games in small frames, they were actually quite refreshing.\n\nThe story started rather interesting, but in the end it seemed like it was rushed and cut in half. I've had a problem with some voice over actors. As always, some were better than others, but this time Kristin Price-Wilson voiced over a supporting character rather than the protagonist and it felt quite weird.\n\nThe game's quite short, I think it took me about 2h to complete it, so you might want to wait until it's on sale.
