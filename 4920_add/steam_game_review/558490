It is nice to be challenged on puzzles instead of basically the same thing  in HOGs.  I decided to leave the game loaded on my computer so I can go back later and do them all over again because I liked the mini games that much.  IF you are looking for a bit of a challenge I recommend this highly.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
