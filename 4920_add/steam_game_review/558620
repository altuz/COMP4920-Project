On sale so that was pretty sweet. The guns are a little slow but other than that it's a pretty good game..reminds me of space invaders. The bosses are a bytch though. You have to purchase the upgrades damn near everytime you go into a level. My upgrades tend to run out when i get to the boss though which bites.
