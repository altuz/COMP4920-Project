So i try to make a box of equal sides, lets say 10cm or whatever the units of measure they use, just try to set the table saw at 10 is a mission itself, should be a achievement just for that, so first cut done, right lets make a second cut the other way to make a piece of 10x10 wood, well i think i cut it into 5 small pieces and the wood wasn't even near the blade.\nOk, lets try attaching 2 pieces of wood together, lets try a nail, well the 1 nail a can find, hammer it in, nail disappears, no luck. Ok lets try this brad looking gun, no its a staple gun that does nothing, lets try this tool, ok it does nothing other than spin and make some sounds. Right what are these ball things, ok so you use these balls to stick things together, well that just stupid.\nJust trying to keep something in your hand is hard enough, ffs, why do i have to click and hold. Seriously game is so bad in its current state, why would you release it.\n\nConcept is good but execution is bad, real bad, only thing that can save the game is if they update very quick and regularly, min once a week.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492433866, "num_games_owned": 402, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071910990"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "weighted_vote_score": "0.510236", "timestamp_updated": 1481211112, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "28254560", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1481211112, "votes_up": 6, "review": "Game first stopped at the first tutorial, was fixed by a simple restart.. once i got into the workshop i got confused as to what there is to do? you can pick up a lot of tools but not use them for anything?  i tried to put together a small table, but the nails didnt really work what so ever? nothing except for the bench and chalkboard really did anything...\nCan't recommend this game at it's current state.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481542923, "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198158033341"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502047", "timestamp_updated": 1482573633, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28588717", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1482573633, "votes_up": 3, "review": "Overall,  good.\n\nPros:\n\n- Idea of the game is great. Would be amazing to turn the virtual making into an actual object in the future\n- Graphic is quite good. Easy to play. I like building things freely via the tools which can be found in the physical world\n- There are weekly updates. The team is actually working hard on it\n\nCons:\n\n- There aren\u2019t so many game level designs here. Tool functions may need to be enhanced.\n- It will definitely be great if I can save my making so that I can continue next time. I saw the updates and they are developing this function. GOOD\n- The robot is cute, but it\u2019s just like a decoration at the current stage. Would be much better if there are more interactions or game level instructions from it\n\nGenerally speaking, I recommend this game.
