I think most of the puzzles were self-explanatory but some were taking too long to maneuver pieces or there were multiple levels to complete and I just skipped them. \n\nI give this game an 8/10 for catering to my impatience, being bug-free, and including more than the usual hidden objects.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499630149, "num_games_owned": 2080, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198080204442"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506911", "timestamp_updated": 1499630664, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33413589", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1499630664, "votes_up": 5, "review": "This is one of the first HOG I have played in awhile that was heavy on the actual hidden object scenes.
