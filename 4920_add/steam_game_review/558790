The art is amazing, and there\u2019s the \u201calchemy system\u201d that adds a nice feature in order to make potions. Overall, this title was quite fun.

To the writer\u2019s credit, the story almost manages to keep all of this together coherently up until the last act, where it feels like as if the roaring head of a deadline resulted in rushed decisions.\n\nThis deadline also affected the gameplay. For quite a while, the game treats us with a wide variety of hidden object scenes, but as we near the end, they just give up and resort to the most simplistic variation. Similarly, conventional puzzles almost disappear by then, as if there was no time to design them.\nStill, up until this last segment, Queen\u2019s Quest 2 is a well-made HOG, a big step up compared to the previous entry.
