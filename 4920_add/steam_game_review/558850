There are \"mana\" regen crystals that fall to shoot for regen and soft spots on monsters to hit with a sword and the magic. You have to dodge attacks also. There is a hardcore mode now where one hit kills you. It is quite immersive as you feel like you are really there and it does make use of the room scale space of the VIVE which is a plus.
