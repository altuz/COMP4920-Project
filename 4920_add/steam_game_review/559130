It was kind of hard to figure out at first. It does not really lead it's story that well in my opinion. It did have a couple good jumpscares but I think there is more to the game than I go to. If you like horror games check it out. I would recommend giving it a shot. I had fun when I played it. I just felt there could be more done with it.
