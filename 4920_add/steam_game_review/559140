Upon firing the game up it seems like it's well suited for the touch controllers. The play area looks cool and interesting. I noticed some performance issues which shortned my play experience with it (motion sickness).  I'm running on a gtx 970, I7 4790k, Most games run well on my system but at lower settings so this could be due to lower system specs but my gut says that it's just an early access optimization aspect.  About half my shots would go up in the air and flop down onto the lane without much momentum. I suspect this is due to some kinks with performance they're working on. When my shots did register as expected it was really cool.  I could see myself playing this alot when it is more fluid. \n\nOne critique I would like to offer up is that it is mentioned this game is suited for room scale/ standing/ sitting experiences but currently I think it is only suited for room scale.  Perhaps they are adding ways to accommodate the other play styles? Personally I think that is really cool to aim for because I'm on the rift and while I have some mobility in my room, until I get my third sensor,  I like being able to warp around as needed.  This allows me to orient my game experience to my living room layout on the fly. For instance, my living room is wider than it is long, so I would prefer to be able to rotate my game orientation so that the direction I run towards the lanes to shoot is along the longer direction of my living room layout. \n\nOverall I'm excited to see where this game goes.  I love vr games like this.

The theme is great, and I like the art direction and I know it can be a really fun game potentially. I am having a lot of performance issues though. I don't know how optimized the game is currently or if the Physics is just too much for my rig. I'm not gonna request a refund though, because I really wanna see how this game progresses in early access.\n\ni5 4670K 8GB 2133Mhz DDR3 980 Ti STRIX OC.\n\nCurrently there are too many playability issues for me to recommend this right now.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484963054, "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198176502750"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1484964823, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28724448", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1482868207, "votes_up": 1, "review": "[Bias Review][Tried to be as Unbiased as Possible]\n\n====================\n| Simple Spec Sheet |\n|Graphics| 980ti\n|CPU| i5-4570 @ 3.6\n|RAM| 16gb Corsair Vengeance 1600mhz\n-----------------------------------------\nJanuary 20, 2017\n-----------------------------------------\nI can definately see the progress that is being made on the game, and I think it is going in the right direction.\n\nThe most important thing I have noticed is that I stay at a consistent 80-90 fps, with 0 lag spikes.\n\nI appreciate the addition of an options menu to turn down different sounds.\nAs of right now the video quality options aren't easily accessible (read patch notes for more info)\nI also appreciate the option to use animated or regular pins.\n\nCriticisms:\n ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---\nI think that the touch pad is cluttered, but maybe that is just me.\nI think you should be able to access the option menu during a game.

Disregarding the performance issues the scene i got to see looked great. It felt  like I was in a real fictional bowling ally that for some reason only has a minute amount of lanes.\n\nI would recommend:\nA high quality trailer (currently no video on steam, and the one video I saw was very low production/low quality)\nOption menu ASAP (the continuous moans and gasps of the pins can get annoying)\nFix performance ASAP!! The framerate currently gives me a headache)\n\nI am not returning the game because I am related to the devs\n\nFinally, why is Free to play in the tags?
