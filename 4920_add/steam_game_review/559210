Combining the cinematic storytelling with the exploration mechanics of classic Zelda titles, Rakuen is an incredibly personal project and you can really feel its creator's touch on every aspect of the game. As a non-combat, story-focused game created with RPG maker, I'll try to focus my review on these elements specifically.\n\nThematically, it's probably easier to compare Rakuen to titles outside gaming realm such as the animated movie 'Spirited Away'. Rakuen's main themes are family, friendships and the duality of life & death, which it generally handles pretty well - even though the pacing, depending on the player may seem overly melancholic and in some instances even pushy. I've seen many people hype this game up mainly as a tear-jerker, what for me feels both as an overstatement and disregard to other parts of the story which I found great. I do think that Rakuen has a touching plot, but the real highlight for me was its amazing side characters and hilarious writing that acted as a good counterpart for the overrall sad tone.\n\nOn a mechanical level, Rakuen shines. The limitations of the RPG engine and how the developer approaches them is often a good way of judging a game, and Rakuen feels like the framework was created for it and not the other way around. Completely dropping combat aspects works well, and the usually tedious puzzle-solving of RPGM titles is done in a way that entwines it well with the story. For me however, the enjoyability of said puzzles varied greatly. A classic Zelda-esque dungeon was an amazing experience, but some of the more cramped and ominous parts felt monotone and only times I wished for a peek in the walkthrough.\nGraphically Rakuen is a treat with good character design, beautiful enviroments and fitting effects. The unique artstyle coupled with original soundtrack might not be for everyone, but they really nail home the creator's passion for the project.\n\nOverall, Rakuen deserves the praise it's gotten - if it had been published to a handheld console ten years ago, it would be definitely praised as a classic gem by now. Even now, it's a great example for both what you can do with such a simple engine and the emotional depth you can create with a videogame.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507076681, "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 529, "steamid": "76561198113741945"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505650", "timestamp_updated": 1506879849, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "35390876", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506879849, "votes_up": 2, "review": "I just finished this game and I am still crying from it.

The key to really immerse the player is to make the game world and its inhabitants feel natural and act in a way that makes sense. With that said, Rakuen is nowhere near an \"ordinary\" world and its approach to magic and wonder is what really captured my attention and in the end my heart.\n\nYou will get to know a wide range of characters and at the end of the game you'll really miss them. You care for them, you want to see what they do next. Each character felt unique and each of the \"main NPCs\" got their own arcs and stories told within the bigger story of Rakuen. In the end it all connects in an emotional and a natural way.\n\nThe music is probably my favorite part of Rakuen. I bought the full soundtrack even before I started playing the game itself just because I heard one of the songs on Youtube. Gosh, these songs will pull at your heartstrings!\n\nI don't wanna discuss the game more because this game is best experienced if you don't know too much about the world of Rakuen beforehand.
