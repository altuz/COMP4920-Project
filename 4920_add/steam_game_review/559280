It blends the two together beautifully! The price asked for this game is a STEAL for what you are getting!\n\nUnderstanding that it is in EA, the game is better than most of the fully released games for VR so far!  The graphics and animations are top notch! Aiming is precise. Movement is done with a teleport system - which I don't mind at all.  I play hours at a time and I do not feel the least bit motion sick nor do I have any headaches, which does happen (one or the other - or both) to me in some other games...\n\nThe game saves the level you are at and the weapons you unlocked automatically if you exit, which is nice as I have a tendency to take my headset off and close the game with the mouse, rather than the in game exit steps.\n\nI've completed the game up to the convention center with no issues at all.  The beginning tutorial is appropriate to show you how to play, and you can repeat it as needed to get the hang of things.\n\nNOTE: you MUST have the sound on (either thru speakers or earbuds) as the tutorial is talking you thru some activities. I did not have my sound on and thought the game was broken and restarted it twice.  When I turned on the speakers, I heard what I was supposed to do.\n\nI very highly recommend this game!  I am very much looking forward to seeing what else the developer does with the game as it nears release. The passion the team has for details and quality are apparent in the polish of this EA release.\n\nI can't bestow enough kudos to this game or the development team!  If you are a fan of tower defense - get this game... YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThe developer is really quick to respond to issues/problems with a patch to address them.  Within  just a couple hours they had a patch out for an audio issue I had.  TOP NOTCH TEAM!", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
