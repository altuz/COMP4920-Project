First, for a MMO, the game's community is exceedingly welcoming to newcomers.  Many of the established players are willing to answer basic questions in the chat, and even provide early game resource donations.  The game world is suitably large and there is a strategic depth to the game that requires classic \"guns vs. butter\" decision making.\n\nThose things said, there are two components of the game that prevent a recommendation.\n\nThere is absolutely a P2W aspect to the game.  It's not overbearing, but it is there.  There are time gates to facets of the game; things such as building construction, resource gathering, trade and others all occur in real time.  If you want to avoid the wait, you can \"rush\" the completion of these tasks by spending Prestige (the in game currency that is available for purchase).  \n\nOf course, one can play the game in such a way that rushing construction and so forth doesn't make too big of a difference.  If you are of the mind that you simply wanrt to develop a network of varied cities, conduct research, gather resources and so forth without engaging in the PvP, you can certainly do so (so long as one of your more established neighbors doesn't get itchy and decide you are a prime target).  However, that brings up the second critical flaw.\n\nAs you constuct your initial city, you will be able to research certain technologies that allow for varied buildings and units.  This is all worthwhile as it forms the foundations of what your city can produce.  However, once you have progressed enough to settle a second city (and start thinking about the new tenor this city will possess) you are met with the fact that you have to start all research over again.  In other words, even though you researched the Militia technology in the first city (a necessity), you have to research it again in your new city.  Seeing as the object of the game is to create and foster an integrated kingdom, this mechanic makes absolutely no sense and is unnecessarily frustrating.\n\nIn the end, if you are looking to engage in the social aspect of a MMO, Illyriad is probably as good a choice as any other.  However, if you are looking for a game that provides a sense of progression and proportionate reward for effort, this game will likely disappoint.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500662256, "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198213433584"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1500580673, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33680018", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1500580673, "votes_up": 2, "review": "Although I have only owned the steam version for a couple of days I have been an Illyriad player for the past 3 months and I absolutely love this game.  When I set out to find a browser based game I had a couple things in mind: Fantasy setting, decent presentation, doesn't DEMAND much of my time but could occupy it if I wanted to, has an interesting mechanic, and has a good community.  Illyriad passed this test with flying colors.  \n\nIllyriad as a setting is an amazingly vast space with so much varied terrain and just enough fluff to inspire your own imagination.  \n\nThe graphics are simple but well presented.  \n\nThe demand on your time can be as little or as much as you want.  If you're away from the game for a few days your cities will be fine (most likely).  If you're worried about that and you have made a couple trusts worthy friends in game they can sit your account for you until you return.  Once you have settled a couple cities and have built them up there is so much you can do with diplomacy (mostly spying), building, researching, crafting, selling, and , oh yes, war.  \n\nThe mechanics work and are deeply layered in this game.  You can't learn it all in one sitting but if you take it a little at a time you'll eventually understand.  Nothing is very complicated but there are many simple mechanics at work with most in game activities.  A key thing that you must learn is that TEAM WORK is the backbone of this game.  Not graphics,  micro transactions, celebrity voice acting, nor unique game play... Its team work.\n\nWhich brings me to community.  Illyriad has an outstanding community.  It is so full of helpful and friendly players.  When I first started I was given a very sizable shipment of goods just for asking a question in global chat.  There are a lot of charitable people in this game.  However there are some who are not so.  There are militarily aggressive alliances as well as peaceful training alliances. Both have their place and I enjoy a world that allows me to construct these intricate cities but also presents a reality where they could be under threat.  I'm not trying to write a guide but I do urge new players to research the player alliances and pick the best one for you.\n\nI think most people that give up the game or who don't like it are ones that tried to go at it alone.  People sometimes complain that there is no real PvP.  That is a complete lie.  There are always attacks going on.  And if you want that PvP you can have it.  The problem is if you go at it alone and choose your targets carelessly then you will be confronted with the awesome might of one or more of these alliances.  That's not the work of the dev's.  That's the community.  If you can't accept that, then this game may not be for you.\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504011322, "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198406120924"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "timestamp_updated": 1500736140, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33722940", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1500736140, "votes_up": 2, "review": "I love this game and all the depth the developers have put into it.
