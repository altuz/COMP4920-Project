Buut, it doesn't affect the gameplay tho so it's okay. [spoiler]Meeting the big guy thingy in wave 6 I think it just too much for a beginner *sob*[/spoiler]\n\nThe idea about farmers fight for Haaria is actually pretty impresive. However even though the logic behind \"if you loose, you loose everything\" is awesome, my heart still cannot accept it. Mah pride ... Mha hart ... [strike]mha village people I've rescued but ended up back to the bad guys because I f*cked up [/strike] ;_;)/\n\nAnyway, I recommend people to play this game, it's a bit hard in the beginning but its gets easier once you get used to it. The gameplay is easy to understand, and the graphic are cool. I kinda recommend the creator to use voice dub for the story everytime we retreat. You can expand the game more, and I hope you will never stop creating <3", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 2}]}
