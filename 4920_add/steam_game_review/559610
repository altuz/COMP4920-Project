The girls, who meet as strangers after not even knowing about each other\u2019s existence for their whole lives, end up living and going to school together and after initial misunderstandings start developing feelings for each other. This leads to a rather deep and realistic story of forbidden love, that ends up happily, but never ignores the challenges and social stigma that comes with the protagonist\u2019s choices.[/b]\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat heavy on sexual themes, even without the 18+ content unlocked (I never installed the patch), but for me these elements never felt forced or distasteful \u2013 they always had an actual role in the narrative. The wording could be described as somewhat pornographic, but it never bothered me enough to actually feel out-of-place and the NSFW moments weren\u2019t that numerous anyways, so they couldn\u2019t overshadow the core story.\n\nThe game\u2019s art and music are of high quality, just as I expected from the maker of Starlight Vega. The sprites (only the two main characters have any) and background aren\u2019t that numerous or heavy on detail, but they\u2019re pleasing to the eye and the CGs are all gorgeous (from what I\u2019ve heard, that applies to the sexually explicit ones too). As the story is pretty short (around 7 hours for full playthrough) the characters aren\u2019t extremely deep, but full focus on the main couple and their relationship helps it quite a bit. The protagonist, Iris, might seem a bit bland, but her thoughts and actions feel very realistic and the second sister, Zoey, is also above all a consistent character that starts as rather unlikeable and grows over time in slightly predictable, but still interesting and believable ways. \n\nThe plot itself doesn\u2019t always surprise you, but it feels sincere and well-written, so it easily brings the enjoyment and emotional impact this kind of story should deliver. [b]Especially with the expanded epilogue, it\u2019s really a satisfying read that doesn\u2019t try to force feelings out of you with some cheap tricks and doesn\u2019t fetishize the subject matter to the point where it would be off-putting. Above all, it\u2019s a really good love story that should be satisfying for all fans of yuri VNs or romance in general.[/b] \n\nWhile it\u2019s somewhat short and light on player choices (and only one of them alone decides the ending), I can still wholeheartedly recommend it. Apart from the romance element, there\u2019s also a bit of optional, high-quality erotic content for those interested \u2013 the game give you choice on how you want to experience it and I think it should be very much worth the asking price no matter which approach you take.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504646083, "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035398358"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504511", "timestamp_updated": 1504979295, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "34842901", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504979295, "votes_up": 3, "review": "The first VN game I've played outside of the Ace Attorney series, I stumbled across this while browsing the weekly sale listings and for whatever reason felt compelled to check it out. So glad I did.\n\nThis story is very well-written and had me hooked in from the moment I started. It tackles a taboo subject matter tastefully, and really brings you through a rollercoaster of emotions along with the girls.  Completion time will vary depending on reading speed of course, but it personally took me about 5 hours. I found myself feeling a little melancholy saying goodbye to Iris and Zoey at the end, but that's only a testament to the quality job Razz has done rather than an unsatisfying conclusion. The Afterstory epilogue update wrapped things up as perfectly as I could've hoped for.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n- Excellent story and characters that will stick with you.\n- Great art style and music.\n- A touching, maturely-handled romance that manages to be sexy without falling into raunchy territory.\n-Good value. $9 is cheaper than a ticket to a 2 hour movie! \n\nSo if you're here asking yourself if it's worth your time, I say \"absolutely.\"", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504851826, "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198284426452"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500345", "timestamp_updated": 1504846331, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "34808063", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504846331, "votes_up": 1, "review": "It's probably the best of this type of game I've played so far.....excluding Life is Strange obviousely....playing it without the 18+ patch because I really just want to get my Max and Chloe love story fix..\n\nSo....that being said these girls are sisters.....I feel like they address deeper issues involving \"you can't pick who you love\"...it's also sold as a sortof maybe sexy romance.....\n\nOverall I really liked it...I bought Catch Canvas and it wasnt worth the money....this is more what I was hoping for :)", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506064307, "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 355, "steamid": "76561198424603157"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1506149630, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "35145898", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506149630, "votes_up": 1, "review": "The complexity of the story and pace at which the VN unravels adds a lot of depth to the characters.
