Raymond Feist created with Midkemia something that will be still enjoyed by Millions in hundred years[/h1]\n\nI sincerly can`t praise Betrayal at Krondor enough and it stands out till today and have absolut not lost any of it`s charm. It`s one of those Games that will be still played in hundred years and people will probably wondering why the just keep playing it also the Graphic System is complete outdated by now and could be easily even work on your microwave or one of those fancy new refrigerators.\n\n[h1]If you want to play the Game without those strange black Borders make sure to edit the dosboxBAK.conf File..[/h1]\n\n..with some editor like Notepad in the DOSBOX folder by adding the line fullresolution=x where x is your current resultion. By that you should be able to remove all or at least some of those black borders. Depending on your resolution you might have still black Border either left and right if you have an Wide Screen Resolution.\n\n[h1]Conlusion:[/h1]\n\nI`m loving both Games since I have so many great memories of playing those both Games or reading the Books from Raymond Feist. Those two Games will always be in my heart and I can therefore only rate the Collection with an...\n\n[i]Thumbs Up.[/i]\n\nThat\u00b4s it.

It was my brothers game, and one of the very first serious computer games I ever played. I completely geeked out when I saw it, and am very much enjoying it in all its retro glory. From the clunky movement, the constant reading, the 75% Miss attack rate, the majestic video shots and the constantly full inventory... this game gets me in the childhood.
