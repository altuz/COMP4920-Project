Regardless of which you choose, you'll be having loads of fun. Additionally, the game offers 6 different maps that can have subtle variations as well an option to randomly cycle the maps. [b]Witch It[/b] also has a decent amount of cosmetics to unlock and player icons, too!\n\nNaturally, the [i]Hunters'[/i] objective is to hunt down and kill all the witches. In some game modes, you simply eliminate them, or you end up converting them into hunters as well. Hunters have a ranged-weapon and a melee-weapon to choose from, in addition to unique powers that you unlock at various levels. \n\nOn the other hand, you have the [i]Witches[/i]. Their objective is to escape, run, and hide for as long as they can, or rather, until the round is over. Witches can transform into many different items which change your health value depending on the size of the object. Just like the [i]Hunters[/i], Witches also have unique abilities which can be unlocked at various levels.  \n\nIn terms of any [b]bugs[/b], I've yet to encounter anything noticeable, but the physics can be a bit wonky at times.  There are some quality-of-life updates that would be nice (that others have mentioned as well), such as allowing the Witches to see the names of individual Hunters during the round, allowing Hunters to have more default skin color options, fixing some grammatical errors, adding a tutorial, and maybe adding a longer cooldown in between taunts as they can be spammed a bit. However, I realize the game is still in Early Access, and I'm not currently aware of the size or workload of their development and/or bug fixing team(s).\n\nOverall, [b][u]Witch It[/u][/b] was a spur-of-the-moment purchase that I certainly have no regrets about. I started off playing with 2 friends that I bought the game for and had fun from minute one. Transitioning to online play was fine, but as others have mentioned, the community is relatively small. I look forward to future updates and hope to see the community thrive.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506356088, "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 60, "steamid": "76561198272251843"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1504910194, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "34824514", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1504910194, "votes_up": 2, "review": "BEST Game ever", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 3}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505709096, "num_games_owned": 592, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013088070"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "13", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501312", "timestamp_updated": 1505713805, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "35039650", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505713805, "votes_up": 2, "review": "Only issue I have with this game is that it is dying...Please if you are reading this don't let it die.
