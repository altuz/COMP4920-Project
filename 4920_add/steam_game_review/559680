Before becoming a vampire I could use healing items however you cannot use these once you become a vampire meaning I can no longer play the game.\nI've tried uninstalling the game & reinstalling but that didn't help & I tried to install a mod that is suppossed to fix many of the games bugs but that made no difference what so ever.\nI actually really enjoyed this game but this bug has killed the game for me & I see no real way to fix it.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}]}
