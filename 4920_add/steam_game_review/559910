It was worth the price for me, but even so I'd say the overall gameplay is relatively simple and there isn't a great deal of depth.\n\nPros:\n\n- Unique idea for tycoon style game\n- Simple, clean art style\n- Relaxing and fun to play\n- Has that addictive \"just 10 more minutes\" quality\n\nCons:\n\n- Other tycoon games offer more depth for the same money", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506309899, "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 293, "steamid": "76561198040834549"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1506272362, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "35185890", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506272362, "votes_up": 2, "review": "I'm a winemaker by trade and must say it's a fun, relaxing game but there could be some changes.  The two big frustrations are:\n\n-Making money and reputation in early game (economics in general).  I've gone bankrupt in three playthroughs within the first five years trying to expand.  In order to make more money, you need to upgrade the estate, grow more grapes, etc. but they all cost an exorbitant amount of money making it seemingly impossible to actually make progress.\n \n-Rerolling and unlocking tiles.  Even if you just want to \"preview\" which types of soil and land you can unlock, you need to reroll which costs money and that cost goes up each time.  Only after you unlock that tile and pick the soil, that's when you know which grapes you'd be able to grow.\n\nThose complaints aside, I think with a few tweaks it could be a phenomenal game!", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506022178, "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "steamid": "76561198255408009"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1506022309, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "35112157", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506022309, "votes_up": 2, "review": "I really enjoy this charming game!
