The whole point of the game is using time travel to get through the puzzles, where you have your characters go through portals into the past during the same puzzle, essentially causing other events to happen simultaneously.\n\nThe game is a handful of hours to play, depending on how well you are at figuring out the puzzles. The game does not really give you much direction for most of the puzzles, though sometimes you will know how to start out (i.e., you will see that you lose the puzzle if a given character goes in any direction except for one at the beginning, etc.).\n\nThere are 4 different sets of puzzles, with different gameplay mechanics. Each puzzle set has 15 levels, where the first 10 \"complete\" the set, and the other 5 are bonus levels with more difficult puzzles. I think that the last set of the game is almost the easiest, actually, because of the mechanic it adds into the game. The enemy makes it more obvious what directions you cannot use at different times.\n\nThe graphics of the game are simple, but interesting. Minimalist, essentially. I do not really remember much sound or music from playing a few days ago, so I guess that is not really a big part of the game.\n\nCausality can be really, really difficult to figure out, but it's worth trying.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
