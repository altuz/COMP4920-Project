At \u00a32.79 I would be asking for a refund. \nI was enjoying the game until it started getting harder and you had to hover on ceilings and around pipes. As soon as you go upside down then suddenly right is left and left is right. The amount of times I pressed left to go left and it went right and visa versa really annoyed me. The controls ruin the game for me really. I will still give it a positive mark though as I can't see anyone else having this problem. I just think I am a bit of a doofus.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
