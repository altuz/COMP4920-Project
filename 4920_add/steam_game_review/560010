This is always a good sign for the future.\n--------------------------------------\nI was bored, and had a few dollars left in my Steam wallet after Xmas, so decided to give this one a go.\n\nIt may attract a \"cult\" following, since it seems to incorporate some pretty unique ideas: Procedurally generated levels, some sort of tower defense (which I never figured out or collected enough crystals to do anything).\n\nThe first gun you are given is sad.  That's the only word to describe a projectile shaped like crosshair travelling towards your foe about a quarter of the speed that you could throw a baseball..\n\nTo make matters worse the teleport system in this game removes any chance at effectively avoiding your enemies (since your gun is so underpowered).  Movement via trackpad might make combat better.\n\nThe graphics are not terrible, but not good enough to detract from the playablity.  The teleport icon is a wide bright green pillar.  The gems you need to collect seem completely out of place in a space game, and are not rendered well.  Finally, there is that really sad looking cross you fire from your gun.\n\nI like your creativity devlopers, and hope this develops into something worth playing, but it's definitaly not worth $30 in my opinion...", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482976840, "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198351326433"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "2", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506425", "timestamp_updated": 1482977039, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28774348", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_created": 1482977039, "votes_up": 6, "review": "I\u2019ve been watching this game since the day it came out because it looked interesting, but it was missing videos and since I had never heard of this developer before I held off buying it.Reading the discussion forums I changed my mind and decided to give it a try since the developer was very active and friendly. Also they already delivered a first patch yesterday and another one planned for Friday. If you are looking for something different, I think Starship Survivor is quite interesting. Here is what I liked, and didn\u2019t like:\nLIKED:\n+ The procedurally generated levels make the game different every time you play, and the way maps are laid out affect how you strategically set yourself up to win. \n+ I liked that it\u2019s not a wave shooter and that I could move & explore, but they made a totally different way to move. I think it works but is a bit limited, props for them to try and innovate, but I prefer to have more options. The developer said they are looking to add more options, so I\u2019ll leave this in the positive column.\n+ The resource mechanics are a pleasant innovation. Reminds me of kingdom new lands. You can build towers and upgrade them. I can see a ton of potential for extra devices. It would be cool if there were even more things to buy.\n+ Starship survivor is more of a suspense and strategic shooter. I will hear footstep and know a monster is coming, but sometimes one sneaks up to me from behind and it scares me. If you played five nights at freddy\u2019s you know what I mean. There are periods where nothing is happening and you are exploring, but you never know when the next monsters show up. It can definitely be balanced to be better, but I really enjoyed seeing how the devs built this game for suspense.\nDIDN\u2019T LIKE: \n- The tutorial sucks. You are left to figure everything out by yourself. It\u2019s only because I read the discussion forum posts that I understood what to do. You 100% deserve that initial response if that\u2019s what people are first introduced to. It would have been better if you waited to release your game until you nailed that. First impressions matter \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 that said \u2026. the game is actually fun once you figure things out.\n- Sometimes the downtimes between monster waves is too long. You need to tweak that.\n- I would like to see more monsters & weapons. \n\nCONCLUSION\nStarship Survivor is trying hard to innovate. Sometimes it works really well, other times it\u2019s still rough around the edges. Overall I would only positively recommend a game unless I had fun. Once I figured out how things worked, I really enjoyed it, and it\u2019s clear the game has a ton of potential with its unique gameplay. It\u2019s different, and in a world of copies it\u2019s good to see an indie team that\u2019s passionate and unique.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483298079, "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198048981562"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "5", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501959", "timestamp_updated": 1483297953, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28877962", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1483209190, "votes_up": 3, "review": "Tried the tutorial and that helped, Thank you\nReally great tower defense concept!
