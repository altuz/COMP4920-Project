A pretty standard entry from OJ following (or is that before?) QP Dangerous. In fact, if you didn't play Dangerous I recommend you do so you can transfer your points over.\n\nBy all standards a very basic bullethell and a little too short (only three stages) but what little is here is cute and fun and I have to say stage two just has some great atmosphere. Hard to recommend unless you really like the OJ games or want the extra character for 100% OJ. \n\nI don't \"recommend\" it, but take that as a \"maybe,\" Dangerous is the better game, but if you have a few bucks laying around it's nice for the holidays, otherwise pass. If you've played any other bullethell you've seen all Scramble has to offer.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
