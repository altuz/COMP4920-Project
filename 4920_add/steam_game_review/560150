It is currently one of my favorites. It plays like a combination on air hockey, tennis, and Arkanoid. The level progression is nice to see as well as being able to upgrade your equipment based on performance from the previous levels. The game does have you face the opposite direction from most others I play on the Vive...but i actually like that better. You do need to have enough room height to play (watch the ceiling), as expected with a tennis type game.  The level design is really cool and varied. The tracking seems perfect on the Vive without any issues at all. Its strange not to see more reviews for this game, its really fun.
