I originally had a paragraph long essay review on this game but instead here are some pros and cons.\n\nPROS: \n1. Interesting story and characters\n2. First couple missions are totally enjoyable ( missions 1-5ish and maybe 7)\n3. Super fun controls once you get used to them. (some dated controls but are easy to get a hold of)\n4. satisfying to shoot down stormtroopers/guards with a rain of lazers \n5. Original Trilogy Nostalgia feel\n6. You will get a kick out of it one way or another.\n7. $5.99 for a game like this is pretty awesome! Well worth it.\n8. Improved graphics in comparison to N64 version.\nCONS:\n1. Early game design issues from that era\n2. BEWARE GALL SPACEPORT (Frustration will occur)\n3.Some clunky controls with 'V' to look up and down and also slight movements of mouse will move character forward.\n4. Game loses that Original Starwars feel in the last few missions (like Xizors palace is just kinda weird, man.)\n5. BEWARE GALL SPACEPORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm telling you! You will want to punch your computer!\n\nWith all that said I still need to finish the last level which is really frustrating me, so I took a break to write this review.\nI really want to LOVE this game but it feels like I've spent a lot of frustrating hours trying to push through bosses or levels that seem impossible because of some game design flaw with hitboxes or aiming or just level design.\nBut I do really like the first couple missions on here though so  I can see myself playing those again. This game really reminded me of the Jedi Knight games because of it's creative original trilogy feel. I love the new movies but it's still nice to be reminded of the time where the originals were around for about 25 years and the prequels were just being made. To end this review on a high note: It's a fun Star Wars expanded universe game thats only $5.99!!!!! Go get it if you grew up on it or if you like Star Wars in general.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1496069653, "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198032345390"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1499953015, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33503519", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1499953015, "votes_up": 1, "review": "Still runs smooth.

The controls are slightly mapped for pc but are still clunky and unable to be remapped (that I know of).
