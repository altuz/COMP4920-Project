But I played enough so far to know that this is a pretty cool logic puzzle game.  And it has some jazzy music too, though it's a bit repetative.\n\nWhat you have to do is move the number tiles around, sometimes split them (i.e. 4 becomes two tiles of 2) in order to get the correct number tile to the green solution area.  Sometimes it's just a number you have to match, like 2 and you have to split a 4 to get a 2 there.  Other times there are the \">\" greater than and \"<\" less than symbols, which I still get confused on even after all these years and have to think about it for a second.  Sigh.  I envy those who can glance at those symbols and instantly remember what they are without thinking hard.   \n\nUse the up/down/left/right arrows to move the tiles around (Oh, and all times move at the same time!) and spacebar+direction arrow to split.  So this is not one of those mouse click puzzle games.  \n\nWhat makes it difficult is that all number tiles move together at the same time.  So if you need to get a 4 up to the green spot and have a bunch of 9s in your way (9 is the highest number tiles can combine to become) then you have to manuver until you can get the 4 in the right spot and it can be tricky.  Then there are barriers where once you  move a tile past it, the barrier (gate or door or whatever it's called) closes and can't go back.  That's when I quit...for now.  Will definitely play more but am dreading what devious things the later levels have in store!\n\nTutorial is great.  There is dialogue as if the game is talking to you while explaining the rules and it adds character to the game instead of just pointers.  \n\nCan't think of anything else to say.  Hopefully I will update as I play more (usually I forget).

The campaign contains 80 different levels. I can confirm that they aren`t that easy... Additionally this game has a level editor and a community workshop.
