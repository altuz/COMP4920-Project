But if you are lucky and manage to run it smoothly like me (by closing the game every half an hour and re-entering it immediately) then it\u2019s quite good: hard enough, pretty graphics, excellent music and overall entertaining.\n\nThe game has indeed some problems and bugs: first time I tried, the whole thing froze after the video at the lake and I had to restart the computer. The second time I managed to play it without any problems till almost the end, where the game stopped working two or three times. What I did that second time was exit the game every half an hour; I don\u2019t know if that had any influence on the game, but I had almost no problems that time. \nThe bugs aside, the game is pretty good, the graphics are very nice, the story ok for a hidden object game (HOG), longer than most HOG on steam and comes with a bonus chapter. The voice acting is pretty good, again, for a HOG, and the music is excellent. The hidden object scenes and the mini-games are mostly difficult enough, but sometimes they can be annoying. For those who hate them (like me): it has at least two sliding puzzles. The game is not too linear either, which I like but others might find too difficult. The ridiculousness and lack of logic, frequent in HOG, is not too dominant in this one. \nI had to play it on the medium-difficulty setting, because in the difficult one were no commentaries from the protagonist when you looked at things (don\u2019t know if possibly a bug), which made it too hard to guess what the game wanted you to do. Oh, and there were some isolated translation errors, which made it hard to find the object in the scene.\n\nIn conclusion: don\u2019t buy it at full price because there are bugs, but if you are lucky and manage to run it smoothly like me (by closing it every half an hour or so and re-entering it immediately) then it\u2019s quite good: hard enough, pretty graphics, excellent music and overall entertaining.\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
