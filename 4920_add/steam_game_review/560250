I love Yuri/Ecchi and want to proliferate these genres across the universe. I can enjoy a well-told story with a bit less \"plot\", like Kindred Spirits on the Roof and I can enjoy the tons-of-plot-no-substance variety, like some of the entries in Winged Cloud's Sakura series. Unfortunately, Galaxy Girls didn't scratch either itch and my disappointment is further aggravated by the embarassingly forward attempts by Dharker to sell the DLC.\n\nI'd rather not write a huge novel about why I'm disappointed in the game, but the condensed version would be as follows:\n\nPositives: \n\n-No glaring typos/grammatical errors\n-Nice, clean art\n\nCould be improved:\n\n-Dialogue is long and uninteresting.\n-Not enough ecchi content to make up for the seemingly endless, stilted dialogue.\n-Ecchi/H content (including uncensored stuff) not particularly interesting. There were a couple nice CGs I found, but the scenes are all very short and have no impact because the story and characters are unnatural.\n-A large, mostly-opaque bar that spans the width of the screen where the text appears. Size and transparancy cannot be edited. A very poor design choice for this type of VN especially.\n-Characters I don't care about at all. This is partly thanks to the premise, which is shaky to begin with, with the game opening as the MC takes in two random girls who don't even know why they're there. One of them, bizarrely, is immediately open to the idea, while the other has an absolutely atrocious (though understandable, which is the core issue here) reaction. \n-DLC everywhere. I was turned off the moment I got to the start screen and saw 3 big buttons in the bottom left with little features I'm blocked off from because \"Buy the DLC.\" When you press \"Start\", instead of starting the game, it also takes you to a screen where half of it is filled with greyed out boxes with future content, saying buy the DLC. The DLC content appears to be \"H\" stuff, probably with shorter, more tightly written stories and more of the good stuff, which is how the main game should play as well. It seems clear the long dialogue and initially uninteresting Ecchi situations are in-place to keep the player going beyond 2 hours, which is quite insulting. In fact, the main game without DLC can ONLY be bought on Steam, which further strengthens my fears in this regard.\n\nIn short: The writing is too poor for this to be an entertaining story, and the H scenes are too short, uninteresting, and infrequent for this to be entertaining smut. It's a shame, considering I enjoyed Negligee (Dharker's previous Yuri title) and left a positive review on it. In case the devs read this, just know I am disappointed in Dharker for the cash-grabbiness of this title, considering they've been given a good amount of support recently and I praised their other Yuri title as well. \n\nThis ended up being almost half of a novel anyway, didn't it...", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 4}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506276469, "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 241, "steamid": "76561198057364615"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "5", "weighted_vote_score": "0.519965", "timestamp_updated": 1506264261, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "35182411", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506263478, "votes_up": 11, "review": "The art design of this game is very good but it feel's short.

Not perfectly written, but enjoyable. Basically an overhaul for Blossoms Bloom Brightest, though it retains a lot of the original dialogue. \nIf you're a slave to the goddesses of yuri, buy it.\n\n\nMost important thing first: Two of the routes are\u2014even with the uncensor patch\u2014rather light on lewd content, the third on the other hand is quite steamy. So keep that in mind; mashing muffs is the strawberry on top, not the entire cake.\n\nIf you have played Blossoms Bloom Brightest, this is a continuation of it. Or more precisely, it doesn't bring the story much further, but instead fleshes it out with more scenes and a new character. And bigger mammaries.\n\nLet's get [b]the negatives[/b] out early:[list]\n   [*]The text field cannot be adjusted in height or transparence\n   [*]Save slots are limited to a meager six\n   [*]Some choices are not quite clear as to how they would affect a character's path and will require some trial and error at worst to get the desired endings\n   [*]The premise and backstory is nothing to write home about, really, and littered with plot holes if you think about it too hard. Some are explained, but sorry mate, I'm not buying that\n   [*]On the same note, the \"big reveal\" ([spoiler]that they're all genetically altered[/spoiler]) could have been used a lot more. It felt like there was hardly any point to it at all\n[/list]\n\n[b]The art[/b] is splendid and clean all throughout. Dharker had some rather amateurish art and styles I didn't personally enjoy in the past, but this one hits the nail quite nicely. Complements the overall themes and atmosphere, no weird faces or impossible postures and quite an amount of detail, especially on the backgrounds.\nSame for [b]the music[/b]. Fitting futuristic-sounding tunes all throughout, blending in easily with the scenes. None struck me as particularly catchy or noteworthy, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing; they don't distract you from reading.\n[b]The story[/b] is no Shakespearean drama, although a drama it is. It focuses mainly on the characters and their rather solitary lives on a space ship. And of course, you, the protagonist, are gunning for either some sort of romance or face a bad end. Speaking of [b]the characters[/b], I found them rather refreshing. Without spoiling much, they're diverse, each with their own sets of more or less serious issues. The resulting interactions might be angsty and overdramatised at times, but I've never been put off by them and they get mostly resolved in a timely manner.\n[b]The smut[/b] is fine. As I said, it is not the main focus, although a lot of scenes contain erotic undertones and flirting. It is a romance-heavy novel, after all. An additional erotic scene for each character is gated behind perfectly picking all the right choices. Someone in the guide section figured them out already, go check the bonus endings there if you have trouble.\n\nThere will be be [b]DLCs[/b] further down the line. An odd choice, for a visual novel, and one I cannot agree with, from a player's perspective. At this point, I cannot say anything about these, but they appear to be background stories for each character and one extra\u2014possibly quite lewd\u2014chapter.\n\n[b]The pricing[/b] seems fair to me. 13 euro or your regional equivalent\u2122 and the same again for the season pass. What you get for it is a decent short-medium length yuri visual novel with nice art\u2014although it's mostly grey space ship interiors\u2014fitting music and a crew that might have been better off with a psychiatrist instead of a doctor.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 2}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506909139, "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 192, "steamid": "76561198025634327"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509275", "timestamp_updated": 1506617886, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "35266264", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1506617886, "votes_up": 5, "review": "I have not played the game since the September 21st update with \"easy mode,\" but I actually appreciated the difficulty of getting \"good endings.\"  I played through probably a dozen times, each one ending in the first, disastrous possibility, before successfully making it over that hurdle and getting the chance to explore the some of the many other endings.  For me, that just made it all the more enjoyable when I finally succeeded.  I have enjoyed the challenge of figuring out how each character feels and reacts to my actions, and I was glad that, in many instances, there was no obvious \"best choice.\"\n\nFor example, early in the game, when talking to Kotoha, you're given the chance to ask her about her likes, her dislikes, or her previous life on Earth.  None of these three choices jumps out as an obvious \"pick me to advance relationship\" option, which makes it all the more interesting in my mind.\n\nFrom there, the different character routes still offer multiple outcomes, both positive and negative, I look forward to putting several more hours into this game and seeing what happens.\n\nI would also like to add that I find the chibi-style DLC placeholders to be fairly amusing, and I kind of hope they'll still be available somewhere to read through once the DLCs come out.  It's obvious to me that a lot of work has gone into this game, and I can recommend it for both the challenge and the excellent art style.\n\nMy biggest \"complaint\" would likely be that there isn't *more* to the mystery of why these women are in space.  I found myself wishing there was even more background to dig up on each of the characters, and on the organization that sent them into space.
