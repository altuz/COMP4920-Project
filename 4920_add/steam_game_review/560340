I didn't notice any issues (I only used 2 sensors with standing room only setup). Obviously, this game is better with 3 sensor setup and full roomscale and I will try that at a later time. You move by holding the triggers and moving your hands like a running motion. And you climb by holding the grip buttons. There are leaderboards for bragging rights.\n\nThe gameplay is basically climbing midieval castle towers. The game is very particular about which paths are open or not to climb up, and you can tell with the buzzing of your motion controllers when you are not in a good situation. However, several times I saw paths that should be good and visually looked like they could be used when they were not. In particular I found a spot where the game would take me temporarily to a menu loading screen and then I would fall all the way down. This happened each time I tried going up this way and eventually I had to find an alternative path. Also, not sure if this was a bug or not, but it seemed I fell a few times from a ledge randomly (I was holding on to the grip button).\n\nThere is an interesting co-op mode gameplay where one person climbs and tries to avoid guards, while the other person shoots bows and arrows to distract them or to create new paths to climb. I didn't get to try that, but it seems like something innovative which may be fun to play.\n\nGiven the price, I do recommend this game. \n\nRate: 6/10\n\nI would rate higher if they added more challenging elements to the climbing or traps to avoid. Also, I hope they would different objects to climb instead of just castle towers, like a church. I'd be happy with a modern city building.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
