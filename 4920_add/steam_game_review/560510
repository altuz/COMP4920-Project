Similarities: controls make your character move left, right, jump, and drop, and firing can only be done forwards or backwards, stationary or during movement. There are three planes along which you can travel, and enemies may come either along those lanes (from either side) or may fly independent of them. \n\nNotable additions include a number of unlockable characters that feel like (and, in one case, literally is) Nuclear Throne characters, different strengths/weaknesses, different guns, and a different active/passive unique ability. There is a cumulative score based unlock system, which means even if you aren't good, you'll start getting new characters quickly. Finally, coins collected in game allow you to unlock items which essentially function as perks, giving new or improved abilities, or one time bonuses (like refilling life).\n\nI don't know how much content the game has - I haven't yet reached the first REAL boss (there are a number of short miniboss waves), but the game so far is cute, fun, more than a little twitchy, and definitely scratches my \"one more time\" itch.

The game is really enjoyable and the constantly scrolling levels force you to quickly kill and grab what you can before the next ambush or boss. Kinda short tho and some builds (fara with homing, damage+grav and poison will destroy some bosses in seconds) are very OP.  Although even after finishing i still want to try the other characters and item combos. And for those who like to beat their highshcore there is that aspect.

Pressing x still fired the weapon but I couldn't move.  Shot Zeros lightning ball at the first area boss, lighting effect spread across the screen and i died. In area 3 I had to jump into the water to kill an enemy as he was out of range so that i could activate the ambush. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485373314, "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025497563"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490595", "timestamp_updated": 1485565726, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "29531559", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_created": 1485565726, "votes_up": 6, "review": "It's just not very fun.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485533208, "num_games_owned": 2315, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997138432"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488989", "timestamp_updated": 1485533395, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "29523071", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_created": 1485533395, "votes_up": 4, "review": "This is such a disappointment.
