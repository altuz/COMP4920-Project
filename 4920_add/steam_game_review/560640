It has a nice atmosphere and nice graphics.  The only thing unrealistic is the small micro cabin out in the woods.  I don't think anybody would make a cabin so small, but it makes sense for VR to be full roomscale.  \n\nThe puzzles are pretty easy except for 2 of them which will make you think.  There's just enough story to keep you going forward and keeping you in suspense.  Even the voice-acting was pretty good considering the price. If you can find it on sale for half off, then definitely it's a must get for 20 minutes of entertainment. \n\nRate 7/10 this is a good escape room VR experience to introduce friends or family to the concept, advanced escape artists will probably not enjoy as much", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
