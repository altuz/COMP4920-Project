For example (spoiler alert) who in the hell would think to add a rope bridge to a crossbow? There is rarely any clue as to what you're supposed to do and whilst the story is interetesting, I got tired of the whole 'You go do everything whilst the rest of the teams stands there looking vacant'. You're the newest member so how in th hell would you know what to do? Smoe of the controls are appalling - the chakram for example - and you will be clicking madly waiting for it to react. It's a real shame as this could have been a great game.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}]}
