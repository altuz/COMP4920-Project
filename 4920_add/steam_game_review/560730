First of all, the game is so buggy that some puzzles despite you arranging them correctly, will need you to restart the game for you to complete them (happened to me with the bird mosaic). The video achievement is buggy and everytime you open the game you have to watch fully the introduction video in order to get it. Another major drawback is the repetitive HO scenes, that is you keep viewing the same room three times (!) and you keep revisiting the same locations a lot. HO objects are reused continously, which means you will be looking for the same scissors, kettle, sword through many scenes and it gets to a point you memorise what doesn't belong to the enviornment and automatically spot it. I do enjoy the art and space-like music, but I find the story all over the place. Last but not least, if you are going to make game translations and have the game auto detect your language, make sure there are no mistakes - my Polish version had mistakes not only in the story (which is w/e) but also in HO scenes and I was looking for ages for \"kataloi\" and googling it - which was meant to be \"katalog\".", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
