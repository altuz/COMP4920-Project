The graphics are great and I love the theme of a kid's summer camp with mysterious disappearances. The game is lacking in terms of an ongoing story through cutscenes and it doesn't offer much narrative - which personally doesn't bother me. What it does have however is loads of HOG scenes and easy-medium difficulty minigames. For me, it's a solid HOG with some minor drawbacks with an appropriate price.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
