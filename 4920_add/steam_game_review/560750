There is no dialogue, the story is so random that it's very time consuming to try to find out what steps you are suppossed to do next. Most of the time, especially in part 4, you are following instructions written on pieces of paper and just collect things to assemble something greater. It's really and I mean really tedious and boring - I miss the joy in exploring. On top of all this, you have these extra doll characaters that are meant to help you and have \"superpowers\" to quote \"fight evil\", however they are inconsistent - for instance a fire doll will melt ice over a pot for you, but will not light a fire, because he is only used to \"fight evil\". The logic is beyond me.

There are only a handful of easy hidden-object scenes, and the puzzles are for the most part trivial -- expect one that is brutally difficult in \u201chard\u201d mode (I had to switch to easy for that one).\n\nThe good things going for it are some adorable characters (no voice acting, just written dialog) and a pleasant narrative flow. Unfortunately the graphics are rather mediocre, and there is a weird resolution glitch: the scenes are all too big for the screen, so you have to scroll up and down with a mouse click. It's very easy to click and drag by mistake and create a nausea-inducing effect. There is nothing hidden up or down, so this annoying \u201cfeature\u201d provides no gameplay value.\n\nThere are better games in this genre, but this one is nice enough.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
