On the plus side, the map is great showing active areas and there is plenty of HO scenes. However, HO scenes seem poorly responsive. The biggest drawback is one particular minigame (at the end of the bonus chapter), which will take you around 40 minutes to complete, if you are bothered - if not, stay away from this game if you are looking for 100% achievements. I gotta say, I couldn't stop laughing when I saw the models of the police officer, the lover of the ballerina and the egyptian - they all looked like the same man. Overall I feel like the bonus chapter is unneeded and dragged the game out for no satisfactory conclusion. Average HOG.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
