Beautiful graphics, great setting but a whacky story, that is in a silly way complicated - why does the main character have to be a war veteran that has touched some book during a battle and became religious but then became an exorcist - I don't know when it doesn't affect the story and gameplay. There are plenty of minigames which are easy. Achievements are buggy, making the game tedious to play. The price is low. I wish I could give this game a neutral rating, because it's not the worst (such as The Esoterica: Hollow Earth) but it's definetly far from being the best (such as Adam Wolfe).", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
