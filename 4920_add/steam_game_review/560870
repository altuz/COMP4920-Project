Gamepad support seems iffy (mine didn't work right, and the keyboard\n              didn't work while it was plugged in either.)  Keyboard controls are very laggy.  Aiming to pick up the \"stones\"\n              is via head-tracking only.\n          Sound is awful.  Forest background noises are fine, but the noise of the obelisks is grating, and when you are\n              at the beach, you could swear there are seagulls on your shoulders, screeching in your ears.\n          Steam/Vive support is bad.  I could only launch the game by exiting SteamVR and having the game start it.  Once\n              the game was running, there seems to be no menu, I had to take off the headset and close SteamVR to make\n              the game exit.\n           Motion is pretty much on rails.  You can follow the path, and maybe a few feet to either side.  Then you hit an\n              invisible wall.  There are other walls in places that make no sense.  I could climb one stairway to a platform, but\n              another one was blocked, for no visible reason.  I can jump down off platforms in some places, but not others,\n              again for no apparent reason.\n\nOverall, seems like a very poorly done port of an Oculus game to the Vive.  I can't recommend it.\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495706029, "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993859255"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496948", "timestamp_updated": 1481899106, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28405768", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_created": 1481899106, "votes_up": 3, "review": "Quite relaxing", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482955212, "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198052343010"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495715", "timestamp_updated": 1481913082, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28409836", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_created": 1481913082, "votes_up": 2, "review": "Mesmerizing experience", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481962096, "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198214498775"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493740", "timestamp_updated": 1485065560, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "29414804", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1485065560, "votes_up": 0, "review": "Boring, and nauseas", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
