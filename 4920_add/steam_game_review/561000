The QOL issues that earlier titles had are mostly gone (entertainers still get in the way a bit, and some dishes are incredibly similar to each other, but that's just a flaw with the entire series). The gameplay had that frustrating yet addictive quality that makes you ragequit, then restart the game (thankfully, erasing everything in the \"branding\" folder makes restarting the game quick and easy) with a new strategy that allows you to easily ace the level.\n\nThe plot also reached the expected level of sitcom insanity, as Emily's work as a temporary chef reconciles a series of wacky parents to their children (and vice-versa), all while a power-hungry councilwoman plots to demolish Emily's new home (to be fair, Emily's family did break her daughter's legs).\n\nWith that said - since the developer outright stated that the current bug-ridden condition of the game is here to stay, and even game breaking bugs like the Russian translation not working at all will never be fixed, I cannot in good conscience give this game a positive recommendation.\n\nEdit - I note that the game's store page no longer claims to support Russian. I guess that's one way to fix things. Simpler than fixing the translation itself.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
