Now that the puzzle like adventure mode is no longer required to unlock free mode this game has gone from disappointing to something worth getting for its' price.\n\nThe game is still rough around the edges, as expected of early releases.

Then you have the title of the game dispayed for 5 seconds.\n\nIf you think that's not important, just wait. \n\nI went through a few scenarios: \"Click these carrots and make them grow\" \"click these eggs to make them grow\" etc.\nTakes about 5 minutes each, but in between, you have to wait for the title screen to do its thing each time.\n\nThe third scenario was this wierd \"whack a mole\" game that seemed really out of place. It was at night, in water and I was clicking on moles. .... Okaaayyy\n\nMaddened by the fact that I was playing more \"title screen\" and loading screens then the game, I tried sandbox mode in the hopes I could get more out of it. Fish and butterflies I think. \nAt least, that's what ened up on my island. Fish, bugs, butterflies, and not much else. \n\nIf you delete trees, that's it, no getting them back.\nI tried going back to the scenarios to see if I missed a tutorial or something on how to get different things on my island. I had managed to pick up a carrot and placed it on my island in sandbox mode, maybe the same could be done for trees? \nMaybe I needed to scare away fish for rabbits to come?\nBut the game slowed to a crawl when I tried to play the next scenario, spanting trees with squirrels.\n\nSo, a memory leak, slow, slow load times and not much to do until the game says you can.
