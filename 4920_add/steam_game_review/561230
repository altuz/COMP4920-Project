Riding the bike feels good and throwing papers feels good though they are a bit heavier than i'd like.  Riding past mailboxes and loading a paper into them without slowing down feels badass. \n\nThe game plays EXACTLY like Paperboy on the NES which is great if that is what you are looking for. The game centers on learning the pattern of the level (when cars come, which houses have dogs) and delivering to an ever increasing amount of houses along the street. You eventually move on to new neighborhoods with new obsticles to learn. \n\nThe game in its current form is very fleshed out and gives you a lot to do as long as you consider what the core game is. If you think delivering papers on a virtual bike is boring, this game won't change your mind. If you want to relive the days of delivering papers on your bike, or found Paperboy on the NES fun,  it s quite good. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1490772886, "num_games_owned": 1048, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197963489560"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505153", "timestamp_updated": 1481964567, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28420839", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1481964567, "votes_up": 7, "review": "This game is Paperboy from the Nintendo/Sega days of classic game - but in VR.

But no, this game is great,has good graphics, the controls feel right, and it's challenging. The people who made this game love paperboy, you can tell and it shows in the entire presentation. I like how holding both the handle bars slows you down. Holding one lets you steer with that hand, and throw the newspapers with the free hand. I love this game.
