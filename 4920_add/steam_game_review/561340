Do I really need to say more?\n\nFor 3.29 canadian, it's definitely worth it.\nI certainly enjoy this game, it's like a much lesser version of Recettear, but still very fun.\nIt's extremely simple, get items, sell them, mark up the price as high as you think you can to be able to sell the item (about 109% at the beginning).\nThere are a few things that aren't explained, like how prestige and style work, but it does have a short tutorial.\n\nThe only thing I would not recommend is trying to put this game into fullscreen mode... I tried it, and it just gave me a black screen, and even after I uninstalled and reinstalled the game, it kept the fullscreen setting, so I couldn't play it.\nIf you do try to fullscreen, and it doesn't work for you either, press Alt+Enter, and it'll put it back into windowed mode.\n\nAll in all, this is a fun game, and as I said, for 3.29 canadian, it's worth it.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480674389, "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198339421398"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.378682", "timestamp_updated": 1480671162, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28135334", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 61, "timestamp_created": 1480671162, "votes_up": 0, "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNLHC0Sn-lo", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}]}
