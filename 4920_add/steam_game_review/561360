I actually thought it was very good: paid $10 on the steam sale and it was definitely worth it. \nPROs\n-great visuals\n-weapons \"feel\" great\n-the bullet time mechanic is fun and key to the game\n-good use of dodge/ crouch\n-fun bosses\n-different \"levels\" for variety and even som edestructable environments .\n-polished experience overall\n \nCONs\n-not that long\n-story isn't mind blowing but it's not exactly weak by VR standards\n\nIn regards to other reviewers comments/ criticisms: \n-the voice acting seemed fine (some said it was poor), it was even pretty good for most of the game.\n-the story isn't mind blowing but there IS a story with a possible sequel as this appears to be thbe first chapter in a series.  \n-at least one reviewer complained that the smaller enemies are \"simple\" and have \"galaga like patterns\".  Some do, while some move reactively.  I felt overall it reminded me of Starfox with the use of enemy and boss patterns and scoring system.  Very satisfying overall.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
