I finally thought I found it when I discovered Overcooked. But I soon realised OC is primarily based on a good 'fun with friends' coop title. Which is fine n dandy dandy n fine but missin certain aspects I wanted to play in a cooking game.\n\nThe description on the Store page of HP convinced me that some (not all) of my desired missin aspects were fulfilled. So I purchased this ridiculously cheap title. Now it's my game of choice ATM in this genre. (Until of course, another game tops it or the Devs fail to keep HP fresh & interestin) whichever first.\n\nATM HP is buggy. Graphical glitches here n there, equipment appearin, disappearin & lackin optimisation. But in sayin that its very playable. \n\nThe time aspect is good. You first av freetime - Use this as preperation time. A few things are involved in prepin. Then openin/closin time (automatic) - business as usual. Followed by more freetime. Again use for prepin, orderin, cleanin, etc. You can cut the day short after closin time but that can glitch the game. So ATM let it run its end.\n\nThe managerial aspects challenging. Buyin, sellin, upgradin. Serving everyone is too. Lackin meats or veggies? Then cook only the most expensive dishes with wot ya got. You can even prepare ingrediants for the day comin & store them in the fridge boxes. The machines are good. They could use a little more animations here n there but still good. \n\nWrappin it up. \nFor the price its well worth it. The playabilitys good. Managements good. Just needs bug splattin.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
