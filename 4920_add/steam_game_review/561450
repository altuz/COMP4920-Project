Overall easy at first, but it gets more challenging later on-- I like it. You gradually get stronger over time and Challenge mode is kinda a bit [i]too[/i] easy as opposed to a \"Challenge.\" However that is just me.\nSadly, the Achievements by my studies appear to disappear once you log off the computer/laptop, I don't really know exactly how/what, nor why it does that. But I suppose it's a small bug, unless you hunt for achievements as a hobby in games.\nAs for PvP, in my opinion (as coming from my side here) it's a bit bugged as it keeps on saying \"Found opponent!\" then \"Searching for an opponent...\" I really don't know why, but hopefully this gets fixed at some point.\nI don't believe I need to really say anything else in this review except I got this game for my BF, he liked it. ouo", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
