Always has been. The only new things in this version though are a few new leagues and updated squad lists. Same story every year. \nConsidering that the mobile version of exactly the same game is less than a third of the price and is exactly the same, this is a big rip-off. \nIf you're new to this franchise, get an old version for your PC or better still, just get the mobile version.
