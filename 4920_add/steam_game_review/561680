Great music, fun little puzzles and a good time filler. The advent calendar approach is really cute and you can buy lots of items from the shop to help you out as levels get harder.\n\nThe only thing I wish this game has was Steam Achievements and cards. There is in game achievements however but I like going for Steam ones  too.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
