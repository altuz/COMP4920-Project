Possess other creatures to become more powerful & also by picking up items alone the way. \n\nLevels are random generated so each playthrough is never the same. \n\nYou will learn what enemy's you can fight & what enemy's are avoided till you build up your character. Levels are set not to give you enemy's that you can't kill, but without taking major risk its best to level up as much as you can before you fight them. Mastering each creature is the best way to do this.\n\nThis game was in development for years before it was released on Steam, As my hours played is alot more then what Steam shows.\n\nIf you like turn-based rogue games then you will love this one.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
