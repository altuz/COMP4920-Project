I love the characters and how your decisions make a huge difference in how the game will pan out! Some of the puzzles and such were a bit confusing though to me so it took me awhile and some help to figure ways to continue the story. I am glad I added this game to my library and can see myself playing over and over without growing bored. I did notice some things with the game such as the character seeing things that either werent there yet (mustve been ghost objects) or things the character already picked up.  I would highly recommend this one.

It was a fun and enjoyable experience considering its cost. I do however feel that the game would drastically benefit from having some kind of ambient music patched in, seeing as pixel graphics in silence just fails to build any sort of tension, which at certain points in the game becomes dreadfully noticeable.\n\nThere is also a really glaring hole in the plot depending on the choices you make.\n\n[spoiler] Towards the end of the narrative, you find [strike] Dan[/strike] Dave, whom asks about the girl you meet in the diner; Now if like me you chose to tell her about your weird childish monsters, which seems harmless enough she hangs herself. Fair enough. BUT when you actually answer Dave you say [b] I fucking hanged her.[/b] \n\nThis is important because the entire reason you meet the other main character-leading to the climax of the plot; is because you wanted to call the diner in order to find out if [b] the girl you hanged is okay.[/b] So henceforth the plot doesn't make any damn sense. [/spoiler]\n\nApart from that though it's still an interesting narrative and has a diverse and interactive story based around your decisions, if you have a bit of time to waste and want to engage in a bit of a horror experience I would recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505975270, "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198356646254"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504560", "timestamp_updated": 1506484203, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "35234944", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506484172, "votes_up": 2, "review": "Zero background music. It wouldn't be so much of a problem if there were at least SOUND EFFECTS, though. Like when the television turns on at first as a tiny jumpscare-type-event out of no where... Nothing. It's so \"huh.\" and anticlimactic that when I recorded for my channel and went back to edit, I was incredibly tempted to add in a stock SFX of television static.\n\nI legitimately looked for music that I could add in the background because it was THAT boring and silent, minus the sound of the main character's footsteps. Which adds nothing.\n\nThat was the biggest killer. How can you have a horror or dark game with zero ambiance..?\n\nIt also doesn't help that some of the puzzles are convoluted as heck. The main ways I advanced at all was by random clicking and combining.\n\nJust... nah. I'm glad I bought it on sale.\n\nIf you're gonna buy it, have a spooky playlist on queue and a really good imagination.\nMaybe it's secretly good, who knows.

In the begining I thought it ended when the mom \"died\" and thought, 'thats it' that was short... But then realized there was more, like, 1 1/2 hours more. There are points in the story where you think that its all just BS and the writing feels really bad (like when you find out \"they are not monsters, they are robots\") But somehow it seems to be able to work out (like finding out the whole story of \"they're actualy dead people in robot suites\" it sounds bad when I say it....) But all in all, if you do a full play through... and get the \"Dad Ending\" which I got the first time... It is a really good game.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
