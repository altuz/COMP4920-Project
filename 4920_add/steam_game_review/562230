I've tried.\n\nIn fact [i]Stellaris[/i] was my final attempt at breaking into the genre. This was my final [i]final[/i] attempt.\n\nNow, I do like [i]Space Tyrant[/i] quite a bit, but it does suffer from some of the same issues that other 4X games have. The saving grace is that it simplifies things and distills mechanics down to something more digestible. [b]It's for this exact reason that I would guess traditional 4X people probably won't trade in [i]Civ[/i] or [i]Stellaris[/i] for this title.[/b] I think a staple of the 4X genre is having a complicated and breathy system.\n\nAnyways, [i]Space Tyrant[/i] is fairly easy to learn and has some great humor. Yeah, the RNG is wily, but it's also wily in those other 4X games BUT the RNG is just hidden better. You know I'm right about that. \n\nAt some point this title was described as a coffee-break game, but I disagree. Yes, it is easily played with one hand, but matches are certainly more than about 20 minutes. They are shorter than competitor titles, but still. The other point of concern is the roguelike nature and permadeath. That part makes me nervous, but the jury is still out on that. The permadeath spans over an entire CAMPAIGN that will easily take you, oh, probably 5-10 hours to complete. One false step and it's back to the begining. I'm not sure it works here, but again, I still need to play more.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+You can't even tell this is Early Access. \n+Controls are intuitive and there is a solid tutorial system to ease you in.\n+It definitely has that one-more-round addiction going on.\n+They nicely distilled what I would consider an overly complicated system that 4X games adhere to into a bite-size package.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-While the music is good, it is very repetitive. There isn't enough variation.\n-RNG is fairly brutal, but more importantly - everything hinges on this idea of permadeath and I'm just not sure it makes it more 'fun'. I'm still thinking on this.\n-Alot of the dialogue is quite humorous but I find myself skipping through to see the end result. Again, the RNG leaves something to be desired. Choices don't feel meaningful. It's like just pick a button and see what happens most of the time.\n\n[b][i]Slayaway Camp[/i] was a hit and this is no exception.[/b] If the idea appeals to you, by all means go for it.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506838009, "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 166, "steamid": "76561198048910194"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508658", "timestamp_updated": 1505448686, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "34963139", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505446333, "votes_up": 7, "review": "With its store front claim of delivering a \"fast-paced roguelike-lite 5X\" experience, chunky UI, and colorful cartoonish graphics, Space Tyrant may at first glance seem like just another one of those hyper-casual mobile games that we're seeing more and more of on Steam these days; but beneath the veneer lies a brilliantly conceived game that, despite lacking the depth of many 4X games that fans of the genre celebrate, delivers an entertaining experience that can be just as satisfying.\n\nI've always had a soft spot for games that let me be the bad guy. Space Tyrant endeavors to join the ranks of titles like Dungeon Keeper, Evil Genius, and Overlord by casting the player in the role of the ultimate... well... Space Tyrant. You'll find no diplomatic standing screen here. There will be no trade routes. You will not be tweaking your economy (unless brutally oppressing your hapless citizens to increase their productivity counts as \"tweaking\"). You will foster no alliances, shaky or otherwise. There will be no negotiation. The galaxy will either submit to your will, or you will destroy it with your lasers and missiles. Or maybe you'll be the one who gets destroyed by lasers and missiles. Actually, that's probably what will happen.\n\nThe premise was immediately enticing to me, but even though my curators were recommending it and all of the other internet buzz surrounding the game was positive, I held back. The reason was simple: \"Fast-paced\" and \"4X\" are mutually exclusive terms in my world. I like my 4X games with layers upon layers of depth. I enjoy being able to wrest control of the universe from my enemies using strength, wit, and guile (along with a healthy dose of economic min-maxing). My current all-time favorite of the genre is Distant Worlds, and I've long since decided that if a 4X game can't deliver that sort of deep experience, then I simply don't have time for it.\n\nThankfully, after having been practically browbeaten by my peers into buying the game, I discovered that Space Tyrant is far more than it seems on the surface. A campaign plays out almost like a series of board games, if board games could be randomly generated. I won't get into the mechanical specifics of the game, as so many other reviews have already covered that; suffice it to say that despite the seemingly simple premise of \"just blow everything up to win,\" there are tons of strategic and tactical options available to the player over the course of a campaign. Will you prioritize conquering crystal worlds in order to utilize your most powerful cards? Or will you favor wealthy worlds in the early game to quickly bolster your fleets? Or perhaps you will focus on tech worlds, so that even your most meager fleet will be able to deal with hordes of ill-equipped enemies.\n\nYou will need to do all three to succeed, but how you choose to prioritize objectives based on enemy movement, playfield layout, and other RNG factors will make or break you. Yes, you can play this game quick and dirty; but if you're not paying attention, the Galactic Senate will end you. Or the RNG. Or the space sharks. Yeah, there are space sharks. With lasers on their heads. Because why wouldn't a space shark have a laser on its head?\n\nSo in closing, if you're like me and find yourself hesitant to try this game based on any sort of 4X bias, just stop it. Stop being a 4X elitist. You should be ashamed. I know I am.\n\nThis game is not even finished yet, and it's already awesome. Buy it and play it already.

In fact, for the first 10 or 20 hours, I thought it WAS great.  I found myself wishing there were more of this sort of simplified, lighthearted 4X game.\n\nI'll leave the list of things it does right to all the other good reviews, and just talk about its problems.\n\nFirst, the difficulty of missions is extremely uneven.  The devs seem to leave to much control over missions to the RNG that you could be immediately set upon by a legitimately impossible confluence of events, or encounter zero drama from turn 1.\n\nThere are several different mission types, and in my experience, only one (in which you must capture and hold 2 of 3 specific planets) is consistently tense.  The others are always effectively decided within the first few turns - either the game throws everything at you as quickly as possible, or it doesn't.  If it doesn't, the entire mission is dead easy.\n\nIt also has a problematic meta-strategy layer wth the senate control mechanic in the mission selector.  My first ragequit happened when I won the last of the initial 12 missions you have to win before taking on the senate.  Upon winning it, the senate promptly sent two ships to the same area that already had 2 ships in it.  4 ships in one area, even for a moment, and the campaign is over.\n\nI WON the last mission, kept more than 2 senate ships from ever being in the same area at any time for the entire campaign until the literal moment I won the last mission, and was greeted with the \"game over\" screen.  I've rarely been so mad at a video game.\n\nWith a few tweaks to smooth out the difficulty and fix a few \"we've decided you lose now\" problem mechanics, it'll be great.  Even with its frustrations, I still can't bring myself to give it a thumbs down, though.
