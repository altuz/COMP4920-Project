It feels like somebody very inexperienced learned a few things on how to make a game and put out their first attempt. This should be on Gamejolt for free, not on Steam for money.

A game is not scary when it's only dark! \n- some scipts are not working ( light on/off ) ??? what was that supposed to do??\n- Story is boring and nothing new to horror games.\n- Minimal effort shown - No Music in Main menu, no custom sound effects, no custom loading screens. NOT EVEN CREDITS. What did it take to make this game? 3 Hours??\n- You are able to walk outside the areas into the no man's land. Never heard of invisible walls?\n\nTRY to make something unique at least. \nSorry, but this is just not good. I really wanted to like it, but I can't. Hopefully the developer learns of this.\nIt can only get better from now on.\nCheers\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 2}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484025646, "num_games_owned": 711, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198094159267"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "weighted_vote_score": "0.508992", "timestamp_updated": 1484946723, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "29383789", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1484946723, "votes_up": 5, "review": "Welcome to, yet, another cash-grab indie horror game.\n\nThe Spirit Underneath, not only starts the game with the company's logo with errors in it, starts with the game title not even complete on the main menu.

There are broken textures, or untextured things, throughout the game. The game seems as if it should have been free on Gamejolt or Itch.io, but was released here instead because they knew they could.\n\nThis game shouldn't cost money. It really shouldn't. I don't know why or how this does, but it does. I was able to get out of the map and there are bunny enemies for no reason once for a few seconds. Why? What's the purpose?\n\nI really wish devs would understand that they can show off their work for free first then release their product after people see what they can do. \n\nHere is a full playthrough of both endings on my channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRNnjeXjclM\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483541257, "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079664351"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497728", "timestamp_updated": 1483562170, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "29016424", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 8, "timestamp_created": 1483562170, "votes_up": 10, "review": "Played the game finished it not a bad game for the price aswell thought the music was good in the game but the atmosphere wasn't great wasn't that long thats my review......take it our try it for yourself\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XpGivXMGNU0", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483495987, "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198283832325"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "weighted_vote_score": "0.440961", "timestamp_updated": 1483500894, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28995814", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 29, "timestamp_created": 1483500894, "votes_up": 6, "review": "This game is A LOT creepier then I gave it credit for.
