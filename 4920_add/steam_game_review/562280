The story is good, love the animation, I'd love to see this developed into a larger thing. Nice to see a VN with an engaging story. I'd love a NG plus type option though because I kind of want to see all of the endings, but I'll probably wait until some other time because I've already read the story twice now though I really appreciated the ways certain moments really are affected. I wonder how much the characters can like each other. I still wonder if I should have sent Jacob back. Who knows? Game was definitely worth a play through and I downloaded it from Steam so I'm saying that without having played it for free.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
