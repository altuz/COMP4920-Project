As of yet, I haven't found anything hard about it, but I have found a TON that is annoying. A chunk of that comes from the characters themselves. I'll get to that.\n\nThe world looks nice, but becomes repetitive VERY quickly. Each zone, and they're large, has one tileset that they use, and your eyes glaze over it in no time. There's the occasional decoration around, yes, but they typically cause graphical glitches in the form of black lines appearing next to the object, and sometimes enemy. That's really nice, when an enemy walks around looking like someone tried to paste it to the game directly out of paint. As such, each rooms basically looks the same. Assuming the room doesn't crash your game. Which happened to me THREE TIMES in the 70 minutes I played.\n\nThere are items you can find in treasure chests, in the form of potions, bombs, and power ups. Potions don't persist if you leave the room, (Not sure about other items, I didn't want to risk it.) So if you find a room with three potions that you accidentally opened, and you only have room for one, sucks to be you! Potions gone! For that matter, you can also somehow use items while in the menu checking your stats. Lost a bomb that way! Guess I don't get to open that wall till I can find another, yay.\n\nThe enemies are actually kind of cute, although their art style stands out from the characters in a big way, making the characters look even chunkier and flat. While they look good, the placement of the enemies is extremely boring and uninspired. They're just in your way, waiting for you to show up, sometimes just the same enemy for rooms and rooms (six rooms straight of just floating swords. How fun.) On occasion something will drop from the ceiling, or a flyer will fly though the floor and walls because why not. None are in the slightest bit dangerous, and most can't even drop down or climb up ledges, making them completely helpless.\n\nThere is dialogue, but I never get to read it because I run around while mashing the shoot button, which skips dialogue. Great. \n\nThe music is okay. I didn't get to hear much, honestly, and what I did hear was a fairly short loop, which, while nice, got annoying fast, in particular because I could HEAR WHERE IT LOOPED. Speaking of sound getting annoying, some sounds are just louder than others. There are pikachus in the game, and when they do a shock attack, a LOUD buzzing noise plays that is very jarring. The same noise plays for bombs. \n\n\nNow, on to the characters. There are eight [strike]unique[/strike] characters. I attempted to get each one to level ten to get a good feel for them, but the game had other plans for me.\n\nGojar is the first. S/he (I'm not sure) is a swordsman, and suffers from being a melee character in a game where you can shoot. As such, he sucks. His gimmick is he has a higher speed stat than the others. This caused me to collide with enemies constantly as the dude shot around the room. Actually kind of funny. Possibly my fault as I was in a hurry.\n\nThirakor is next. He is also a swordsman, with a mighty beard. His gimmick is that he does high damage, and has good defense and HP. That's about it. Actually kind of satisfying, as his high damage and slow speed allows you to basically move forward mashing attack without worry. Can't shoot, so he's still not very useful.\n\nFarog is third. He is ANOTHER swordsman. Is old, and has a sweet fu manchu. Appears to be a mix between Gojar and Thirakor. Does more damage than Gojar, less than Thirakor. Is faster than Thirakor, slower than Gojar. Woo.\n\nAgroha is fourth. He has a large spiked shield, and has no attack. He simply moves close to enemies, and they take damage. If he moves too far, they clip past the shield and damage him. Incredibly boring, and you're forced to use him to open doors, because someone made automatic doors that only open if some shmuck sticks a spiked shield into a specific wall for some obscure reason.\n\nLarilak is fifth. He can double jump. Because this would bring him dangerously close to being a good and fun character, his stats suck, and his weapon is terrible. It's a spear that does low damage, and only damages directly in front of him. In a game where it sucks to be melee, he has even worse melee. \n\nArajam is sixth. He's a mage. He fires blasts of magic. This means he can shoot, which makes him useful right? NOPE. For some mystifying reason, his shots go over the heads of small enemies like rats or crouching slimes. If he crouches, his shots fire from the exact same place. He cannot attack small enemies, of which the game has mostly consisted of so far. Combine this with corridors with small roofs, and he gets wrecked trying to get around enemies. Someone actually reported this issue on the 12th of may. It got a dev response, but nothing was changed. At all. Is completely useless because of the inability to shoot low. Another power of the mage is the ability to shoot magic statues to open doors or make magic blocks appear to avoid danger. If you open a door this way, it will be closed when you come back. TRAPPING YOU IN THE ROOM. Forcing you to bring the only other mage to come get them out, or to use a summon statue to bring the mage back to safety. If you just have your magi left, you can break your game this way. Good job dev!\n\nGela is seventh. She has a bow, and is literally the only good character. She has decent speed without rocketing around, and has decent enough attack to do satisfying damage. She can also shoot, AND she can shoot low enemies too, making her the only character you'll ever want to use.\n\nCiya is last. She is also a mage, and somehow gets stuck on walls a lot. Suffers all the same problems as Arajam. I could not get either mage to level 10 as a managed to get them both trapped in different magic statue rooms. I admit, the second one was my own stupidity.\n\n\nI made it to the second zone, which for me was the crystal caves. They were pretty for three rooms, then became bland and repetitive. After that, I had no motivation to play anymore.\n\n\nI got this game for 50 cents.
