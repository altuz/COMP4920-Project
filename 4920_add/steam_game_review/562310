Has cats. It's got pretty nice graphics. Has lasers. It's pretty damn fun to play. Has space.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what the 'casual' tag is doing on there, as 0% of the players have passed wave 50 on any difficulty. There's also a wave 100 achievement. The game is pretty intense and fast paced, and can get pretty frustratingly difficult in some situations no matter what difficulty you're playing on. That's not to say the situations were unavoidable. They were definitely punishing due to my own mistakes.\nAnd while the available upgrades per wave are randomized, each one of them feels useful. In no right of mind would I take chain lightning over the crit simply because the crit is better, I would still take the chain lightning if the crit were not available and still be able to make use of it.\n\nI just gotta keep aiming for the top, I just need to stop falling for stuns and remember to take vampirsm at least once.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495887452, "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198257082091"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495626", "timestamp_updated": 1495650103, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31938872", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1495650103, "votes_up": 2, "review": "Lazeeeeeeeeeeeerssssssssssssssssssssssss !!\nReally cool game where you get to play as a freakin' spacecat, that can shoot lasers from his eyes to kill evil rats, as they come wave after wave. \nLots of powerups, all sorts of rats, customization,..\nDefinetely worth the price, Check it out !\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
