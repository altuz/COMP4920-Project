Great atmosphere, decent puzzles, I only managed to get out with two minutes left. The only issue is, as others have stated, that the flashlight dies and you need to use batteries to power it up again. Unfortunately the batteries don't look like batteries, so I didn't know to use them on the flashlight. I went through the whole game without putting any new batteries in the flashlight, just using it as a strobe light(as it flashes briefly even when out of power when you click it), assuming that was what I was supposed to be doing. I didn't encounter any glitches, which seem to plague most of the other escape games I've tried, and given its low price I definitely recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
