Here're some reasons why you would like it (without particular order):\n1. Art is simple, but very nice and with great attention to details, and quite a lot of them make you smile.\n2. Rules and controls are very easy to learn, you do not really question how to play the game, you just play.\n3. Levels are well-thought and each built around its own idea. There's no complexity for the sake of complexity. Many of them will make you scratch your head, but once you get it right you go through. It never gets too long to bore you. Harder levels are sometimes followed with the easier to relax a bit, and then there's a new puzzle.\n4. Funny characters, humourous dialogs and even intriguing plot really brings life into the game, and you really can't wait for the next cutscene. \n5. Although it's early access, the game seems to be of release quality. I guess early access status is only caused by the limited amount of levels, and I personally will wait for more with eager (especially if it gives me a chance to see Tortilla again!).", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482141090, "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013311490"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502349", "timestamp_updated": 1482225971, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28482983", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_created": 1482225971, "votes_up": 2, "review": "A nice-looking puzzle game.
