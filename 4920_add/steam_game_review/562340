The alternate history style and story are creative and well done. The developers deserve credit for improving this game, and the recently added joystick control is great when you are looking forward. I think the new joystick controls do add some new user interface problems - it is hard to fly with a joystick when you are trying to drop bomds or need to look at a waypoint. Maybe they can add an autopilot, an external bomb view, or a picture-in-picture mode that allows you to see the horizon in the inset and the bombsite/target in the other wiindow. In general the user interface has a few rough edges, though some were added by adding the new joystick control. The missions are really hard, and maybe the times to complete missions could be relaxed for the rookie mode. Despite these minor blemishes, this is a truly inspiring game. Really the best in its genre and makes many other games look dated. If the developers can iron out the minor issues this could well become a classic, and the foundation for many great games. I am more of an arcade player, but aspects of this remind me of Crimson Skies in the best possible way. I do hope they deliver on the potential and that this game achieves enough success to consider sequels.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501089679, "num_games_owned": 893, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041571110"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506148", "timestamp_updated": 1501091614, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33778262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_created": 1500951769, "votes_up": 5, "review": "Pros:\n\nGraphics are beautiful\n\nMusic and general mood are optimistic and uplifting\n\nThe game seems to be trying with some new ideas for mechanics\n\nYou can replay missions (but you don't get anything for doing so)\n\nCons:\n\nFirst of all, you MUST have a controller to play this game.
