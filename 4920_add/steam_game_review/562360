It's fun at first but gets boring dissapointingly quickly; that elusive drive to play again is not quite there. The fervent red-and-black colour scheme was giving me headaches and vertigo, but in the most recent update the dev added an option to change the background to gray and that helps a ton. What is still missing, is an option to turn off controller vibration (which seems to be set to max) - I'm too lazy to unplug my gamepad and it just flops around wildly while I play on keyboard. As for the achievements, maybe I just suck but I found some of them way too hard; if you're the type that does everything legit, prepare for frustration. Normally I would consider giving a thumbs down for difficult achievements, but not everyone cares about that and the game is pretty decent for one EUR.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506284211, "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 162, "steamid": "76561198179923793"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1505170478, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "34891614", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505170478, "votes_up": 1, "review": "Hurts my eyes a little other wise its pretty fun\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506016185, "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "steamid": "76561198178578283"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1505406755, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "34952106", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505406755, "votes_up": 1, "review": "This is an awesome game, I love it! \nIt's great, I have nothing to say :)\n", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506025300, "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "steamid": "76561198294755283"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1505754084, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "35049157", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1505754084, "votes_up": 1, "review": "I enjoy it, you can call it a 1944 type game\n\nI'd rate 7/10 needs some work, a bit plane (plain) with the colors", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507146140, "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "steamid": "76561198260325974"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1506578042, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "35255534", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506578042, "votes_up": 1, "review": "Im going to tell the truth...just because of the title, I decided to buy this game.\nI got it on sale and Im not dissapointed from purchasing it.\n\nThe game is simple and fun, as many shoot em up.
