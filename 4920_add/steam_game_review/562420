I bought this game because it has a vehicle center which looks exactly like the one from the original Command & Conquer - a landing pad with a cargo plane that drops the vehicle. I wanted to like this game but I cannot. \n\nIT HAS NO MISSIONS WHATSOEVER. It only has skirmish maps and a quick combat feature that randomly selects a skirmish map. Do not waste your money on this game. I'm asking for a refund.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}]}
