Empire of Angels is essentially FE light... if all the characters were female, and lived in a biologically impossible world populated by ONLY females, and everyone wore sexy clothes... all the time.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun. The story is serviceable, light-hearted for the most part, and doesn't interfere with what we're all here for, the battles. Two things really stand out for me. 1) The game essentially allows you to, very organically, choose your difficulty. Maps give you three optional objectives in the battle that you can either choose to complete or ignore, with two often making the battle a little bit harder/more intense should you choose to pursue them. If not you can simply breeze through a lot of the maps with minimal difficulty. 2) The game rewards you completing these optional objectives, but doesn't ostensibly punish you for not completing them; anything you earn through working harder during battles can also be earned through grinding, which is a nice compromise I think.\n\nAdmittedly the translation isn't perfect- at times it is more a transliteration of the native Mandarin rather than at true Western translation i.e. some metaphors and idioms come off as awkward or incomprehensible because they are transliterated rather than rewritten to something more identifiable to a westerner. There are occasional misspellings and odd syntax as well, but all of these things are minor, in my opinion at least, and I don't feel anyone should be completely turned off by it. Also the game can be a bit grindy, and even encourages it. I've been mainlining JRPGs since birth so I break out into a cold sweat when I can't watch numbers incrementally rise over long repetitive sessions of play, but for those who don't grind up JRPG's a snort them through crisp rolled up dollar bills regularly this may be a bit of a turn off.\n\nAll in all this game is a bit of a hidden gem, and certainly a credit to the Taiwanese game industry", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501164986, "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198343789607"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "timestamp_updated": 1492356295, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31180653", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1492356295, "votes_up": 2, "review": "Been a fan of this game since Version 2 and that around 20 years ago?
