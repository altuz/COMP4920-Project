But that should't matter, as there are plenty great indie platformers like super meat boy, or N. \n\n The english translation is pretty amateur, but that doesn't matter too much, it's not really a story driven game. First thing that caught my attention were options, where I saw a \"controls\" tab which sadly didn't allow me to map any actions. That wouldn't be too bad if the default binds were good (D-pad as movement doesn't work in platformers in my opinion, especially on xbox gamepad).\n\n Then the gameplay. You die, a lot, which I'm really fine with, but it really shouldn't take time to reload with a game like this(~3-5 seconds every death). When I got to the gameplay part I really noticed that something felt odd, and figured it was the screen scrolling animation. It really felt bad, I can't really explain why but it was noticeably annoying. The platforming parts didn't feel good either, but i guess that might be a personal thing. \n\n I genuinely approve the concept of eating enemy powers, but didn't really spend much time to play around with that. The soundtrack is pretty good for the most part, but i don't know how long does that last. \n\nOverall I don't think this game is worth playing through despite it's low price, there are way too many games on steam to mess with stuff like this.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486961492, "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198138419242"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523295", "timestamp_updated": 1486961793, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "29891315", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1486961793, "votes_up": 16, "review": "You know, I really wanted to like this game. I grew up with Ninja Gaiden on the NES and all that, but this game is hard for hard-to-pin-down reasons. You die when you really shouldn't... bad hitboxes, etc. That's incredibly off-putting, but I went at it for a while.\n\nIf you're like me and you like a challenge, this game will have initial appeal, but I like games where I fail because I\"m not good enough... not because there is some sort of magical hitbox distance you have to estimate in all directions near spikes, with zero air control or jump height control.\n\nThe distancing and timing are so tight that you can't really do it consistently, and that's just stupid.
