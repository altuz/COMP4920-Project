The warrior is a raw power class that focuses on buffing units and sending them to the battle quickly and amassing a numbers advantage. The Sorceror uses spells to his advantage to actively deal with the enemy at hand with much larger mana pools to use than the other 2 classes. The Treasurer is a gold based class that brings some serious firepower to the table and actively plays by removing and creating new units quickly.\n\nYou can refund your skill tree for free and craft it however you like. You can also freely mix skill trees and take the stats that you value the most. For example I value archers morethen mercinaries so I focused more on buffing them using the warrior path while grapping the 15 starting gold from the treasurer path.\n\nThe gameplay is interesting enough to keep it from getting stale. There are different objects, difficulty levels, and also 2 different game types one being TD mode and another being a mix of an assault/TD defense mode\n\nEach unit has several upgrades and special abilities that you will need to take on harder difficulties. I will say that this game does have a grind to keep you busy but the developers plan on lowering that eventually and making it easier for everyone which is something else I want to talk about.\n\nThe devs are active in the community and will respond to you. I seriously haven't seen this in a very long time so thumbs up to the devs for staying active with their community.\n\nAs for my final statement quite a bit of the game is still being developed and the game is changing for the better as its still in early access but for 50+ hours worth of gameplay this sure was worth it for only 20 dollars.\n\nI definitely recommend this game if you like TDs it is definitely worth your time.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507186301, "num_games_owned": 609, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2005, "steamid": "76561198006572322"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501480", "timestamp_updated": 1506520916, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "35242195", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1506520916, "votes_up": 1, "review": "I give this game two thumbs up!\n\n\nThis Tower-defense game looks similar to games such as Kingdom Rush. That is where the comparison ends, however. You do not have personal heroes to fight on your behalf. Rather, you invest into three school of skills as you level up. \n\nThe skills are divided in magic, warlord and treasurer. The magic skills improve your mana pool, your prowess with casting spells on the battlefield like an angry god. The treasurer skills improve your ability to earn and to spend gold on towers/warriors more efficiently. Finally, the warlord mostly improve your warriors' strengths. (The knights hit harder, the archers shoot further, for instance.)\n\nThe campaign is lengthy, ranging over 33 missions, (mostly solo play, with a healthy mix of PvP and Coop missions throw in for a measure.) PvP is exactly that- you play against another player by beefing up your warriors to send against the other players while also beefing up your own defense. The trick is to find the correct balance between allocating your resources between the two. While Coop is two players (you and another random player) setting up defense against an onslaught of AI-controlled waves.\n\nEven then, each mission has three stars you can earn, by achieving certain goals (Example- complete a mission without casting spells). Finally, each star can be achieved in terms of difficulty- bronze for easy, silver for normal and gold for hard difficulty. \n\nThis allows for many replays, both for resources and for experience as you level up your own personal avatar. I've been playing for a while, and even then there's still many more stars and achievements for me to earn yet.\n\nI've not even touched up the ability to upgrade your army with resources, the ability to earn resources by building things such as a gold mine, or the ability to upgrade your spells by investing into them at the mage tower, the rewards you can earn by completing the quests given to you, and so much more. \n\nOn the surface, it seems like another gimmicky tower-defense game, but it is surprisingly and delightfully deep, more comparable to  games such as Gemcraft than anything else.\n\n\nTLDR; This game rocks.
