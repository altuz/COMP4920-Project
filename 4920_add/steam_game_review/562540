The game has ad much going for it as it does against, below is a list of both but overall the positives outweighed the negatives for me.\n\nPro:\n+ Endless grind. Not gated by energy nor other timers.\n+ Auto card battle. Not my number one choice but at least the RNG is screwing both the players. \n+ At the moment not PVP orientated. And I hope it never will be.\n+ Almost entirely redundant cash shop. See cons for the almost part.\n+ Loosing isn\u2019t punishing and isn\u2019t rubbed in by showing a match history.\n+ Upgradable cards, really, really upgradable.\n\nCon:\n+ The game is full Auto. You build the deck then rnJ will play it for you.\n\n+The progression system is not explain and extremely poorly balanced. What I mean is you can kill 1 campaign mob and it disables lower level \u201cfarm\u201d decks from spawning.\n\n+ Lots of noob stomper AI decks e.g. a deck that runs 3 cards in 3 \u2013 5 copy that will stomp on you until you buff up to the point that it can\u2019t scratch you. Lots of these even at the 120+ grade.\n\n+ Since the game is built around time based upgrades and the said upgrades use slots that require premium currency towards the mid/late game you will want to invest some $$ to buy a few extra smithies~. This is not as bad as it sound since the cost are exponential insanely so, thus not many at all would have them, evening out the footing.\n\n+ I\u2019m not sure if the game is Hack proof yet. With 200 players on the ladder at very early pvp I ran into 3 players at lvl 3 running exactly lvl 10 upgrade type 3 (gold) decks. Either that or devs thought it\u2019s funny to populate the PVP ladder with OP botts for such an early period in the game.\n\nThis review has been changed, for the Original please see comment #4.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487296058, "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198032947680"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "weighted_vote_score": "0.497763", "timestamp_updated": 1486642134, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "29799962", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 4, "timestamp_created": 1486642134, "votes_up": 7, "review": "Fun game if you are in for a fast, casual experience.

I surprised myself.\n\nYes there is a big loss timer, but it just cuts your health by half during this process so you can still play. Just keep mashing the same fight and eventually you'll win (if you got decent cards of course).\n\nDon't get the Platinum Booster. I'd rather 4x Silver packs.\n\nPrices in the game are a bit rough when it comes to paying with gems for extra leveling slots, and unlocking in-game events.\n\nSome of the card combinations you face are unbeatable, but thankfully their deck changes when you take them on again.\n\nThe game also gets difficult pretty fast with tons of high level zones. You can still beat them though, just will take some replays. I've been taking on level 50 - 65 decks with a level 40 - 44 decks.
