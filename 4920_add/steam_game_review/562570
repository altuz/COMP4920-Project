There's quite a number of times where you have to turn a dial, and it feels like a mobile port designed for touchscreens, not for mouse users. The dials go everywhere exept for the one place you want to set it, and though it forces the player to think a little bit harder because brute forcing becomes neigh impossible due to frustration (turn three dials with twelve settings each \u2026), it's no fun even if you know the solution. \n\nThere's no feeling of reward - though the sales pitch tells a story of a not-so-distand furture where personal data being stored in elaborate boxes, you never get to see the contents of the box you've just cracked. There's some blue light, and that's it, next box. I imagined myself in the role of a professional cracker who constantly keeps asking himself \"Why the hell am I still doing this?\". Even my Windows 3.0 Mahjongg game rewarded me with a fortune-cooky-style saying if I solved one. Here, I get nothing. Okay, there was some [spoiler]cake[/spoiler] in the end, but it didn't even look [spoiler]edible[/spoiler].\n\nAs for being buggy: The boxes sit on a kind of desk, where you can turn them around (and a little bit up and down), zoom in and out to find details (not that looking for minute detail is required for more than one puzzle). It happened four or five times that I found myself trapped inside the cube (thus knowing they are empty and not worth the efford), and hitting Escape in order to get to the menus leads to the images rotating maniacally, forcing me to end the game via task manager. Made me twitch and felt cheap.\n\nStill, it's a recommendation. I payed less than one Euro in the summer sale and spent a couple of hours with twisting, turning (and cursing dials). You can replay the puzzles, but why bother? It's play and uninstall, there's hundred of nice (or not so nice) puzzle games on Steam, but I had some fun, making it fifty cent (or so) well spent.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}]}
