Look it up on the official website in the \"News\" tab.\n\nTL:DR for ex-robocraft players: You are playing Mars Crater and everyone is playing Rail Walkers.\n\nTL:DR (for everyone else) - Small maps, little cover and auto-spotting [i]kinda[/i] favor the point and click nature of long range armor cubes.\n\nThe game itself has massive potential, though it's currently plagued by a couple of problems that complement each other resulting in a huge issue..\nBy reading other reviews you are probably aware of the \"long range\" builds issue with about 44.2% of the community focusing on two longest range weapons. You can find the data on the Dev diary #21 on the official site.\nI mean Jesus, how do you end up with almost half the community using only two weapons out of 7 total?\n\nWe'll I'll tell ya, now buckle up, this is gonna be a long one. \n(As usually happens with my rants when I have a love/hate relationship with something)\n\n\nThe major factors that are causing this issue:\n1. Automatic spotting regardless of distance\n2. Relatively small maps with huge open areas and very little to no cover\n3. Simpler ship design when building a long range build. (fewer things to worry about)\n4. The \"buffer\"\n\n\n#1 - Automatic spotting regardless of distance\nLooking at this alone doesn't seem like a huge deal, and in [i]some[/i] areas of [i]some[/i] maps its not a big problem. But it gets worse, or better in the case of 44.2% of players. xD\n\n#2 - Relatively small maps with huge open areas and very little to no cover\nNow when we look at the number 1 and 2 together, you don't need a PhD in map design to figure out which classes will benefit the most out of that. Add more stuff to maps, don't leave such massive open areas that allow the long ranged ships spot and engage threats the moment they get in range.\nSome potential weapon solutions can be seen in Robocraft ( I know I keep comparing these two, but alot of the problems are pretty much interchangeable). The range advantage was was reduced by adding the laser indicator that lets the targeted player know that they are being targeted, so he can start dodging or engage back. Other things that reduced the effectiveness of the long range (railguns atleast) were the slow turn rate and somewhat long recharge time between shots, leaving them vulnerable to fast moving close range vehicles and forcing them to pick their shots and not just spam left click at the first name that turns white.\n\n#3 - Simpler ship design when building a long range build.\nIt's like point building characters in RPGs, you will have dumpstats, aka aspects that will get neglected to the lowest possible state that doesn't overall compromise the build in a significant way.\nYou don't need insane speed, or incredibly fast turning rates, mostly because you can outrange or match anything that can threaten you the moment it's in your line of sight. Not to mention, you'll probably be aware of the threat long before they get to threaten you due to how the spotting works right now.\nSo the result is people simply making so called \"Borg cubes\" that cover a large portion of the map, particularly from the top.\n\n4. The distance \"buffer\".\nYou will notice that gauss based builds end up dying far less often than average (in the graphs I initially mentioned). Atleast in the case of cannons, they have that buffer distance which allows them to engage the short/medium ranged enemy long before they are within range to respond. That usually results in you loosing a component, getting your core exposed or even getting outright destroyed before reaching cover.\nNow some will argue that they \"need to git gud\" and dodge, which you can try, but as mentioned in 1. and 2. the maps are universally open if not to all sides then atleast from above. to amplify the problem further, you will be constantly marked as long as you are in the line of sight of any other enemy, which is pretty much all of the time, resulting in the long range ship being ready for you once you pop out of cover whether to engange him or run away.\n\nEssentially the effective range importance goes up as the map size and complexity go down. You cover a much bigger portion of the map and you end up threatening other ships from further away, while they have no effective way of fighting back. \nImagine encountering a group of such long ranged ships (with ~44.2% of people playing like that, that is statistically unavoidable) that can virtually make the entire map their killzone, while being able to cover each other at the same time. Countering something like that, well it leaves you with with few options out of which the most popular one is \"Leave match\".\n\nThe change the devs did on these weapons is welcome (largely futile), but it's only treating the symptom, not the cause.\nNerfing the cannons is merely a bandaid measure. As long as the maps are designed with large open areas where you'd get spotted the moment you pop out the domminant weapon will be whichever weapon has the longest range and the lowest skill requirement to use. Nerf the cannons and ubers bellow 3000, cruise missles will become popular, nerf the missles, heavy lasers will become popular. Balacing weapons this way can only go so far as it turns into a race to the bottom.\n\nOther issue I have to mention are the range/damage abilities. This is an issue I often see with games that have any sort of customization.\nIf you intend to give players utility, stick to utility. The moment you give them ways to shorten the TTK (TTK - Time To Kill) those abilities will become the go-to abilities.\nAnyone who has played CoD4 MW1 knows this, with everyone picking Stopping Power perk +40% DMG, essentially shortening the TTK by 1 hit on average. And in a game where most automatic weapons kill in 3 to 4 hits, lowering that by 1 is a huge deal.\nWarframe also fell into this trap of the \"game of numbers\" years ago, with all weapon and warframe builds being laser focused on dishing out the highest possible DPS and some CC (though CC is another story).\n\nSo these are all the problems, but what of solutions. Well those might be obvious at the first glance, but will take a lot of work and time.\nLarger maps, add some complexity, like those holes in that rock platform that cant fit oversized ships (forgot the name of the map).\nNo auto-spotting, use radars and jammers if you have to have an automatic way of spotting. Rewarding scouting and supporting in general would be a good idea as well.\n\nThe reason I wrote the \"Great Wall of China\" of text is that I really like this game and I'd hate to see it go down the same road of mistakes I've seen so many games follow. You guys have a good thing going here, don't let it go down in history like another robocraft. \n\nAlso from the data devs gave in that table show other implications besides the sheer popularity.\nAverage K/D ratios\nGauss Cannon: 1.47\nGattling Gauss: 1.34 (despite having the highest average kills)\nHeavy Laser and Uber Cannon: 1.75 (the difference is 0.01)\nCruise missle: 0.97 (Probabbly due to the fiddly nature of the rocket AI)\n\nAnd then the interesting part\nPhaser: 0.84\nRocket Launchers: 0.71\n\nSo it must be a coincidence that the weapons that have the lowest K/D on average are also the weapons with the shortest range.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 4}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484951132, "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198020824886"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "weighted_vote_score": "0.543646", "timestamp_updated": 1488034425, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30169181", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_created": 1488034425, "votes_up": 24, "review": "EARLY ACCESS REVIEW\n\nNot a bad game so far, very inspired by Robocraft and obvious where it borrowed from its progenitor. But that does not make it a bad game by any means. \n\nThe building is decent, but not hugely important. There is simply not enough depth to the building -yet- to make it matter much. The combat is very engaging and the ground work for a solid damage system are there, but as the building doesnt matter much yet so doesn't careful targeting. On the flip side, you can make a really cool looking ship without sacrificing much in the way of power/toughness.\n\nThe weapons need a lot of work though... the game is currently a snipe fest. Everyone uses the big cannons and stays back at max range just pinging at each other. Few ships are well enough designed and piloted by skilled enough people to zip in and fight up close/mid range but they are still inferior to the large cannon cruiser/battleships in general. They have a tough uphill journey to balancing their weapons and creating better counter play.\n\nOver-all.... the game is worth giving a try. If you like it, throw a little $$ the developers way to keep growing the game. This is very much in the same boat Robocraft is, what they are trying to do is truly epic, very hard to balance, and requires  strong community support to pull off. These guys are not 3xA developers and with no major Publishers backing them. They are making a great product and need a dedicated communities help to not only fund it but also test and balance it.\n\nThis, as with Robocraft, has the potential to be one of the best multiplayer online games out there and far far exceed the 3xA big money games.

Snipers are too strong, they can completely tear you apart in a few shots.\n2. Snipers also don't travel very far from spawn meaning IF you manage to get through the enemy team and avoid said snipers fire, he's just going to spawn up and remove you.\n3. Rockets, phasors or cannon is really the only way to go... you have to aim everything but why should I restrict myself to trying to lead in this game when rockets are so much better? The machine guns are TERRIBLE.\n4. No regen so if you get your stuff shot out... even though you won the fight... you have to press K and suicide giving the enemy a point anyway.\n5. Maps are too small and too big at the same time. All the terrain you can take cover behind is limited to such a small space, yet you can fly out of that to rediculous lengths making that annoying flankers capable of just riding the edge into your spawn, then fly behind your spawn and never get spotted by your team.\n6. Progression is so painful. It take quite a few games of 2x exp with a 225% increase on the match to get enough junk to research one thing.\n7. Matchmaking is broken. I was seeing ships much larger and much more well equipped than I early game. Indestrucible badasses just taking on level 3 rookies.\n8. Since snipers are so powerful, this makes games focused around a few pillars, with snipers daring anyone to peek meaning if you are a close ranged damage dealer, you better be able to take on their entire team.\n\nThis game HAS potential but right now it just lacks the balance for me to recommend this to anyone.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 2}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485213974, "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198166938141"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "3", "weighted_vote_score": "0.514931", "timestamp_updated": 1485090515, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "29421372", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 10, "timestamp_created": 1485090515, "votes_up": 25, "review": "Gauss Cannon Artillery League more like it haha.

[/h1]\n\nAfter playing this game for a while, I discovered one thing:\n[u] This game is one of the most addicting games I've played in a long time! [/u]\n\nLet's take a look at some Pro's and Con's:\n\nPro's:\n[*] Very easy to use editor, but sadly, the hotbar is very small.\n[*] You dont have to buy anything more than once. You buy it for a sorta high price, and you can use it as much as you want.\n[*] The crafts control feels very good, it doesn't feel like youre sliding all over the place.\n[*] The Noob-Ship class doesn't feel underpowered at all. Of course, the specialised classes are better, but you can easily take down a shielded Battleship with a beginner ship.\n[*] No pay to win. Most ingame purchases are for skins only. The rest is Premium and \"Space Whiskey\" for more XP and Currency.\n[*] Class-specific abilities are surprisingly well balanced for a 2 week-old game, which is something a lot of dev's struggle with at first.\n\nCon's:\n[*] OMG the balancing is awful. Definetly something that has to be improved.\n[*] As of right now, the Gauss Cannons are very overpowered, especially using the Destroyer class.\n[*] The only gamemode so far is TDM, which is kind of a bummer, but I'm certain that that will change very quickly.\n[*] Leveling up in the higher levels feels very slow to me personally, but in the end, it extends the fun, so it isn't necessarily that bad.\n\nLong story short, this game hooked me really quickly and i cant wait to see it take off, 'cause it has a lot of potential. I can't wait to see it develop and get more fun after every update! It's definetly more fun if you play it with friends though, cause you can attack more efficiently. It's also very addicting. I keep telling myself: \"just one more game and I'm done!\", but that mostly just ends in me playing through a whole night (which totally didn't happen to me last night). \n\nNOW GO!

Some things that are great about this game and I let you decide if it's any good.\n1. Unlimited amount of blocks, no pay wall or grind to get more simply unlock the modules with your in game credits and you can use as much as your cpu (game block count limit) will allow.\n2. No pay to get better things only pay to get cool looking skins and faster exp.\n3. Skins are AMAZING with custom animations and designs and everything.\n4. Very few bugs.

More than just building the best craft, abilities and the effective use of them as well as knowing what abilities other craft have and map awareness can make almost any build work properly in Galactic Junk League.\n\nNow some few complaints:\n1. Placing blocks is a pain in the ass sometimes. \n2. Current meta is kinda boring but not broken as a lot of people complain (IE sit near your own spawn and long range anything that comes near or the ever annoying fast ships with an high damage close range lasers.

Theres nothing that stands out about this game but that still does not mean its not fun. In fact its actually a well made early access game that has some pontential. I'm going to start off with the problems I had with the game first. My first problem I had with the game was that the game limits you with your ship if you want to decorate or build anything cool like a star wars tie fighter or the star trek enterprise. Another one of my problems is the multiplayer, team auto balance is not that good and you leave the match when its over. One of my last problem is the ship movement. Your ship goes extremeley slow even with powerups enabled which is really anyoing if you want to get to the battle fast or get away from another ship thats shooting at you, but at the same time its an early access game so its not that big of a deal. My last problem is that you can only put one type of weapon on your ship, for example if I wanted to put missles and lasers on my ship I would not be able to do that. I dont really understand why they did that, but I can live with it. The stuff I really liked about the game though was that the editor, to make your ships, was easy to use, the cartoony art style was pretty cool, the controls were easy to use and I loved the battling because of how the peices of someones ship could just fall off and you could shoot someones weapons off and they would'nt be able to shoot there weapons which is really cool to me. So overall this is a decently good, free early access game that I really liked.\n                                                          \n   I will probably keep playing and enjoying this game now and after the full version comes out and I am going to reccommend this game and give it game a 7 out of 10 :)", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487802015, "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198313018080"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "weighted_vote_score": "0.511893", "timestamp_updated": 1487627507, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30067019", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1487627507, "votes_up": 8, "review": "Its a good start for a game, but it could use a few updates.

One would think that the developpers learnt something from it, but actually it has exactly the same flaws as Robocraft. Yay?\nGood stuff: Now fully 3d fast paced combat, controls are quite intuitive and the battle flows good.\nAlso building a robot... Sorry, I mean, an \"space junk ship\" is quite satisfying... the first three times. Then its always the same stuff: battle, get some coins (or pay for them if you wish), unlock new skills and modules and repeat.\n\nBut now let's be honest: How comes that you kept EXACTLY the same mechanics than in Robocraft?\nDo you want to build an all-purpose ship? NOP! You can only select one kind of weapon. \nDo you want to fully protect your ship? NOP! You are limited on the ammount of pieces you can add. Cheap mechanic as f(word). They could balace it so if you have a very heavy ship you will be slow, or loose power, or require more engines to actually keep flying... But Nop! Let's just limit the number of pieces you have! \n\nThe battles are short. WAY too short.\n\nAnd, exactly as it happened in Robocraft, the players that have been playing longer are simply overpowered, so they will always lead the battle. Skill, you ask? Nop, simply better weapons and pieces.\n\nSill you may enjoy this game for... let's say 2 hours? Maybe a game you want to have installed to play something while the good games get updated.\n\nStill free to play. I don't think much people would spend money on this.\n\nOnly good thing I can actually say: This is still an early access. Maybe the developpers will lsiten to the reviews and actually make this an appealing game. As it is right now I expect a very short life for Galactic Junk League.\n\nUPDATE: It keeps getting better (sarcasm) with the \"buy credits\" option.\nSo you unlock an upgrade, say for 3000 credits, right? Play a couple of games to get the credits.\nImmediatly as you get the credits you get a new upgrade to research. The price?\n\n12.000 credits.\n\nDo you want to have anything good in a reasonable time? Pay. Becuase if you don't have this stuff you simply can't compete in game.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 2}]}
