This game is LITERALLY impossible. \n\nIt has you slide 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 images but here's the problem:\nWhen you do a 3x3 there are 9 squares BUT ONE OF THEM IS JUST A \"CURSOR\" SQUARE that doesn't have a part of the image and you have to work off this stupid square, so you're unable to complete a picture because you can't actually do any of the squares with it WITHOUT FUCKING UP THE IMAGE MAKING THE GAME ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY SINCE YOU CAN'T WIN AND COMPLETE THE PICTURE.\n\nFor a better understanding, I will leave a gif of the issue. Notice how I am using the help function which tells me which blocks should be in which space. But you simply cannot maneuver the cursor block to maintain a picture: \nhttps://gyazo.com/23d763cd310a282fe8016433138f8cdf\n\nPlease observe how it's impossible to keep the 1 block and the 2 block up there at the same time BECAUSE IT FORCES YOU TO MOVE ONE OR THE OTHER.\nThis happens throughout the game at any points in the picture 3x3 4x4 and 5x5 alike", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 2}]}
