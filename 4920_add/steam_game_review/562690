It's a fun experience for only $10, although I got it on sale. The only complaints I have are: no music, it's extremely short, and practically no replayability. The shortness is fine though, as the game is fun. \n\nI hope that Machine1357 makes more games. Immersion is fun, but honestly feels like a demo for a bigger game.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}]}
