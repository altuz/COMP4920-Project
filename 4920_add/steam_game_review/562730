The graphics are low quality, no suprise for it being a port of mobile port of a NG flash game, but at the same time I've played other flash games that are of much better graphical quality. Even for a lash port, I'd still expect graphics improvements other than basic upscaling given that I'm expected to buy this game. (Or maybe not considering the dev is all for people torrenting this game?)\n\nIf you're in the market for similarly priced TD games, $7 will get you the IBomber Defense bundle. Personally, I'd save up a bit more and get Defense Grid: The Awakening for $10. Or you could save that $5 for the summer sale and get em both. Or get a pretty good discount on Iron Brigade. Lot of options besides giving your money to a scummy dev like this.\n\nEdit - Welp, that forum ban was pretty quick. https://i.gyazo.com/7c6c84ef7c9f77ecdb94bfd20e6b1fe1.png\n\nOh yeah, and the forums have been purged.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493559862, "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198094628303"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "8", "weighted_vote_score": "0.413273", "timestamp_updated": 1493743425, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31509509", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 116, "timestamp_created": 1493743425, "votes_up": 5, "review": "Fun tower defence with top-down graphics \nYour task is to protect 4 energy cores from zombies that try to steal them \nYou can improve the turret and upgrade the robot by installing more powerful cannons and improvements. \nThe choice of different options and tactics will not let you get bored \nI recommend", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493766509, "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198011571208"}, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "9", "weighted_vote_score": "0.410638", "timestamp_updated": 1493766863, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31514932", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 114, "timestamp_created": 1493766863, "votes_up": 4, "review": "Fun tower defense with robots and zombies.
