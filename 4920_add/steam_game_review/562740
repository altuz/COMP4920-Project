Check my first gameplay video and first impression in Mixed Reality:\nhttps://youtu.be/KPuD047XshY\nI think this game is well worth the low pricetag IF you enjoy wave-shooters, if you dont need free movement, and dont care too much about realism. This is a simple arcade-style shooter with cartoonish graphics but its very polished and well done actually! \nYou move along the streets of a cute village, for every new wave. There are a lot of different zombies and creatures as well as some cool bonus-zombies like a Michael Jackson zombie dancing - hilarious funny :)\n\nWell, i recommend this game for what it is, and the price tag is perfect for the amount of content. \n\nCheers\nSweViver", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501972122, "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035565771"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496953", "timestamp_updated": 1481506623, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "28320133", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1481506623, "votes_up": 2, "review": "Very Fun, but short.
