We have limited capabilities in terms of player testing, so feedback like that is really valuable. We are currently finalizing and update that will bring a lot more things and confusion but also greatly improve all the help/guide stuff, so if you decide to mess with it more, please consider waiting a week or so for the update (kind of a strange request, but it makes sense in that it will be a 60% new game by the end of the month). For now though here is a few helpful things: |The Q-tips explain the user interface - panels, menu elements, etc - not the 3D environment. \n|To progress with the guides on game mechanics you need to click the arrow buttons  left to the guide dialog box.\n|The circles in the main menu open editing. In that mode where you could move atoms along axises you can shape the models and add abilities to their atoms (shown in the bottom part of the screen). And a small grey button in the top left corner of the screen is to enter neural editing.\nHopefully, this helps a little bit.
