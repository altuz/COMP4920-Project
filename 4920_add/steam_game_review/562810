Easily the best looking Monopoly out there - but major game breaking issues that were present on the Xbox and PS4 versions since it came out in November 2014 still exist. That's almost 3 years. \n\nThe game will inexplicably stop proceeding at random points during the game. The game won't be frozen, but none of the players will be able to take the next turn.\n\nI've reported this to the developer, Asobo, and also to Uplay with previous version. But nothing's gotten done. \n\nBeing the glutton for Monopoly that I am, I've been able to limit this happening by making sure everyone who I play with on the Xbox/PS4 has a wired connection to their router (I strongly feel they did not test this game using Wifi connected devices). And I'm leaning towards this being the issue here as well. Haven't been able to test this with the PC version yet. Not sure I'm motivated to waste the time of 5 other people. \n\nI love the team at Ubisoft, and strongly believe this has the potential to be a huge success on Steam and Uplay. But as it is right now, it's tremendously irresposible to sell this with the same game breaking issues that have been there for years. Please invest the resources need to fix this game. I'm personally happy to help duplicate the issues and get this sorted. \n\nThis could be the definitive version of Monopoly online with just a bit more love.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505089273, "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198108200111"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "5", "weighted_vote_score": "0.533726", "timestamp_updated": 1505084731, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "34807919", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 17, "timestamp_created": 1504845802, "votes_up": 50, "review": "Really want this game to work but 6 of us all buy the game for $15 each and cant even get past the first part of the game.
