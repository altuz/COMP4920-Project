Well anyway im lvl 30, yep, barley an hour in and im lvl 30, with the same three skills but are stronger and might be able to learn otheres(at this rate, I might have to be like 60 before seeing new skills)\n\nAlthough I did enjoy some of the old school asetic, I didn't really feel emereced in the story...spoilers.... \"hold on, Im a what that did stuff then ended up with the Gods so I have to learn everything again?\" Also...being able to not only fight Zeus but beat him multiple times(he does get tougher but still....why should I be able to casually get into a play fight with Zeus to \"learn something\" was there no one else around? No demigod to train with instead so the gods can be awesome and not feel like \"I have to beat Zeus again....well this might take a few more turns\") Oh....and story wise Im some one with dragon blood...which apprantly makes me chummy enough with Zeus for him to be my punching bag a few times\n\nokay let me stop bashing that for a moment, its just for me gods should have a clear purpose for interacting with them, or at least a feeling of...well something awesome, which is lacking here....totally killed it for me...\n\nspeaking about interactions....I dont want to see a fairy saying \"click here to continue\" for every time I needed to click on a dialog box to keep the conversation going...\n\nOkay so you clearly see some of my beef, let me say some good things, after all there are human beings at work here....\n\nI DO like how I DONT need to know who I am exactly talking too, there is an autopilot that will take me to whoever I need to talk to, so no time having to look through old quests for names, or even looking at people's head to try to find so and so, I get lost easily so I liked that aspect...now for me to turn it off\n\nthe dungeon system is GREAT! Just simply click on dungeon and pop in whenever you want! just costs stamina which regenerates, no hassle to get from where ever I am to the dungeon I need to crawl so I can lvl up my party.(NPC's join you to make up your party by the way)\n\nCombat ratings are reasonable, I have a clear idea of what constitues a three star rather then a single star...long story short, speeed, which when I got 2 star rating intstead of three by ONE TURN that is legitamatly my fault...one move diffrent and I could have done it...which I did go back in order to complete, which of course gives you goodies as you go along, encourages you to use your skills wisely, as most of them consume rage you need to manage which ablities you want to use to optimize just how fast your going to kick their butt... Execpt for when the \"Random target\" happens to kill someone that someone in your NPC party could have killed in their sleep...so that sort of ruins the idea...would have been intresting if they did it right\n\nwhich unfortuatly inculdes gods(more specifically Zeus)....and other random things like Hoplites, preists, dragon things\n\nSo I DO like the combat ratings that encourage tactial thinking, but a lack of skills/ablities to keep things intresting(though I will say some are epicly named) and a rage meter to keep track of in order to USE some of the more usefule ones prevents me from spamming my most powerful ablities all the time create the atmosphere where just using a basic sword swipe can be a good move, to preserve rage for something else later to get a three star rating...timing is essential\n\nBut I feel the HUD is WAAYYY to cluttered with all of these shiny buttons(which I am almost surprised the fairy isn't telling me to press...the 1st few times were fine, getting introduced to an upgrade mechanic I can understand the need...but to keep dialoge going? Sorry...its annoying after a while...also like half of those buttons were to get me to spend real money)\n\nSo long story short then...there are a few intresting ideas, but needs more story(chracters are introduced randomly so I dont really care....I think one preistess at the start was a freind of my hero or something and I left that level as confused as to who I am then when I started and well...lvl 30 and no clue who I am? I start not to care...I shouldn't NOT CARE about characters...including the annoying fairy) and TRIM DOWN THE HUD! put all the money stuff in one place instead of 5 diffrent buttons would ya?", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486263866, "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198276276430"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493255", "timestamp_updated": 1486264251, "language": "english", "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "29708838", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 7, "timestamp_created": 1486264251, "votes_up": 9, "review": "mehh Clash of the titans?
