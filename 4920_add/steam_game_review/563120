With generated coin you can trigger mouse QTE style twitch events to buy stuff at lower prices and sell it higher. Unfortunately due to a bug or an issue I often could not adjust prices or negotiate making a great deal of the game not very functional. Eventually you are meant to be able to amass enough ressoures to keep a stock of weapons, hire some mercs and send them on missions. The overall quality was a little bit on the low side with few things to do or manage and I would recommend Sheltered over this.

Sure it's still dreary and gray but rather than fighting your way through hordes of monsters you're running a small shop.  You still gotta mow down a few baddies along the way but most of your time is spent dealing with customers either requesting a specific type of gun or trying to sell you something they found.  You can negotiate the price and if you attempt to get a better deal, you usually have to play a game.  The game consists of a circle and an arrow spinning around it - land in the small colored section and you're one step closer to getting a good deal.  The harder the deal the more times you need to land in the correct spot - each time getting smaller and faster.  \n\nAs you make money from your deals you get the opportunity to build a few more items and add them to your shop.  Things such as a bar or gambling table - things that will net you extra money and allow you to hire some extra muscle to protect you.  And you'll need it as the game gets a bit more difficult and you may find yourself rushing to finish things and making a few errors here and there.\n\nDesolate Wastes isn't the prettiest game.  It isn't the most intuitive.  But there's something charming and fun about it - at least for awhile.  If you're into resource management or trading type games then this will probably be something that interests you.  It's not gonna break the bank and you'll most likely get your money's worth.  \n\nMy first (poor) attempt at it: https://youtu.be/FwF4tEnvfl8", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
