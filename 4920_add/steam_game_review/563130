Installed fast and booted it up after watching the trailer. \n\nLevel 1. Had good ambience, looked pretty good for a $4 game. Was creeped out a bit as I figured out what I was doing. Got into a paddock, shoved a cow over. Did it four more times and the level ended. \n\nLevel 2. Knock over a couple more in the same paddock. Okay I guess? Cows are in the same places. Oh a dog that I can outrun and I have no stamina. \n\nLevel 3: Knock over a couple more??? \n\nLevel 6-8?: Oh there is a pig that chases me around outside the paddocks now.\n\nLevel 10: I'm literally just doing the same thing over and over and over again. \n\nIf this was someone's first venture into game making and it was free, then I would be a bit impressed. Alas, I spent $4 on this and must rate it as something I would expect out of a $4 game, which isn't much, and this just doesn't cut it. You literally see all the game mechanics on the very first level. I didn't play past Level 10, I couldn't bring myself to do it. Don't buy this game for $4.
