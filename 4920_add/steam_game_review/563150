Very basic, even, but it does provide an hour of puzzling (even though there are only a few challenging levels) so I hesitantly recommend it to puzzle game afficionados or if you can pick it up heavily discounted or in a bundle.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nYou control a small robot that can push blocks around. If two or more blocks of the same colour are connected by pushing them next to each other, they disappear. The level is completed when all the blocks have vanished. You fail when there's only one block of its colour left or when you've made it impossible to push the remaining blocks next to each other.\n\nThe game has 40 levels. The difficulty of the levels seems random; there's no real steady increase in difficulty like in most puzzle games. Sometimes you'll be served a level that requires some thinking and planning or even a few tries to get it right, and the level after that may well be a ridiculously easy one.\n\nBecause of the game's perspective, the controls feel very clumsy and do take some getting used to. Take a look at the screenshots: the levels are rectangular in shape and you're looking straight at one of the corners. That means pressing 'up' makes the robot move towards the upper right corner of your screen, 'left' makes the robot move towards the upper left corner of your screen, 'down' makes the robot move towards the lower left corner of your screen and 'right' makes the robot move towards the lower right corner of your screen. \n\nI found it impossible to play the game using the mouse. Using the arrow keys of the keyboard worked better but I still had trouble moving the robot where I wanted him to go. That meant that sometimes I unintentionally pushed a block into a dead corner, causing me to have to restart the level. Actually, it was only when I tilted my head a bit to the right, making 'up' actually meaning 'go up' and so on, that I managed to make the robot go where I wanted him to go without making any unintentional mistakes.\n\nThere's an 'undo' button that allows you to undo your last move. You can use the button up to 5 times. Each step the robot takes counts as a move, though, so often the undo button couldn't really undo anything that mattered and restarting the level was the only option. In the screenshots on the Steam Store page, you see high numbers like 28 and 33 on top of the 'undo' button. I don't understand where that comes from as for me, the counter always stayed at 5. \n\nThe game keeps a score while you play but I don't see the point, really.\n\n[h1]Graphics and music[/h1]\n\n[i]Interlogic[/i] is made in Unity. The graphics are basic but that's okay for a block-based puzzle game. The main menu is extremely basic graphic wise, too, looking like a menu from a 1980s game.\n\nThe music is subtle, non-intrusive and actually sounds very good as background music to a game like this.\n\n[h1]On Steam's extra features[/h1]\n\n[i]Interlogic[/i] has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.\n\nThe 5 Steam Achievements are granted for:\n[list]\n[*] completing the tutorial levels\n[*] completing all the levels\n[*] retrying a level 5 times \n[*] completing 5 levels without undo or retry\n[*] completing 10 levels without undo or retry\n[/list]", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501590601, "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970693896"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1501650217, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33948264", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_created": 1501591011, "votes_up": 1, "review": "Quite easy, rather boring.
