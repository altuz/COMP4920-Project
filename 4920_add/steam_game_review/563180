It reminds me of the old EGA games I used to play in the early 90's as a child and brings back so many great memories. I can't wait to get home for the holidays and grab a copy for my brother so we can play side by side together to see who can finish levels first - and to generally have more time to game - I will be editing this review as I get through the game. (So far I've completed the first stage, Factory, and Egypt)\n\nPros:\n\n-Available on Linux, Windows, as well as Mac OS.\n-The Soundtrack is excellent. It's a really cool balance between real instrumentals and chiptune music. \n-Works well with my Xbox 360 gamepad, controls are great.\n-The player can get addtional powers, jumps, and skills -  So far I've only achieved the freeze skill and it's been fun to use to overcome certain challenges. \n-60 FPS. Thanks.\n-The title of the game really makes sense with the story - and to have a pretty cool story in a platformer is incredible in and of itself. This really takes me back to classic DOS gaming.\n-After you beat the first level you have a choice between going to a bunch of levels that have a great amount of variation. reminds me of how Shareware/Full registered games used to work. If you're bored, or simply want to see other levels, you have a choice to skip to them, and then revisit the episode you could not beat. \n-Challenging, but not punishing. Has the same quick restart/pace as Super Meat Boy. No lives either, a healthy amount of checkpoints. Very rewarding when you get past some of the tricky rooms. This is a game where timing is crucial!\n-Jewels and treasure are a great addition and often tricky to get to, but rewarding. Reminds me of  Apogee Software's Crystal Caves. \n-Price. There has been a lot of games saturating Steam at this price-point, but a great number of them are frankly kind of terrible. With what I've experienced so far, I believe that this dev selling himself short. This is a great game! I'd pick this up at $5-$10 without any hesitation. \n\nOverall, and especially given the EGA/DOS nostalgic charm of this game, great soundtrack and responsive controls - combined with the overall inexpensive cost of the game; I rate this game a 9.5/10. \n\n\nNOTE: I emailed the dev about saving progress and he replied that they come into play as soon as you finish the first episode or level. (He got back to me very quickly after messaging him through his Youtube Channel - kudos to him!)After you complete the first challenge you will have a choice to play 6 other episodes or levels. You can't save within them, but given the amount of checkpoints, I'd suggest giving yourself about 20 minutes each episode to finish if you're not very skilled at platformers like myself.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505549032, "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198047951443"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "timestamp_updated": 1487386109, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "29998532", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1487386109, "votes_up": 2, "review": "Great game.
