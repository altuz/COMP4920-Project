And it's worth it - this game has really great atmosphere. You are talking on this abandoned spaceship and feel that something might happen just around next corner. And often it does. It's also a puzzle game - it tests your skills in many ways. I didn't like fighting with enemy robots but fortunetaly most of them can be killed with minigame which by the way is also very interesting (and difficult). RPG part of the game is rather simple and it might not be enough for hardcore rpg gamers, but is decent and a skill tree is quite smart and interesting. I would say that it's a great game for players that usually don't play rpg.\n\nPros:\n- great atmosphere and music\n- interesting story with some surprises, there are also many notes or mails which enriches the story, for example love affair plot\n- many, many features like mini-games, skill developing, puzzles, and other small things\n- easy but yet challenging rpg system\n- you can skip boring parts of fighting with mini-game\n\nCons:\n- You need some training to use movement \n- It's a bit too dark as for my taste, not everywhere it's because of atmosphere\n- Well, it's quite difficult, don't even try Expert mode - you will die quickly, but I guess it could be a Pro for some people", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489882166, "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198090537281"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526133", "timestamp_updated": 1489884351, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30604185", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "timestamp_created": 1489884351, "votes_up": 12, "review": "I just finish the game and here's my review.\n\nLemuria: Lost in Space is ok. Early in the game i was enjoying exploring the ship and uncovering various weapons until I died...and died. unfortunately, this game has a very difficult survival aspect to it. I played on normal difficulty and struggled to find coolant and batteries and had to spend all my level up points torwards upgrading my coolant and energy to counter it. That didn't help much which caused me to start to rush to complete my tasks since surviving in this game is really close. \n\nHalf-way in the game I realized I needed hacker points allocated which required me to use an item to reset my skillz which really ticked me off since the game requires you to have that in your level up build to progress. late in the game, I got so low of energy, i couldn't get passed a group of enemies, my only option was to either start over the game or \"cheat\", I chose the latter. (again, because of the lack of resources which drain way to fast) \n\nI imagine this game would have been more fun for more if I had played on easy, so I will give this game a thumbs up because of that. All those cons below are based on my experience so if your in for challenge...play on normal otherwise play on easy!\n\nPros\n+ good story\n+ good setting/atmosphere\n+ fun puzzles\n\nCons\n- very difficult on normal (can't imaging the hard difficult)\n- lack of resources\n- required hacker skillz\n- had to rush through the game to survive\n\nHere's a link to my finished video walkthrough playlist in case you need help. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ4nRRZoj255oMUIvpD29DoiO9Y8V1K3T", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489830045, "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198223195412"}, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518768", "timestamp_updated": 1490128100, "language": "english", "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30580103", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "timestamp_created": 1489796705, "votes_up": 12, "review": "This game has some flaws but it also has some unique little diamonds not seen anywhere. It seems crazy mix of not related genres but it mixes it in a nice way.

I dont know, story? maybe)\n+ many smart puzzles and trivia mini-game\n+ interesting mix of many genres - it's like a dish with a small portions of meals from around the world \n+ nice sci-fi story, with many details and great actors job\n\n- movement could be better\n- some small graphics bad choices \n- fighting could be better\nOverall 8.5/10", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
