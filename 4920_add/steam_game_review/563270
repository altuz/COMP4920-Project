I finished this game in one weekend, which is shorter by far than most RPG's I have played, but it was well-worth the money I paid for it. This was a great casual-play RPG. The gameplay is smooth, the art is great, the music is enjoyable, it isn't ridiculously time-consuming to level-up your party, and it is very original.

Such short amount of hours in RPG is unacceptable. Other things are not good too: You get randome encouters way to often, combat is boring, long and repetitive, numbers you see on accuracy are lies, otherwise I don't know how in 10 turn fight with acc at 95% i missed 4 out of 10 attacks, 3 of which was in a row, monsters have way to much HP. Story was okay, but generic. Music's forgetable and only thing I liked was few gravestone jokes. Overall not good.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 1}]}
