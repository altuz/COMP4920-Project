I didn't hate it but it wasn't the best either.  Some of the puzzles were too easy.  Others didn't have clear instructions so I just skipped those.  The graphics were good.  I played on a Win 7 pc, so I didn't have problems running the game.  The story was really weird. I didn't like the beginning. I was waiting for my cards to drop or I might not have played past it. The ending wasn't bad, but it kinda scared me though.  When I got to the end, my first though was \"Oh god, don't tell they are making a part 2\".  I would recommend only if it is really, really cheap or if you have a severe love of HOGs.", "received_for_free": false, "votes_funny": 0}]}
