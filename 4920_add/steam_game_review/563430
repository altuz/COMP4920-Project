As the hottest of takes, it's like System Shock 2 by way of Dragon Quest crammed into a Zelda 1 dungeon map.\n\nThis game is pretty excellent! The combat seems initially too simple, but as the game progresses, the simple math and the small numbers mean you know EXACTLY how screwed you are at any given moment. The map design can't be overstated, either. Every room is crammed with stuff to find and interact with, and the constant threat of (lightning-fast) random encounters draining your health adds tension to your exploration. The game has a very simple stat system, but the resource that upgrades your combat performance also upgrades your exploration skills, so deciding between one more point of Defense to survive a little longer and one more point of Agility to slide past those deadly lasers is very immediately meaningful.\n\nVoid Pyramid is just a fantastic, tightly woven experience that always offers more danger, more to explore, and a setting you definitely have not seen before, completely free of magic forests and military bases.", "recommendationid": "29914063", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487046491, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487046383, "num_reviews": 18, "steamid": "76561197981074029", "num_games_owned": 349, "playtime_forever": 6}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514389"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1486320854, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Excellent minimalist RPG set within a very weird universe, somewhere between Final Fantasy Legend and Space Funeral. The Ancient Egyptian / Sci-Fi atmosphere mix works very well, and manages to be both creepy and hilarious. The writing is particularly good, and is kinda reminiscent of these weird 80s PnP RPG manuals or Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, with MONSTER NAMES IN CAPS and an extremely serious tone applied to the most ridiculous subjects.\n\nYour character has three \"dungeon stats\" (corresponding to the classic fighter / mage / rogue archetypes) which are used extensively through skillchecks, allowing you to explore rooms in different ways. There are optional treasures to find (which are described in detail and are a great contribution towards world-building, in a Dark Souls kind of way), and multiple endings (most of which being bad ends). Sadly, the combat is pretty barebones and usually amounts to spamming attack (or, when facing bosses, the item which allows you to attack twice), although the \"dungeon stats\" can alter the fights in a variety of ways (by allowing you to run away, killing the enemy instantly, or increasing the chances of a reward).\n\nAlthough it's not really innovative gameplay-wise, it has that sense of wonder early 8/16-bit RPGs had, which is kind of lost nowadays.\n\n+ Bizarre and fun setting\n+ Excellent writing\n+ Rewards exploration\n\n- Kinda grindy\n- Combat has very little tactical depth\n\n7/10 It's free, it's not very long, it's fun and original.

While the mechanics are not very complex, most attributes and every of the few items is well-thought and has its use, like a warp item which shortens backtracking or a radar item that allows you to sneak through passages which are heavily populated with enemies.\nThe bizarre lore is made with passion and contributes to the unique atmosphere of the game.\nThe only downside is  the combat system, which encourages you to go for a simplistic one-hit kill approach. But most combats can be avoided, even grinding is possible without actual fighting: One \"dungeon attribute\" offers a chance to win an engagement automatically, another one allows you too flee otherwise. This way you'll get money and stats passively and without even having investested lots of attributes in the \"combat\" category.\nThe single rooms are full of details and keep you motivated. At the same time the game does not overstay its welcome. With a playtime of ~8 hours it gives you all the time to dive into the gameplay and the atmosphere before it gets tedious or shallow.\nFor free game not much you can do wrong here!", "recommendationid": "30128189", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487886977, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487880380, "num_reviews": 42, "steamid": "76561198088213112", "num_games_owned": 653, "playtime_forever": 39}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 5, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_positive": 5}}
