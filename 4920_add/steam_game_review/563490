Ressource just accumulate over time, no need to expand or plan a strategy - just sit in your base, amass units an roll over your oppenent. No control groups, the UI has nothing beyond the bare minimum. Units and factions are unimaginative, as are the levels. Currently there is only a campaign, I made it to mission 7 when the designers decided to just throw an unreal amounts of enemies at you. Even with just staying defensive, you get slauthered. The other missions are basically the same, but less frustrating.\nThe levels are very small, they almost fit completly on my HD-monitor. And they are so boring. Most of all because the designers put in tons of turrents in the way which deal massive amounts of damage. So you need some artillery, which is fragile and still takes ages to take out a turrent. So its just lengthens the missions, but doesn't make them interesting.\nSounds are basic and the music is stragnely quite and relaxing - not something fit to a fast paced RTS, nothing that  is meant to raise your heartbeat. The graphics are okay, but nothing special either.\n\nOverall, the game is not even mediocre, its the mininum what to expect from an RTS, its more of prototype. But the biggest nail in their coffin is that there has been not updates or communincation by the devs decemver 2016 when it entered Early Access. No new maps, no new mods, nothing - not even a forum post. Therefore I cannot recommend it at this point, because I don't see it moving anywhere. If you want to try it, there is a version on itch.io which is basically the same, but with less missions.", "recommendationid": "29843212", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486805927, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486805173, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561197968052901", "num_games_owned": 1176, "playtime_forever": 53}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505144"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1482061825, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game is fairly basic for now.
