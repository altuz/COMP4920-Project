This isn't a game, it's LITERALLY nothing!  I cannot not fucking believe garbage like this actually got posted for sale.  Does Steam ever look at what's going into their store?\n\nLet me explain.\nThere's no sound AT ALL.\nNo gameplay.  \nYou walk to three areas, that's it!\nYou cannot interact with anything.\nIf you go down stairs you cannot go back up them becasue you will lose \"momentum\" and slide back down... I kid you not.\nthere's 2 parts of this shit show where if you walk to it you cannot turn back and you're stuck and there's no way to get out other than turning off the game.\nI'm at a lost for words, I just cannot believe it.\n\nThere's literally nothing here, absolutely nothing.
