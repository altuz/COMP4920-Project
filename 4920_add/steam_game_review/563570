Demons to fight and all while playing as a Purple haired Viking lady[/u][/b]\n\n\nSo yeah, the game is difrent.\n\n[b] Yes, you should play this game if you like th following [/b] \n\n* This game has a very 80s - 90s heavy metal sort of vibe, it doesnt dominate the imagery but be warned Skulls, demons, monsters, and chunky guitar riffs are a plenty\n\n* this game in early access and some features are not available yet The dev says to use a 360 controller, or keyboard and mouse I used my keyboard and mouse and it handles pretty good, I dont have a 360 controller so I cant comment on if its any good.\n\n* This game is difficult, but such that I enjoy. Deaths dont feel cheap. \n  Enemies telegraph attacks with large enough windows to evade, projectiles can be deflected or dodged and the camera generally shows you all you need to see.\n\n* The levels are diverse, but the gameplay identity is solid. Hack n Slash with Roguelike elements.\n\n  The dev said hes going for a \"isaac may cry\" sort of game and it shows.\n    - Like BOI you pick up power ups and items that add or replace each other.\n        - this game doesnt have as many items as boi tho\n    - Like DMC it is all out offense (no royal guard) You can launch enemies into the air and slash em up\n    - If you dodge lost second you can return the favor and explode them\n\n* The player moves fast, and for long corredors she accelerates even further, unlike DMC she can perform \nbasic slashes while running allowing you to speed through corredors and with skill and timing, kill everything in sight without a loss of speed.\n\n* Point system rewards using various items and abilities, and maintaining momentum. At first I could barely get 100,000 pts\nbut now im closer to a million.\n\n* Really superb art work, this dev could probably mae visual novels with the best of em. \nThe art style in game is somewhere between painted and cartoony whil the 'cutscenes'are painted\n\n* The game uses 'Tyrfing Cycle' or 'Tyrfing Saga' as a reference, but goes all out with in the fantasy direction and doesnt take itself to seriously\n     There is one part early on where Thor tries to explain through a statue the implications of your rampaging, but all the player hears is \"blah blah blah\"\n      You then proceed to smash his statue.\n\n\n[b]What this game lacks - [/b]\n\n* The points presently do not reflect much, I hoped to receive a medal or a ranking but I get nothing, sort of upsetting.\n  \n* Lack of aerial moves - you can slash while airborn and you can do it multiple times. but there isnt very much diverse moves in the air.\n\n* I think the text box that pops up when you pick up an item is a little big. it can obscure the combat. please ake it smaller and less wordy.\n  * also, it should only pop up once per item you pick up.\n\n* Im not sure what the frame rate is, but it isnt 60 fps. the game is smooth and responsive, but upping the fps will make it all the better\n\n* Doesnt have near as many items as binding of isaac\n\n* doesnt have as much depth in combat as Devil May cry\n\n* That intro, with the demon thingy, its cool and very pretty, but do i have to sit through it EVERY TIME!?\n\n* Story isnt very clear, but maybe im missing something, there is flavour text hidden through out the game.\n\n*achievements pop up, when i quit the game, not during.\n\n*when i quit a run and start a new one I cant get past the run select screen, I have to restart the game. Its a mild annoyance but please fix it!\n\n\n[b] The game is currently 4.99, good deal imo [/b] The game doesnt step too far into dmc territory and more than anything its a side scroller hack n slash with some rogue eleents if you want to get your side scroller fix, well I def recommend.", "recommendationid": "29008245", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1483541589, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484779515, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198338411834", "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 69}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501127"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1484853446, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ive played for a little less than an hour and I really enjoy the game so far.\n\nIts not without problems,  but the game is in development so if youre looking for a flawless and finished game\nwhat are you doing browsing early access?\n\nIn fact early access turned me off almost completely i really dont have a lot of trust with Early access\nbut the [i] trailer looked good and so I gave it a shot [/i]\n\n\nFrom what ive played this game has massive levels, good boss fights and a rewarding set of mechanics\nthat encourage mixing and matching items and using them to kill your enemies. \n\nin terms of length - well Ive gotten a solid hour into the game and havent beaten it,\n\nBut There are some issues that I encountered:\n1 - My achievements didnt unlock and that is frustrating, I see that other people have earned achievements \n      I WANT MINE \n2 - The background art is gorgeous but the sprites are a bit too cartoony for the rest of the style\n3 - Screenshots dont seem to work and despite there being a scoring mechanic there is no leaderboard service \n4 - the story isnt clear at all, it needs work.\n5 - some framerate dips when lots of enemies are on screen, but this is rare.\n6 -DID I MENTION MY ACHIEVEMENTS DIDNT WORK FIX IT\n7- I had a weird popup that said \"unlock status goes here\" Im assuming thats a glitch.\n\n\nDemonSword.
