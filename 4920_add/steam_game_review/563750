The first game that introduced me to text/database sims in this genre is Total Extreme Wrestling (a fantastic game series, available on Steam) and I also have experience with text based Gladiator game Elysium: Blood Games.  This game stacks up highly against these.  The excitement of the Mayweather Jr vs McGregor hype got me wondering what Boxing management sims are on steam.  I used to play Barry McGuigan World Championship Boxing released in 1985 on the ZX spectrum and hoped some game could rekindle the excitement of building up a boxer to fight for a World title.  I could only find this game as a serious contender so this game is an incredibly niche game for a specific niche target gamer and I have to say highly welcomed to even attempt a game in this genre.  That alone deserves support.\n\nGames like this can suffer from being too simple to be engaging and cheap games often suffer, in my experience, from poor tutorials and bad interface.  Happily, this game is both highly engaging and easy to understand. \n\nYou start with a basic gym and equipment and attract students to train.  Your role as manager is to pit them in sparring against each other to try and assess if any have potential. When you spot a good student you can take them on as a trained fighter.  If there is no potential you can drop them from the gym.  You will need to hire a trainer and each trainer has specific traits and will work best with specific weights of boxer. The trainer only gets involved in fight preparation at a training camp.  When a fighter has no scheduled matches they will simply train in the gym alone or rest to recover strength and from injury. Your task is to search 100\u2019s of boxers to find the ideal opponent that will challenge your boxer. With careful planning, you will get very few losses and a few KOs.  You don\u2019t simply set a match up, but have to negotiate how much you are willing to \u201cinvest\u201d in the fight, and whether you want the fight as a undercard for a event.  Later when your boxer is more than a \u201cunknown\u201d you can create main events and title fights.  BUT, it takes a LONG time to build up to that level (in fact, I haven\u2019t got beyond \u201cunknown\u201d in 6 hours of enjoyable play). Once a match is set up you need to find a TV company willing to broadcast the fight and pay them a fee to host the event. You will get a share of the PPV revenues. There are 100\u2019s of media companies to choose from and each company has specific audience sizes, specific regions, different values for marketing and hype.  It really depends what you want to achieve from the match what you go for \u2013 boxer marketability long term or money?\n\nOverall \u2013 it\u2019s a huge database of boxers and media companies to enjoy flicking through to select just the right next step to develop your boxer.\n\nWhat makes this game is the matches.  Some gladiator games offer very simple matches and choices, but this game sets text/stats based strategy apart, taking from excellent features within the Total Extreme Wrestling series. You can choose to auto simulate the matches, but most value will come from \u201cwatching\u201d the matches unfold.  The writing is incredibly detailed, detailing 3 minutes worth of text per round over <8+ rounds giving line by line detail of what specifics are happening in the ring, punch by punch, move by move. This really makes the game as you can imagine the exact moves and the excitement unfolds as you click \"next\" or simply \"play\" to play through the 3 minute round \u2013 you really do will on your boxer and pray he doesn\u2019t get KO and puts up a great fight.  The end of each round tells you who likely \"won\" the round on score. There is a LOT you can do to affect your boxers performance during the match (unlike some similar games). There is a whole suite of tactics to use and I make sure I study the opponents before the match, and the end of round statistics, to use the tactics to best effect.  There is always something for the manager to watch and do.  For example, I focus my boxer on using his best moves, tell him to watch out for moves where the opponent is strong, study what is best for him (if he\u2019s a \u201cslugger\u201d I want him to stand and throw back punches, but if he doesn\u2019t like getting stuck in the pocket and clinching I tell him to avoid that \u2013 stand back and throw punches from a distance).  End of each round provides great stats \u2013 exactly how many attempts at punches, blocks, dodges were made and successful in this match for each boxer. This means tactics evolve throughout the rounds.  The boxer is also in 3 states \u2013 is he fresh or exhausted? Is he cut or not? Is he mentally OK or dazed? As the bell rings to end each round you can choose how to treat the boxer \u2013 water, sponge, or tend to cuts?  Each victory is a real achievement in itself.\n\nIt's just a really exciting text based fun game to play over half hour to an hour each evening. It\u2019s addictive \u2013 you will want to build up 18 year olds into legends of the ring. You get to choose when they retire.\n\nOver time, building up your gym and getting better equipment will enable you to manage more students, fighters and build better statistics. \n\nThere is a period between fights which is a bit empty early on (the game is simulated day by day, but you can skip as many days as you like).  I'm sure as you get more fighters to manage you could aim for 1 match+ each week.\n\nIn terms of learning the game, there is no tutorial BUT unlike many games there is a big \u201c?\u201d in the menu to show you where the help section is.  This clearly explains all features of the game and is very easy and quick to read. Also after each boxing round if you hover over the tactics options it will tell you what does what.\n \nAny negatives? The sound / music is non-existent \u2013 try playing Rocky tunes on your PC for atmosphere!  I also think the database, while huge, is perhaps a bit too huge to really appreciate individuals characteristics and styles. Games like Total Extreme Wrestling are naturally more suited to \u201ccolourful\u201d characters, more so than boxing. I\u2019d love it if the database included more description of the boxers history and made them \u201ccharacters\u201d and not just \u201cstats\u201d. Anything that helps with immersion is great \u2013 the immersion is fantastic in the ring, I\u2019d just like a bit more immersion outside the ring.  Also I don't like the \"weight\" system much.  I had fights set up but the boxers didn't meet minimum weight requirements so matches were cancelled at the last minute I was looking forward to.\n\nA stats and text based game is not for everyone, but if you love that style (as I do), this is a perfect game for you, especially if you love boxing, management, strategy and numerical analysis.  This is a surprisingly rewarding gem of a game. The price is fantastic, priced perfectly. I would pay AT LEAST \u00a37.99 for this and would still get a bargain, so the base price of \u00a33.99 is fantastic and if you get it on sale even more so (as you also get some valuable trading cards).  The fact this incorporates Steam Achievements is a bonus too.\n\nA note to the dev: Fantastic game, keep up the great work, I really appreciate this game being made and available on Steam. With a bit more immersion outside of the ring and on sounds/music this could be even higher rated (how about cheering crowds/boxer entrances with music, etc).  How about press conferences and trash talking to affect boxer morale? How about a deeper RPG element for boxers with external events affecting them (marriages/accidents/more traits that come and go)?  Can we add branding around the gym and have different managers and gyms compete?  Can the gym \u201cbuy\u201d different established boxers and run a team of boxers?\n\nA note to potential buyers: If you\u2019re in the niche who enjoys these types of games (and you know if you are), buy and support this game.  You should not regret it.  My rating is 6.8/10 68% - highly recommended to niche buyers.", "recommendationid": "35209605", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506369428, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 364, "last_played": 1506386265, "num_reviews": 31, "steamid": "76561198015017512", "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 364}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507886"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 14, "total_reviews": 47, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 33}}
