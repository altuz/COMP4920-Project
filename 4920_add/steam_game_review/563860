Very moody. I liked how dark it was, in imagery and content. I would have like to have been able to walk a little bit faster, but I kept going back and forth between also kind of liking that it made me slow down. I found restarting chapters to get all the dialogue worth it as well. Often you only get to choose one option per conversation.
