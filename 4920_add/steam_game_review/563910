Personally, I found the \"music\", and I use that word loosely, totally annoying to the point that I said to myself, \"if this doesn't get better, I'll play with speakers turned off.\"  Secondly, when the game starts, I was wandering around aimlessly, and the devil was whispering repeatedly something intelligible and after wandering through the whole first floor/dungeon/basement, I saw two blobs that I guess were silhouettes, but I could not figure out how to interact with them or battle.  I deleted the game from my hard drive/PC and marked the category as \"don't like\", so that when I get a new PC someday, I don't waste time downloading this again.", "recommendationid": "29752528", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486429671, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486429461, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198073400785", "num_games_owned": 219, "playtime_forever": 12}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497118"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1480612528, "votes_down": 20, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Hey, so as a Youtuber, I must say--This is quite possibly one of the best horror games I've seen! If you can get over the fact that the game has fixed perspectives, you'll probably have quite a lovely time playing it.\n\nPros:Genuinely terrifying atmosphere, decent story, and very spooky events. Decent progression if you know how to manage your resources\n\nCons:I have NO idea what happens if I game over. Do I have to start all over again? Hopefully I won't need to find out, but a save point would be a nice reassurance.\n\nFixed perspective can be mildly irritating with navigation.\n\nThe actual random encounters are only really good for a flinch. not a real scare. Probably could use a variety of sounds for the jumpscare so we don't get the same one over and over.\n\n\n\n\nMind, I haven't played past the first hour or so. But still, I totally recommend it!\n\nYou can follow my journey through this game on my channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7TDIkfCXWE&ab_channel=Grub\n", "recommendationid": "28122933", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1480612528, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480932493, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198079070161", "num_games_owned": 138, "playtime_forever": 93}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471752"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
