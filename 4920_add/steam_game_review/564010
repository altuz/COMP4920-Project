They managed to take their excellent pinball simulation and wrap it up in an interface that is somehow even worse than the abysmal front end they have for The Pinball Arcade. It's also more unstable and the lighting on the tables defaults to a horribly over exposed look.\nStill, once you manage to navigate your way through a menu created by some alien life form not used to the expectations of the average human and get the lighting setup to your liking, you will be able to play some excellent reproductions of real life Stern pinball tables. Like Pinball Arcade once you get to actually playing the tables, everything is great. You'll just have to wade through what may just be the most un-intuitive menu conceived in the modern era and maybe a few crashes to desktop a long the way.\nI'm not a big fan of Stern tables, though people seem to really like the AC/DC table. You aren't able to try out tables you haven't bought as you can in Pinball Arcade. The free table, Frankenstein is quite good though and this game is worth downloading to play it.\nIf only Farsight could sort out their QA I could happily recommend this.

Wow, I am a huge STTNG fan and am so impressed with Star Trek and ACDC.   \n\nMy call out is to all of you that gave it a poor review.  Give it another go, see if you agre with me and update your reviews so they will release Ghostbusters, Batman 66, and 20 other awesome stern games that I want to own.
