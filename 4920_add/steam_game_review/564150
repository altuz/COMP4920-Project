Every enemy, miniboss and situation from the 4 levels I played through can be compared directly to a Megaman, and most of the time there is no difference.  The wind guys in Wind Man's stage?  Got him.  Mettaur's.  Got 'em.  The shield guys you can only hurt from the back in Skull Man's stage?  Got him.  The snail midboss that shoots is eyes and launches bombs from Toad Man's stage.  haha...Got him.  The moves are also just like megaman skills Toad Rain, etc.  So why don't I like it?\n-If someone were to make a Megaman Maker similar to Mario Maker, these would be sub-par levels from the community.\n-The controls are screwy.  Although I didn't find the game to be particularly challenging, being easier than most Megaman games, most all of my deaths were from sliding into the hole.  The Xbox D-pad doesn't work so you're stuck using the analog.  Normally, that isn't an issue.  However, if you're stick is downward 10\u00b0 from center, you slide rather than jump, resulting in (at least in my case) sliding into holes.\n-If the game loses focus (alt-tab, double screens, etc.) the game crashes.  I discovered this at the end of a level when I went to write down the ppassword and lost my progress. Which leads me to...\n-The game tries to be so consistent with the old Megaman games that it forces you to use the old 6x6 pasword entry rather than offering a simple save function.\n-Music, story and graphics are fine, but completely forgettable.\n\nIn short, you'd be better off going back and playing any Megaman 1-10 (or the gameboy ones, or the Xs or the Zeros).", "recommendationid": "34088513", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502135584, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502134908, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561198023117872", "num_games_owned": 287, "playtime_forever": 40}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495090"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502262694, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "What to say? \nMegaman + Lolis = 10/10\n\nSeriously, if you like megaman x and x2 you will like this it's really cool and decently hard", "recommendationid": "34119494", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502262694, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505543034, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198071531597", "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_forever": 931}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497276"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502220154, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Amazing mega man 3 clone. \nfully voice acting. \ngoth loli story.\nThis is a solid buy.", "recommendationid": "34110236", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502220154, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503286622, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198010215554", "num_games_owned": 184, "playtime_forever": 341}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1501127629, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a fun little game.
