I read about the enthusiasm the fans have for this game and as an ex-wrestling nut (I'm slowly getting back into it now via NJPW and the independent circuit) I had to give it a go. \n\nI give the game a thumbs up because I am an 'old school' wrestling fan and can appreciate the mechanics and uniqueness of the game. People who find aesthetics to be important may be turned off by this game; graphically this game is not based on realism but on some sort of nostalgic, squared circle, fantasy escapism; graphically it hasn't really changed in years. Also, the timing based system gives each match an element of unpredictability which I like ( the last WWE 2K game I played, 2K13,  was too easy and I won whenever I wanted. Perhaps WWE 2K games are more difficult now but winning got boring (even though I would complain if I lost!)). \n\nPersonally, I find FPW to be Pro Evolution Soccer to WWE's FIFA. The fact you can edit the wrestler's tendencies means they can act like their real world counterpart would do, and this makes each wrestler feel like an individual. This is evident as it is very common for players to create 'edits' (or 'CAWs' in WWE2K speak), and watch the PC sim the matches rather than play the matches yourself. When I played WWE 2K, the moves each wrestler had was different but the mindset/ tendencies/ mentality was the same. Much like Pro Evo's Player ID (where every player plays like he would in real life) versus FIFA's dominance with licenses where every team would 'look' like they do in real life, but actually when you play FIFA, every AI controlled team 'plays' exactly the same. Tough to say style over substance as the WWE 2K games can offer things (real WWE roster, Universe mode etc) that FPW doesn't. As a result, FPW suits a person who can get lost in their own imagination and create story lines in their heads, as well as enjoy the community element as you will rely on strangers to create your desired roster for you (or you can create edits yourself).\n\nPlease note, FPW is in early access and I can safely say that the monthly updates are great as Spike actually listen to what's being said on the threads/ forums and make adjustments accordingly. They understand that the people who are playing FPW now are, by and large, the same people who were playing FP before, and this makes loyal fans even more loyal. Also, as it is a PC game, mods and all sorts are making their way into the game to make the experience even more immersive. \n\nIf pure aesthetic glitz and glamour is your thing (FIFA's licenses and presentation, for example) is your thing then you may not be convinced by FPW, but if you want a fighting game mechanic that is truly unique, and you consider yourself a long time wrestling fan (I say 'long time' as I assume younger players won't get their heads around the graphics/ mechanics/ easy DIY roster building) and have never played this game before, then I suggest you by it now before the price goes up. Personally, I think the game will get better as time goes on (at the time of writing they have just released another patch with new arenas) and FPW should be considered a rite of passage for any gaming wrestling fan.", "recommendationid": "35451248", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1507113304, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 227, "last_played": 1506973058, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198227168960", "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_forever": 8619}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1505423022, "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I honestly don't understand the hype for this game.
