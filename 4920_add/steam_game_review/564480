Your goal is to escape the station, as Wobo soon learns that staying will result in his destruction. The story is light, but there are 2 cut scenes that try to explain why Wobo and the station exists. \n\nMovement is left and right on the controller or keyboard, with a jump, an interact button and a sneak. Game mechanics are clearly explained by billboards when something new is encountered. It is not an overly technical game though, which lends it towards a younger gamer or someone who has no (or very little) experience with side scrolling or platform gaming.\n\nThe game involves no overt violence, when Wobo is captured or falls from a height, his arms, legs and head pop off and the game reloads from the last save point. This is another thing that I feel makes it a good game for a younger gamer, there was nothing in the game that would make me not want to let my own children have a turn.\n\nThere are 3 difficulty levels, an Easy level when you can use the MANY save points littered throughout a stage. A Hardcore setting that puts you back to the start of a stage if you die and a Time Attack mode where you can try to beat a defined counter per stage. All stages have the optional mission of saving other robots - \"Woblings\" - which provide a points bonus to your score. \n\nGame length will vary depending on your own abilities, but on the hardcore mode it took me about 2 hours to complete the 8 stages. The price is about right with the current discount and am happy to recommend it, I feel a younger gamer will get a lot of value from this title.", "recommendationid": "35341034", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506835776, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 209, "last_played": 1506810729, "num_reviews": 17, "steamid": "76561197960286303", "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 209}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502371"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
