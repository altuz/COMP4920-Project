It's only a .99 cents game and it delivers on what it promises.  I think in the end that deserves a recommendation.  But just know that you're getting a short ride.  And the graphics are average to below average for this genre.  And you'll be using a keyboard to get the game going (why does it not support a controller?!).  \n\nHowever, I think this is a unique enough experience to recommend for VR Rollercoaster / Carnival Ride Experience enthusiasts.  It's a nighttime carnival atmosphere and the ride is definitely different than others (even from the one in Ultimate Booster experience which is similar, but this ride just feels very different to me).  I enjoyed the ride.\n\nRate 5/10 ..
