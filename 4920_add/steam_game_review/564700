It seems very predictable at first, but it really starts to get interesting as you get into it. Despite feeling peacefull to the most part it shakes things up at times just enough to catch you off guard. \n\nIt keeps you guessing all the way through. Ive played the game all the way through to the end, and do not worry it does not get bad torwards the end I personally think it gets better the farther into the mystery you go.    \n\nThis game was originally from Japan( Where it apparantly stayed to the most part)  and had a English Language version on the Appstore( Which in looks was nothing close to how this port is) that got removed, I am glad to see it pop up elsewhere. Worth the price, Memorable little game.

So I thought this version was going to be an improved remake version, but its mostly the same. Sure its better than the Ipad, but not by much. Also I remember specifically that I was totally confused with the plot when I played it on the Ipad, but the story seems to be much more clearer in this version. \n\nMy guess is either this has a better translation or a chunk of the plot got cut or changed from the Appstore version for whatever reason (I can't remember it's been 3 years).\n\nSo if you've never played it, I'd say give it a go. I'm kinda of a sucker for these kind of VN, hence why I bought it again. But if you played the game a few years back on the Apsstore, I suggest you wait until it's on discount if you want to give it another go.", "recommendationid": "31435121", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493530581, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493383995, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198071311428", "num_games_owned": 48, "playtime_forever": 368}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504054"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1498301741, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I've just finished this game and I liked it, I liked it quite a lot. It is a shiny little gem that should be experienced by all fans of mysteries and dark secrets. The story was intriguing, the dialogue dynamic and I even found the artwork to be appealing (although it clearly shows its age, thus it may not work for everyone). \nHowever, as Scar of the Doll can be beaten in about 3 without consulting a walktrough guide, I do recommend getting it when it's on sale. I find 10 bucks to be a tiny bit too much for a 2 hours long experience.
