(First review lol) this game is incredible. It's not a \"Active\" game. It's more idle it in the background until your dungeon raid is complete, Upgrade a bit. Repeat. I sunk 200 hours into the mobile version. And was hyped for this release. I'm so glad it's finally out too! (Small note, Fullscreen doesn't look all that good. :P) It's simple, pixelated graphics still give me nostalgia and it's an amazing concept executed in an amazing way. I'd definitely give this game a shot. It's free and i'm sure a couple hundred megabytes can't hurt the hard drive.\n\nGraphics wise it's not the prettiest, It's simple. Clean. I like that, Sure if you're playing it \"active\" then the repetitive zones get a bit \"EHHHH\" but that's not the point of the game. Just leave it running. If anything 'better' graphics would make this look like a flash game. So your hopes have just plumetted. (how sad)\n\nEven for what, 5 minutes of gameplay it's already amazing. Nothing to complain about. But if this isn't your type of game then [b]Don't leave a review. Simple[/b]. I do hope this game gets future updates and allows me to sink hundreds of hours in.\n\nPros:\n-Unique concept, Bande together a bunch of unique adventurers and warriors/mages. Head into the dungeon and earn loot, With said loot upgrade your tavern and attract more \"powerful\" customers. With endgame products costing a couple million gold each, I doubt you'll complete this game in the first 500 hours or so.\n-[b]WARPING[/b]. The warping feature in this game is amazing. If you pay a small sum for a wizard to set up shop in the tavern he will be able to warp you to levels of the dungeon you've cleared (In incriments of 10), Each level costing an additional 10 gold. So say level 300 would cost you 300 gold. Simple.\n-Music. The music. Oh god the music. It never gets old. It's the same 2 minute piano/drum track played on repeat. But it NEVER gets old. Trust me. It's kinda catchy too >.>\n\nCons:\n-Graphics, You can't expect much graphicwise from this game. It has simple, 8-Bit pixel graphics. And you'll have to learn to respect that. \n-Nothing more.\n\nOverall, Game is wonderful. 100% worth a shot for checking it out. The developers keep in contact with the community and deserve everything they get.", "recommendationid": "29756664", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486454594, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499082491, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198265701733", "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 260}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527505"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 30, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487826861, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "....Why am I addicted to this game?

My first adventure into this genre was with Clicker Heroes, which is still a shining example of the genre. Having played that game for well over 2000 hours, I'm always on the lookout for another idle game that I can open up and let play on its own.\n\nSoday Dungeon doesn't disappoint. \n\nThe basic mechanic is pretty simple, buy heores, let them do the dungeons for you. You can play it move by move, if you'd like to, and there is certainly an advantage to hand picking each of your moves, to advance to the next round. The thing is, I'm the kind of player who's just too busy to sit at the computer and play round after round of games. I much prefer being able to set it up, then come back to it a while later and see what I've earned. \n\nSoda Dungeon really shines when you start getting to later dungeons and racking up the gold. You can buy upgrades that bring new hero types to your bar, allowing you to assemble an ideal team that will bring you to ever higher dungeon levels. Add to that the loot you gain from dungeons, auto equip the strongest set, and just let the game do the rest for you.\n\n[b]Worth the Modest Real Money Price[/b]\n\nIn total, I've spent about $10 on the special heroes you can get in the game. Sure, I could probably grind my way up to unlocking them, later, but again, I like skipping at least a little bit of the grind. I feel the 1 or 2 dollars for each unlock were reasonable asking prices for extending the joy of the game. \n\n[b]A Great Free-To-Play, Even Without Spending Real Money[/b]\n\nEven if you're looking at playing the game absolutely free, there's a reason the game has been praised by so many review outlets. It's simply just a fun game to open up and let run itself. There's depth in all of its mechanics, it has a nice retro graphical charm to it, and it doesn't require you to invest any more time into it than you absolutely want to.\n\nI strongly recommend this game to just about anyone who's a fan of fun games.", "recommendationid": "30011223", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487431075, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488188757, "num_reviews": 205, "steamid": "76561198042913113", "num_games_owned": 443, "playtime_forever": 9396}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531490"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 20, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1486929996, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Yes it's an idle game but i ADORED this on android.

Like Cookie Clicker and Clicker Heroes, the game essentially plays itself, though I'd say that Soda Dungeon both requires more interaction, and rewards the player more for said interaction.\n\nYou start by hiring heroes, equipping them, then sending them to fight monsters in an ever increasing difficulty dungeon. Every 5 levels there's a miniboss, and every 10 there's a boss. Once you reach level 100 (then 200, then 300), you ascend the world, and gain a new relic, which gives you pretty big bonuses - people who've played Clicker Heroes will recognise what's happening here. Characters do not level up, instead progression is done through items and leveling relics.\n\nAnd really, that's all there is to the game. Like Clicker Heroes, it's very simple, with a surprising amount of depth. It's nice to just have on in the background, checking on it every now and then. Put auto battle on and come back once an hour or so.\n\nThe art style is, like the game, simple. There's a decent amount of enemy sprites, that are all pretty well drawn. The animations are a little too basic for my liking, but that's not a big deal. I'd like a bit more variety/interesting visuals, but oh well. I really like the music, but of course it tends to get repetitive after a while.\n\nI only really have small issues with the game. This was a mobile game ported to PC, but no keyboard controls have been added (would be nice for selecting abilities). Some of the controls are a little awkward because of this, but it's easy to get over it.

Has a cash shop for early unlocks, but it seems everything can be achieved with patience and dedication. Even with that, the early unlocks are very reasonably priced, so you get a very decent bang for the buck for donating a bit to the developers.\n\nAppears to have a very nice selection of loot drops, including uncommon and rare drops and a bestiary and item catalogue to see what you've yet to find.\n\nWide selection of adventurer-types to unlock as well, which you do by improving the tavern and supplying it with the right kind of drinks that attract them.\n\nIt has a satisfying amount of layers to unlock and find so it's well worth a download and play for fantasy adventure/explorer fans. It has dungeon crawling, arena contests, tavern management, rare loot drops, character outfitting, and a several other parts of the game that I haven't unlocked yet and may take weeks to do so, so it really has something for everyone.\n\nIt's free, so hey, worth a look.
