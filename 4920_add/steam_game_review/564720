The puzzles can be a little unintuitive but not bad for this genre of game. Game I was considering for times I have to look after children, as the puzzles difficulty level I felt would be perfect for them but the voice acting is so bad it will not appeal to adults as I found myself being pulled away from my fantasy through laughing at the voice lines. But this game is avoidable in its current state, so little effort has been put into the port to the PC platform and how a keyboard and mouse user will play the game has little to no thought put into it. No need for early access as the game is available on mobile platforms already (they should have an income), this work should have been done before the PC release.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/YYOpa1Wr8yw", "recommendationid": "29339378", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1484755869, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484752588, "num_reviews": 51, "steamid": "76561197994868319", "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 143}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503547"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1484743446, "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LubBMTN9ha8\n\nFor all intents and purposes, this is a Point and click game ported to PC from mobile. At the time of recording/playing this was in Early access so there is still a chance to massivly improve the game before release. The pain points I had were mainly with the controls as they did feel quite a bit clunky and no clear input. The voice acting wasnt super amazing, as there are some lines that dont really make a sentence or dont even match up with the subtittles. \n\nOverall, alot of work left to be done, but promising. This could be a really good PC port as long as alot of care and hard work come into fixing up the controls =)", "recommendationid": "29335724", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1484743446, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484739999, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561198046082034", "num_games_owned": 407, "playtime_forever": 34}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500380"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 0}}
