After arriving we found they had lost our reservation, the first mistake. They were very nice about it and found us a room anyway, we asked about room service as we arrived late and were told there is a McDonalds just in the next solar system, second mistake.\n\nWhen we were shown our room we found blood on the bed from what looked like an Alien being born through an unfortunate host. The bathroom had some kind of goo that looked like it came from a slime alien and it was stuck on everything like there had been a slime orgy in there.\n\nThe tv had only channels in Klingonese and the remote was broken, the fridge rattled all night and the air con did not work. \n\nTo cap it off a couple of large slug creatures from the planet Tatooine had sex continually in the room next door making the whole room shake and we could not sleep.\n\nWe told the reception and asked to see the manager but were told the Hotel caters to a large number of different life forms and we were being lifeist.\n\nWe decided to leave after one night and stayed at the Hilton Uranus which catered to humanoids only and was perfect.", "recommendationid": "34409690", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503384006, "votes_funny": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503381781, "num_reviews": 336, "steamid": "76561197974522156", "num_games_owned": 1812, "playtime_forever": 250}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508836"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502061165, "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Space Hotel is a cinematical masterpiece. I've had many a friend play space hotel and they've all loved it. Such great graphics for a tiny litte indie game. More in-depth details below.\n\n-Pros\nGameplay is very fluid, had no trouble understanding what was going on in the background. It is an extremely well done game.\n\nVery scary. Almost didn't make it but I powered through, the monster is quite terrifying!\n\nMusic is always boring to me in video games. Luckily; this game has none!\n\n-Cons\nWould love if there was DLC or some sequel to Space Hotel. I can't wait to see what the developer releases next!!", "recommendationid": "34070892", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502061165, "votes_funny": 5, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504499332, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198074470876", "num_games_owned": 98, "playtime_forever": 363}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494043"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 12, "total_reviews": 15, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_positive": 3}}
