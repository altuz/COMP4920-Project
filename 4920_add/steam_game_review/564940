I enjoyed my time exploring the world and its characters. I think that it could be a bit less linear though, in terms of the choices affecting character conversations and since there is multiple endings I don't think the replay value has enough to it (especially since it auto-saves and you start all over from the begining after the first playthrough). Overall a nice experience!", "recommendationid": "33349312", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499449141, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501001677, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198035364663", "num_games_owned": 513, "playtime_forever": 769}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505361"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502272500, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Unique experience.
