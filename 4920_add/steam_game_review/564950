However, what I was forced to endure for my First Impressions review quickly dispelled any vestige of hope or excitement.\n\nThe options menus are a broken mess, some even requiring a loading screen? Also there is no menu for audio adjustments and the buttons to select an inverted Y axis do not seem to function at all. Also, in spite of the Developer's claim for HOTAS support, the game refused to recognize my joystick and only allowed me to use the controller... where I'm sorry but right stick for maneuvering and left stick for throttle? To me that seems exceptionally backwards.\n\nThe game itself is buggy and tedious. It requires you to slog through the tutorial missions before it will even unlock the campaign. Once you finally get there, IF you manage to get the campaign to load, you will be met with more tedium and broken missions.\n\nThere is a good game here, but it is buried under layers of inadequate controls, menus, and bugs both game breaking and non.

So far I have been enjoying the game.  If the Dev of this project keeps adding to this game I believe you'll have a decent space sim over some time.  But alot more work is needed.
