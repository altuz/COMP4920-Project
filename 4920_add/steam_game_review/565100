I really enjoyed the story and the characters as well. the artwork was amazing and just beautiful i love how it's painted and how you needed paintbrushes to go through scenes. i would definitely recommend this hob to anyone especially people who love hob games, this is a refreshing one and definitely will keep you wanting to play to the very end\n", "recommendationid": "29040470", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1483639520, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494536091, "num_reviews": 18, "steamid": "76561198314305705", "num_games_owned": 153, "playtime_forever": 1714}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504249"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
