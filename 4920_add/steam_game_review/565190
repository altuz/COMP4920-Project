Holy crap, this game is hella fun. Like Xortex 2.0. \n\nThere's wave shooters out there where you physically dodge bullets, but in this game because of the scale, you use your hands and switching between hands to avoid danger. There's so many powerups along the way and so many different types of enemies. It's unbelievable the amount of content. I only got through wave 5 on easy on my first playthrough! I already got my money's worth and I'm looking forward to playing a lot more.\n\nThis is a must buy as there's very few games that'll entertain this much for this little cash.\n\nRating 9/10 (keeping sale price in mind versus fun had)", "recommendationid": "34673959", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505085386, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504316578, "num_reviews": 210, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 15}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 5, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_positive": 5}}
