More than 2 hrs just to unlock those, and without 100% of start earned. So, the full game would be at least 6 hrs long. I confirm it's a great game and any boss is unique and different to beat. To spend worthy your stars is mandatory or later would be impossible to progress, in fact you can also reset your XP assigment for a price.\n\n---\n\nNice and unexpected game, than mix in a good way a match two puzzle with a pistol shooter. But it's more than this because the puzzle itself it's a boss than attack you and could be beaten just learning his moves, and you can also spend XP earned to improve your stats. A demo is avaliable, but honestly you can't understand very much from it as the first boss is closer than a whirlgig where further they're shaped as animal and act like real game bosses.\n\nThings I really liked in this game:\n\n1) price is very fair, this could costs 9.90 and would be anyway better than LOT of games of the same range;\n2) if you beat something in the demo, you'll find this unlocked even in the full game;\n3) The campaign seems very long: 30 bosses to win, where any boss has three configuration with different attacks, shapes and gems, so basically 90 stages", "recommendationid": "28451097", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1482097864, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482653373, "num_reviews": 132, "steamid": "76561197969101080", "num_games_owned": 290, "playtime_forever": 137}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510374"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485216255, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Forgot to review this game some time back and the latest update re-spurred me into action!  Fantastic game with a really simplistic minimalist design.  Its kind of a really cool Target Shooter Puzzle game - you need quick reactions to shoot two gems of the same colour to chip away the boss' health while paying attention to its attacks and teleporting to get a better shot at the enemy (such as to get to the gems on its back while its spearing towards your previous position).  \n\nIts an absolute bargain at the price its sold for - offers far more variety and content and actual skill than the majority of the standard wave shooters out there, and it'll hone your reflexes far better at the harder difficulties.
