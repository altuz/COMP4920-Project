Far few medpacks, not enough line of sight breaking map tiles. My vehicle is large and the enemy has your typical \"lazy developer\" auto-aim, twin miniguns (as) zombies hurl bombs in your general direction. Bombs arent the issue, its the never miss miniguns. \n\nThat was the halfway point of this game. I can only imagine boss 15 and 20, with 4 miniguns and 3 zombies throwing bombs or something else rather offputting. This was shovelware at its finest. A mobile port for steam with barely functioning controlls, horrid weapons and poor bullet travel speeds. The finicky mechanics for ensuring 3-star plays is so wonkey the map is usually ran more than once to ensure that \"top\" score. \n\nPoor graphics, repetitious music but it did come with a mute button. Unobtainable achievements from poor design, at least for me. I feel like a fool for purchasing this. I did intend this to be a fluff game for easy 100% and badges.", "recommendationid": "31768687", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1494855419, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494854994, "num_reviews": 161, "steamid": "76561198044229474", "num_games_owned": 1376, "playtime_forever": 651}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511645"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1497369243, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "You ever want to review something but it take five minutes, and you think \"I don't know if I can do that?\" After this game, I can say I Have!!! It was so bad that at one point I noticed I had picked up health, and I kept thinking \"WHY?\" Playing reminds me of that toy you really loved and ALWAYS wanted- and the cheap knockoff your grandmother bought you at Christmas because she got lost in the store. Yeah, if boredom could cause physical pain, I'd have relatives discussing options on keeping the plug in or not. I say that enjoying a lot of cheaper games and playing oceans of rogue-lite, throwback style games, too, as well as keeping a host of applications on my mobile devices. \n\nWithout giving this too much focus, this game basically scrolls in a specific direction while you attempt to move around obstructions and shoot zombies. The zombies are in cars, lying on the road, and on, and your job is to push UP while pushing side-to-side and back, so you can move AND shoot. Seriously - this shouldn't be difficult to achieve or look like the aftereffect of chewing bubblegum and patting your head gone awry, and yet it does. You get health, some weaponry, pick up some folks; I think I tuned out somewhere around there and hope to never, ever open this game again, even by accident.", "recommendationid": "32391785", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1497369243, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497369117, "num_reviews": 17, "steamid": "76561198087062700", "num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_forever": 5}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
