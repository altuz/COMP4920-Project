This \"game\" that is more than a visual novel is an abomination both in writing and the characters provided.  This game presents you with two stories in the world of darkness universe, one being the Vampire, perhaps familiar to you if you've played Vampire the masquerade bloodlines and the other one being Mage, set in the ascension universe of world of darkness. Both of these stories do the original material no justice and it gives you clique after clique plus hamfisted political opinions that the writers seem to force in which is not needed and should be thrown away as this franchise has never been about the mortal fragility of politics, vampires and mages deal with stuff on a whole other level, mundane human politics and the mortal frailty is beyond their concern, so if the bus driver is \"racist\" or that this bookstore you work at is \"ultra pc\" it is not relevant to the universe, never has and hopefully never will again. \n\nA mage should be concerned about the technocracy and the war that they have pretty much lost. Vampires should be concerned about the masquerade, where their next pray is. Both navigate an incredibly vulnerable world which could be exposed at any moment and are much more important than a regular human could ever be, especially the humans weak mindset and opinions of things. Even new vampires show often a cold detachment to the mortal world which they no longer inhabit and the older they get the more dark and cynical they become. Do you think a 100 year old vampire would moan about being politically correct or care about racist human behaviour? no, i dont think so, the same goes for mages.\n\nBoth the main characters in these games have newly discovered their new \"gifts\", but there really is not a whole lot of emphasis on how they deal with it personally completely missing the point of personal horror that the original franchise presented, its about how YOU experience things, how this new world that have opened to you is and how you deal with it and what dangers lurk within it. Mortal politics would rarely and never enter to a big extent because they were useless. Vampires being concerned with the coming Gehenna and the end of all vampires and Mages fighting a losing war with dimensions opening left and right and there is not much they can do to save their dying world. \n\nIn this \"game\" prelude you are dropped into the shoes of two females, little character investment is considered and you are bombared with their opinions and hopeless characteristics with an awfully modern and story driven by mortal politics plaguing the world today, to try to make the world of darkness more modern in tone could not hurt but when you do it in such a wrong way its glaring to look at, especially when the writers they hired have no previous experience in writing this kind of work and have never understood the essence on what the universe itself is about. \n\nI would therefore not recommend this product to a fan or hardcore fan of the world darkness franchise, the vampire nor the mage story adds nothing new and contributes nothing at all to the universe except for poor political statements mixed with poor understanding of an amazing universe.", "recommendationid": "33381441", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499537350, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499532574, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198011786867", "num_games_owned": 294, "playtime_forever": 66}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523097"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1500233034, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a very tentatively positive review, in all honesty. \n\nI rather enjoyed the game for Vampire. Not only did I know of Vampire before, so there was less need for worldbuilding for me, but also the political messages weren't nearly as strong as with Mage. In vampire, you get a student in art school, a couple trans people, and one vampire who kills anyone she deems a douchebag (including but not limited to people who voted for Trump in the American election - it was mentioned in passing, not focused on at all). In the end, if you're used to or enjoy text-based adventure stories, this was pretty good. I wanted more by the end. If you wanted another Bloodlines, though, you'll be vastly disappointed that you'll be playing through choices on your cell phone.\n\nHowever, the Mage story was so politically driven that it was jarring. Unlike Vampire where there are game overs, I believe  Mage truly is choose your own adventure. And while I consider myself rather liberal or left-leaning as a person, the story and your options make anyone to the right of radical feminist feel positively alienated. I guess by the end wanting better security for Sweden made me a bad person. I didn't much care for the magic-centered story either. All around, I don't recommend the Mage half of the story much at all, other than you already have it from buying Vampire, so why not explore what else you bought? \n\nBest case scenario, you recieve this as a gift or catch it during a sale of some kind. I found some good in Vampire and I didn't mind it being text-based. If anything I mentioned seems like a dealbreaker to you, then don't pick it up.", "recommendationid": "33592215", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1500233204, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500232428, "num_reviews": 27, "steamid": "76561198122244584", "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_forever": 236}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502295111, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you like White Wolf and want something fun (and interactive) to read, then this one may be for you.
