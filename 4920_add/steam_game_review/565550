If you get screen flicker go back into the dosbox settings menu (#2 selction from start menu) and select 800x600 resolution. Also- the game comes with the complete CUSS pack!! to install it.. goto\n\n\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Redneck Rampage\\Redneck\\CUSSPACK  \n\nand copy and paste all the files in the cusspack folder 1 level up into the Redneck folder. Next.. under the dosbox settings/sound goto 'sound/Select RTS file' and pick CUSSPACK.RTS.  Thats it!   Also if you want mouse aiming, once in a running game press the U key. if you want WASD movement controls, like modern games, you will need to go back into the dosbox settings menu and make W forward, S backward, Left Strafe A and Right Strafe D. Makes the game soooooo much more enjoyable. :)", "recommendationid": "33443039", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499728162, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503696254, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561197992534243", "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 252}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518242"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 8, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1500335660, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "EDIT: Apparently they increased the price on GOG! It's still cheaper there for the entire collection rather than separately, but now it costs $9.99. Going to leave the original review up.\n\nPlease do not get either steam version of this game. Buy the GOG collection instead.\n\nEven if it runs fine after some tweaking, the fact that they split up the main game and Rides Again into two separate games that cost more for each one individually than the entire GOG collection is ridiculous. You can easily add Rides Again to this, but the fact that they try to trick people into buying a split up version for $10 each is a practice that should not be supported. Spend $5.99 for the GOG version and get the main game (this page) with Rides Again as well as some digital extras as an added bonus.\n\nhttps://www.gog.com/game/redneck_rampage_collection", "recommendationid": "33618900", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505162832, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504905956, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198054155868", "num_games_owned": 851, "playtime_forever": 85}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511751"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504452373, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Redneck rampage is an old school 3d action doom-like game with original atmosphere,places and exceptional difficulty and i like it a lot, but the worst disadvantage is its enormous difficulty of enemies and even some levels which decreases the overall fun.\n\nRating: 80%", "recommendationid": "34714495", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504452373, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504938763, "num_reviews": 47, "steamid": "76561198046734749", "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_forever": 6009}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504384"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 14, "total_reviews": 24, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 10}}
