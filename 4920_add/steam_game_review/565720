It is somewhat simple, and the pictures aren't as graphic as one might fear.  And the game itself is... amusing. Carving out portions of a hidden picture while trying not to be hit by sea creatures (or their shot balls of lights) is an interesting concept (I'm sure there is some game out there that this is based on, but I've never seen it). If you manage to get those sea creatures in one of your cuts (without it touching you or the line) you can remove it. Small power-ups can also be gained by cutting them out, such as a speed one, a ghost one, and one that allows you to freeze the sea creatures.\n\nRather enjoyable, especially for the price of $2.", "recommendationid": "33799311", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501036092, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501036257, "num_reviews": 362, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_games_owned": 445, "playtime_forever": 252}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502238"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1502593054, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's a simple game that encloses the field with lines and acquires the territory.
