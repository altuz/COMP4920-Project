About the graphics, many people think its ugly, but I liked it because its weirdness. The problem is the reload, is a bit confussing but its not a big problem. In conclusion i recommend buying it if you have some extra bucks because it is cheap and worth the price.", "recommendationid": "35163818", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506212167, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 174, "last_played": 1506253782, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198150284356", "num_games_owned": 174, "playtime_forever": 174}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506184817, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's a weird game, but it's very fun to play\n10/10", "recommendationid": "35158271", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506184817, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 81, "last_played": 1506183365, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198137175279", "num_games_owned": 119, "playtime_forever": 81}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506647360, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "DETAILED REVIEW//NO SPOILERS\nTomato way is as silly as it looks. As of recent, there are three episodes and an arena which you can finish in about an hour and thirty minutes. There are english subtitles, however they're spoken in a different language, it doesn't matter though, because there's only about 4-5 dialog parts in the game. (Press ESC to skip cutscenes)\nThey dont recycle monsters as you progress in the game, infact the design of most of the characters in this game are very uniquely done, however theres not much difficulty added to the monsters, they just have a shit ton more health. (Not including the bosses) \nIn all of the maps, there are little details you can often find and take part in, like breaking boxes, or exploring big ass skeletons, and breaking boxes for either powerups, or a random enemy. Yo fuck the checkpoints though, I think it tells you that you've reached a checkpoint where a cutscene of the totato is swinging his massive fork in a line but I dont know, the checkpoints are shite. \n\nPERFORMANCE & GRAPHICS: I cant really speak much for the graphics, they're not that impressive. The game on the other hand runs fine overall, however there are times where your frames will drop beyond the IQ of Nicole Arbor, and you will have to either die or restart the whole level to get them up again. \n\nARENA MODE: It basically presents to you all the monsters you encounter through the game as time goes on, but it gets pretty stale after a while and is fun for about 7-13 minutes. \n\nEpisode 1: This part of the game started it all. You spawn in a flat desert with a building in the middle of it, and when you walk to the end of the map, theres nothing there except a bottomless pit of which if you fall into, you'll have to restart the whole game. From there, you fight four types of disgusting looking enemies as you wander underground the bar, saving the lives of your tomato brothers and sisters, discovering a darker truth along the way.\n\nEpisode 2: This map has the most detail out of either episode, and I really enjoyed exploring the map (except when my frames jumped out of a space ship all the way to the surface of Earth) Its shorter than the first episode, and is basically the same format, go here, then there, kill these guys, and go there, but it doesnt have any feelings of repetition at all. \n\nEpisode 3: Its the final episode, with a very small map, and one tall building that you have to climb. I didnt really have time to see how much detail there was in the building because of annoying and god-awfully soul draining the monsters in episode are. They take your health by the twenties and they take a whole 30 rounds of a machine gun to kill, they're awful. I suggest just running to the end of the map where the extra ammo and supplies are, go back and kill the monsters, and explore the building. When you're finally ready, when you reach the top floor, you'll be experienced with a very weird and confusing boss fight, which essentially all you do is run around in a circle and fire endless amounts of bullets into it.\n\nStatement: its like an acid trip, just go along with it man, its cool. \n\nOverall, the weirdness and uniqueness of the gameplay, maps, and characters you see and meet in the game make up for the lack of exciting story and compelling fights. Its not that difficult of a game, it does have bugs here and there but it is fixable with just a simple death or restart. I thought it was hilarious all the way through, and I think a lot of people will too, however this game is definitely not for everyone. I think the idea or concept the developer had about making this game could be expanded on in a series of comics, a show, or even more games, and I hope to hear more from Tomato Way in the future.", "recommendationid": "35278306", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506647360, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 92, "last_played": 1506561107, "num_reviews": 16, "steamid": "76561198138859511", "num_games_owned": 39, "playtime_forever": 92}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506908925, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is one of those \"so bad it's good\" cringeworthy, B-level indie games with English subtitles (all spoken dialogue is in Ukrainian, I believe), disgusting models, confusing controls, and a bizarre narrative about the misdeeds done to a talking tomato and his family.
