Sadly, most of the player's choices are shallow and don't make much impact on the increasingly linear plot, which erases any potential replay value. I love murder mysteries, but the mystery aspect is pretty much thrown out the window after you hit the midpoint of the story, and replaced by a few unexciting action scenes that lead to a disapointing finale. Based on my experience, the \"killer\" is the same no matter your choices, and your \"skill tree\" and backstory are barely important.\n\nI wouldn't have a problem with the game if it was free, but I don't think it's worth three dollars.

There is one large encounter, and that's about it. I boosted my combat skill twice, only to use it a couple times.\n\n- The magic is terrible. Even having over 50% dedication to magic, my spells only worked once the entire game.\n\n- Many decisions are forced. Either you're stuck with people you don't want to be with, or one mistake you made a while ago causes everyone to hate you for some reason.\n\n- Characters are bland. I had no real attachment to any of them.\n\n- No replay value. The ending is practically the same regardless, so why even bother if I successfully completed the game once?\n\n- The length is way too short. Other, similar games may last me 3-4 hours per novel.

Well, not ALL the audience is underage. If you're not, I'm guessing that qualifies as good).
