It is reminiscent of sokuban & alpha team, but the use of multiple holo-copies of the player with recorded movement is a clever twist.  The graphics are simple, but effective & the sound track is pleasant & atmospheric.  If you like brain-teaser logic puzzles, this should be well worth the low purchase price.  I will be keeping an eye on Tarbutton Studio to see what they come up with next!", "recommendationid": "30072767", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487655346, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487653835, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197991264061", "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 24}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506608"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
