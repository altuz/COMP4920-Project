Puzzles require more timing as opposed to actual problem solving.\n-It has a ton of Steam Achievements (2448 to be exact), and trading cards.\n-Pretty cheap at R12 (~$1), and offers a fair amount of content for the game you are getting.\n\nCons:\n-Achievements pop-ups are so many and so frequent, that you often have to sit and wait before you can see what you need to do.\n-Game itself is relatively short, took me about an hour to finish all the puzzles.\n\nIt's another Zup! game, if you know the series and enjoyed it or are just looking for a minimal little time waster, you'll love this game.\n7/10\n\n[code][h1]Accidently Reviewed[/h1]\nFree Games?
