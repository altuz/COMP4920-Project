Feels very pretentious in the way it's made. I don't mind the easy puzzles and reptitive mechanics as I was looking foward to know more. But in the end, all I've got  it's quotes from Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung, vaguely related in a simplistic way of thinking about creativity. That's all the game.\n\nAnd the final punch, what was that thing about the TV? [spoiler]The narrator says something like \"why you need this to know other ideas when you can reach them on your own?\"[/spoiler] C'mon! You are the one trying to iluminate me through a video game! And after the explanation of all the quotes, one after another, it felt it was like that the typical artsy person lecturing somebody.\n\nI insist, nice atmosphere though. The rest it's very dissapointing.", "recommendationid": "34562500", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503955313, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503954474, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561197981885128", "num_games_owned": 310, "playtime_forever": 55}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512331"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502094377, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game was fantastic!
