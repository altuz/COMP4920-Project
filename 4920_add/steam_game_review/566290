BCInteractive or \u201cBerdyev\u201d (Elusive Team) has made a habit of deleting comments, deleting threads, vote botting, fake users, fake reviews, and removal of review code given to other critics when he didn\u2019t like what they had to say. \n\nIn addition to that, this mimeograph artist has harangued consumers, telling them to kill themselves and referring to them as children whenever someone had something negative to say about his asset flips.\n\nI urge you not to purchase this ripoff artist\u2019s cavalcade of crap as all you are doing is supporting a toxic individual who does not deserve your money or your time and who attempts to profit at your expense without introducing any of his own content. He has done this on a dozen titles on Steam and has made insane amounts of money already.\n\nThe original Unity package can be found here: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/71475\nThe Asset has been discontinued but can be seen here:\nhttps://forum.unity3d.com/threads/vr-pool-sport-starter-pack-will-be-removed-soon.430895/", "recommendationid": "30947637", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1491330677, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491330122, "num_reviews": 174, "steamid": "76561198030863487", "num_games_owned": 427, "playtime_forever": 7}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556359"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 0}}
