The balance of finding points vs answering questions are interesting. The visual approach was better than expected from the screens.\n\nSuggestions: view reset several times in five minutes. It seems to take the forward on load as the forward. Likely would help to only set this on app, not scene load.\n\nThe scoreboard is inaccurate. I'm scoring 15,000 in the game, showing up as 3,000 on the scoreboard. Makes it feel frustrating.\n\nMore questions can help. There are game show question companies that sell these for cheap, which would extend the replayability. In three sessions I saw many repeats.\n\nMaking a note of used questions and hiding them from rotation would be sharp. You mayhave 1,000,000 questions but if I see the same 10 I think it's less.\n\nOverall, expanded my thinking on what a VR quiz coould be.
