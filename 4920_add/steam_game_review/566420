I wouldn't say it's worth the full five bucks yet, but it easily could be [worth more than that] by the time it gets to v1. \n\nSeems to be updated about once a month, most of the complaints in the other posts are no longer applicable. It's not perfect, duh, it's not even v1 yet. I do plan to head over to the Discussions next to express some of my ideas on how to improve it.\n\nI guess everyone likes a procon list, so I'll try one. This is based only on my first playthrough.\nPros:\n-Silly characters\n-Dolphins that aren't bottle-nose dolphins\n-Serious plotline\n-Intuitive control\n-Real kinds of fish!\n-Nice graphics!\n\nCons:\n-I have no idea how many fish this boat can hold\n-The controls take getting used to after Windward & Sunless Sea\n-Bob thinks Mackerel are all over the place\n-Jack wanted a fish that I never found any of\n-Some dialogs (Inn especially) get rather tiresome. Just give me my options already okay?!!?! (there is a key to make this go faster, but clicking constantly is not fun either.)\n\nI guess that's it. I last played yesterday, & so I've slept & worked since then.\n\nETA: I've played a second time now, & almost made 5000 in time. I'm finding that to be more discouraging than the horrible fail of my first playthrough. Here's the insight I've gained:\n- Playing with a PlayStation2 controller on an adapter works, but you'll still need the mouse to see the map.\n- When controlling the boat with your mouse, (Trackball in my case,) don't just left-click, left-hold. But be careful, you'll stop where the cursor last was, not where the boat was when you released the button. I love this control system.", "recommendationid": "32299207", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498596564, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 121, "last_played": 1506545400, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198212093451", "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 706}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 5, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
