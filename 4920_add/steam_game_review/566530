The only down-side is the fact that there isn't really an online community and it is hard to find someone with a VR headset to play against. The graphics are beautiful for what it is and the game can either make you feel larger than life, or as tiny as an ant depending on your playing perspective as either the seeker (VR) or a rogue android (No VR). The view from the seeker perspective is amazing and its hard to describe how many gosh dang androids there are (a **** ton). I personally believe the most fun to be had is on a LAN network with good friends or family and like some commenters, I think it is one of the best asymmetrical VR games out there. Buy it already so i can play!\n\njust an update: There was a recent update that for whatever reason made it very difficult to play as the seeker. The grab and place mechanics are a litte screwy and after finding just one android playing as the seeker, the game is won, which i am not a fan of. seeing as there was an update, I do have faith that some bugs will be worked out.", "recommendationid": "34915718", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505970797, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505981323, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198035654693", "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 154}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1505662192, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "it's a fun game when it works.
