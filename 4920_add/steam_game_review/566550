The game lets you design the rooms and school yourself.\n2. If they change some settings, this game has great potential.\n3. The price.\n\nMinuses:\n1. Even though they've updated to allow deleting of a game, it doesn't work very well. If I name the game the same name, it pulls up the old school. I even named it a different name once and got the last school.\n2. There needs to be some guidelines or something. I can't tell how many blocks are being used as their is no grid showing you what you have and there is no way to edit.\n3. There is no way to edit or move anything once you've approved the placement.\n4. The field wouldn't move to the far side of the lot like I wanted.\n\nAt the moment, I would not recommend.
