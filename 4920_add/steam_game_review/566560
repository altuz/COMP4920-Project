Well, I suppose not. I don't like throwing around accusations of bad hit detection, because that's a very hard claim to legitimately back up, but let me make myself perfectly clear: There are points in this game where you \n\nA. Take damage after your enemy has already fallen. \nB. Before they even swing at you\nC. When they're on a separate plane from you\nD. When there are no enemies in sight at all.\n\nIf you absolutely must play this, I recommended that you try Alexia's story. The other playable character is so brutally, utterly destroyed by his opponents that I cannot fathom anyone having the patience for the second stage. Keep in mind though, that the game is prone to locking up when a stage starts, and you may need to pause/unpause to get it going again.
