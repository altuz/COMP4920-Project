It has tons of potential, lots of replayability, and active devs.  I have one problem, though. Sometimes, when I would put my hands on the board where they should be, the board would rapidly appear and disappear. This happened a bit often and the only way I found so far to fix it is to exit the game and play it again. So far, that is the only bug I've seen.
