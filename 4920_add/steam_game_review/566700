We noticed graphics issues when moving through confined sapces such as tubes but not enough to spoil the game. The puzzles weren't overly challenging, had some nice ah-ha moments and will allow a broad age range to get involved. It's a great concept that uses VR really well. Would love to play more levels, shame the resources aren't there to evolve it further.", "recommendationid": "34872916", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505084668, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505069679, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198072350122", "num_games_owned": 102, "playtime_forever": 165}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 9, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_positive": 9}}
