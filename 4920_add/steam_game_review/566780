There are purely rhythm reflex games like OSU, there are rhythm games which make you feel like you are hitting a drum or playing an instrument in rhythm like Drum Hero or Rockband, there are rhythm games which are simulations like Rocksmith or Drummer Talent VR.  Finally, there's rhythm games like Soundboxing that are about getting a good workout to the beat of the music.  There's probably more types, but you get the idea.  Each rhythm game is going for something a little different.\n\nI would say Beats Fever falls in between the first two I mentioned.  It's not a purely rhythm game and it's not really trying to make you feel like you are playing an instrument.  And it's not a simulation or trying to give you a physical workout. \n However, what the game is doing is putting you in a position to feel the beat of the music without it being too much like banging on drums or banging on a virtual piano.  It's more of a mental workout to see the patterns emerging to the beat.  You start to feel the beat of the music simply by playing along to the audio and visual cues.  Music is sound waves and it is a visual mathematical formula where you can see patterns emerge.  Soon, I was seeing where the next beat would be.  I heard and saw the recurring patterns in the beat for each song and predicted where it would go next.  Not many rhythm games accomplish this.  \n\nSo, these in-game songs are probably nothing I would listen to outside of the game.  But within the game I appreciated the songs fully and it made playing the game that much more immersive and entertaining.  You're not just waving your hands, you're an active participant to the beat.  I strongly recommend this game.  If you love music.  If you love rhythm games that expand your appreciation of music then this is a must buy.  \n\nRating 8/10 (only knock it down because the licensed music is not as strong as it could be, I would love to play this game to some of my favorite songs, I'm all for DLC for popular music tracks)\n[spoiler] Online coop to this game would also be entertaining, imagine having to sync up with another person to get the beats correctly (they could play left hand and you could play right hand .. I think that'd be a lot of fun and a good test for friendship [/spoiler]", "recommendationid": "34985462", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505527191, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1506234238, "num_reviews": 210, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 58}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502113"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505618375, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pros:\nThe hand-mapped patterns are more interesting than the algorithmically generated patterns of many similar games\nBeep Boop is teaching me how to do the robot as a side effect.\nQuick to get in and playing: the interface is minimally designed and doesn't rely on laser pointer selection.\nNo annoying J-Pop filler just to add to the song count (I suppose this could be a con if you're into that type of thing... Just not my preference)\n\nCons:\nMusic selection is limited (though, there IS a free DLC at the time of this writing)\nMusic is not AAA quality; no real ear worms among them\n\nOverall:\nThere's enough selection to keep my attention for about 45 minutes at a time for 3.4 hours so far and I can see myself coming back to Beats Fever again\n\nRecommended: If rhythm games are your jam and you absolutely NEED big name music.", "recommendationid": "35012954", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505618375, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505617507, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561197992765887", "num_games_owned": 1259, "playtime_forever": 202}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505971189, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So I used to play a lot of Dance Dance Revolution when I was younger, but since I was always a big guy the feet movements weren't as easy for me.  I could only get an A on 7 foot or below ;P  But then I found the Dance Maniax game(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Maniax) in the arcade at the mall I worked at and fell in love.  My hand motion has always been better than my footwork.  I played this game on my lunch break every day, and ended up being the top 10 high scores all by myself.  I also ended up losing about 50lbs due to all of the excercise.\n\nI have beeen working to recreate that experience for the past 10 years.  I've even been looking for an affordable old arcade unit to put in my garage.  This game does that and so much more!  I look forward to trying to S every level on here, and hopefully get in better shape in the process!  \n\nI realyl hope this isn't a one and done thing, and that you guys plan on releasing more songs, because I am afraid that I will get tired of the same songs over and over.  But for now this game is exactly what I have been looking for for years, and I'm just amazed that you managed to almost perfectly capture what I see in my head when I'm dancing!", "recommendationid": "35097944", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505971189, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 112, "last_played": 1506890411, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197989059409", "num_games_owned": 334, "playtime_forever": 136}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 23, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 19}}
