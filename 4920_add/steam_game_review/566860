It's like a bunch of the other games combined into a dungeon crawler. The only game I have that makes me feel like I actually travel somewhere, instead of just taking elevators or standing in a roomscale area. \n\nRanged combat: Bow, crossbows, pistols. Each has its own style but all are fun to use.\n\nMelee combat: One handed, two handed, shield, dual wield. Pick your poison and get up close and personal.\n\nMagic combat: Staff or spellbooks. These are fun but you need to use them wisely.\n\nExploration: This one was the wildcard I didn't expect. Climb ivy up the walls and onto ceilings to find hidden gold or xp books. Find gold under tables and benches, behind bookcases and up on rafters. Use these to get a better position in a fight or avoid fights.\n\nStealth: Also unexpected. It was so intuitive, just crouch and suddenly you're harder to spot. Sneak up on or sneak around enemies. Warning: crouching through an entire dungeon can be exhausting.\n\nContinued Support: I thought I was late to the party on this game, and yet as I opened the door to the next room I was shocked to find myself in a village instead of a dark corridor. Suddenly there was plenty of room for enemies to try and flank me, for me to sneak around patrols and for me to sprint from one enemy to the next, hacking away. Updates are still coming and they are pretty significant. The developer listens to the community and does great work. \n\nConclusion: I think this game is well worth the money. I think this game is the standard others should be held up to. There is great use of the VR gear and there's a lot of stuff to keep you coming back for more. If you want an action rpg for the Vive, this is the game for you.", "recommendationid": "35078317", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505886844, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 50, "last_played": 1506306536, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198025287840", "num_games_owned": 191, "playtime_forever": 300}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505716366, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is definitely one of the better VR experiences, with special props for being a bit open-ended and lengthy in scope, a quite uncommon trait for VR games. It's still a little rough around the edges, but I didn't feel like I was paying a big VR tax for what I got (20$ at the time of writing).\n\nI played this on Oculus Touch, entirely with teleportation locomotion and extensive use of snap-turning since I am not really set up for or comfortable with roomscale or smooth motion, but I still had a lot of immersive experiences. Trodding through a dark dungeon, looking out for loot and ambushing enemies, clambering up and around hanging vines (this type of motion didn't bother me), crouching  or (very rarely) going prone so I could transport through tight spaces, it gives a strong feeling of exploration.\n\nSome caveats is I would say people with mobility issues could have trouble exploring every nook and cranny of the game or to just sneak around (the dev has stated they are looking to implement crouch-height adjustment options), but mere lack of fitness is no obstacle. I'm in terrible shape, and though I struggled a bit with an optional sub-dungeon where going fully prone was necessary (made all the more difficult by my less-than-perfect sensor coverage near the floor) I was able to make it through nonetheless, and the regular procedurally-generated dungeons have never required anything more difficult than crouching.\n\nThe difficulty curve can also be a little unpredictable. Some of the traps and terrain would be very difficult to traverse with 'arm swinger' or other smooth locomotion, but relatively easy with careful use of teleportation. Melee enemies are generally very easy except for one particularly stealthy / quick type, while ranged enemies are very deadly especially for the unprepared.\n\nI haven't made time to play any VR games in a few weeks so I haven't tried the latest build that came out Sept 15th (I don't make much time to game at all these days), but VR Dungeon Knight is one of the titles I'd like to make more time for. They've added more rooms to explore and more gear to unlock, both things I would consider to be valuable content. Variety is already a strongpoint for this game compared to other VR titles.\n\nI notice a lot in a lot of VR games, people have quite short hours played, and I'm definitely part of that trend. Sometimes it is due to a lack of longevity in gameplay, but I think with this game it's a factor of how the VR experience is processed. Something about it being a bit new, and also a bit strenuous, is that short play sessions feel longer and more satisfying than the kind of games I'm used to. I can hit the 5 hour mark in a traditional CRPG easily even if I'm not enjoying it, I can hit the double digits with no sweat in a strategy game I don't care for, but somehow with a VR title I love I'll play maybe an hour a day and feel that's quite sufficient. It also feels like a bigger commitment of energy and enthusiasm just getting in the mindset of booting up an active VR experience, which is probably why I've spent so little time in Robo Recall, Star Trek: Bridge Crew, H3VR, etc, even though my experience in those games and this one are definitely positive.

If you liked Vanishing Realms and visit their store page from time to time hoping for a new chapter, then this game is for you.  So far, I have only played a couple of regular dungeons and I have not tried co-op yet though the graphics are quite good and if they were any more realistic, it might become too scary, because actually can get scary crawling and climbing through these dungeons in the dark.  The weapons work well and the spell casting system is easy to use.  You have tons of melee and ranged options from carrying two pirate pistols to crossbows, bow and arrow, swords, maces, shields etc.  While at the beggining the Warrior class and meele seems like the easiest way to complete a dugeon, I personally prefer the ranger and the bow works great and causes a whole lot of damage.  \nPros: \nEver changing and challenging dungeons to explore\nThe climbing system to get over obstacles is extremely well done\nGraphics \nSound quality and voice over \nAmbiance \nChoice of Locomotion \u2013 onward format, arm swinging, teleport \nWeapon placement has been improved and not clunky any more \n\nCons/suggestions:\nIn the multiplayer room, allowing one to keep the pre-configured weapons while waiting and practicing on the spawns.  \nThe grip for the shoulder if the area that counts as one grabbing (for example an arrow) could be widened it would be great.
