I hope to see more content in the future but this has got a big thumbs up from me.  \n\nGame plays alot like playing old school Rampage in VR.  Buildings and cars to smash and throw around, people to eat.  Tanks and helicopters come to attack you, and will kill you if you dont deal with them. \n\nThe boss fight was unexpected and very cool!  Using room scale to try to defend and counterattack the tank was great fun.  I even got top spot on the leaderboard.\n\nI made a video of my gameplay if you want to see how it plays.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/G7zApOzXnJ8\n\nWishlist\nMore levels\nMore bosses\nMore explosions haha (gas station?)\n", "recommendationid": "31251846", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492677557, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492924126, "num_reviews": 39, "steamid": "76561198091573845", "num_games_owned": 929, "playtime_forever": 26}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504814"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 8, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1498234474, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Q: When does looking like an idiot and screaming like a monster become something a grown man does?\n A: When playing this game. \nThis game, while lacking in length of game play, is still fun as heck!
