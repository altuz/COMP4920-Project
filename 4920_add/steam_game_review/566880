I got it on sale, you should too.[/i] It's too well formed a title to give it a negative rating, but you may or may not like it. It's cute, and it has a nice intro scene. It's premium standing-only game play. You have to lead the hamsters to their safety through a serious of levels. You press buttons and pull leavers in an attempt to make sure they don't die. You only get one hand to do it with! The other is a hook, and you can use it to kill the hamsters, so be careful. It's good, but put it in your list of things to pick up when it goes on sale, and when you've played all the other good stuff first. [spoiler]I had a hamster once, name was Dr. Shiela Hutchinson, and she had her own Habitrail and such. Russian barn mouse, or something like that. She cost 3 dollars less than this game. I don't think she liked me :([/spoiler] http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1102008518", "recommendationid": "34758825", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504625428, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501990827, "num_reviews": 236, "steamid": "76561197961017729", "num_games_owned": 2716, "playtime_forever": 249}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.354997"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 12, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 11}}
