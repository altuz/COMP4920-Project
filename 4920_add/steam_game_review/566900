The graphics are limited to an old Atari style presentation, but with the modern flash and smooth animation of VR.  The simplicity of it has you flying fast automatically while you try and stay airborne by hitting fuel signs in a constantly depleted fuel situation, all the while avoiding collision with the obstacles in your path, and collecting coins all the while.  40 levels are passable with bronze and silver medals coming with ease, but gold medals require a large portion of coins being captured and you need all 40 gold in the 40 levels(10 sets of 4 common themed maps) in order to advance to the 2nd thrid of this game.  \n\nThe 2nd area is blitz mode, giving a black and white WWII style rainy night over london firefighting.  You must shoot down 40 planes, all the while collecting the fuel they leave behind when destroyed.  It took a while before I finally jumped all thw way to 59.  Before that I had reached 30 once followed by a heartbreaking 39 and then many more trys before I blasted on through this section.  \n\nFinally comes endless mode, a short, fuel heavy replay of all the standard maps, connected indefinitely while you fly through the sun cycles of dawn to day to dusk to night and back to dawn again.  You hear the cheers that ended levels before but do not stop.  Actually you speed up just a tad with each segment of the sewed together endless stream and a nice arcade music track plays, speeding up in sync with the increase of your flight speed as you hold on and build up as much speed as you can surive past.  \n\nPlatinum medals are bonus skins for the many different flyers you unlock.  Besides comsmetic value there is one difference that really adds up over time and that is the tight quickness each new vehicle increases in handling.  This allows you to try tighter, more aggressive cuts and cross over manuevers.  I still have 3 to unlock still.  \n\n\nThis game is so worth the incredibly low price.  \n\nP.S.  I had a couple of problems a few months back due to bugs.  The developers jumped right on it and patched it while thanking me for helping them discoverr a bug.  I was impressed with their professional response.", "recommendationid": "34986989", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505533893, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 75, "last_played": 1506740466, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198058085314", "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 1118}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506231235, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great arcade VR title that is casual to play yet offers that slight challenge that makes it addictive and fun.\n\nFly your wings through each level dodging the obstacles in your path while also collecting fuel to stop yourself from crashing down. Simultaneously try to collect the coins to earn yourself higher grade medals which unlock different novelty wings and skins [i](Dragons, Brooms, Drones, UFOs etc.)[/i]. The levels are randomly generated which offers the challenge by putting your reflexes to the test and each world provides new environments, obstacles, soundtracks, and day and night cycles. [i](Worlds: Country, Snow, Sea, Desert, Cavern, City, Volcano, Toy, Space)[/i]. There is also the option to fly in 1st or 3rd person mode which can be activated via controller during gameplay.\n\nAfter the campaign there is the added bonus of blitz mode which is practically a new game itself. Set in WW2 in a vintage black and white atmosphere you must use new controls to shoot down enemy planes to gain fuel for as long as you can.\n\nYou're rewarded once again after blitz mode with the added bonus of endless mode (I love this one). This mode features all the campaign world levels in an infinite cycle but as you progress dodging obstacles the speed increases infinitely also, making it become hectic really quick. The tempo of the soundtrack also increases with the speed which adds to the fun! \n\nOverall great value with lots of detail and rewards for gameplay!", "recommendationid": "35171602", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506313932, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1506671586, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198090026018", "num_games_owned": 259, "playtime_forever": 251}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 8, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_positive": 8}}
