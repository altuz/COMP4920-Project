The setting is pirate themed.  One of the birds even has an eyepatch!  The \"choose a level\" screen is a pirate map.\n\nFor those who haven't played the first game, here's the basics on gameplay.  The beginning levels do a great job of introducing one element of gameplay at a time, so the player doesn'' get overwhelmed all at once.  Gameplay is Turn-Based.  There is no enemy, you are playing against yourself and time.  After each turn you make, eggs will drop onto the grid and hatch in a turn or two unless you place an object on it.  You play by clicking on an object (bird, key, bomb, etc) and holding the click button drag the object where you want it to go and release button to drop it.  Drag a bird next to two birds all of the same color and they will fly off the screen (leaving the grid squares they were on empty).  Get rid of cats by having two or more of the same color bird surround a cat, and they will fly away with it.  Later levels introduce heavier cats which take more birds to fly them.  \n\nEach level has some goals if you want to get a silver or gold rating on that level.  In the first game the object was to free the caged eggs that were stolen by the cats.  In this one you have to open treasure chests and get coins (booty!).  Optional goals can be stuff like:  \"do it in X number of turns\" or \"clear 75% of the board before opening all the chests\" or \"bomb all the barrels\".  These are optional but add a nice extra purpose to the gameplay, at least for me!  I just wish the game had achievements.  \n\n\ntl;dr version:\n\nTurn-Based Strategy Puzzle Game (later levels get very difficult)\nCute Cartoony Graphics and sounds\nFunny dialogue (some story but not heavy--focus of game is on gameplay strategy)\nCan Repeat Levels to get better score\nNo Achievements :-(", "recommendationid": "28351332", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1481668862, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488765061, "num_reviews": 59, "steamid": "76561198064050389", "num_games_owned": 3500, "playtime_forever": 820}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528763"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1499490419, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fun and addicting match 3 game with plenty of variation which requires some thinking and strategy unlike most other similar games.
