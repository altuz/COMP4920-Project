Das Spiel schwankt bei mir zwischen positiv und negativ, ich kann beide Seiten verstehen. Es ist f\u00fcr 5 Euro gerade bei der heutigen Konkurrenz zu teuer. 1,99 oder 2,99 h\u00e4tte ich noch verstanden. Allerdings finde ich den Stil und die ganzen Anspielungen so gut, das ich es nicht negativ bewerten kann. Es ist also eine eingeschr\u00e4nkte Empfehlung, wer ein langes Spiel erwartet wird hier schwer entt\u00e4uscht, wer aber gerne \u00fcber Gags auf Neomagazin Niveau lachen will (also \u00fcber sehr sehr guten Pipi Kacka Humor) wird hier f\u00fcr eine gute Stunde sehr gut unterhalten.

I've played a lot of imports so i am used to figuring out game menus, etc. That being said, English and German are very similar so understanding the gist of whats going on will be easy enough. Most of the jokes are puns, and some are even in english. Navigating the game is super easy to those familiar with point-n-click games (try every item on every object/ talk to every character twice, etc) will be able to fumble through most of it with out consulting a walk-thru/youtube playthrough.\n\n That being said there is a FREE game (the 1st Game Royale) on the company's website (click the link at the top of the page, then scroll down to choose the platform to download it for)... This game is also in German only, so you will be able to play through to see what you are basically getting into.\n\n Using the Google Translate app for your phone (in audio mode) will help translate the jokes, and spoken word. and there is a visual camera mode that will translate onscreen text.\n\n\n As far as is the game worth $5 ? Well.... its good if you're thirsty for a point-n-click that is fresh and new, but the game is obscenely short. it only took me so long because the save feature is buggy and sometimes doesn't work (on the MAC version ), well that and i don't spreken zie dutcsh. but in actuality the game could be played through in less than 30 minutes. from start to finish there are maybe 12 puzzles to solve.\n\n Graphics - Classic, VERY believable as a 90's style game\n\nSound - spoken voice through out makes the game feel complete, and adds extra humor. the music is charming and not overdone/repetative\n\n\n\n in closing, HEADUP GAMES please make an English subtitle option~!!!", "recommendationid": "30300990", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488571651, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488569750, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197962348121", "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 327}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504775"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1483184642, "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Best...Game...Ever", "recommendationid": "28865568", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1483184642, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485109058, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198042648058", "num_games_owned": 338, "playtime_forever": 26}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493224"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1498573349, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a game for fans of the german Late Night Show \"neo magazin royale\".
