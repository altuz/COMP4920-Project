Original review was posted on the 10th of December  2016 a day after games release)\n\nTILE is a minimalistic number-tile puzzle game where the objective is to arrange the tiles in ascending number order.\n\nPros:\n-Simple, easy to play\n-Puzzles are okay, and offer some challenge\n\nCons:\n-No functionality with regards to resetting the puzzles, going back to menu, or exiting the game.\n-The tiles will sometimes bounce after clicking them to move, which can be frustrating.\n-One of the levels is currently unbeatable in episode one, hindering progress\n-The future episodes which were promised have never arrived, close to 3 months after release date\n\nHonestly, I had high hopes for this little game, but the developer has abandoned it. Not worth going into.\n2/10", "recommendationid": "28290135", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487706090, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487705795, "num_reviews": 223, "steamid": "76561198130516505", "num_games_owned": 1102, "playtime_forever": 78}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503473"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 0}}
