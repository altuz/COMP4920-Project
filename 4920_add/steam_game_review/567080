However, the ideas of the game are solid and the game really has great potential.  I have to compliment the developers, I have never seen so much feedback and openness to good ideas.  This game really is going to be good.\n\nThink of it as a cross between Heros and Civilization with quests thrown in for a little spice.\n\nIf you have not played a game under development, please wait.  If you enjoy helping make a good game even better, jump in now, the dungeon's fine!", "recommendationid": "34554798", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503932287, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2513, "last_played": 1507207299, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198069355891", "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_forever": 15476}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_positive": 7}}
