The only graphics they might have made are the sprites that stand out from the rest because of their poor quality. I can't tell anyone what to and not to purchase, however this is one of the \"very\" few game purchases I regret.

Or at least even fun... but alas, it is not.... \nThe controls are clunky and slow. The combat system sucks, it's weird and its nearly impossible to avoid being hit, and hard to hit the enemy. Theres really nothing to motivate the player to search around or proceed, because the environment and gameplay just feels empty and bland...\nMonters will still attack you if they have aggro on you, even when dialogue pops up (e.x: turning in quest- which happens by walking up to the npc after completing the objectives) the creatures will still be attacking and hurting you. So, you're forced to hopefully skip the dialogue fast enough to kill them, therefore, effectively missing any part of the story you may have wanted to know, or... well, die. You don't get to speak to them again. Its just bad...
