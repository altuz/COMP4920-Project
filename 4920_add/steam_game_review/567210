Bunnyrama is the second game I've encounterd in a couple of years that look all nice and cuddly, while being a relentless sadist of a puzzle game in its heart. Could I call this a new sub-genre? :)\nWhile the level design is not as consistently evolving as it was in Snakebird, the second part of the second episode and the first part of the third episode are very good puzzles indeed, What do you do? Well, you simply stack carrots, boulders, and of course, bunnies to overcome obstacles and make it to the exit. Simple and carefully evolving mechanic, tough puzzles - that's what's it all about. Level design does fall off a bit towards the end of the third episode, and the bonus levels are also hit and miss, but altogether, mazochistic fans of puzzle games should be pleased.
