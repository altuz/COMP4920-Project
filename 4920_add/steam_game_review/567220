I get \"This War of Mine\" vibes, which is the main reason I bought this.  The soundtrack is decent, and the story seems interesting.\n\nNow the bad: \nVoice acting is poor and you hear the same phrases uttered over and over again every-time an enemy enters the screen.  When an enemy does enter the screen, there is a pretty good chance they will shoot you before you can react.  I understand this is a side scroller, but not a whole lot of warning before you get lazered from an enemies assault rifle.  Glitches are rampant.  Enemies will try and shoot you through the floor, you character can get stuck in the crouching animation, the shotgun does not seem to work at all, hit detection is very bad, and you character will get stuck trying to jump over objects.  And all of that was discovered with me playing the game under 15 minutes.\n\nAll in all, I recommend a hard pass until the Devs can push some updates to fix the issues plaguing this game.", "recommendationid": "31812386", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1495058337, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495057697, "num_reviews": 76, "steamid": "76561197984712587", "num_games_owned": 168, "playtime_forever": 15}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506012"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1497229720, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Maybe it's not the best side scroller that I've played, but it's a good one.\n\n+ Graphics (I like the art very much)\n+ Music (great background - not aggressive, quite kind for the ears)\n+ Gameplay (Yeah! There are some bugs - like getting stuck in a car, because you jumped or didn't jump in the right moment, but it's not that often)\n+ Sounds (If an enemy walking from the left - you can hear him on the left.
