The visuals are greatly improved since the Dark Flight, the Soundtrack and the atmosphere are brilliant, like in the first two episodes! The puzzles are challenging, but fun! In the \"Extras\" menu we got in-game achievements, wallpapers, soundtrack, etc. I can only recommend this masterpiece!", "recommendationid": "29958468", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487246320, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487432863, "num_reviews": 47, "steamid": "76561198019458917", "num_games_owned": 128, "playtime_forever": 252}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539390"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
