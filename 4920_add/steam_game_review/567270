Split infinitives, redundancy and odd word choices were really distracting from an otherwise amazing game. \"Accept your faith\"... wut? Are you sure you don't mean \"Accept your FATE?\" The environments gave me chills; they are expansive and alternated between making me feel claustrophobic and exposed. The ambient effects kept me on my toes and the ambent sounds were creepy. Some of the player effects were awkward, but they were easy to distinguish from ambient sounds. The monsters were not totally inventive, but very scary. The pace of the game was slow at times and generated good jump scares. The puzzles were fairly straightforward.\n\nTL;DR It's worth every penny. I can't wait to see the finished product.", "recommendationid": "33928918", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501512498, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501640696, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198044867862", "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_forever": 235}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516359"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 27, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 22}}
