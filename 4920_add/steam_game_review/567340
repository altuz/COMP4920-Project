BUT!!! It's one of the few good ones!\n\nBetween 10 and 20hrs depending on your pace and your interest for completion, this game involves a group of adventuring friends in the form of cute-looking sprites, a balanced group, spells you can teach any of your mage-wielding characters and skills that depend on what weapon your warrior has equipped. \n\nA simple, straight-forward and yet entertaining story easy to follow with a journal to check if you forget where you're at. It also involves backtracking after acquiring certain items so you can open areas you couldn't the first time you visited a dungeon. But the world in this game is somewhat small, so easy to revisit everything over and over once cleared if you can't remember where was that ONE place! The monsters don't respawn once killed in dungeons, and the ones on the map quickly become too weak and easily avoidable or escapable from.\n\nA bunch of sidequests, easy to spot with \"?\" over NPCs heads, but the one downside is there is no list of sidequests in your menu, so either take notes, or only pick them one at a time so you don't forget where you're supposed to go. But that's a minor inconvenience because any new area reachable by obtaining a sidequest becomes marked on the world map (meaning when you're outside, you can see an arrow over a cave or a forest entrance. You don't have a map key item)\n\nThe community for this game is surprisingly small but the developers are ready to answer any questions you might have.\n\nTL;DR\nFor the price, this game is very much worth it. I have unfortunately seen worse for more than this.\n\nDid I mention there are [b]VERY FEW TYPOS[/b] in this game??? Typos are an eyesore for me and these games usually have a lot. But not this one! A few minor ones, which makes this game all the more enjoyable and cringing-free (at least for me!)\n\nThis is my first review, and this game deserves it.", "recommendationid": "34989195", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505543857, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505071847, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198056067433", "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_forever": 977}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505180919, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A really fun and cute RPG.

This game is one of my favorite RPGs (closely tied with Skyborn). The story is unique and fun, I love the characters quirks. Sometimes RPGs can feel a little cut/paste but this one is different. There is no walk-through but if you get stuck there is a great discussion board and if you encounter any technical problems the games team is ON TOP of things. I would post a problem and would not have to wait long for help.
