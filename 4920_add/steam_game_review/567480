[/b]\n\nFirstly I want to say that I  sincerely love survival horror. Games like System Shock 2, Dead space and others have a special place in my heart, and will for years to come. When I saw HEPH appear in my Steam carousel - I was excited. Weapon crafting? Monsters in space? Mysterious atmosphere? Sign me up!\n\nFirstly I understand this is an indie title,  but I am going to rate this game at the suggested price of 15 dollars.\n\n[u] Lets get the good things out of the way \t[/u]\n\n[list]\n    [*]The game has a cool space horror aesthetic\n    [*]The guns (the ones I crafted) seem neat, and they do remind me of Dead Space quite a bit.\n    [*]The monster animations I saw looked pretty cool!\n[/list]\n\n[u] Now for the unfortunate parts \t[/u]\n\n[list]\n    [*] The ship is a little lackluster. Not a big deal. This is my smallest complaint.\n    [*] Poor conveyance: Everyone will get stuck in the first room for about 15-20 minutes. You will also spend about 15 minutes fiddling with the menu system, just trying to make sense of it. There were things happening on the ship and so little of it was clear what was supposed to happen! I saw a panel 'explode'. (and i mean a pretty bad flame poof spawned on it). Then I repaired it. Why? I controlled a turret at one point and blew up two hovering ships. I'm not sure what this did. None of it reall ymade sense or had clarity.\n    [*] UI glitching. As a programmer I can identify a few things. There is an issue with the menu overlays. They are stylizedd and all, but the hover handlers will often leave orphaned views. Sometimes closing a menu will leave the mouse behind. Opening and closing the menu is really very frustraing andd prone to error. This woulddnt be so bad except the game has you doing this constantly\n    [*] Bounded mouse errors. Actually in general play control is super rough! theres some clunkiness between the menu system and just general mobility.\n    [*] Clipping/ Poly problems. There's a 'gun' that lets you break down stuff on the ship into materials. All the materials are the uninteresting cubes, but sometimes they get stuck in walls, or you get stuck on furniture. Its pretty bad.\n    [*] The inventory is frustrating. Basically the biggest obstacle in this game, ven more than the monsters or slowly decomposing ship, is the fact that your character can only carry a few things at once, and must constantly jog between rooms andd these 'crafting stations' to build stuff. See the previous comments about the menu system of course, but your worst enemy shouldnt be the fact that your character cant carry a box. It just made the game feel tedious. this was even worse when to simply make a gun and ammo you had to gather all these items over multiple trips. I finally made some ammo, and an assult rifle.. and absolutly unloaded into this eye-creature.. but it did not good. The only legitimate tactic was to run around like an idiot and just run past monsters! I spend most of the game with no ammo, just running amok.\n     [*] Lack of polish on audio. This one really stuck out. firstly, these sounds happen on the ship for no clear reason at all. Someites I exit a door, and this 'spooky music plays' only to have the waveform be sudddenly truncated, and it was never clear *why* that sound played to begin with. \n     [*] The over the sholder view just needs polish.  In dead space, the over the shoulder view didn't feel forced. Your character was a lot smaller, for one, but in addition to that your spine conveyed information about your health. In this game it just feels like your character is very large, and obstructs your vision.\n    [*] Performanc was adequate, but felt very unoptimized. I got a lot of stuttering. I am running dual GTX 780s in SLI on a 1440o monitor and I averaged 15-30FPS with occasionaly 45. The game needs to be improved here.\n[/list]\n\nSo lets put it all together. In short this game was truly a dissapointment. I'm likely going to uninstall it, and forget about it. The UI is clunky, the aiming is clunky. The inventory management is un-fun and tedious. the audio feels unpolished and haphazard. I also noticed parts in the map where I could see clear seams and the space skybox visible through them. The first 'control room' you go into back up and look at the ceiling from every angle, and there is the red nebula peeking through.\n\nI know this is an indie title, and in many ways its ambitious. It has some moments of visual engagement, but overall the problems grealy outshine th pros. I expected more for 15 dollars. This feels like a 5 dollar game at best. It feels like an unfinished Unity 3d concept game.\n\nAs someone that loves ths genre and is truly forgiving of indie games, there comes a threshold you cross when the  game really is 'that bad'.\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Art[/th]\n        [th]6/10[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Sound[/td]\n        [td]3/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]0/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]UX, Conveyance[/td]\n        [td]0/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Performance[/td]\n        [td]5/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nI simply cannot recommend this game. Do not buy it, it is not worth it. There are games in early access that greatly exceed this in quality. This game is worth 5 bucks tops.\n\nEdit: Also the achievements clearly do not work! I clearly recall crafting my first keycard. I also used the isolator as well.

Needs a fair bit of work and some TLC though.\nFrame rate issues are present on high settings, but on medium or low its very smooth and rock solid at 60 fps / 1080p.\nDevelopers are not native English speakers I would assume, so some of the text is in broken English. \nLack of a proper manual, guide, or any form of real gameplay documentation can quickly lead to frustation if the player is not familiar with survival style games. \nCrafting system is awkward but passable and has quite a few bits to make.\nCamera placement is extremely \"tight\" on the player character and offers a limited field of view.\nNo real narrative, or in game storyline content. Its pretty much text based only.\n\nScore 6/10\n\nCheap, just passable, and kinda wonky. Devs seem dedicated though, so here's hoping it improves somewhat.\nOnly really recommended for people who want a cheap game, and dont mind indie products.\n\n", "recommendationid": "29512289", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485479248, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487946542, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561197983722586", "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_forever": 53}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518584"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504498828, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "\u0e23\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e27\u0e43\u0e19\u0e10\u0e32\u0e19\u0e30\u0e04\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e19\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\n\n\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e08\u0e31\u0e14\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e17\u0e33\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e14\u0e35\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e43\u0e19\u0e23\u0e30\u0e14\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e2d\u0e43\u0e08\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a \u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e22 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e32\u0e1f\u0e34\u0e04\u0e42\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e04 \u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e40\u0e01\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e35\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48 100% \u0e2d\u0e34\u0e19\u0e40\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e1f\u0e2a\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e19\u0e40\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e1a\u0e39\u0e23\u0e13\u0e4c\n\n\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e16\u0e49\u0e32\u0e04\u0e34\u0e14\u0e08\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e38\u0e14\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e38\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e04\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e19\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a \u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e43\u0e19\u0e23\u0e30\u0e14\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e0b\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22 \u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e14\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e07\u0e34\u0e19\n\n\u0e22\u0e01\u0e40\u0e27\u0e49\u0e19\u0e04\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e46 \u0e40\u0e17\u0e35\u0e22\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e01 \u0e2d\u0e32\u0e08\u0e08\u0e30\u0e1c\u0e34\u0e14\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e07\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22\u0e40\u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e21\u0e32\u0e17\u0e33\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e40\u0e25\u0e27", "recommendationid": "34727320", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504498828, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504428386, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198168283145", "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 72}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498963"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
