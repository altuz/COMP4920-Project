You can beat the game and get all 128 achievments complete in about 4hrs taking my time at it. I got it on sale for like 89 cent, so i got my money's worth out of it. \nRecommended? Sure but only if you want a short pass time, because that is all you will get. No story just gameplay. Which I will add isn't hard. Easily mastered and enemies are very easily predicted, both on movments and fireing.\n\nGrab it on sale like myself, doubt you will get $3 worth of game here.

You play as a lone fighter working your way through hordes of enemy fighters and bosses. The game is relatively simple to grasp. Since this isn't the Japanese-styled bullet hell shooter or arcade variants, your ship can take quite a lot of hits before exploding. The controls are smooth; not clunky and respond quickly to button-pushes. The graphics are decent, although at times, the enemies look like toys to me. The music is good; not annoying and adds flavour to your playthrough. Presence of upgrades to further improve your ship adds further zest to the game and the myriad of weapons allows you room to pick and choose what you want to decimate your enemies with. Achievements are relatively easy to obtain 100%; simply playing the campaign itself will net you a ton of them. The only flaw I can see in this game is the lack of challenge and its repetitiveness. Perhaps it's by the developer's goal to let the players have lots of fun killing many things at once that the difficulty of the game is ramped down so low. Also, the game does get very repetitive after an hour or two, so I wouldn't recommend playing this long-haul. Not a bad pick for its price.
