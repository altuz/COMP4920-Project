Overall, I haven't been disappointed. The story so far is just as good as the first two, and the class trial introduces some really interesting new mechanics. However, I can't recommend this game as it is currently. It suffers from several flaws that make it frustrating to play. First, tutorials automatically default to console controllers when explaining controls. You have to open the configuration tool to change this, and it can't be done in-game. This is a minor point, but it was still kind of frustrating. Second, the controls aren't always responsive on keyboard. It can sometimes take several hits of a button to accomplish anything, especially during class trials. This is frustrating since you have a time limit in those sections. Finally, it appears if you exit out of a class trial, there's a chance that the background art will simply be a solid black screen when you load back in. The text is still visible, but no art will be there. Unfortunately, I only had one save file, which mean's I'll have to start an entirely new game, as uninstalling and reinstalling didn't work.

I prefer the Japanese dub because I'm a filthy weeb, but from the clips I've seen, the English dub is pretty good, too!

Like, audio desync during cutscenes, unresponsive KB+M controls, lag, etc. But, one of the biggest problems that a lot of people seem to be having is that, during the minigames, the A and S keys are swaped. So, when the game tells you to press A you really have to press S and vice-versa. However, to my surprise, I do not have this problem. Maybe I'm just lucky. But, unfortunately, it does seem like a common problem so hopefully it gets patched. \n[*]I hate that fucking Death Road of Despair platformer game. It's [i]REALLY[/i] difficult with a keyboard {although, I'm  unsure if it's any easier with a controller.) In my opinion, it's not even a \"fun\" kind of difficult.

The game mechanics, premise and style hit all the right notes for me. Yes, it is very niche, but it is a niche that I adore.\n\nDanganronpa V3 manages to do the same again. If you are one who gets easily bored and you only liked the past games because the premise was new, then you will probably be winding down in this game finding the moment to moment stuff a bit tedious. But not me, no, sure the free time events can be a bit tedious, but it is the in between dialogue that builds up the characters and story that really leave an impact come the class trial.\n\nMost of the game is great. It does what it does best and provides not only some of the best punishments in the game's history, but also some new class trial minigames to spice things up (one of which is lackluster, but the others are very enjoyable). The characters are strong, the banter is still funny and enjoyable (though perhaps not quite up to the level of DR 2) and the mystery solving is still engaging. Heck, even the Monokubs kinda grew on me after a bit.\n\nSo why is this review a downvote? Well, the ending is bad. Not just \"Oh man I was expecting something more.\" bad but rather the kind of bad that taints my memories of the entire rest of the game bad. I found myself having new favorite characters, new favorite punishments, new favorite twists and new favorite class trials. But when the ending rolled around it all started to collapse around me, and suddenly my connection and feelings towards these things started to fizzle.\n\nLet me be fair. It is still an amazing game up to a certain point. Some like the ending, some don't. I don't, and it actually makes me wish I stopped playing the game before I started the final chapter. Everything in this game works (even if some parts may be weaker than its predecessors) except the ending. If you love Danganronpa as much as I do, you should buy this game.
