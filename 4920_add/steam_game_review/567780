The difficulty curve is not a curve, but a cliff.\n\nEverything happens at the same time and needs your undivided attention: Building broken? Fix it soon, or it'll break(Which takes up valueable space for the rest of the game). Comm Tower broken? If your comm link breaks, a part of your planet won't be defended! Everything wants your attention, all at the same time. \n\nYou get no breathing room, which adds to the challenge, but also punished mistakes with even a hint of mercy. This shouldn't always be a problem, but I get the feeling I lose more time fighting against the game. I also think a \"casual\" game shouldn't be this stressful.\n\nBuilding a satellite requires you to spend a lot of time in the (awful) UI, just to select the right satellite and modules. Selected the wrong one? There's no way to cancel production. There's not even a way to remove an item from your inventory, other than placing it. There are no hotkeys, and why can't we press enter to add something to the queue?\n\nBy the time you ordered your first sat+modules, they are constructed, you flew up, put the sat down, docked, put all the modules in(Press the number, then press e, press the number... etc etc) and got down, you're already (at least) a minute into the game. 2 minutes into, the first wave starts. If you spend those 2 minutes putting down sats, bad luck: Half of your planet doesn't even have comms! If you spent that time building comms, back luck: You don't have any radar! It also raises the question: Why don't we have simple ground-based radar?\n\nThe amount of micromanagement is too high. Every sat needs modules, which you have to construct independently. You don't have time to think about what modules to put in your sat because OH MY GOD A MISSLE JUST SET THE HEADQUARTERS ON FIRE. Even if you shoot missiles out of the sky, you can't rest. If the missile was close enough to a satellite, you're going to have to fix that sattelite. Go up to it, dock with it and hold W for what seems like ages. Which sats are damaged? The only way to check on damaged sats is either going up there, or adding a remote diagnostics module(Which is another module to add!).\n\nIf your planet doesn't have full comms coverage and your satellites don't link comms together, your sat is useless until it gets back in range.\n\nIf you lose your Construction Yard or Research Center(If you're not done with research), you're screwed. There's no way to get them anew. They will just take up space and throw mocking glances your way, while you're busy defending against the neverending barrage of missiles coming your way, which you will lose, because you can't research/make buildings anymore.\n\nEverything you research/build is free. Time is your only resource, but you never have enough.\n\nOn the positive side: The game looks nice and the gameplay does have a lot of potential. For the price, it's a good hour of fun. But it's nothing more than that. It's repetitive and stressful.

There's not much strategy involved. You have barely any time at all to do shit. For example, producing a sattelite, all it's modules, picking it all up, flying up and placing it and inserting modules is probably going to take you a minute or so. But before this you want to have com towers on the ground, which ads another minute or so, so say two minutes until you have ground coverage and a single sattelite up and running. One satellite gives you maybe 20-25% coverage. Add another half minute to create a turret below your satellite and that's around the time the first missile appears.\n\nWell, if that missile isn't randomly going to appear exactly where you put that satellite have fun. As far as I can see there's no way you're going to get coverage in all the spots where it's important before missiles show up as well as defenses, and there's no way to know roughly what directions missiles are going to come from before they're launched, so you're essentially just rolling dice.\n\nIf that missile didn't appear at your sattelite it's probably going to damage it. Now you can either go repair it, but that means you won't have more coverage by the time the next missile appears. Or you can ignore it and try to get more coverage, which will probably result in the loss of structures. The game essentially always have you feeling like you're behind. Any lucky stroke means you can continue on schedule, any not-so-lucky stroke means you're fucked. \n\nThere doesn't seem to be any resource system, you're simply limited by time. You can build as much shit as you want without any penalties beyond the time it takes. \n\nThe interface is also really clunky and obviously intended to be console friendly.\n\nThe game has a research system (again, only limited by time) but I don't see how you have time to worry about that stuff when you can't even get basics up and running before you get pummeled and you're way too busy trying to deal with that shit instead of stopping at your research center.\n\nAlso, the game has a star system but doesn't tell you how to achieve different star ratings (the first non-tutorial stage has you shooting down a single rocket, something I did without it damaging anything as soon as it appeared and I got 2 out of 3 for some reason). \n\nThat said, you can actually win a mission without actually shooting down a single rocket, by just repairing the damage they do, but that seems to be kind of avoiding the point of the game in the first place and turning it into a boring run to X, press repair game instead of actual strategy (hence the second sentence of this review).\n\nIf you came here looking for a strategy game: avoid like the plague.", "recommendationid": "29675923", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486150601, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486149364, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561197975903337", "num_games_owned": 477, "playtime_forever": 40}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501062"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1486083206, "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Nice!", "recommendationid": "29659838", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486083206, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486086404, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561197975186725", "num_games_owned": 212, "playtime_forever": 146}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484008"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492018739, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "ahhhhhh i didnt like the lay outs of the controlls and stuff i liked the design ie the art work but that was kinda it id recommend the game but it just isnt for me", "recommendationid": "31101289", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492018739, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492018621, "num_reviews": 98, "steamid": "76561198210071037", "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_forever": 8}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492500014, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Really nice game\n\nA multiplayer setting would give this a really nice Aritimis: Bridge simulator feeling I think.\n\n", "recommendationid": "31213747", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492500014, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492584544, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198090085689", "num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_forever": 100}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1498261678, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Eh its alright not the worst not the best", "recommendationid": "32703031", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498261678, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498258892, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198136468382", "num_games_owned": 10, "playtime_forever": 42}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 13, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 13, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 11}}
