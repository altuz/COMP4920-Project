I know it's only a .99 cents game, but I don't know why anybody, even a kid, would want to play this.  If it were free, I would probably not knock it down as it does what is promises to do.  \n\nHowever, you're brushing some weird looking creature's teeth.  In one VR environment.  You move around in room scale.  You basically move your motion controller all around its teeth to get the junk out.  Some music is playing.  That's basically the whole game.\n\nThe VR environment is nice enough.  But the game is weird, why am I brusing this thing's teeth?  Would make more sense if I was brusing my own in VR.  You only need standing room that way.  Instead I need to walk over to reach the brush then  walk over to reach this thing.  And it's not even fun, it's more like a chore.\n\nRate 3/10 needs to be free to even be worthy of downloading and then only for small kids\n\nnote: played this on Oculus Rift with Touch and the game works fine as long as you have room scale setup", "recommendationid": "35015170", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505627842, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505620907, "num_reviews": 210, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 7}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
