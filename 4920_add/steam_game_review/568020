Everything works well.\nThe graphics are nice (albeit a little bit black and white/too minimalistic) but the main problem is that there's no gallery to browse all of them!! It's one of the very few visual novels without a gallery..\nBut anyways it's a nice story, it's a different kind of visual novel if you're used to the most \"Japanese\" ones.\nTouching, overall. Nice one!
