A little over 1.5 hours, maybe 2 hours of gameplay. Relies mostly on a light creepy factor with a few jumpscares a la FNAF, which don't really hit that hard (probably as a result of the lighter tone which doesn't instill the sense of anxiety that some scarier titles might provide). Music is nice, and would really set the tone well if the content was better at switching it up when the creep factor is supposed to hit.\n\nThe Kaleidoscope update is rather odd, and introduces some off-beat storytelling; but it does pad out the gameplay a bit. \n\nAll in all, were it priced any higher I'd say avoid it, but it's pretty cheap so not bad honestly.
