I loved how when one abnormality broke out, it could cause a chain affect of containment failures but not it doesnt really feel like that. alot of the system was dumbed down to be more simple while it was increased in other areas. panic response is just kill everything on sight now.\n\nother than the management system the graphics design part i really find appealing (still kinda mad theres no special containment team that would be similar to SCP's MTF) its really appealing and very interesting and could apply well to the older version.\n\noverall, id only reccomend this game if they either allow for you to play the older version or make some changes to the new version. if your a fan of SCP, i think you may enjoy this if you enjoy trying to keep things in. there isnt much of a cleanup other than onsite personel trying to recontain\n\n\nEdit: I have just learned that you can go to the older version via the beta tab, doesnt change my reccomend till some changes are made", "recommendationid": "34896643", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505250048, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505608021, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197983528056", "num_games_owned": 117, "playtime_forever": 1701}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504738"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505815698, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Nice theme.

Its a hard language to translate and since this is an Indie gamecompany with limited experience in the global marked and limited resourses, most of the devolpers most likely are focusing on devoping.\n\nI agree that most of the game is heavly RNG based and it's puts people off due to that. However, this game is not about how to make a functioning base. Its how to just survive with odds stacked against you from the start with anomalities that can and will kill you and your fellow emploies in an heartbeat. Its about any failure could be your last before mayham occurs.\n\nLobotomy Coorperation needs an English translator to cover the global marked. However, by doing so, the poor translation are some of the theme in this game and it will lose that theme by perfecting the english speaking world. Why, do you ask:  It's poor translation is about something you can not control as per theme in this game that you can not control anything within your satifactions. Sooner or later, you will lose control and mayham occurs. And thats maybe why they have poor translation. To infact just say: we are not perfect and will never be perfect.\n\nThe artform on this game is out of a fairetail book. Scary and depressing while also fasinating and beutyful. The anomalities themself are fasinating on their own and also quite deadly and terrifying. You will be glad to hear the endbell when you filled the day's quata of energy with most of not all anomalities quite passified in their rooms. You will be more glad if you filled the quata if one or more anomalities escaping and you just filled up that energybar.\n\nThe work on the anomalities is RNG based appond the level of the emploies. High level of emploies is pressus and yet they have the priorities to maintain high risk high revard anomalities and to contain both high and low anomalities if they break out. Low level emploies can handle low level anomalities on day to day basis, however they become meat seald for the high level emplies if someone is escaping.\n\nIf you want a game wich is punishing you for any mistake you make and also punishing you if you do something worng, this is a game for you. This game is brutal in its simplisesy and for keeping you on the toe every single day you work. I highly recomend this due to the fact we need games that will be a challence every time we start a new game.", "recommendationid": "35218911", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506419740, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503065092, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198011904914", "num_games_owned": 93, "playtime_forever": 393}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1506123149, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Trailer looked really neat and the gameplay seems interesting, so I grabbed this game. After taking it for a spin and watching the intro I have zero understanding of what I'm supposed to be doing and cannot figure out any controls.

At this point in time, the game can't really be played for fun due to a few problems.  First, the English portions of the game are lacking.  There is no tutorial that explains why things happen which often result in your pawns just dying or being killed by monsters.  No ability to control the volume in the game directly is a pain because I don't want to have to keep switching between screens in order to accomodate the poor sound engineering.\n\nBut here's the biggest personal gripe I have.  The game was built using the free version of Unity.  This tends to send up a red flag because many times when startup companies build games this way, they end up getting abandoned.  Well, as it is the game is far from a solid alpha state so while I'll keep an eye on it (great game concept), I can't support the game at its current price.\n\nRefunded.", "recommendationid": "35092716", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505944377, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505944037, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197999832150", "num_games_owned": 277, "playtime_forever": 41}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494385"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1504596031, "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "not lovin it, a tutorial would have bin nice", "recommendationid": "34751385", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504596031, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504595915, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198171071583", "num_games_owned": 103, "playtime_forever": 31}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479178"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 8, "total_negative": 46, "total_reviews": 129, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 83}}
