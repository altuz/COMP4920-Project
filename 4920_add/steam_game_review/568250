It's basically just a bunch of cage matches against big monsters. I'm sure there will be updates for it in the future and I'm sure it will get better after community feedback. \n\nAlso, when trying to exit the game, it doesn't exit and causes glitches inside VR because it's still open. You have to take off the VR headset, go to the computer and open tack manager to get it to close - that's very annoying. In it's current state, I can't honestly recommend this game. \n\nThe game does look cool, but it needs a lot of development to finetune the gameplay.", "recommendationid": "29207635", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1484242674, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484242713, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198047529041", "num_games_owned": 29, "playtime_forever": 32}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507187"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 11, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1484214283, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Screenshots show A X Y B buttons for attack, yet the game ONLY allows tracked motion controller use. For a third person perspective game, it doesn't make sense to force tracked motion control scheme. If there is no intent to re-allow gamepad controls for this game (as is shown in the screenshots) then maybe there should be a way to change the button configuration? I'd prefer to control my character's rolling by holding grip and waving my right controller down, left, or right rather than having to hold grip and wave down, left, or right to activate what used to be controlled by pressing X, Y, or B on a gamepad.\n\nThe combat seemed a little too confusing to follow when I got to  enemy 3. I couldn't tell if I was out of range of the boss's point blank attack or not, so my dodge rolls didn't seem effective. Or, I just didn't know how to time them. Either way, the gameplay wasn't fun enough for me to continue trying to get further than the third enemy.\n\nThis game requires a VR headset but doesn't really make a compelling case for having it as a requirement.

Still putting it as not recommended.\n\nShort version: \n\nThe game looks like Tera played in VR without the damage indicator with less skills to activate with motion controls only[strike]with unnecessary motion controls[/strike].\n\nLong version:\n\nThe controls are super janky. It's better to play with a controller especially on a fighting game rather than relying on motion gestures. [strike]The game's ability to register/detection is also unreliable[/strike]. Also your character will sometimes dodge when you're not even pressing the button.\n\nThe tutorial is lacking a bit(apparently you are given a crossbow which was not explained in tutorial and are used to kill the smaller minions, what are the icons means like the lightning? charge bar? when does the 4th skill appear?) which is another factor why this game feels janky/unintuitive to play.\n\nAlso the game is just a bunch of monsters(more like bosses) per level in a caged arena and you need to unlock each level starting from easy, normal then hard. For it's price, I guess that's pretty what much what you expect.\n\nLastly, while the game is nice to be played with VR, I don't think this deserves to be a VR exclusive, you can easily play this on a normal monitor game.\n\nThis was just below on what I'm expecting so I'm not recommending for now. I would change my review once:\n\n1) controls are ported to a controller\n[strike]2) The game detects motion gestures more accurately[/strike]", "recommendationid": "29209063", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1484253909, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484252417, "num_reviews": 85, "steamid": "76561198046980920", "num_games_owned": 6257, "playtime_forever": 30}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501717"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 8, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1484207588, "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I've only had the chance to play this game for a half hour or so, but I like what I see so far.\n\nThis does not feel like a fighting game that has just been ported to VR.
