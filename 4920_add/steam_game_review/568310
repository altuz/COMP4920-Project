The objective of the game is not just to escape a room for the sake of escaping but it always feels like it has some kind of purpose. The game cleverly puts you in scenarios that relate to protagonists past and uses this as a means to put the player in different situations that keeps the experience feeling fresh and engaging. \nI definitely find myself lost at several points but I generally don\u2019t play VR games for long stretches of time and every time I got back into the game I would manage to figure out the more challenging puzzles in the game. It\u2019s definitely worth noting that they want to look inside every cupboard and drawer as you\u2019ll find items and clues that you will need in order to solve the puzzles. \nI also really enjoyed the setting and the atmosphere. It\u2019s mysterious and I always curious as to what would happen next. The hub world idea was pretty neat too and is a crafty way to progress the story and return to areas that you have already visited.\nThis game is definitely not just for room escape fans but for anyone who wants to experience a pretty unique game with a nice variety of gameplay mechanics.", "recommendationid": "29977752", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487310586, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487310302, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198197141630", "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_forever": 68}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504982"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487388010, "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A friend recommended this to me since he knows that I like these kinds of games.
