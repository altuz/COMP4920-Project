Someone who likes history and knows of the terra cotta warriors would enjoy this short little experience. The two different light sources to choose from was nice and made for a kinda creepy environment, although im always scared/jumpy in the dark in VR. Only down side is NO subtitles or translations and it's rather short. The menu was trial and error but I got through it simple enough and the main action that plays out has no subs. So you just watch and try and guess whats going on from observation. Overall I played for about 20 mins and I would love to go back in if they add some subtitles.", "recommendationid": "29510769", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485471435, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485113795, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198253216407", "num_games_owned": 86, "playtime_forever": 18}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
