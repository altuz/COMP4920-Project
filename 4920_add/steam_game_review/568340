Voice acting was mostly very good, except parts from the daughter. The story is very interesting, the ending is shocking and a bit controversal, i liked it. Playtime is short, around an hour if you dont run through the game. I absolutely recommend it.", "recommendationid": "34771998", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504688860, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504720153, "num_reviews": 62, "steamid": "76561197981111953", "num_games_owned": 8882, "playtime_forever": 312}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518683"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 10, "total_reviews": 24, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 14}}
