The main parts that make it cool are:\n\n- Troops don't automatically beat an enemy troop and die--it seems to be a coin flip, so fights are 100% obvious in outcome\n- The speed at which you expand is dependent on a couple special kinds of terrain. This means where you expand matters, and how you expand matters--you get to try to calculate the time it would take to build a new node vs how long it will take to expand.\n- terrain affects how fast your troops move, and where they spawn in a more imaginative way than the usual node-centric setup. Thinking about distance and timing makes this more interesting than the typical version of this game.\n- Art is fucking weird as hell and I love it. It's like a fever dream internet thing along the lines of Hotline Miami or Ghost in the Shell's digital world.", "recommendationid": "33564890", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1500140796, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500320317, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561197970897823", "num_games_owned": 683, "playtime_forever": 2525}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502322"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1503024894, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "As a long time RTS fan, Castle Battles hits the spot with simplistic but satisfying gameplay.
