The developer was very active in the beginning, but nothing has happened since March (both game uptades and announcements). Though already fun, buying it now is financing it's potential, not it's content, that is scarse.\n\nWith that said, the game's premise is the Binding of Isaac's room by room than floor by floor style, but with Nuclear Throne's twin stick controls and focus on weapons and ammo, not (primarily) abilities. Depths of Limbo already has it all, but not much to offer in any front. A few enemies, a few weapons, a few abilities, a few bosses.\n\nWhat got me to buy (and enjoy) it is the potential of differing from the core games it's inspired on, like the ones I mentioned before. Some rooms have sound puzzles that are simple, but nice, and the infinite ammo pistol with rare other ammo available brings a resource management to the game that I appreciate.\n\nAs a game, I can't recommend it for now, but I do not regret financially supporting the potential of the developer.", "recommendationid": "32503267", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1497703013, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490641151, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198084941250", "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_forever": 544}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537062"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_positive": 4}}
