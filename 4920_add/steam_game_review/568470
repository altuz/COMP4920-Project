Here is why:\n\n- The game is short - you can complete it in about an hour\n- Basically, there are three scenes. While the first and second make little sense, there is at least a glimpse of a story on the third one - that ends with a cliffhanger.\n- the game is absolutely no beauty. No offense, that would be no problem if the game would not suffer from casual frame drops at the same time\n- while the music is pretty decently playong along in the background, the narrative bits are of poor quality\n\nIn short, this game was a disappointment to me, and I am not looking forward to playing further chapters. There are better indie games out there with more gaming value - better spend your money on these.", "recommendationid": "35188540", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506279625, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 92, "last_played": 1506200512, "num_reviews": 36, "steamid": "76561197977105828", "num_games_owned": 217, "playtime_forever": 92}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503194"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 5, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_positive": 3}}
