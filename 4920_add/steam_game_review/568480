As much as i would love to have one, just not in the cards. \n\nI was asked to come by Quickdraw Studios to play Space Slam before release. I got to preview the game in all its glory with a VR headset. I was totally amazed by the soundtrack and the controls. Smashing into planets. \n\nSo i'm only reviewing the \"2D mode\". You plug in your controller and go to space smashing into some planets. \n\nUpon starting a level, you have to go through the center star to get some BOOST and weapons to start destroying planets. I personally had some trouble getting the controls to work with the sensitvity but quickly fixed it. It takes some time getting used to the ship moving and camera for me personally. \n\nI really enjoy the skybox in this game, its so damn pretty! ALSO the music. they nailed it. \n\nSupport an awesome team ;) and QUICKDRAW STUDIOS. \n\nThanks for reading.", "recommendationid": "29451376", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485211628, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484593858, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561197967003815", "num_games_owned": 1294, "playtime_forever": 77}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504780"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1484260669, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "These are simply my initial thoughts on the game.\n\nUnfortunately, due to only having a dev kit oculus, I am not able to experience this game in the full VR it was designed or intended for for. I was first surprised at the smoothness of the gameplay. The controls and physics in the game work well together, making it really easy to pick up and play. Despite this, it is clear that this will be a difficult game to master. Challenging yourself to beat your own scores is rewarding. The music is good and the AI dialogue provides a sense of humor and character to the game. \n\nNow I have to go mine more \"minerills.\"", "recommendationid": "29212756", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1484260669, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484275131, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198022310451", "num_games_owned": 157, "playtime_forever": 29}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498913"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
