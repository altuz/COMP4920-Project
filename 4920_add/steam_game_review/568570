This make early game play challenging, but not in a good way. The items you can craft at the beginning are simply underpowered, and it\u2019s not like you can farm materials to make stronger weapons and faster tools early on. You\u2019ll encounter enemies that are not hard, but take a lot of swings to kill because of the weak weapons. Farming will become very redundant due to the slowness of the tools. You have to advance in a very linear way; it\u2019s very anti-sandbox. The game does offer a creative mode that supposedly unlocks all building/items. \n\nLeveling is a little weird, you have to complete quests, which is fine. But you also have to collect resources (the same that you use to build things) are part of the requirements. Said resources are consumed when you level up. You have stats, and the only way to gain higher stats is to complete the quests and burn through resources. \n\nDraw / View distance. This game has a very limited draw and view distance; hiding un-rendered areas with fog. This makes the world feel very small.\n\nThis game has a weird handle on menus. submenus prevent access from their main menus; even when both menus are visible. You have to do a lot of menu juggling to get between menus. It's very clumsy, frustrating, and inconvenient.\n\nAll crafting benches require additional tools; and later on upgraded tools. It\u2019s neat, but also requires a lot of busy work to collect the items necessary to build the tools, then the resources to build the benches.\n\nYou cannot personalize or change your character.\n\nThe English translation is a little rough; there are some grammar syntax errors that require you to read through a tool tip or quest multiple times to understand what it actually means. Some of the word usage is awkward, such as \u201cSplinters\u201d. You\u2019ll actually collect some in the very first quest, and you\u2019ll be like \u201cThose aren\u2019t really splinters\u2026 technically they are, but\u2026\u201d\n\nBuilding is a little clumsy, you can\u2019t rotate your view of the area, and camera control doesn\u2019t feel natural. \n\nCamrea control in general is very clumsy.\n\nBe prepared for a lot of walking around, micro management for item crafting, redundant and boring framing.

TEE-DEE-US\n\nI read another review that said it got boring very quickly. I thought I didn't mind the complex survival/build/strategy type games so I could overcome a degree of 'boring'... but ouch. It gets boring very quickly.\n\nVERY nice looking game. Love the free look, movement and graphics. The GUI is clean and friendly enough (Although why I have to 'take all' for items i built with my own hands.. I have to take them off myself before I can use them? Really?) however the system for finding and obtaining recipes seems long winded. Multiple clicks to get to what you need just helps make the game boring quicker. I found that the fog of war some people are complaining about to be pefectly fine, could be stretched out a bt further but meh.\n\nThe heirachy system of building items is very good and very complex so if you like a good depth of options and different constructions this is a pretty sweet little time waster.\n\nUnfortunately for me it just felt like that, a time waster. The tedious amount of work required to get to the higher levels of the construction heirachy are painfully laborious. I didn't even get to the first palm leaf hut before I was wondering how I could put up with the collection of the resources required to build a proper wood or brick house! For example the first basic hut requires something like 20 logs, 40 sticks (I think?), 50 palm leafs... among other things like nails (which I can't even be bothered to explain the process to get to them!). To put this in perspective, to obtain palm leaves you either kick a palm tree or chop one down. Going with kicking seems sensible so you don't kill your resource. Kicking ten times gives about 1-4 leaves. So walking around to every palm tree, kicking, collecting, move, repeat, it takes some time to get that basic resource... you see where I'm going.\n\nI imagine once you get your systems in place it would work out streamlined but I could see by the scarce rocky outcrops and the little metals they yeilded meant that travelling far and wide to collect higher end resources was going to grind me down. That was when I pulled the pin.\n\nCombat.... is just awkward and pointless. There should be an option to switch of foes (maybe there is I didn't go that far into it)\n\nI wanted to like the game and I certainly do like aspects of it but it is just too tedious.

NO RUN FUNCTION!... What? In any survival game sprinting is a must. Why? Are you really gonna walk when something or somebody is trying to murder you? No, if your life is on the line you're going to downright haul ass. If you're out hunting and your, now wounded, prey runs off are you going to walk after it? No. It'll get away. As it ALWAYS DOES in this game as of right now.\n\nSecond: Tedious as fuck! Now to be fair, you can start a craft and walk away. But the material farming is dredgingly slow and the count of materials from each source will have you pulling down on the sides of your face making your eyes bulge out. Sticks and Palm tree leaves should be explosively abundant. But, compared to any build costs, they are a tedious grind to gather as many as you need. A good, quick fix for this is simply to up the amount dropped from each source. Instead of a single tree only giving 6 sticks have it give 12 to 15 and take 2 to 4 fewer sqings to bring the tree down. Instead of 7 palm leaves, 10 and it takes 1 swing to bring the bush down. Unless the Dev meant this game only for children, most adults usually have full time jobs, sometimes multiple jobs, and thus don't have the time for a slow ass grind. I've been playing for almost 4 hours and have only managed to get as far as building my first hut.\n\nThird: Swinging like a... I dunno, even the girliest of girls can swing an axe faster than that. I mean, do I really need to elaborate on this one? The player character hits really damn hard but swings soooo frickin slow, while you, the Dev, have the enemies swinging at a believable speed but hitting for much less damage and with weapons that are clearly superior to my Cudgel. Goblin with a war axe anyone? And the frickin bear!? I'm sorry, I would NOT fight a bear with a stick off the ground! The bear should hit ALOT harder. It's a fucking bear! 600+ pounds of \"I'MMA EATCH YUH!\" Easy fix you say? Sure, speed the player characters attack up and bring the damage down a bit, then make that bear into a proper beast. Honestly, for a naked guy with a stick the bear should kill the player in 2 hits. It's a fuckin bear!\n\nAfter only 4 hours, that's really all I have found to complain about, though I'm looking forward to a female model. Just saying. But anyway, the game is really pretty, so far I love the designs and graphics and I am already in love with the simpler elements of the crafting system. The grid assisted placement is very nice, my OCD approves. The fact that most everything is breakable is nice. I can build wherever the hell I bloody well please.\n\nThat being said, I DO recomment this game as I have high hopes for it.\n\nA few things I'd like to see added in are:\n\nSprinting, faster character movements, quicker material farming to reduce the tediousness, female models, modding support(modding support only helps), and maybe set it up so two or more of the same building piece will join together to form 1 big building piece(but still count as multiple building pieces). This way we can have a bigger home if we want, instead of just a bunch of smaller homes. ( I'm gonna feel dumb is that's already a thing and I just hadn't played long enough to see it yet )\n\nIs the game worth $7.99 as it sits now? Yeah, I think 8 bucks is a fair price for it in it's current state. But with the 3 issues I listed above down right killing the game play, I do have to rate the game about a 6 out of 10 as they badly drag the immersion and enjoyability way down. Hopefully the Dev reads the reviews and takes people's input to heart as I AM enjoying this game and hope to see some of the improvements I've recommended.\n\n17 hour review update:\n\nSo I've been playinmg for 17 hours now and can no longer recommend this game. Good looks is about all it has going for it. Material harvesting is still a slow as hell grind that doesn't leave you feeling accomplished at all. Enemy balance is beyond laughable, a goblin warrior with an axe is less of a threat than a naked man with a club AND A FOX! Yes, a tiny fox is more of a threat to the player than a goblin and a bear is barely more of a threat than a fox, dealing the same damage but taking a whole 3 more hits to kill. The painfully slow movement speed has me falling asleep just trying to run from one side of my base to the other, and my base is pretty cramped up tight mind you. The collision boxes for trees create ALOT of invisible walls between tree trunks and small bushes can not be \"pushed aside\" by the player. You run up to a shrubbery and can not pass through it, which makes moving across the map a HUGE pain in the ass as you constantly have to switch between your sword, which is barely more useful than your club, and your axe to chop down small bushes and shrubbery. OH, and let's not mention the fact that a sword CAN NOT cut through shrubberies and sunflower seed stalks.... What?\n\nI don't know what is wrong with this developer's head, but this game is NOT worth money. It has great potential, but at this point I can only see it reaching that potential if the current developer steps away and allows some one else to take over.

The build system work very well and this comes to the next review bashing.\n\nOne review said that this game was tab crazy and had a very slow build and leveling up system that became boring. \nThis is also untrue; if it became boring you must of play all these new games that all you do is like Rambo gun and run game style.  Well know wonder it seems boring to you,  in fact the tab is 4 tabs that function very well and if not simplifies the game play building system.  It look very well all the cool items and well balanced in combat at lease with in the 2 hours I have played.  A basic club killed some weird native creature\u2019s and even fox\u2019s and a bear.  Within the first 2 hours I have all ready  leveled up to a level 4.   I see nothing wrong with how they claim how slow of leveling up that it is slow and boring.  \n\nOne reviewer said this game was built for kids, of course it was older kids and you can say the battling system is lame it is too basic.

This game may seem easy but that is what we want it\u2019s a learning system later we will play it at a harder level.
