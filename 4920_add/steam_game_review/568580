Ships appear to be moving faster in relation to map size. \nBut that's mostly because maps are tiny here. If you take that out, the ships don't feel much faster, especially not the heavy boats which feel clumsier than battleships in WoWS. On top of that there's no cruise-control, so you have to keep pressing W in order to move forward at half speed and Space+W to move at full speed.\n\n2. You have to zero in to improve accuracy.\nThis feature feels very much out of place considering they're aiming for a faster pace gameplay. If you move - you lose accuracy, if you turn the gun - you lose accuracy. On top of that guns turn speed feels off in some cases (7.62mm machine gun turning like a 127mm turret on a destroyer).\n\n3. Physics... So primitive it's barely there.\nBoats feel like reskinned tanks. Very high friction and/or low inertia. This makes boats feel like they're moving on rails. On the other hand with some practice boats can turn in one spot (once I saw a heavy boat rotating like a fan to dodge torpedoes). Collision looks slightly weird but overall it's passable I suppose.\n\n4. Graphics. Not just bad, but somehow offensive.\nI don't care if a game has bad graphics, but this game isn't just NOT visually pleasing. Its core graphical features (textures,  3d models) are pretty bad, but the devs are using some cheap effects to try and make it look fancy. Looks like heavy makeup on a rotting corpse.\n\n5. Optimization.\nHard to tell. For me the game runs smoothly, but that doesn't tell much since my PC is several times better than what's listed as recommended system requirements. However, the requirements are very low so I'm guessing this game can run on much older machines than WoWS.\n\n6. There are submarines though.\nThey don't really add much other than frustration (for non-subs AND other subs alike) unfortunately. Just like with any other online game that has submarines.\n\n7. Microtransactions.\nI won't even touch that subject. The term \"pay to win\" lost all its meaning nowadays. You either can deal with microtransactions or you can't.\n\n8. Miscellaneous.\n- You can only use one gun at a time (having more guns doesn't increase your firepower, especially not with automatic guns);\n- You can't do controlled bursts or single fire with automatic guns, they fire a predetermined number of rounds per burst;\n- Engine overheats if you go at full speed for too long;\n- Sound quality is modest at best;\n- Overall amount of content is modest at best;\n- Overall level of polish is modest at best;\n- Playerbase is extremely small at the moment (and for a good reason) with peak online around 400 players (~70% of them are non-Steam Russians, take from that what you will);\n- Battles are small scale, the largest I've seen is 6vs6 (maybe that's due to low playerbase);\n- Fake/biased positive reviews and downvoted negative reviews;\n- Having to hold W+Space to go at full speed is maddening;\n- Even Steel Ocean was/is better than this, at least it has more content and players.", "recommendationid": "29759220", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486506540, "votes_funny": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486486134, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198015671863", "num_games_owned": 308, "playtime_forever": 169}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512854"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1487013450, "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Thrill!

You can play as a submarine and you are able to change ship colours etc but that is limited and would require a great deal of play to unlock the credits neccessary to do so. You can pay real money for various ships and pay for credits to unlock camo's and the like faster which is where the developers make their money. The ship balancing is a bit iffy though, with early submarines playing a lot better than their ship 'equals'.\n\nI'd recomend it as it is free and works well, I killed a few hours with it. If you were looking for a fast pace arcade ship battling game then you can't go wrong with this, however, it is very repetative and does not have many of it's own features to make it stand out from other similar games. 5/7.\n\nEdit:\nSince playing I have created a quick video to help those stuck on the fence deciding to download it or not.
