Night Shyamalan cringe [spoiler] It was all a dream [/spoiler], awkward nudity scenes, horrible stock music, monsters that would make most Deviantart users shake their heads, painful QTE's that added nothing to the rexperience, unlikeable characters.\n\nThe setting of the story could of been something that made for an interesting horror story but instead this feels like a first draft that the developers child wrote for a school class. It could be very possible that this has multiple endings and story branches but I couldn't care less to play through this game again to find out.\n\nThrowing stones into a pond is more of a interactive enjoyable experience.", "recommendationid": "33713306", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1500702534, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500701509, "num_reviews": 15, "steamid": "76561198082931104", "num_games_owned": 269, "playtime_forever": 25}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516731"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 12, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 6}}
