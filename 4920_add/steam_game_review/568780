You get better foods that make better profits by completing quests, but are limited to how many locations you can sell most foods. It' offers potential, but ends up being very lame. The description says \"Do your best to become the great businessman in the city\" but with no competition, if you have even half a brain this getting rich and unlocking everything is only a matter of time. Very much not worth the 7.99 they are charging.\nI really must emphasize the poor english. Do you speak engrish? because if you did you might have actually written the in-game text with non-asian accented english.\nAlso the name is decieving in that it says multishop (meaning a variety of types of stores maybe), rather than multi-foodcart which is what the game really is.", "recommendationid": "31545629", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493921972, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493921578, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198029058361", "num_games_owned": 143, "playtime_forever": 119}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510378"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1499258815, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If I knew how to play this game properly, I'd enjoy it more, so I do like it but I need to learn more about this, are there any tuorials for this?", "recommendationid": "33273537", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499258815, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499175115, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198216219873", "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 99}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493929"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_positive": 4}}
