And when I say masterminds I mean they charge 30 dollars for a character - which has significant stat advantages and is unobtainable without paying.\n\nPros:\n+Character Customization\n+Decent Community\n+Skill Intensive\n+Can't Gain Significant Edge Through Paying\n\nCons:\n-50%+ of Content Microtransactions\n-F2P Content Is Lame(for the most part your character won't look unique unless you drop 40$+ on the game)\n-Goalies are AI and inconsistent at that.  Literally have watched a 3 point lead blown because the goalie stared at the ball.\n-80% of the community doesn't pass the ball\n-90% of Defenders don't know how to tackle\n-Everyone Plays Striker, No one is good at it\n-Developers Change Event Rewards at will\n-Overwhelming number of South American players.  No South American Server(which is in high demand and sure to come).\n-Game existed 2 years ago and eventually went under.\n\nA little extra on that last Con, and which was ultimately the last straw for me and this game.  Yesterday you were able to obtain E-Coins which are temporary versions of the irl currency alot of the microtransactions of the game go on.  Yesterday there was also several oppurtunities to unlock the 30$ characters - which was exclusive through a temporary two month long event.  However without any news, warning, or statement whatsoever the game decided to change the first 5 game of the day reward from 150 e-coins to a 1000 points(which to put into perspective is about two games, or 12 minutes) - Basically locking over 50% of the content in the game from the free to play community.  Overall I think the level 48 reward that existed(and was also changed) which gave the player 3000 e-coins(30$) was overwhelming, and they have pushed it to a level 56 reward to unlock 1000 e-coins, which is essentially a single premium stat item.  \n\nUltimately it is a free to play game and developers have the right to charge whatever they want for whatever they deem should become a microtransaction and I respect that.  Overall the game doesn't punish the f2p players, seeing as every stat-based item has a free equivilent, however there is little incentive in the game to work towards.  If you don't want to drop 20 dollars in the game the max you will be able to do is kick a curve ball and have an afro - maybe eventually having a shirt if you decide to drop 30+ hours into the game to get a level 56 character.  However even then small portion of content will be unavailable because e-coins dissappear after seven days meaning to unlock a free character you'd need to get 3 characters to level 56 within a 7 day period.(like storing 3 of them at level 55 and getting that last level for all of them at once) - but seeing as they have already done random changes to the game to prevent players from getting free characters, it wouldn't surprise me if they decide to change the game again upon reading my review.   Ultimately if you're looking for a game to play with a few friends and kill a few minutes out of your day, this is your stop.  If you are looking for a game to actually pour some time into I'd recommend spending money on a different game up front.  \n\nI'd give the game a 6/10.  If they add a SA server and make goalies slightly customizable so as to be more consistent, less luck based, and not completely retarded at times - the game would be an 8/10.  If they hadn't of screwed over the event-rewards and proved themselves to have a disconnect with the community, the game would be an 8/10.  If both of those existed, the game would be 10/10 perfect - seeing as all content would be unlockable, the playerbase would be consistent with its locaton(meaning less lag in matches), and goalies would be consistent so as not to tip games in the favor of whichever sides goalie isn't retarded(because nothinig says victory like your goalie catching uncatchable balls but the enemies goalie literally ducking to avoid the ball).\n\nFinal Score: 6/10\nDeveloper Score: 3/10\nWould I play this game: With Friends\nWould I pay in this game: No\nEsport Capability: Not Likely\n\nAudio: 8/10(Audio Queues are Useful)\nGameplay: 5/10(Goalie AI sucks, Lag)\nGraphics: 7/10(Cartoony Art Style)\nMusic: 8/10(Tight Soundtrack - Probably best part about the game is the rap soundtrack)\nReplay Value: 4/10(No Incentive for F2P players; Pay to look cool, not play to look cool.)\n", "recommendationid": "30160786", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488010309, "votes_funny": 5, "comment_count": "12", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488006093, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198069110667", "num_games_owned": 59, "playtime_forever": 1341}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591640"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 67, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487995750, "votes_down": 36, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I never knew how educational playing a F2P soccer game could be.

I feel as if I'm mostly going to be recapping a lot of the issues already raised, but I feel like the more people speak out about this the more likely the devs are to respond.\n\nThe base gameplay (not taking into consideraton the connection issues and terrible goalie AI) is actually really enjoyable and the music in the game is really high quality, but the business model and deceptive tactics of the devs is incredibly shady, downright deplorable and ultimately means that I would not recommend this game. \n\nAs others have stated there is currently an event to commemorate the launch of the game, wherein originally the reward for reaching level 48 was 3000 E-coins (coins which are the event equivalent of the premium currency) which was basically $30 worth of free coins. This could be seen to be overkill, and it seems as if the devs thought this too. \n\nDURING THE EVENT, and I'm not making this up, AFTER THE EVENT STARTED they changed the rewards so that now the E-Coin reward is at level 56, and only provides 1000 coins. Not only this but they also changed the rewards so that players now do not get a free DLC character, but rather a \"capsule\" (a gacha/luck system) with a chance to win one of the characters. \n\nTHIS IS NOT OK. Whoever thought this would be a good idea is seriously misguided, and really makes me question the intentions of the devs. Now some players have received 3000 free coins and a free DLC characters while others are stuck with only 1000 coins (which equates to just over one permanent cosmetic item) if they make it to level 56.\n\nTo add insult to injury the daily reward system which had previously provided 50 E-Coins for completing 5 games a day has also now been changed to provide only 1000 points. These points are obtained from playing the game, and 1000 points is a very meagre amount. \n\nI understand completely that they probably thought 3000 coins on top of the EXP boosts was a bit overkill (which it probably was) but to change the event mid-way through shows that they don't consider the playerbase as much as they do their own profit. \n\nIf they want to maintain their reputation they should either change back the rewards to how they were and compensate players to make up for what they lost or provide some kind of compensation after the event has ended as an apology (and I don't mean points, which is what I expect they would probably do). Currently all of the permanent cosmetics are locked behind a paywall, something which leaves a very sour taste in my mouth.\n\nI will say, however, that I still intend to play simply because of the club community. This is the only reason while I plan on continuing to play; being part of a club is essentially the same as a guild, and I've met a lot of friends on this game in such a short time. \n\nAlso the league matches that come with being part of a club fix some of the complaints about lack of teamwork.\n\nIf the Devs rectify their actions (and fix Goalkeeper AI/servers by creating a seperate Brazilian server) I may edit this review to recommend it but as of right now I would say that it's only worth playing for the clubs.", "recommendationid": "30200545", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488127664, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488679466, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198084662763", "num_games_owned": 137, "playtime_forever": 2480}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519524"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1488225008, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great team football game.

Recently, they decided to cancel the event that was finally bringing back old players. Their reason for cancelling it was that they found an error that could affect gameplay, however, all the players know it was only because the develoeprs realized people were farming ecoins and other items that would otherwise cost a considerable amount of real money to obtain instantly. This game is pay to win and the developers are very greedy. Nothing has also been improved with the actual gameplay since launch. All they have done was add more ways for them to get money from players. Another game that could've had more potential but the developers care more about money. To top it off, the game is losing players steadily. Might as well stick to FIFA. \n\nOriginal Review:\nThis is a really fun game that can get you hooked if you're a football/soccer fan. I believe I saw Freestyle Football years ago but I never tried it at the time because I didn't have a pc suitable for gaming. Now, I finally do so I downloaded it as soon as I saw it. I played for hours straight! At first, you don't have flashy moves when you're trying to get through opponents but that builds up through progression. As you level up, you gain access to skills that you can purchase and add on to your character. However, there is a limit to how many skills you can add and the only way to unlock skill slots is through real money. This isn't bad because you can still be a good player if you manage your skills well. Unfortunately, there are items in-game that you can buy with real money and improve your character, but don't let that deter you from playing this game because it's quite easy to buy the items by just playing normally. There's no advantage between in-game currency items vs real money items, except for the permaneent duration option. Yes that's right, with in-game currency you can only own an item for a max period of 30days, but you can choose to buy an item with real money and keep it forever.\n\nI know the game just recently came out again and it's not like the developer is a giant, so I was not expecting a clean game. There are bugs, unpolished music and server issues but I have big hopes for the game. I hope the developers work out the issues since I really found the game to be a blast.
