Really good game.\n\n   First up, the graphics far exceed the low expectations I've learned to harbour for \"indie\" horror games. This game is frequently gorgeous, from the sheets of drizzling, misty rain through to the shafts of sunlight peering through the trees (during an uncommonly serene opening sequence). Bodies of water are also highly effective, and the monsters in the game memorable and genuinely frightening. Nice.\n\n   Secondly, the sound - and atmosphere created through the mix of audio and visuals - is top-notch. Long before you \"meet\" anything, the creepy noises of things checking you out from not-so-afar will keep you on your toes. This is a scary game long before the shit officially hits the fan.\n\n   Which brings us to a third noteworthy accolade: the build-up. Rare is the horror game which does such a fabulous job of keeping you in the dark - often literally! - in regard to just when the danger will finally emerge from the shadows to menace you. I won't spoil it for you, other than to say that it's quite a while before you'll truly need that \"sprint\" button. But you'll be hitting it in panic long before that anyway, thinking that something must surely be about to beset you at any moment.\n\n   Now for some more neutral points. The \"puzzles\" are generally solid, if not always entirely logical. I had no idea, for example, that a plank of wood I was carrying about was capable of bridging a gap a good few metres wide. The whole time I thought I was carrying around a stumpy stick, useful at best for beating off feral dwarves, but was in fact lugging about a well-hewn hunk of tree capable of giving a lumberjack back pain (and was still able to sprint from fast-moving monsters whilst doing so).\n\n   The story, while certainly nothing to complain about, also isn't much of anything to write home about, and starts quite a bit more compellingly than it finishes. It's fine, though, and services the gameplay perfectly well; which, when all is said and done, is what most game \"stories\" are about anyway, aren't they?\n\n   Downright negatives? There aren't any really, unless you include the lack of remappable keys and the thoroughly stupid decision to have the player jump AFTER the space button is released. You get used to it, obviously, but it kinda sucks when you have to die a few times to get the hang of such things.\n\n   Look, honestly, I play a lot of indie horror games, and this one gets an awful lot of things \"right\". It's about the right length (around four hours), has about the right balance between linearity and lack thereof (areas seem quite large at first, but you soon whittle them down), is reasonably challenging without being crazy difficult, and has its fair share of chase sequences without them becoming tedious or redundant. And the fact that this was developed by one guy is downright INSANE. \n\n   An extraordinary effort, all things considered. Pretty much a must-buy for all genuine horror-lovers, and we shall definitely have to keep an eye out for the name Alessandro Guzzo in the near future...\n\nVerdict: 9/10.", "recommendationid": "35021716", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506167376, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1506327818, "num_reviews": 429, "steamid": "76561198048974498", "num_games_owned": 1513, "playtime_forever": 276}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537181"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 8, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505458968, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is one of the rare horror indie adventure games on Steam that is actually well worth its asking price.  There are a lot of choices on Steam for this type of a game, and while I livestreamed this entire game in a single sitting on its launch day here on Steam, it was a very fun and gripping game experience.\n\nI love the HP Lovecraft style of story woven in that you will gradually uncover until the dramatic and satisfying final ending scene.  The game has a really well imagined and thought out plot and sequence of how you uncover the secrets within waiting to surprise.. and shock you.  \n\nWhile I've played a good number of these type of games, this game did make me jump at several points, and even had me screaming to hold on to my life as death itself tried to chase me down.  ..If only I can run just a little fasterrrr!  Runnnnnn!   Awesome and exciting moments for sure!  ..Mix that with a well imagined and good story that you discover as you explore this beautiful world and you have one helluva game for a small price tag!\n\nNot without faults, this game hard crashed on me 15 times on its launch day, but thankfully the game does frequently auto-save often, and these autosaves take no time at all, and do not make you wait, so neither crash or death in the game will set you very far back.  Already on just the day after launch, this single developer has already patched the game to fix the crashes, so this is VERY impressive and a quick response to criticism and bugs within his game.  For a developer to respond so quickly and professionally is pure delight and all the more reason I recommend this game and hope that he does very well with this title!  I also look forward to any future titles he might bring to Steam with this title and professionalism shown already.  Love it!\n\nMy score for this game, even with it's minor faults is a strong 8 out of 10.

The graphics were fantastic with a good attention to detail to build terrifying environments. The sound quality was excellent and helped create a tense atmosphere. From what I played, the story was simple but made me want to keep playing to find out more. However, this game is a technical mess and I gave up on it despite all that.\n\nAs others have confirmed, the game will randomly crash for no apparent reason. Luckily my save points weren't affected and it always crashes clean so it was easy to pick back up - but yeah, obviously very annoying regardless. \n\nI was going to keep playing despite the crashes, but then I lost my save point. I'm on Win10 playing with a Xbox One controller - and the game handles it fine except for the menus. I noticed when starting a new game that, when it asks you to confirm yes or no to begin, moving the thumbstick left/right to choose yes/no didn't highlight the active choice to show what you're about to select with the gamepad. At the time I just blindly moved the thumbstick left toward yes and pushed A which successfully started my new game. When I was done playing for the time being, I hit start and then moved the thumbstick down until I got to the option for exiting the game (these menu texts highlight correctly). Somehow I ended up being prompted for a new game with the blind yes/no confirmation which confused me since I was certain that I hit the exit game menu option. I again blindly moved the thumbstick right toward no and pushed A - and to my surprise it started a new game which wiped out all my previous progress. This is when I learned two annoyances about the controller support for my setup. The first is that the yes/no confirmations don't let me select no at all... it always selects yes regardless of which direction the thumbstick moves. The second is that I can't use my controller to select the option to exit the game. For some reason it skips over the exit game option and moves back to the first option which happens to be start new game. I realized when I thumbsticked down to the menu option before exit, I hit down and then A very quickly without confirming that exit actually highlighted which then lead me to the confirmation that doesn't let me say no. And there's my lost progress.\n\nA few other annoyances were some delays when pressing jump which seemed to be randomly mistimed and poor collision detection with objects.
