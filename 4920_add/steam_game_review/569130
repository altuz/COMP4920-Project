The graphics are charming and the sounds are awesome in that retro style. This is a fun casual shooter that makes you think how you are going to attack enemies. Moving chairs and tables to make shields is very fun and adds an extra element to the game.\nhttps://youtu.be/MRYhxWekhAU", "recommendationid": "31177901", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492348109, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492315097, "num_reviews": 43, "steamid": "76561198283832325", "num_games_owned": 119, "playtime_forever": 14}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498427"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
