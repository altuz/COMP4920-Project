This program fullfills those requirements and does it in a very controllable and user-friendly environment.  It's very quick to learn, a pleasure to use, and is an invaluable tool if you want to quickly produce crisp, accurate models and environments in VR, without the steep learning curve of programs like Blender. Highly recommended\n\nNote: I'm currently using this on the Oculus Rift and it all seems to work perfectly so far (other than seeing Vive controllers instead of Touch controllers whilst in the app).", "recommendationid": "35083637", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505914953, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 251, "last_played": 1506771597, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198079025399", "num_games_owned": 111, "playtime_forever": 512}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503546"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
