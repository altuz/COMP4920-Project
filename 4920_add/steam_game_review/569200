It\u00b4s one of those I remember fondly from my childhood as being one of those that had good immersion (or what was at those times considered \"good immersion\"), and it\u00b4s nice to relive those memories.\n\nSince it an ages old game, compared to these days the UI is horrendeous to use, graphics are very dated and the usual you can expect from a \"classic game\", but that\u00b4s what this is to me, a classic. And classics are classics for a reason. Along with Wing Commander and Elite, it was one of those that started a so far life long fascination with with space sims and the life of a opportunistic space trader who\u00b4s not afraid or above of doing a little fighting or piracy, atleast when there are no watchful eyes present.\n\nIt\u00b4s not going to blow you don\u00b4t have a certain fondness for what it was back in it\u00b4s day, but it\u00b4s a nice trip down the memory lane of gaming.", "recommendationid": "31519377", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493794663, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493794722, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198011049563", "num_games_owned": 470, "playtime_forever": 2104}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531575"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
