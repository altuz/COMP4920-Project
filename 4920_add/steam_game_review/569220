Bottom line up front: if you can't get past low-res FMV, you'll have issues with this game. If you want some point and click scenes between espionage-themed minigames and a reasonable, if extremely convoluted, plot, then this might be for you.\n\nFirst, this runs in DosBox. Worked fine on Win10 for me, but if you have any issues with DosBox elsewhere you'll want to look into them first. The FMV is also occasionally choppy at their stock cycles and is low-res scan-line video as was standard at the time. The graphics didn't age well, and the action scenes are pretty campy, but it's fun as is.\n\nSome of the puzzles are walkthrough worthy, but it gave me two days of entertainment. \n\nIt's some James Bond level nonsense as far as realism goes, but they really tried to give you the flavor of espionage.\n\nI'd happily give it a 9/10, athough you really can't take it too seriously. And it's also linear, although you can complete the steps in any order. The only real consequences I saw were game overs and the last choice in the game, which provides one of two endings.\n\nWorth what I paid, although I also grew up with FMVs, so I don't know how many other gamers would enjoy it.", "recommendationid": "31639336", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1494303119, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494300867, "num_reviews": 16, "steamid": "76561197980482234", "num_games_owned": 393, "playtime_forever": 315}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514170"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1493036913, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Interesting and unique game, although underrated.
