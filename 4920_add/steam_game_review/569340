Incredibly immersive and clever. I don't know if they used ASMR for recording sounds, but I was having goosebumps quite a few times. Or maybe it's just that the story really got to me.\n\nOn the other hand, it sure is short and it lacks replayability (or maybe after a month or so it will have similar effect as during your first playthrough). And achievements implementation is kinda out of tune with the game's motif. They can easily destroy the bittersweet feeling you get from the play.
