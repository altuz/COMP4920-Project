It needs waaaaay more content and many of the mechanics in place need to be reworked completely... just feels like a bunch of pretty puzzle pieces that don't fit together. That being said, I have no confidence this will change in the next year. Considering the state of the game, I do not understand why it is out of early access.\n\n[h1] Long: [/h1]\n[b] Map size [/b] is waaaaaaaay too tiny which limits your creative choices when it comes to building. You always end up building on the whole island and putting a wall around, that you spam with towers.\n[b] Map generation [/b] is random with no options what so ever to influence it... which means you will have to klick the same button for half an hour until you get what you had in mind (one solid island where you can build from the middle, for example).\n[b] Building your village [/b] is not challanging once you get the hang of it and that happens really quickly. Your main limittation is the population since every building needs workers to function. After a short while you will have built every building there is and only focus on raising your population and defending, which brings me to the next and biggest issue...\n\nThere is no effective way to defend. Attacks come in the form of Vikings, ogers and dragons.\n[b] Dragons [/b] sound cool but they just fly arround and burn buildings. In order to defend against them you have to litter your land with towers which occupy manpower. Not very esthetically pleasing either and once it is done, you don't have to pay attention to dragons anymore.\n[b] Vikings [/b] kidnap your villagers and set your buildings on fire so you want to stop them before they get in to your settlement. Walls seem like a solution but since it is random from which direction the attack is comming, you have to build your walls all around but do not have the manpower and mats in the beginnig to do so. \nTowers are helpfull but not as much as you would think. Vikings don't bother with towers and just walk passed by while taking dmg. Problem is, it's not enough dmg to kill the Vikings before they walk into your settlement and start setting it on fire. Again the solution seems to be to litter the land with towers so enemies get shot while they walk to your settlement.\n[b] Ogers [/b] appear after a while together with Viking attacks. Unlike the Vikings, Ogres DO attack walls and towers and are there to simply smash buildings. I tried to occupie them by building a bunch of towers clumped up in one space, which would have worked but... since the direction they attack from is random, you have to buld them in every direction which is impossible because of the map size. Also that will not work on Vikings and dragons.\n\nSo the only viable solution is to spam towers which looks like sh*t.\nOh, yes... i forgot to mention the army you can build and send around on the map. They are completely useless against dragons and alsmost useless against Ogers but good against Vikings. I mentioned that population (as a resource) is the only challange and towers take a lot of it... well, armies need even more. That means it will take a while to buld a military that would be most effective in the beginning. Another problem is their AI... you have to babysit them constantly to make sure they do [b] anything at all! [/b]\n\nNot to speak of the lack of controll you have over your towers and army. You can't klick on enemies, not see their health, not choose a priority target,...\n\nI like the looks and the idea behind this game but the mechanics do not work together, like I said, reminds me of pretty puzzle pieces that do not fit. I do not expect a full game and a lack of content is understandable for early access... what I DO expect is a solid core of a game, core mechanics that fit and funcion well together but as of now I can not see that. It's just too much work and this is why I have no confidence it will change anytime soon. Though I sincerely hope the developer will be able to solve all those problems and make this game as good as it should be. Oh wait! It's out ouf early access already?! Seriously?!

However, don't get this game if you are expecting 40+ hours of enjoyment from it.  My \"hours played\" (approximately 6 hours) represents the amount of time it took (less ~30 minutes to learn the basics) to fill an entire map with structures, build at least one of every structure in the game, and fend off dozens of attacks by dragons and vikings.  At this point, I have seen everything that the current version has to offer and I have no desire to keep playing.  I think that this is acceptable value for the price, but you might disagree.\n\n[h1]What I Would Like to See[/h1]\n\n[b]1. Bigger Maps[/b] - An option to adjust the map size, including maps much larger than the default map.\n\n[b]2. Better Citizen Management[/b] - This could be an oversight on my part (then again, the fact that I could not figure this out after six hours indicates that the system, if it exists at all, is neither intuitive nor obvious), but I could not get citizens to occupy specific buildings with any consistency.  This issue poses problems when your kingdom gets attacked, because your defensive structures sit idle if no citizens are operating them.\n\nEven so, rebuilding after an attack was never an issue.  I think that any increases in the difficulty or frequency of attacks must come with similar improvements in your ability to defend the kingdom.\n\n[b]Suggested Solutions[/b]: Citizens do not want to die, and don't want their homes destroyed.  When an attack is detected, citizens automatically stop their current activity and move to the nearest tower or barracks.  \n\nAlternatively, add an option to give each structure \"priority\" (e.g., high, medium, low).  High priority structures would then attract workers before other structures.\n\n[b]3. Steam Workshop[/b] - Mod support via Steam Workshop adds a lot of value for me.  I would be much more likely to continue playing if there was an active modding community working to make new buildings and map options.", "recommendationid": "35177216", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506262333, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 399, "last_played": 1506193899, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198048850477", "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 399}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510705"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505069527, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A lot of people complaining that there isn't enough depth have a point, it's a very simple game and isn't very difficult. \n\nIf you want a complex city-builder, this isn't it, and it's not claiming or trying to be that at all.

But to the reviewers who said \"this game has no depth\", I think you meant \"there literally is no content here\". \n\nIf it helps you visualize the disturbing \"lack of depth\", this game has 39 total things you can build or place in the world. At least 3 of these items are basically useless. A bunch of the pieces of the landscape which could be mining nodes are \"unusable rock\" which the game developers put there just to give you something to clear.\n\nThere are no upgraded buildings or anything, so no improvement. Just constantly growing a severely unstable population. There is no moderation in this game. You can build one extra farm because villagers are starving, and end up wasting a bunch of food because you suddenly have way too much. \n\nIf you are a pyromaniac, however, I would suggest this game. There's literally a fire every 30 seconds, and nothing to do except watch your villagers try (and usually fail, even when it's raining hard enough to drown your farms) to put it out so that you have to build things all over again. \n\nOh, and I forgot. Maybe I'm missing something, but putting up buildings seems to take double the materials it should. The materials you have on hand at the bottom of the screen are lowered by the expected number when you place a building, and while building it the villagers will wait for additional materials if that same amount isn't still on hand. The most aggrivating thing was that I had a storage building burn down with a bunch of materials in it (for example, 89 stone). Instead of the game just erasing the materials that were stored in it, it put me in the negatives of that same amount.
