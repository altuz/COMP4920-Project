It might be one of those 'we won't hold your hand' games, but is even more hampered by translation in the less than half an hour game time, I've done the below areas 3 times & cannot see anything left to do. (I just watched the trailer & I've done everything & been everywhere that is in the trailer 3 times in under half an hour, this is a bad sign)\n\nI've turned on the lights & had encounters with a stock Unreal asset monster in both cutscenes & in-game; I've turned off a music box, read every note I can find & picked up a glowstick which seems to be the only thing I can find to pick up in the areas available to me so far. None of the doors seem to open, only a couple are interactable & have the 'jiggle the door handle but it's locked' sound effects, there doesn't seem to be any keys anywhere or puzzles unless they are lost in translation, but there are definitely rooms behind them as you can see assets in there when you angle the camera. \nThe one note (posted in the Screenshots page) that seems to elude to progress, could not be more garbled english & the clue it appears to give, I have scoured the map & cannot find how to use that information.\nThere might be a game her, but this needs a bunch of fixes.\n\nIt also has some cardinal sins of horror games:\n- The dumb, seemingly only Unreal Engine thing where sprinting shakes the camera from side-to-side because animations don't understand how eyes work in a skull.\n- Terrible lighting & flashlight (RMB zooms the flashlight to more of a focused point which I've never seen before & so far there doesn't seem like there's a mechanical reason for it here either.\n- You encounted the monster twice in cutscenes & once so far in-game & it doesn't acknowledge you in that one & yet you have a garbage stamina system & in what feels like it will be a back-tracking heavy game (if there is a game) then I better be being chased by stuff a lot or at least have the stamina recharge quicker than this nonsense.\n\nNot cardinal sins but still annoying:\n- The notes are in a mix of fonts, possibly indicating they are being written by multiple characters but names aren't mentioned so it is hard to tell.\n- Awful, stock main menu & in-game font.\n\nThe only positive thing is that it didn't have loading times for me even on Ultra, the game is still bad, but at least it didn't make me wait.", "recommendationid": "28576630", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1482542673, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482738211, "num_reviews": 77, "steamid": "76561198086542708", "num_games_owned": 3586, "playtime_forever": 62}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506353"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1483555476, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This has got to be one of the worst games I've ever played.
