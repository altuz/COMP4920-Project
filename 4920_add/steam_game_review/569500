Only problem that i really have with this game righ tnow and i have said it.\n\nI play with KB and mouse, The mouse is no longer needed but could be used to be a sweet set of enjoyment perimitors.\n\nJoypad has a run feature i think - KB doesnt. I would like to see those change so each person palying the game has the same sub set of keys made to them.\n\nTill next update.", "recommendationid": "30029807", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487663395, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487662766, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561197981980302", "num_games_owned": 1657, "playtime_forever": 37}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486329"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
