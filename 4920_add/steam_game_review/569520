It is quite basic by today's standards of graphics and also gameplay, but it has a very special feel to it indeed which I find very appealling.\n\nThe movement is very clunky however and many of the animations are poor. I would hope in the future the creators would improve the animations and movement feel, both in the player and the monsters.\n\nIt can be very intense at times and the monsters run after you very, very fast! I like the stealth element too both sound and visibility are relevant to whether or not you stay undetected. Monsters are quite smart and seem to vary their patrol routes which is very good.\n\nIt is very hard though when you get stuck it can be frustrating trying to find out how to move on from a part of the game.\n\nOverall I think this game has a fantastic charm, a lot of character and the only thing I would want the creators to change are the animations and movement feel.\n\nThanks!", "recommendationid": "33009311", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498769007, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505605938, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198021954644", "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_forever": 332}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508152"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
