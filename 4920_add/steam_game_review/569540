The store page claims that the game is developed by a company called 'Elusive Team'. I whole heartedly agree with the first word because if you do a bit of digging around you will find that 'Elusive Team' is really none other than 'BC Interactive' and again if you do a bit more digging you will find that 'BC Interactive is none other than a guy known as Berdyev. Any developer that has changed his name a couple of times and you can pretty much assert two things 1) He must be a terrible developer and 2) Jim Sterling must be hot on his tail.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/berdyev/  \nThis guy since his appearance on Steam has already been labelled as one of the worst game developers out there. In fact the developer even agrees to that comment and wrote a review about himself under an alias claiming to be one of the worst as keenly spotted by Jim Sterling the wit sniper against bad talent. Hang on let me get this straight, here we have a developer who creates games and then writes reviews about his own games claiming to be the worst developer? Wow I feel like I\u2019ve just been violated by a cartoon character and a saucepan.\n\nThe problem with berdyev's games is that they are all simply asset flips of assets usually on the unity store. Hence they are pretty skeletal in content and offer zero in the way of entertainment. Seriously his games are so skin and bones that you would honestly find more meat on a quail drumstick and unless he begins to stop running away from Jim Sterling's Bowser sized fireball criticism and started to man up and take responsibility for his work unfortunately this developer who often showcases framework idea's will be forever scraping around the bottom of the barrel with all the other cesspool of wannabees.\n\nRest in peace is a perfect example of this. 18 levels which can be finished in about 10 minutes and easily passed by placing your mouse on a spinning top. The idea is to simply draw lines and get the balls to fall in a box. There is no penalty if a ball misses and no penalty on how many lines are used. If the game had achievements that maybe unlocked depending on using the least amount of lines and there were more levels then this game may actually be worthy of attention. But with the constant, blatant disregard of his current products while he continues to manifest new games featuring only a chassis of content then you begin to understand why he is quickly developing a reputation as one to avoid.\n\nBelow is the full game to settle your curiosity...\nhttps://youtu.be/OyTZb9rRo8A\n", "recommendationid": "33584973", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1500211798, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499591733, "num_reviews": 183, "steamid": "76561198112866114", "num_games_owned": 2624, "playtime_forever": 50}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513684"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 11, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 5}}
