It has a good storyline, which is Adlanniel, a student of falconry, and her owl companion, Tyto, are asked by Great Owl King, Silmaran, to save five of the Great Owls from Mermon, the Merman King, who is bent on taking over the land of Owlia. It has a wide variety of floating sea creatures you can defeats and different dungeons with a lot of puzzles.

This would have been a middling title back in the day, and it's a middling title now.  It's not a Crystalis nor a Startropics.\n\nThat said, compared to prior 8-bit era titles it's only below average, not outright bad.  While I feel there are better titles for getting one's retro what-could-have-been fix (which is ultimately my reason for not recommending the game), it does provide what it claims to, and sneaks in a few amenities despite appearances (for example, there's a password system, though if you die your end password is also auto-entered in the Continue menu, and you aren't actually penalized for dying).\n\nEDIT TO ADD: This is a near miss for me, and re-reading my review makes it sound more harsh than that. If you want a faithful NES game, it absolutely is one, and I'd recommend it for that. Otherwise, I would have trouble recommending for reasons discussed in the comments.", "recommendationid": "29210953", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1484338668, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484252954, "num_reviews": 49, "steamid": "76561197999647773", "num_games_owned": 864, "playtime_forever": 30}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503421"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
