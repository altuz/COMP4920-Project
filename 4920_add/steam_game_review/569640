The reload mechanics and precision that you can achieve is really well executed. Everyone who has come to have a go on the Vive has been really impressed by what is still a game mid development. \n\nThe new maps and weapons are good fun - looking forward to seeing what will come next, if it happened to be nothing I wouldn't feel cheated. \n\nI really cant see why people are giving this bad reviews, just a really good zombie shooter, that can easily scare the cr*p out of you.\n\nMy only complaint is the big mutant zombie on the first map but that is personal taste - I prefer a classic zombie.", "recommendationid": "31075987", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1491908234, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502358271, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198053829752", "num_games_owned": 67, "playtime_forever": 834}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499802"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1491900451, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is just amazing. \n\nThis is a fun zombie shooting game with very truely environments. Even though I know its a game, the all weapons and the running zombies still freak the heck outta me. I did have some trouble with the game that I just survived 50 seconds on the night level at the first time.And I tried again and again, I found some ways to control and allot my weapons.\n\nI have to say, this is definitely one of the best VR campaign experiences out there for now. There is a lot of good to say about this game. The basics such as the feel of the weapons and locomotion are excellent, except combination bow. \n\nTo be honest though, on the garden level I always thought it was just guarding buildings, in order not to let the zombies close and destroy them.But I did not think that when I heard some sound, turned around and found a zombie actually jumped on the car, appeared behind me!\n\nIt manages to create at the same time a very deep atmosphere, sometimes creepy and anxiety-provoking, and also provides a very good shooting game.", "recommendationid": "31074572", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1491900451, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491898602, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198379922963", "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 40}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493496"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 14, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 10}}
