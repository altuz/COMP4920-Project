Thank you for support!'. I won't be supporting it.\n\nFirstly, no full screen option & everything seemed to have an odd blur about it, I'm used to Unreal Engine & CryEngine indie games having an odd gloss to surfaces, but all the graphics seemed hazy & off-putting but not in an uneasy horror sense or a 'we tried to do a film grain' effect sense.\n\nAnyway, this starts out as one of those horror games where you have little direction (but not a 'we won't hold your hand' game) & you have to wander the map passing over triggers for some jumpscare or other & then wander the map again until something else that isn't particularly scary happens & when it locks you in a room or similar trope; the pauses for effect are way too long, you can take in the entire bathroom in about 2-3 seconds, but it makes you wait for another 8 to 10 seconds for the standard trigger of a thumping at the door. You get these too-long-delays a few times in an admittedly short game, but I've played too many of these types of games for it to not annoy me immediately so this might be nitpicking.\nIt sticks with this style for the first 2 stages & then the game then becomes a P.T.-them-up for what felt like ages but was probably about 10 minutes of just corridors & occasionally a woman who was evil or injured, maybe we had something to do with it; there was a story with subtitles & voice-acting which were both adequate, but it was still poorly communicated as to why we were there & our involvement.\nIt boiled down to a basic \"did I?...what have I done?!?!' story & it wasn't worth it; it also seemed odd that they bothered to do voice acting but there aren't incidental voice acting parts from the player character like a ghost woman was literally on fire in front of you & you remain completely silent; are you paralysed with fear? \n\n\nBugs: during the first stage, pressing F on things that aren't interactable doors won't trigger the door handle sound; but from the second stage onwards the game just plays that whenever hit the F key no matter where you are or what you're doing. Never know how much playtesting these games go through but seeing as this game is basically directional keys, mouse movement & the F key, there really isn't an excuse for not testing it thoroughly).\n\nAlso at one point during the second section, there is dialogue that says something like 'what's happening? I can't move' but you aren't prevented from moving & then he has a conversation with his injured grandmother but there isn't any additional character models around, not even the ghost woman. This could be one of those 'this is a jumpscare where you should be forcing the players field of view to look at the jumpscare but you don't so it doesn't make sense' moments that you get in a lot of indie horror games on Steam, but who knows at this point.\n\nReturned", "recommendationid": "29178246", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1484121981, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484120148, "num_reviews": 77, "steamid": "76561198086542708", "num_games_owned": 3590, "playtime_forever": 22}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542630"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 36, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1484079409, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": " Short version: This is not really a game in its current state. It is very cheap, but your time is not. Bequest is not worth your time at the moment.\n\n The grainy graphics do conjure a bit of a sinister atmosphere, and the music and sounds help a little too. Because of this I wanted to give the game a chance. There really is very little to do. There is far more story in the Steam Store description than you ever get in the game. The actual voice acting of the main character is fairly well recorded, but makes little sense and contributes nothing to story or plot. The voices provided for the ghost or ghosts, are awfully done; people trying to sound 'horrifying' with a bit of reverb and altered playback speed it seems. \n\n There are no options except for language and volume, and if there is a way to exit the game without ending the process then it is fairly well hidden. There is no kind of interface to control things in the game other than WASD and E or F, which seem to be used interchangeably. \n\n I will not mention specific events to avoid spoilers:\n\n You have to interact with items to make another item available. This takes place in only a handful of rooms. It takes a lot of interaction to get from the first few rooms to the next. Every now and then an object falls over or an image appears. Even accompanied by a sudden, dissonant chord, they are not scary in this game. It seemed to me as though you have too much warning that something is about to \"shock\" you. \n\n At one of the major \"shocks\", it was impossible (in my three games) to know if you died, were knocked out or just pushed into the previous location. There is zero in the way of story or explanation of events as you go along.\n\n The game environment may have made for a good story if one was present. Perhaps it will in the future.
