Great visuals, good sound (the wind gets a bit monotonous at times).  You may want to take some notes, but very, very often (not always) the game gives you a notepad of sorts to carry with you until the clues are actually needed.  There were a few \"what the heck?\" puzzles, but going back to the clue location, I can see they were fair, just very subtle.  There was a good variety of puzzles, including a few I had not run into before.  Decent vision is required, but there are no critical audible clues (unlike Myst and successors, which were notorious for having at least one puzzle requiring a good memory for tone sequences).\n\nMy biggest gripe about this playthrough is a bug where solving one particular puzzle did not produce the clueboard.  In fact, as it was my first playthrough, I had no idea it was supposed to hand me clues for a subsequent puzzle.  Because this is a \"wordless\" game design, and because many puzzles are cascaded, yielding the critical clues needed for later puzzles, this one bug made a fair chunk of the game unsolvable without resorting to the hints.  (And the hints confirmed I had the correct solution for the bugged puzzle, too.)\n\nI ended up with two unused notepads.  In both cases, it was because I used the hint system to solve the clue-dependent puzzles before I went back and worked forward from the bugged puzzle.\n\nHint system is very nice.  You have to solve a (trivial) puzzle to get help for the location you are currently visiting, which is just enough of a threshold to discourage hinting your way through the game.\n\nDespite the bug I ran into, and relatively short length of the game, I do recommend this if you like puzzle games.", "recommendationid": "32034469", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1496030638, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496030746, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198025609388", "num_games_owned": 812, "playtime_forever": 337}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 8, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_positive": 8}}
