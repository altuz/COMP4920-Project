The machinegun may have a rapid fire you can just hold down LMB to have fire constantly, but beyond having to drift its crosshair over an enemy and hit them once with it there is never any variation to the enemies' attacks or animations. Instead they just stand there, these strange, stoic mish-mashes of something resembling a Lego with various gimp masks on, appearing from the same handful of locations intermittently over the same static backgrounds until the timer for each level runs out. There is very little incentive to even shoot the enemies before they disappear (as they never attack you) beyond if 3 of them happen to disappear before you have shot them (clicked on them) you lose the level and are forced to start over.   \n\nThe music in the game is decent enough and the sound effects are also very straightforward, which fit the game's somewhat retro aesthetic, but it appears the same song repeats in every level.  \n\nSome of the designs in this game (such as its color palette and somewhat Spy VS Spy aesthetic) are interesting, but presented in such a bland gameplay format I don't care to play any more of it.", "recommendationid": "34300591", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502948793, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502948747, "num_reviews": 148, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "num_games_owned": 800, "playtime_forever": 9}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1503000997, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.\nPlease remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines.", "recommendationid": "34314468", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503000997, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488711752, "num_reviews": 33, "steamid": "76561198090275708", "num_games_owned": 159, "playtime_forever": 694}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1499622072, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is probably the worst game i've ever paid for.
