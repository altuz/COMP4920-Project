Where other new point & click adventures fail, this one delivers. It feels exactly like a game from LucasArts's heyday. And it is superfunny. Seriously, I've only played for an hour, yet I found myself laughing all the time, constantly curious what weird something-or-other I might discover next. If you like ZakMcKracken, Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle etc, go play this game. Don't wait-a-reno.\n\nEdit:\nI played the game in hard mode, and it took me about 13 hours to finish it. The puzzles are not as outlandish as many game reviews have suggested. I ended up calling the in-game hint line a couple of time towards  the end, only to find out that the solutions I was looking for were perfectly logical and visible. Just remember you can push and pull things, and you'll be ok ;)\nThe game stays weird and funny throughout. It takes a bit of getting used to having all these characters at your disposal and to understand some of them might do things other won't (yes, just make the clown do it). The ending is satisfactory - in this day and age not as mindblowing as it might have been in 1987 - you sort of see it coming at some point, and then you wonder, and you need to find out, and then you find you were almost on the right track, but not quite.\n\nPerhaps I should play it again in easy mode.

The game is made long, not by mundane padding, but by countless lines of fantastic dialog, bizarre occurrences one after the other, and, of course, a parade of crazy puzzles of the old-school variety, the type that make your head hurt, but when it comes down to it, have solutions that were staring you right in the flippin' face all along.\n\nMy adventure game-playing buddy and I had a blast playing [i]Thimbleweed Park[/i].

Maybe even the time gap between 2 games of a series.\n\nBut..this end here is weird in a kinda disappointing way because it does exactly that. \nI do love self referencing humor and when characters in games say \"oh hey, we live in a video game\" but they still live further than what they did in this game.\n\nAnd probably one of the most disappointing things is that you think \"oh, this guy seems suspicious / Oh i wonder what happens to the murder case\" and some other things.
