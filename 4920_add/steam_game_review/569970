I usually wouldn't mind about the story in general, but every character just acts unusual. It's not at all convincing how they act/react. An example:\n[spoiler]The loved one of the main character is in critical danger and is about to die. He just stands there. The question comes up what he's thinking about. An okay answer would be \"I'm unsure whether I did the right thing by killing our enemy,\n because she offered to save her.\" oder even \"I could never tell her I loved her.\" He says  \"I'm thinking of how useless I am.\"\n\" instead. [/spoiler]\nHowever the gameplay itself is anything but great, too. The first monsters you encounter are pretty tough, so you might just level up a bit. After doing so for some minutes every fight for the next hour is pretty easy, but very annoying. You might eventually come to a point when you can buy stuff and quickly find out that you can buy a \"revive\" for 60 crystals, but sell it at 120g. This means that you can farm up some crystals for the only time you will actually buy something. The equipment you've just bought is better than almost anything you'll find later on in the game.\nThe level/map design itself is built in a annoying way. Lots of mazes where you have to push boulders(it's not even a puzzle element, it's just pushing them forward a bit), holes and stairs with no purpose but to send you back a bit and checkpoints every two screens. However they are pointless, because you can heal yourself with potions/spells and save the game at any given time in the menu.\nThe potions themselves are pretty weird, too. You start out with a few hundred hp per character and potions that heal 500hp. This is fine. At the absolute end of the game your main character might have about 800hp and you will have hi-potions that heal 2500hp and potions that \"heal your full health\".\n\nTLDR:\nThe game clearly was not tested, is mostly annoying due to level design/boring fights and the story does not add a lot to the first game. Easy achievements, short game, not worth the 4,99\u20ac by far. This might as well be a free add-on, but it still wouldn't be \"good\".", "recommendationid": "35217571", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506412356, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 106, "last_played": 1506411284, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561197972007883", "num_games_owned": 358, "playtime_forever": 106}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505037436, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I enjoyed this game.
