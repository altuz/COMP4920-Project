As a game developer, I found AD3 very helpful in many aspects. It can help you with visualizing the flow of your story and narratives, be it linear or non-linear. \n\nAD3 also allows you to store all the details of your characters, items, NPCs etc. On top of that, another very useful feature of AD3 is that you can use it to plan any location/map in your game. For instance, you can overlay a zone / patrol path / landmarks / spots etc. on top of your location/map screenshot.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a very good software for developers / storywriters, even at full price.", "recommendationid": "31237274", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492609284, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 3515, "last_played": 1507125813, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198032356456", "num_games_owned": 156, "playtime_forever": 19067}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520653"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1496995387, "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Right now there's not a ton of reason to use this over Twine 2, except this takes less coding, but that's not a huge deal and Twine is a lot freer.
