The graphics aren't the greatest and the combat is clunky (you are a mining vessel after all), but the story was paced well and decent enough that it kept me interested until the end.", "recommendationid": "31049276", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1491773407, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491772080, "num_reviews": 33, "steamid": "76561198301417309", "num_games_owned": 150, "playtime_forever": 491}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508159"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1498688943, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I only made it about 3 hours into the game before deciding enough was enough. The narrative and delivery was interesting, and it was a neat universe to experience, but I just couldn't get into it. The crafting and star-system warping was a little too longwinded/convoluted, and the graphics style lost its appeal quite quickly. While this game is more than space combat, the fights themselves were just not entertaining, but rather a series of deaths until I could destroy a ship without knowing exactly what went differently. I wish I could experience the rest of the story, but the gameplay felt like too much of a chore in the end.", "recommendationid": "32961803", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498689005, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495940190, "num_reviews": 30, "steamid": "76561198002049680", "num_games_owned": 214, "playtime_forever": 173}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510980"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 8, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_positive": 6}}
