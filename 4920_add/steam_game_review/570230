However, you need to do the Windows 7 compatibility fix.[/u]  You do this by going to the game file.  Right click on the deathlike.exe file and choose windows comapatibilty, from there choose Windows 7.  Then run the game from Steam VR.  \n\nThe game is basically like Emily Wants to Play only there's only one trick and that is to stand still.  You will have a flashlight in your hand as most areas are very dark.  Locomotion is by moving your arms in running motion while pressing trigger I believe.  The map is pretty big so you'll be doing a lot of arm moving.  You have to find seven signs which are all bright red.  However, some of them are pretty well hidden nonetheless.  \n\nIf you hear sounds other than your footsteps it's either just environmental sounds or the demon is nearby.  If it's the sound of grass rustling or branches breaking, then it's probably the demon.  If you're facing it with your flashlight you can usually see it run away if you stand still.  If you don't stay still as soon as it's nearby, you'll feel your motion controllers start to buzz.  At this point, you must stand still.  You'll have a nice jump scare if you don't and you'll have to start over.\n\nI give a very tepid recommendation at full price.  There's just not a lot of content here for the price.  Basically it's find the hidden objects and stay still mechanic until the end.  \n\nRating 5/10 .. 6/10 on sale :D", "recommendationid": "35144881", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506145334, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "last_played": 1506143897, "num_reviews": 210, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 20}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 8, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_positive": 6}}
