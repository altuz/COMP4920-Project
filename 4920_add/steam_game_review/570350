The art was very good, the soundwork was excellent as it added to the atmosphere and made it more enticing to read on and I enjoyed the writing. And then it just ended.\n\nI finished it in 30 minutes, and that with taking my time reading and admiring the art style. Even though this was a pretty unique experience, I cant recommend it at this price as it is just too expensive for what it is offering.\n\nI really wish that the creator would have made it longer as the theme and atmosphere is excellent, it is sadly just too short to warrant the pricetag.", "recommendationid": "31819680", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1495105180, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495104714, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198003339347", "num_games_owned": 877, "playtime_forever": 33}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537396"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1499059693, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very interesting little horror story.  I thoroughly enjoyed this short yet chilling visual novel despite the annoyance of sometimes having to press H in order to toggle between text and image.  Regardless, very little backstory is given about our protagonist, but just the right amount of information was provided in order to create an ominous, eerie image of the young man.  The soundtrack was very good as was the artwork!  The ending was a bit of shocker and I'm still trying to piece together what actually happened, so even though the story is only around an hour long, it is quite thought-provoking and will leave you thinking about what happened for some time after you finish it.  If you like non-gory, eerie horror stories and visual novels, buy Entschuldigung.  Seriously, it's worth it.  Get it on sale if you can, but if you can't, get it anyway.  This little story needs more recognition.", "recommendationid": "33168619", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499059693, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499059120, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198275814548", "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_forever": 82}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 8, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_positive": 7}}
