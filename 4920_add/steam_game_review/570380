It sets a dangerous precedent when a developer can unilaterally revoke tens or hundreds of thousands of game keys that were legitimately given away and/or purchased, 6 months or more after activation, by lying and saying there was a problem with the payment. This is a very bad situation for gamers around the world.\"\n\nCouldn't have said it better myself.\n\nEdit: It seems Valve decided to undo the developer's actions and return the game to everyone involved.", "recommendationid": "35069217", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505954271, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505843015, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561197999218586", "num_games_owned": 2347, "playtime_forever": 8}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549886"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1506000355, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "My full thoughts on the game can be summarized here, if you feel your eyes aren't down for reading: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTnWP0n5MEk\n\nDeath Penalty: Beginning is a, \"one man operation,\" released in January of 2017. As with most games seemingly grandfathered in from the now defunct Steam Greenlight, Death Penalty is an asset flip, using mostly pre-bought models, environments and animations to form it's game.\n\nThe gameplay is far less than titilating; essentially a, \"run from point A to point b,\" event with some minor vehicle driving and minimal combat. However, the game is riddled with a multitude of bugs, such as missing executables and REFUSING TO BE INSTALLED TO MY PERSONAL COMPUTER. After finally managing to bring it to a working state, this game is not optimized for run on any level of PC, and has massive graphical and technical issues.\n\nAs with similar games, this would be an open and shut case; another Asset Flop on Steam and the story ends.\n\nHowever, that is not where the story ends. After being denied Trading Card Functionality, VI Games LLC (whether connected to that event or otherwise) began to revoke game keys they had given away to 3rd parties, totalling up to at least FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND by their count, no matter whether or not those keys had been paid for by the consumer. Despite public outcry, the Dev has remained silent on all of their social media platforms.\n\nIn this critic's own opinion: STAY AWAY FROM ALL FUTURE VI GAMES LLC productions, or their other sockpuppet account, \"Vi Games.\" For their, 'first game,' Death Penalty: Beginning is a technical fraud and failure, and how the studio has handled themselves is nothing short of a full PR disaster; disgusting and disgraceful in all manners of the word. There is no level of disdain I could express for the callous mishandling of such a PR disaster for an ultimately meaningless game that didn't even manage to crawl from the womb of original thought. \n\nAVOID AT ALL COST.", "recommendationid": "35104335", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506000355, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 455, "last_played": 1506000153, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198087949131", "num_games_owned": 224, "playtime_forever": 455}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508298"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
