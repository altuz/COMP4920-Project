With an i7 5820k and an OCed 980ti, I can SS this to 1.8x and have absolutely stunning graphics. Controlling the game with the Touch controllers (Oculus) is a dream of finesse and subtle movements -- in fact, I have better control than with my X52Pro joystick which I've used extensively in other space games, including X3. Gameplay, while not as varied and broad as in X3, still gives you the most complete space game experience you can have in VR. Just wish there was multiplayer but, oh well, that's what E:D is for. There ARE a few minor visual glitches which no doubt will be ironed out during EA, as well as some minor gameplay bugs but they don't distract from the experience.

The very first quest I was given took 15 minutes to fly to, using the boosters. \nI love exploration games but this really was just 15 minutes in a straight line, surrounded by background skybox on all sides.\n\nThis remained fairly consistent as I continued to play, with very little in the way of action unless I specifically go looking for it, and then 5+ minutes of floating through intergalactic highways or slowly lumbering through space.\n\nBeyond that, expect to spend a lot of your time in this game just going from A to B.\n\nYou can only pilot one ship - the one you start in.\nYou can upgrade your ship, but you cannot fly anything else. I really don't understand why this had to be the case, in previous X games flying ships was a core aspect of gameplay.\n\nThe menus are pretty daunting. It is entirely possible to miss out on the majority of what the game has to offer simply because it's tucked away in some obscure menu. Expect to be googling or looking for walkthroughs as you discover new things to do, but not how to do them.\n\nI can understand how someone may enjoy this game if they're hardcore into economy management and wandering around, but if like me you want action and/or coherent interface design, best to look elsewhere.\n\nHopefully VR will be present in X4, along with flying multiple ships.", "recommendationid": "35025713", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505660910, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505578892, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561197971783452", "num_games_owned": 326, "playtime_forever": 135}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496719"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 35, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 30}}
