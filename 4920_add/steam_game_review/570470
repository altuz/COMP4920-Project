From looks to execution, everything just feels lacking. The first thing that will hit you is how poor the textures are. They look like they were from the late 90's. Second is the locomotion. While billed as a feature, the push-to-walk requires too much spinning around, and as usual comes with the slight motion sickness compared to teleportation. I find it hard to keep the game's walls lined up with my Chaperone bounds because you can't just eyeball and line up the bounds and teleport there. Third is carrying of stuff. There's a lot of stuff in the first room, and you don't know what you actually need, so you end up having to toss pretty much everything into elevators, then toss them back out. Lastly, it's quite easy to get into situations where you're stuck between floors, because while there are invisible walls in-game, they don't exist in the physical world, and the game does not gracefully handle you getting off an elevator platform while it's moving. No saving or menus for that matter means you have to quit the game and restart.\n\nThere are other VR room escape games with prettier graphics, more rooms, and better puzzles.This game pales in comparison.

I can forgive the game's generally poor visual quality if the puzzles are good, but this game has one glaring problem. Escape the Bunker has a novel concept of having multiple rooms separated vertically by elevators, but the elevators are extremely glitchy. Items you find on the top floor are needed in lower floors, but leaving items on the floor of the elevators is a recipe for disaster because of how often they just end up spazzing out and clipping through the floor, but sometimes your flashlight glues itself to your hand, forcing you to carry items back and forth one at a time. I don't know how this game ends, because the only ending I've ever gotten is the one where you accidentally send an elevator back up while you're not standing on it, effectively breaking the game, and then \"escaping\" through the hole in the universe that is cleverly unveiled under the elevator by exiting the game. It pains me to give a VR escape room a negative review, but this one needs a lot of work. If they fixed the item issue by maybe adding in a item container or something that you could put things in that transferred them between floors, or even just gave us an inventory (if there is one, I never found it), I could see it being at least okay.", "recommendationid": "29066045", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1483742669, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483684999, "num_reviews": 627, "steamid": "76561197995820083", "num_games_owned": 1121, "playtime_forever": 24}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.371730"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1483581287, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Few glitches with losing items.

Basically the janky physics will make it impossible to complete Escape the Bunker.\n\nItems will randomally drop out of your hands.\nBumping anything with an item in your hand will make it bounce out of your hand.\nItems will randomally ignore colissions, falling through tables, or even the floor.\nTaking one of the many elevators in the game will make you drop objects.\nTaking one of the many elevators will cause other items you arent touching to move or lose collission.\n\nI literally walked through the first generator door holding the axe, had it spaz out of my hand, rocket around the room and cause a chain reaction of physics objects to all gain incredible velocity, wrecking the first room instantly. The chaos even caused items to fly up into the first room from rooms below. This was less than five minutes into my fifth attempt to play.\n\nAfter multiple attempts I haven't been able to make it past the fifth room because the third elevator forces me to lose at least one item no matter how I try to prevent it from doing so. This third elevator literally shakes the entire map.\n\nYou can literally get stuck because your essental item falls out of your hand, flies off and then falls through the level, forcing you to restart, only to have the exact same issue happen over and over again.\n\nOn top of being almost incompletable, the rest of Escape the Bunker is of very poor quality. Now I dont expect perfection or AAA quality by any means, but entire sections of the level are clearly incomplete. Massive holes letting you see outside the levels are everywhere, shadows from moveable items are baked into the floors and walls, your ability to move is literally only forward by pressing the pad, sounds are of poor quality and very loud.\n\nEscape the Bunker could have been a fun little indie game, but as it stands now, I would not say it is complete. It's a rough buggy mess and simply setting an item on the floor can cause you to be unable to progress. I don't consider myself demanding, but this is absolutely unacceptable and I reccomend staying away from Escape the Bunker.", "recommendationid": "30307404", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488602616, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488600680, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561197981852677", "num_games_owned": 662, "playtime_forever": 83}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1483805428, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Thumbs up only because there's no neutral option.  \nTL;DR: Good puzzles, tons of glitches. Don't play if you can't deal with borked mechanics.\n\nThe puzzle and room design is well done with cleverly hidden clues. I was screaming at the combination padlock at first, but after reading the manual for it a third time, it worked rather well and to be honest, the real ones can be as finicky as this virtual one. Some of the items have no purpose, but I was grinning from ear to ear when I found out what the axe was for. \n\nBut the actual game implementation and in-game physics? Broken as ****!\nI had to restart the game 5 times because of this and there's no save game or even a menu, so I had to restart from the beginning. The only reason I even finished is because once you know how all the puzzles work it doesn't take more than 5 minutes to play through the game, so I didn't really loose that much time, but seriously.\n\nI tried to look into the ventilation shaft in the first room, it's dark, but wait, I have a flashlight. Guess what got lost because of an invisible wall. No more flashlight - restart.\nNext I dropped a little item, because I let go of the trigger, it went through the floor or something - restart.\nI put the cellphone on the elevator floor, rode the elevator down, *poof* cellphone gone - restart.\nApparently I left the next elevator halfway down. Now I was dwarf sized above the floor and couldn't get the elevator to come back - restart.\n\nAs I said, if I'd have had lost more time due to these glitches I wouldn't have finished this game. Like this? - meh, it was okay.\n\nIf you like room escape games and you have no problem with glitches and restarting a game, then it might be worth it, otherwise look for something else.

There's more than 1 room - there's room progression to be made and there's a connective purpose to doing so - both combined makes the overall experience great!  \nThe game takes between 40 minutes to about 1+1/2 hour - this is dependent on how quick you can solve the puzzles and progress.
