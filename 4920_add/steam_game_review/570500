Meanwhile play the original,  \"Neverending Nightmares\".\n\nI bought this game, because it doesn't cost much and it looked exactly as the game mentioned (\"Neverending Nightmares\") that I really loved. Because the art style, the gameplay et cetera are completely the same, I was pretty sure, it would be from the same devs. And, yes I was just too lazy to look it up. After I have played for 5 minutes, I already saw many flaws. So I took the time and no, other people have made the game, so you can call it a rip-off in every way. \n\nThat of course doesn't have to be a bad thing. Here the problem is, the character moves way too slow and can run for only a few steps. In the original game the character was slow, too, but it played way more fluently, especially as you could move up and down, what isn't possible here.\nThen, here, you can move the character with the gamepad, but, you don't have access to actions with it. Unless you like holding the gamepad in one hand and having the other one on the keyboard... I really don't understand, why the devs would make it possible to move with the gamepad and then didn't just adjust two actions to buttons. (To go faster you have to use shift; OK, if you press shift too often and fast, you probably know what happens in windows. Windows stops the game and asks you if you want to turn on the sticky keys. And: no, you can't change the keyboard setting in the options, you can only change graphic and sound.)\n\nOne difference, I don't know if it's worth mentioning, but I do it anyway: when you come across paintings etc. you can zoom in, but, this just makes the pixels larger, so this kinda seems not very well made. As my screen is pretty large already, I can see everything quite well without zooming. I hoped for a more detailled view.\n\nSo you wander through a house (like in \"Neverending Nightmares\") and the house changes. \nAs a gimmick you get statistical information about being a child that was left, child abuse et cetera between some scenes. I have the feeling, the devs did this to cover up the lack of own ideas and substance and to make this game seem like it has a social message. Wow, experience the nightmares of a child that has...\n\nOk, enough! I will look into the game again, when it's finished/polished and then eventually change my review.\n\nSo the essence now is: If you haven't played Neverending Nightmares yet, you should preferably do that, if you have played it, you shouldn't expect too much from this game.", "recommendationid": "28781444", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1483807474, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483808095, "num_reviews": 42, "steamid": "76561198143030878", "num_games_owned": 407, "playtime_forever": 16}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523409"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1482688562, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Slow an steady paced, which is good for a horror/psychological type of game then again it may not be the same for everyone!\nIf you've played \"Neverending Nightmares\" then you know what to expect. \nI have yet to come across any bugs or anything\nIt's not amazing but it's not bad either and I obviously don't highly recommend it...\nbut it's worth a look if you don't mind spending two dollars.
