Alongside navigating a protagonist through standard obstacles any veteran spelunker would scoff at, you must ensure the survival of his mirrored counterpart who travels in symmetrical moves. The two characters start at opposite sides of the maze and each input will move both at the same time. What starts off unique and novel begins to feel a bit outmoded due to the game\u2019s inability to fully utilize the symmetry aspect, but don't let that stop you in trying out this neat gem. \n\n[h1]Fearful Hitboxes[/h1]\n\nFor the most part, FS feels fun to play in the earlier levels, wracking that brain to solve curious dilemmas. As the levels progress, the developer\u2019s deviousness comes into play where traps are placed on the exact location one would normally assume that it\u2019s safe. Spikes, pits, projectiles, and timed death tiles (ghosts, death marks, etc.) comprise the bulk of the puzzles, but a couple surprises keep the intensity up for a short while. These include enemy statues that mirror your twin\u2019s moves and zombie hands that are activated only when you are adjacent to it. In addition, critical thinking comes into play when you are forced to use certain objects to offset the characters\u2019 paths or backtrack when the goal is so close. Although the traps will compound together to create chaotic mazes, the lack of more synergistic effects keeps FS from becoming something better.\n\nUnfortunately, my enjoyment for the final levels is starkly different from the previous ones. This is mostly due to moving away from a puzzle-centric ideal towards a runner design. Even if I showed you the solution/run for the final levels (included in the playlist below), it will still take a lot of practice to finagle your way across the maze. It becomes more about luck and timing than about logic and puzzle solving. The main culprit of this is the extremely tight hitboxes. \n\n[h1]Complete Walkthrough Playlist[/h1]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IszIFB8vNk&index=1&list=PLeavCsRFiP559jK_-2PJMW-Vi1-Ohoy7K\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nI definitely want more of FS in a sequel where the levels aren\u2019t locked in a specific size with really synergistic obstacles (levers, locked doorways, chests, consumable items, skills/spells/weapons, etc.). Until that happens, any puzzle lover that is looking for something different has come to the right place. For such a cheap and innovative puzzle game, it\u2019s hard to deny its effort in providing a worthwhile experience, albeit a short one. \n\nNote: the options are pretty bare with an overall lack of polish as seen in an absence of an in-game exit option, windowed-only mode, and issues with achievements unlocking (just implemented today), but these issues are minor enough, for me at least, to let slide.\n\n[table][tr][td][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/BeforeYouBuy]Before You Buy[/url] \u2013 analyses of newly released indie games[/td][/tr][/table]", "recommendationid": "29367827", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485200116, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484878798, "num_reviews": 147, "steamid": "76561198048980407", "num_games_owned": 1919, "playtime_forever": 105}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520963"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1490544454, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "+ Challenging\n+ Concept\n+ Pixel Graphics\n\n- Annoying Ghosts\n- Short\n\n\nEven though this concept may not be original, it is something I rarely see in games even for mini-games. Last time I remember a game like this was on Neopets. Which is the reason I decided to get the game.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging which is what to be expected from a puzzle game. However some levels seem easier than others before it but that may just be down to how your brain works for puzzles, clicking with some solutions better than others.\nThe pixel graphics are simple of the eyes so you know what to concentrate on without any real distraction.\n\nI must say I love how you have to think outside the box not only for some puzzles but for other ways to solve the puzzle so one side can actually run freely around, very clever.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nMy only gripe with the game is on some levels you will die, alot due to trail & error as well as some levels you need to remember where the ghosts were. But because you will often die due to the timing of the ghosts you will hear them laughing alot in a short time frame which is annoying. You can only turn off the background music and not their voices.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThat is pretty much it, it is a simple puzzle game, if anything others may complain it is too short but that depends on how quickly you can figure out how to do the levels and execute them to work. Your time is your own intelligence.\n\nIf you want a short yet simple game to pass the time then give this game a shot, it does not cost much and maybe you could reply the levels to see if there was a faster or better solution.

Nothing hardcore at all, but still challenging. Don't think you can underestimate it, it'd kick your ass otherwise. \n\nSOUNDS: every music and sound is licensed. While the choice for the music is well-made, the choice for the sounds is not good as well. You could be tempted to turn them off.\nSTORY: it's a very short game with only two cutscenes, one for the beginning and one for the ending of the game, that explain a little better the little lore behind the characters and their motivations. Wasn't expecting nothing epic, but still the final twist surprised me a little.\nGAMEPLAY: the game has 20 level+3 bonus levels. It constantly introduces something new on the table, a new mechanic, a new danger, new enemies. The majority of the puzzles are pretty good.\nCONTROLS: this is a sore spot. The game does not support gamepad, but in the end you need only 4 buttons on the keyboard: WASD (or the arrows). Often you'll press the direction button too early and the character will turn direction and reach the tile before the one you wanted to reach. This imprecision will lead to frustrating deaths because of the programming of the game.\nGRAPHICS: The graphics are good, not excellent, but very cohesive in their simple style. Everything on the map is easily recognized. Very good.\n\n\nI finished the game in less than 2 hours with the bonus levels, and I haven't still found a super secret within the game that is hard to find.\n\nGood Game 8/10", "recommendationid": "30775532", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1490695192, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502226658, "num_reviews": 17, "steamid": "76561198041753179", "num_games_owned": 496, "playtime_forever": 586}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1486839968, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "**.4 Review and Playthrough**\nThis game is an awesome puzzle game. It challenges you to simultaniously solve two puzzles and it also makes every move you make an extremely calculated decision forcing you to strategically plan. \nI highly recommend you check this game out. The difficulty scales great, the puzzles are intuitive and constanly build on previous level solutions. Puzzles can be frustrating at times but the game is never unfair, you are always left with a feeling of the answer being just right in front of your nose.

First of all a seperate settings or options button in the main menu, it's required in every game so I think this one should get one too. What annoyed me a little bit was that everynew level you have to wait a solid few seconds, which doesn't seem like much, but it gets pretty annoying.
