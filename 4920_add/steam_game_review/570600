In order to get a good multiplier you need to be fast and accurate.  \n\nI'd recommend this game specifically for working on your ambi-shooting for other games.  I know my left hand doesn't seem to shoot where my brain tells it to sometimes.  This game definitely helped me work on that.\n\nAs it is (early access) there isn't much to it.  I definitely don't think it's worth the $9.00 they are asking for it right now.  But if you can pick it up on a 50-75% off sale, it could be worth your time for a some cheap wave-shooting thrills.\n\nAs a caveat, I'm recommending this game if it's deeply discounted AS IT IS NOW (6 Jan 2017).  They may have a patch that comes out tomorrow that breaks this or makes it amazing.  So, take it for what it's worth since.. you know, Early Access.\n\n", "recommendationid": "29062921", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1483717489, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483403080, "num_reviews": 65, "steamid": "76561197972966291", "num_games_owned": 4448, "playtime_forever": 6}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492886"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
