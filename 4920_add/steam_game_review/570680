It was the last official Zork game released and one of the few graphical ones.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nBeing released in 1997, this game does show it's  age, particularly during cinematic cutscenes. However, despite being 20 years old, and at a reduced resolution, the graphics hold up well during standard gameplay.\nThe graphical style is panoramic 360 pre-rendered 3D images, similar to the Myst franchise. As such, it requires very little processing power, which is always a plus. The cinematic cutscenes feature both 3D CGI and live action, and are quite charming, despite their now low quality.\n\nTLDR Graphics: Nice, but heavily aged\n\n[b]Sound[/b]\nZork GI features plenty of voice acting, plenty of sound effects, and a nice instrumental soundtrack. Good quality that should have no issues, despite the age\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nAs mentioned above, this is a point-n-click adventure. Although in a 3D style, it functions like a 2D game. You click on arrows to move to the next room, or to interact with your environment or inventory. it mostly features clicking or clicking an object to select it and another to try and use the two things. Quite simplistic, but even an older, inexperienced or casual gamer will have no problem playing this. It's 90% mouse/trackpad and barely any keyboard.\nThis game is very puzzle oriented. That being said, simple controls belie a deceptively challenging puzzle game.\n\nTLD Gameplay: You basically just need a mouse\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nThe story, in typical Zork fashion is quite ridiculous, funny, clich\u00e9, but charming. To avoid spoiling much, basic plot is a tyrannical leader by the name of Mir Yannik takes over the land of Zork and outlaws magic, to make way for his regime in the scientific age. He imposes insane laws on the land (and suggests that you FLOSS REGUARLY) and vows to destroy any magic contraband. You, the player, happen upon a brass lantern early on, which contains the trapped soul of your travelling buddy, the former Dungeon Master of Zork, Dalboz of Gurth. He is basically the magic king. Your job is to travel to the Great Underground Empire of Zork (which is literally underground) to recover 3 ancient artifacts, that will have the power to restore magic to all of Zork: The Skull of Yoruk (I knew him well), The Cube of Foundation, and the Coconut of Quendor. The game is broken up into several definable chapters, but the second part, the main part, takes place where you and Dalboz the lamp explore the underground in search of these relics. This will be about 80% of the story.\nArmed with a magic lamp, whatever you find and can carry, and a small assortment of saved magic spells, you point and click your way to victory!\nThere are many callbacks and references to all the old Zork text games that an old fan can enjoy, and even if one has never played a Zork game, the story, game, and jokes can be enjoyed all the same.\n\n[h1]Final analysis[/h1]\nZork Grand Inquisitor is an old game, but very fun for old Zork fans, and new payers alike. The controls are easy as can be, but the puzzles are pleasantly challenging, providing a fun, memorable adventure in a fantasy setting. This version runs in something comparable to an emulator, meaning that it can run on modern machines fantastically. \n\n[i]Fun Pointless Things to Try! \u2665[/i]\n[list]\n    [*]First saving, intentionally get yourself killed! The old fashioned text descriptions when you die can be quite humourous.\n    [*]At any point, try typing MIKESPANTS while playing. Fun little easter egg.\n    [*]Examine everything under your magnifying glass in your inventory, Dalboz, your partner can be quite the wisecracker.\n    [*]Try casting the spell [spoiler]Kendall[/spoiler] on a book you find called [spoiler]How to Win at Double Fannuci.[/spoiler]\n    [*]In the game you will find three [spoiler]totems.[/spoiler] Try [spoiler]sending everyone of them through every time tunnel! They will be out of place in some for humourous effect.[spoiler]\n    [*]Near the endgame, try casting your spell, [spoiler]Lidibo[/spoiler] on [spoiler]Dalboz.[/spoiler]\n    [*]When tampering with the [spoiler]Totemizer Machine,[spoiler] try [spoiler]sending yourself to every destination, with AND without the Perma-Seal. SAVE before doing this ;)[/spoiler]\n    [*]You are told not to [spoiler]Throck the grass.[/spoiler] Do so anyways. (Save first!)\n[/list]\n\n[i]One last note...[/i]\nIf you have played the old text games, or have heard of how unforgiving the old text adventures are, worry not. Grand Inquisitor keeps standard Zork difficulty, but it is impossible to 'break' your chance of victory. This game is much more forgiving than the classic games.", "recommendationid": "31333773", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493011466, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493013727, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198051440262", "num_games_owned": 123, "playtime_forever": 117}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560643"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
