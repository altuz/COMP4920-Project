Personally I felt like Gujian 1 was too difficult. \n\nThe gameplay is alright (which is already an improvement over the first Gujian). The music is pretty good. Personally I think the story, while not as intricate as say Xianjian 4, is still quite a bit more intricate and well-planned than most RPGs today. It is also filled with quite a lot of melancholy.\n\nHowever, you do need to know Chinese to play this game since right now there is no English support. Further, it does take quite a lot of knowledge to figure out the plot (just knowing basic words probably won't cut it since the style of language used is rather classical).", "recommendationid": "35161254", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506192771, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1522, "last_played": 1506183133, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561197995993650", "num_games_owned": 310, "playtime_forever": 3239}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510022"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1505402054, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "\nI more focus on the negative of currency game, hope the furture update can fix those problem\n\n1.
