While I still cannot get Steam achievements, this is but a minor issue that will not distract me from enjoying the game. \n\nOn the game play, its a \"classic RPG Chinese game\", which may appeal to some people. For me, the strength lies in its story plot, story-telling and music. I must say that the story really appeals to me. You do need to understand Chinese to be able to enjoy it, and the Chinese used in the game is somewhat ancient, like those Wuxia novels (or Chinese swordfighting novels). But there is a certain beauty in that type of language. \n\nThe downside is the slightly slower pace as compared to some other games. The main story plots are voice-casted, which is one reason why the pace is slower. But if you enjoy a good story being told, you probably will tend to overlook the slower pace.\n\nTLDR: If you understand Chinese, enjoy a good story being told in a masterful manner, you will enjoy this game. But if you cannot stand slow pace games, you will do well to stay away.", "recommendationid": "34861823", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505198829, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 258, "last_played": 1506786449, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198025571544", "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_forever": 2856}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508081"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505090957, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Saved game gets corrupted and you won't even notice it until you are about to load. \nVERY frustrating!\nfixed already", "recommendationid": "34874105", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505150266, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505587102, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198339408412", "num_games_owned": 26, "playtime_forever": 2783}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507229"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505078536, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Can't load latest game saves after playing 10 hours.
