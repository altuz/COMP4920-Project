Not as good though and barebones. I suppose you could compare this style of shooter along the lines of Time Crisis but in VR. You're planted in one place and must clear the baddies and you travel to the next point of the map, and so on. So a wave shooter with changing scenes if you will.\n\nVisually it's pretty decent, the gunplay is okay. Your armed with a shotgun and automatic rifle along with unlimited ammo with a couple of seconds between reloads.\n\nThe game does feel a little unfair, although you can physically move around your space, theres no artifical movement so ducking for cover is just out of usable reach so your mostly in the open while the enemy run and hide behind things. It's the biggest flaw for me. You'll need a 3+ metre square play area to reach most cover. Mine is over 2 metres squared. This is the games main flaw for me.\n\nFor this low price you should be able to get your money's worth and you'll probably enjoy if for a short time, but overall it's a generic shooter without much depth or imagination.", "recommendationid": "32327405", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1497128082, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497126111, "num_reviews": 111, "steamid": "76561198020445786", "num_games_owned": 779, "playtime_forever": 10}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504551"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1491697813, "votes_down": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Aweful..yeah yeah it is 5 dollars, shut UP please about that newbs, this game isn't worthy to reccomend a GTX 1080 lol. Bulltet Sorrow has wayyyyy better graphics at more than half the gpu usage. SOOOOOOO not good. Also, no cover system, fun is not there, game is like one of the most boring VR games i've ever played.
