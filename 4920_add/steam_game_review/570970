Then it's right back into another fight.

It's a great continuation of the ideas in that game, and while it can seem pretty tough at first, in part due to the minimal explanation of new game mechanics (and that \"Barbarian Brothers\" inspired battle will frustrate the button-mashers out there), once you get a handle on things it becomes a hell of a lot of fun. Yes, there are certainly some bugs at the moment, but Crian Soft have shown a serious dedication to their games in the past that puts most other developers to shame, so I have no doubt that these will be fixed soon enough.\n\nFor the uninitiated, I'm genuinely torn between recommending Arena or the original Age of Barbarian; Age of Barbarian has some light rpg elements (you increase character health and unlock moves as you progress) and a gentler difficulty curve, despite being a really tough game in places - like some of those optional boss battles (the Basilisk still gives me nightmares) - but Arena is cheaper in price, has a better character selection, and a greater variety in terms of gameplay styles. At the end of the day, if you like the look of the trailers then you'll likely be happy with either game, particularly if you remember the 8-bit Barbarian games from the 80's, or have a soft-spot for those cheesy 80's barbarian movies.
