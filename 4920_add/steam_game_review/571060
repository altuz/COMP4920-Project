The plot involves you entering an ancient, run-down temple and learning about the plight of four great alchemists who have been trapped in a state of purgatory by an evil presence called Nemesis. Of course, like many great adventure games, things are not as simple as they seem.\n\nIt is a great game with tough but fair difficulty, no arbitrary deaths, a great little story, excellent cutscene direction, and really interesting and varied locations. If you take notes you should be able to beat the game without restoring to a guide, but there are also many guides online if you need to cheat. It is well worth the $5.99. The graphics are pre-rendered backgrounds with live action FMV playing on top of them, which at the time was very exciting and cutting edge. Also very nice music and sound effects, they really made the most of the 3 or 4 CDs the game shipped on. \n\nCompared with other games in the genre, it has a darker and more sinister tone. It's not quite horror, but at times it's close: for example, one segment involves you decapitating a cadaver with a guillotine and hooking up the severed head to electrodes. This is not the light-hearted comedy of the traditional Zork games, although there are jokes here and there.\n\nTo the second question, I think the quality of the port is mixed. First, the game was released in two versions: Windows 95 and DOS. This is the DOS version, emulated through DOSBOX. There are no achievements, trading cards, gamepad controls, graphical settings, etc. Moreover, the DOS version requires you to use keyboard commands to save (Ctrl+S), load (Ctrl+R), exit (Ctrl+Q), and set options (Ctrl+P) because there are no menus. Please read the manual before you play to help with this. There are two minor technical issues -- some slight sound crackling, and mouse sensitivity is way too high. The bulk of the game is navigated through panning your field of view with the mouse, and so high mouse sensitivity makes it difficult to control. You can set it to a lower sensitivity in the preferences, but even on the lowest setting, it is too sensitive. This appears to be a the GOG.com version, which also suffered from these issues. \n\nThere is also a question of the game holding up. It runs at 640x480; the FMV overlays are highly compressed, interlaced, low resolution video. Some of the game's beautiful visual designs look blurry or low detail because of the resolution, and there are a handful of puzzles where you must be very very precise with the mouse because click targets are quite small. This is definitely not modernized or ready for 2017, so I would recommend you be sure that you can handle something feeling dated before you jump in. \n\nI highly recommend the game. The playtime listed above is until completion on a replay; someone playing for the first time without a guide would be looking at probably 10-12 hours, maybe a little more.", "recommendationid": "31328397", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493012870, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493013163, "num_reviews": 26, "steamid": "76561197999584737", "num_games_owned": 3341, "playtime_forever": 442}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554516"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 11, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492643487, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is another challenging addition to the Zork universe that takes a more somber tone punctuated with good humor. As a Zork game, the puzzles are again often very difficult and sometimes convoluted. As I iterate with other Zork titles, you are not a failure if you look around for hints. Just give it a fair shot, preferably with loved ones and pad and paper, then go online and look for pushes in the right direction.\n\nThe story is nice, the acting is pretty good, and the atmosphere is immersive. The animation for the time was gorgeous. Altogether a very atmospheric, well-put-together game.\n\nP.S. The nudity tag is from art nudity and hardly explicit or frequent.\n\nP.P.S. While there is substantially less peril and fewer opportunities to \"lose\" the game by breaking the wrong item, etc., save from time to time.
