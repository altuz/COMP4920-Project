(reversing takes longer than simply floring it to bounce out so it's not really an option either\n\nIt feels like you increased the difficulty too as I did grab a bronze before and now my closest time is about 1 sec. off on one of the easiest tracks, that I never did play a lot of the similar games way back when doesn't help of course. (I am also a hood view type of gamer which also handicaps me a bit)\n\nOverall it's been improved quite a lot and I'll keep it installed and see how things move along occassionally.", "recommendationid": "29525031", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486923297, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489525675, "num_reviews": 81, "steamid": "76561198138101163", "num_games_owned": 152, "playtime_forever": 37}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506373"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
