My favorite part of the game mouse trap, and also domino ralley back in the day was setting up the dominos and knocking em' down. This game brings me back to that feeling of joy again. The plus is, this is without the task of cleaning up all the pieces afterwards which is fantastic!\n\nThis isn't just a create your own setups and do what you want kind of game at first \"level creator is unlocked later\", but there are pre-built levels with patches missing, and your tasked with connecting the chains from the start to the finish and doing your best to get as many stars that you can with the available doninos in your inventory. It takes creativity and though to evaluate the board before hitting the first block and watching, \"fingers crossed\" that you will get the three stars. This is a timeless VR experience for kids and adults alike. 8/10", "recommendationid": "28950788", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1483381331, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504390995, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561197972610271", "num_games_owned": 224, "playtime_forever": 46}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513224"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1482463227, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I love this game!
