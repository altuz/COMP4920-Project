SNK has always been standup and forthright in their gaming structure never trying to screw every last dime out of their audience and the fact that they do something simple like put the words \"Thanks for Playing\" at the end of the game really puts the emphasis on the fact that the game is here to be enjoyed. Absolutely Smashing! Brings tears to my eyes! I always dreamed about this level of detail and modeling as a kid and it's finally come true!\n\nMy one biggest gripe though is that I do occaisionally get screen tearing at 4k on ultra.
