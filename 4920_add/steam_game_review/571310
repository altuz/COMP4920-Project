In the game you play as Dot, a robot who\u2019s goal is to find her friend Rusty and to discover what is causing many dangerous earthquakes in the valley. Along the way you will meet fellow bots to help guide you on your adventure.\n\nImage & Form really stepped their game up with this one, they\u2019ve listened to the complaints with the first game and made sure not to make similar mistakes, for that I applaud them. All the hard work created a beautiful and mechanically satisfying masterpiece. SteamWorld Dig 2 plays a lot like a Metroid style of gameplay except with ya know digging, you can explore and make bank or stick to the main story at hand, it is up to you and your playstyle.\n\nOh boy the music in this game, let me tell ya, it\u2019s real nice. Walking into the hubworld for the first time made my ears dab with elation. A lot of tracks in the game fit the locations and atmosphere perfectly, at least it gives you an incentive to keep your lamp aflame when digging, if ya don\u2019t then things can get a bit spooky, real quick. The visuals they\u2019re great, just look at the trailer and see for yourself, they\u2019re freaking gorgeous. There are some sections in the game that made me stop and go \u201cwhoa that looks insane\u201d and I\u2019m sure others would agree when seeing it for the first time.\n\nDifficulty isn\u2019t too high, however, it is much higher than the previous game forsure. Enemies in this game actually have attacks and can feel threatening when encountering them for the first time which is pretty awesome. There is a place from the previous game that has been completely reimagined for SWD2 and holy cow the enemies in that level scared the bolts out of me, I had no idea I was stepping into Resident Evil: Robot Edition. Was a really terrifying and badass experience, had me on edge the entire time.\n\nPros:\n-Graphics are really really nice\n-Music is down right awesome\n-Much longer than the first game if you 100% everything\n-Upgrades, lots and lots of upgrades\n-Did I mention Graphics? Cause those are pretty darn good\n-Collectables with hilarious descriptions to find\n-Actual story \n\nCons:\n-Some platform sections can be a bit confusing on where to go\n-Still wish it was tad more difficult but that\u2019s just me\n-Should be a stat screen after beating the game to help speedrunners\n-Fen ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\nConclusion:\nDo I recommend this game? Absolutely, this one is far more superior than it\u2019s predecessor in every way shape and form. Image & Form said \u201cYOLO\u201d and put all the effort into this game. These guys really knocked it out of the park and I hope their future projects are as fun as this one.\n \nIf you loved the first game then you're in for a treat.", "recommendationid": "35222086", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506436057, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1790, "last_played": 1506437204, "num_reviews": 33, "steamid": "76561198021454753", "num_games_owned": 771, "playtime_forever": 1790}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555615"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 46, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506087839, "votes_down": 20, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "What a great game 10/10\n\ndont miss the older version on Origin (On the House) for free!", "recommendationid": "35128134", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506087839, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "7", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 931, "last_played": 1506360493, "num_reviews": 15, "steamid": "76561198045223183", "num_games_owned": 174, "playtime_forever": 931}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550999"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 18, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506497775, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you liked SteamWorld Dig, you'll love SteamWorld Dig 2.\nIf you loved SteamWorld Dig, you can't miss out on this.\n\nThis is a sequel in the best way; it is nothing but great improvements on the original game.\n\nBetter movment abilities\nBetter upgrade system\nBetter character interactions\nBetter exploration\nAnd many more great secrets and puzzles. \n\nIt's not a large game but that's not a bad thing as it doesn't overstay it's welcome.\n\nGreat fun 10/10.\n\nI'm doing a blind let's play over on my youtube channel, so if you're interested in seeing the start of the game (or more) then you can check out my playthrough's play list here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoEzRww9YfiE0ugTqqmB1VqNTddwTWYjm   \nThanks.", "recommendationid": "35237314", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506497775, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 203, "last_played": 1506169334, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198037778794", "num_games_owned": 196, "playtime_forever": 203}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536806"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 52, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506072549, "votes_down": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Awesome game! if you loved the first one but felt like it wa slacking a little, you will absolutely love this one.", "recommendationid": "35123847", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506072549, "votes_funny": 4, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 176, "last_played": 1506834039, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197981837367", "num_games_owned": 113, "playtime_forever": 176}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539960"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 29, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506189770, "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Steam world dig 2 is a metroidvania and nothing more. If you're familiar with this genre you know exactly what to expect.\n\nPersonally I have tried many metroidvania games and I don't really like them. They're neat and kind of clever but not really that much fun to play. The only metroid games that I do like are the original ones.\n\nSteamworld dig 2 is a game that I do like. Not because I'm a metroidvania fan or I like the steam world games per se. I like Steamworld dig 2 because it's so well made. It's made by people who loved it. It's a child that grew up in a happy family. \n\nExploring is fun. Upgrades feel meaningful and let me explore new places and reach spots I couldn't before. There is some sense of excitement when I get a new toy. For me this is the meat with metroidvanias. Exploring and feeling good about upgrades. \n\nThe game is fairly easy, at start at least, but it's challenging enough that I can't just play without thinking. Which is a very good thing. But it's easy enough that I don't have to restart from the starting area every 5 minutes because I died. \n\nI would warmly recommend this game to people who enjoy metroidvanias and like the steam world game series.\n\n*disclaimer* metroidvania is a game where you explore a non-random world (often in 2D) and gradually upgrade your character's abilities and gain access to new areas and secrets *disclaimer*", "recommendationid": "35160166", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506348171, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 455, "last_played": 1506692707, "num_reviews": 20, "steamid": "76561198009907235", "num_games_owned": 234, "playtime_forever": 455}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526309"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 15, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506220482, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Steamworld Dig 2 is all about progression. You start the game with a pickaxe and walljumps but by the end you have a jetpack, triple grenade launcher, flaming pickaxe, and all manner of life preserving upgrades. \n\nMovement feels good after you get a few upgrades, there are a few quirks to mining that may tick people off (you can't hit blocks while you are jumping) but taking some time to learn the game if you weren't already a fan of Steamworld Dig 1 will help. Tip: Stand on the edge of a block to hit a block that is one further away than where you can normally hit. \n\nBacktracking to complete earlier caves isn't a pain thanks to the transit system or the constant need for more money to spend on upgrades. \n\nYou are heavily rewarded for being on the lookout for hidden passages and secrets. There are caves (puzzle rooms) towards the end of the game which will test your agility, timing, and sometimes patience, yet you always complete one feeling just a little proud. \n\nThe visual style is charming and the music is adequate. There is a large variety in visual design for the places you explore, to name a few: nuclear-irradiated underground forest, apocalypse god worshipping temple, and a very cyberpunk-inspired robot graveyard. \n\nI highly recommend Steamworld Dig 2 and also 1 if you haven't already played it, it's considerably shorter than 2.", "recommendationid": "35168966", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506260984, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 722, "last_played": 1506266133, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198000179729", "num_games_owned": 759, "playtime_forever": 722}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519059"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 14, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506198729, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Completed the game in about 8 hours.

There are very few gimmicks which are not used to their fullest potential. The levels also don't use the players tool to their full potential.\n\nEnemies - (3/10) Very simple and boring AI. Not that many variety, not that many bosses. Everything kind of works the same. So many enemy types missing that would complement the block type gameplay.\n\nStory - (5/10) Predictable all the way.
