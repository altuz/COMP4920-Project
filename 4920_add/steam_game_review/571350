I like the art style and gameplay, it all seems easy to learn but hard to master. As of now there are multiple patches coming with new content soon. Here is to hoping it doesn't stop there.\n\n\nI realized after posting this review the reason this game reminded me so much of Bloody Walls is because it is from the same Dev. If you liked Bloody Walls I strongly recommend you try this game, or vice versa. \nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/531960/", "recommendationid": "29539493", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485608299, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486272301, "num_reviews": 1403, "steamid": "76561198045381877", "num_games_owned": 156, "playtime_forever": 443}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505842"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 8, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485556632, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So yeah. Mixed feelings on this game. The primary combat system consists of pressing m whenever the combat bar is on the green bars. It is kind of like that 1970s Troll gameshow, only in this you are getting shot at and die before you have killed three baddies. \n\nThe game has balance issues in that the baddies can shoot you when you stand right next to them and you cannot shoot them in return. Your character has no ability to take cover, only move and shoot. The reloading time is not my favorite, it loads like a shotgun (IE one bullet at a time). There is a glitch that if you keep pressing M, you will not die until everyone in front of you is dead. \n\nIt is free and in Beta, so there is time to fix things, so I am going to recommend the game and review it after they have worked out the kinks.", "recommendationid": "29529644", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485558995, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485556487, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561197998157086", "num_games_owned": 213, "playtime_forever": 5}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497643"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 19, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1485551256, "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Controls like hot garbage, UI is a mess, and there's this slight lag whenever you try to select anything in the menu.

Don't expect to go into this game and just mow your way through enemies (like I had first expected). You have to learn how long the enemies take to shoot you with each weapon, dodge out of their kill range, and take aim to get better crits. The game is definitely a challenge, which is what makes it enjoyable.\n\nThe art style is very nice and fits the game, and the music is fast and energetic. Being in early access, it still has its glitches [strike]like holding 'M' keeps you from dying until you kill all enemies in range, and if you stand against the wall where enemies spawn, they get stuck on you and you can shoot them without getting hurt. None of these are game breaking and are easily avoidable if you don't purposefully do them. [/strike] *Fixed*\n\n\nAll in all, I would recommend DED for anyone who likes a challenging game with simple controls. The updates look promising, with achievements, bosses, and perks planned. And the developer seems to listen to the community so far, which is a huge plus.\n\nPros:\n- Nice art\n- Simple controls\n- Challenging\n- Freeeeee\n\nCons:\n- Not enough locations (they all sort of look the same so far, but I'm sure that will change seeing the screenshots)\n- Not enough weapons\n- Controls on the menu can be a bit annoying (hint: press esc after changing volume)", "recommendationid": "29583978", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485803336, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485803623, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198044197107", "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_forever": 168}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496890"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485808304, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I'm ded.", "recommendationid": "29592326", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485808304, "votes_funny": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485808284, "num_reviews": 28, "steamid": "76561198011483913", "num_games_owned": 691, "playtime_forever": 8}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511337"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 8, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485594736, "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "DED\n\nIm waiting for it since 1 mounth, now its released!\n\nHere is my Review\n\n-Graphics 10/10  i love the pixel style\n-Gameplay 8/10 \n-Fun  7/10   Needs more Locations \n\nSo, my only problem are the bugs(but its early access) .. the switch from left to right is not everytime good.
