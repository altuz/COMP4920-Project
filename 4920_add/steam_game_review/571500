If you have experience with dabbling with manual mode, this is also worth picking up since it's quite curious to see how this game emulates the settings and see how this develop and as well give feedback on how this game differs in real life so the dev can improve this. \n\nI could see this being very useful to be as a teaching aid to encourage beginners to dabble with manual/shutter priority/aperture mode to expand their flexibility on taking shots.\n\nWhat you get for now (I'll constantly update this part as the game progresses):\n- 1 world/scene\n- Around a dozen of objects in the scene\n- Dusk time only\n- 1 Camera with the following features:\n    * Aperture control from f/1.4 to f/22\n    * Shutter controls from 1/125 to 1\n    * Screen emulates final photo you will capture (motion due to shutter will be emulated)\n    * Lens focal length from 6mm-150mm\n    * Aperture/Shutter/Manual modes\n- Only 1000x700 photo capture resolution\n\nCurrent issues I see:\n- Ugly bokeh on larger apertures\n- 1s exposure emulation is broken\n- Ground elevation not smooth so you get those weird sensation that the floor changes.\n- Distortion on wide lens feels wrong", "recommendationid": "28523594", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1482400613, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482408172, "num_reviews": 85, "steamid": "76561198046980920", "num_games_owned": 6257, "playtime_forever": 37}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509129"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1482340756, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "As a photographer, I was really curious about this VR application so I downloaded it to try it out. I thought it might be not only a fun virtual sandbox, but also a fantastic way to teach friends about different camera settings. \n\nIn short: It is fantastic in concept, although a little light on content but that is to be expected. It's clever, interesting, easy and most importantly a pretty accurate simulator for the concepts. I can't wait to see how this plays out and I have tons of suggestions and ideas after just a short session. \n\nCouple minor issues:\n- the intructional text on the dock is easy to end up standing on top of when trying to frame close on the flame spinner and it is unsettling. I thought my Vive ground setting got borked for a moment. \n- Up until 1 sec exposure things are pretty accurate and look like the Liveview or Mirrorless viewfinder in a real camera. At 1 second it gets a little strange. I understand the desire to preview, so maybe the preview could be a toggle as a real camera doesn't show you a preview of what will happen. You have to shoot to see the trails, for example. I can see value in both. \n\nGreat work, this could be a priceless photography tutorial platform worth paying quite a bit for when it is fully fleshed out.
