No, really. \n\nIt's nothing special though.\n\nSo this is just another Neptunia game on steam. If you have played previous Neptunia titles (namely the Re;Birth series), then it is very likely you will find yourself at home here. But if for whatever reason someone buys and plays this one as their first game in the series then here is a short rundown:\n\n- It's a JRPG\n\n- Lots of girly girl characters\n\n- Lighthearted humor and dialog\n\n- Lots of fanservice\n\n- \u00f6\u00f6hSIISNiinkumit\u00f6\u00d6\n\nThere are some unique aspects to this game compared to other games. The main difference is the battle system. In this game you no longer get to create your own combos. When in battle you have a gauge that fills as you take actions (e.g. attack, skills, items etc.). Then there's the fever gauge. It fills as you deal HITS or the enemy HITS your party. \n\nI don't know about game engines, but if I were to guess, I'd say this game uses the same engine as the Re;Birth games just slightly modified. I say this, because it seems to have some of the same bugs or similiar ones that are present in the aforementioned games. The game may crash after playing for around 2 hours straight. The game may also turn a specific character into a black pixel-y pulp.\n\nIf the game looks and sounds like the game you would enjoy and you are fine with the bugs it has, then feel free to buy it (or don't if you're young and your parents restrict you). \n\nNow for my thoughts about this game.\n\nAll the new features and things excited me in the beginning. However, the more I played the game the less I was entertained. This is mainly because many things in the game are very simple or just monotonous. The battle system for instance: It's all fun and games at first, but then you realize that you just move in front of enemies and spam attack.\n\nAnother new feature is the job system. They give you new class based skills and stats. Would be a good idea, if they were somewhat interesting. There's no point to having multiple classes if there's just gonna be one class that's better than everything else.\n\nThen there's the story, if you can even call it that. It had its twists but overall it's pretty generic stuff. Some things about the story are never revealed to you unless you get the true ending. [spoiler] I quite literally forgot that a character couldn't remember anything until it was mentioned again at the end of the game[/spoiler] Luckily, the true ending is not difficult to obtain this time around.\n\nOne thing I was very disappointed about was the fact that you can't use anyone except IF and the other new character as your party leader. What a bummer.\n\nOverall I'd say it is a very underwhelming game. I had plenty of fun with the Re;Birth series, but this just doesn't manage to capture that feeling. I probably shouldn't compare this to the main series but it is pretty close to them graphically and mechanically. Even comparing to other spin-off titles I'd say this is one of the worst. Atleast the other games try new things. This just...\n\nwell...\n\nis.\n\n[spoiler]IT'S STILL BETTER THAN MEGATAGMENSION NEPTUNE + BLANC VS ZOMBIES WITH ITS BUGS AND INCREDIBLY SHORT CAMPAIGN[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]ALSO, COULD THE GAME DEVS STOP RECYCLING SO MANY ASSETS AND DUNGEONS?? PLEASE??
