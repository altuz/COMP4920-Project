A lot. Like, every ten minutes or so. Often, when backing out of menus with Esc.\nIt runs at 546x416 windowed, or fullscreen. It doesn't have any window zoom settings (like 2x), which is a shame because it looks ok when it zooms to fullscreen.\nIt's keyboard only, which is cumbersome for a tactical game.\nThe translation is incomplete (e.g. Magic Potion: R\u00e9cup 30%).\nThe game does not explain itself well: I can buy items at the shop, but what do the numbers mean? Why can I move my own guy twice, but the other party members only once (first Inn fight)? I get a sword, but I need to explicitly equip it, even though I have no weapon.\nIt doesn't autosave before a fight.\n\nThis last point breaks it for me, because I don't want to replay it yet again after it crashed on me in this fight.\n\nI did like the writing so far, but considering I didn't get very far, this doesn't mean much.", "recommendationid": "29121529", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1483896330, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483895680, "num_reviews": 220, "steamid": "76561197988012862", "num_games_owned": 3564, "playtime_forever": 48}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534023"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1484246128, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I like the game and the concept. However, I'd like to point out a few things that have caused me to not recommend. Hopefully you read this and make some changes to the game itself. I hope I can come back here and change to Recommend instead of Not Recommend. \n\nESC Key - Very out of place for having to bring up menus and such. If able, I would advise giving us the option of remaping keys to our desired set up. \n\nAlthough not directly explained, You can attack more than once and use skills more than once on certain characters. This would help if there was some prompt somewhere explaining this. I may have missed it myself, and if so apologies. \n\nHP/MP recovery after battles at the very least. You don't heal after fights so make sure you heal up before the next fight. I hope you guys can fix this.\n\nThere is a bug that I encountered that broke the game. The bug causes your character to constantly go up (North), which prevents you from going down (South). If you tried to go back to the menu, you will find that it has disappeared, forcing you to restart the game. No Idea what caused it and if I can reproduce the bug, Ill be sure to report the steps.\n\nAll in all, I like the game and the story. There are just to many flaws that can't be overlooked. If you can fix them, I'd be more than happy to give you another review on an updated product. \n\n~Chao", "recommendationid": "29208712", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1484246128, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484271628, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198322200057", "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_forever": 244}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511602"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487738678, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Okay, so i would say its better than the other RPGmakers games. controls are abit wanky but its alright. get it on sale though", "recommendationid": "30092880", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487738678, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487738602, "num_reviews": 29, "steamid": "76561198012035595", "num_games_owned": 317, "playtime_forever": 25}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492103"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
