Its fast paced and really gets you moving, an aspect I really enjoyed coming from a game.  I also thought the slow motion was awesome, felt like I was in the Matrix or something.  The game was difficult at first, but once you get comfortable and remember the right buttons, it really opens up and becomes really great.  Don't freak out if you suck the first round, it gets really fun really fast is all I'm saying.  I would definitely recommend it, especially if you want to mess around with some friends.  Super funny watching people dodge and dance around.", "recommendationid": "34362251", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503189237, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502853190, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198090286878", "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 170}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
