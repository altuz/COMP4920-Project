I went on the editor to try to mess around and I got stuck quick, I would like to see sort of like a welcome video or a basic tutorial as it doesn't tell you much.\n\n- Host Options. When I host a game and I accidentaly miss out in writing something I think \"well sh*t\" because now I have to re-host the game which is a pain; I would like their to be a way to edit the titles and the amount of people allowed in the lobby, just for the sake of time.\n\n- Server hosts. This would be a *huge* addition to the game, investing in like 5 servers would help out the game a ton. I'm suggesting they put a COD type menu where after a game you can still stay in the lobby and you can vote for the next map (the maps can be the most rated in workshop) to help with the flow of the menus. Although this is a big ask I would an extra $4-$5 for this and I think others might as well; the server hosts would also help with the connection.\n\nPro's/Con's of the game:\n\nPro's:\n\n- Fun and easy controls\n\n- Has an in-game editor and workshop\n\n- Customization (a little limited)\n\n- Ability to play online or single player.\n\n- Has an active community\n\n- It's more laid back and chill\n\nCon's:\n\n- The search filter doesn't save so it's a pain to search for games without passwords.\n\n- Limited ball customization.\n\n- Editor is very hard to use if you are new to map making.\n\n- There are barely any servers there so its hard to find people to play with.\n\n- Lots of out of bounds glitches.\n\nOverall this is a very good game and I have had a very fun time playing it, and would recomend anyone to buy this as long as they are not on a laptop trackpad.
