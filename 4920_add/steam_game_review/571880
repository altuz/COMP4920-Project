It really swept me up and captivated me, and I found myself really falling in love with the world and the characters. It is not easy on your emotions if you let yourself become invested, but everything I learned, every time I let a character down, every bittersweet alternate ending I earned, it all spurred me on and made me that much more determined to find a way to fix things and make it right for everyone. It's been a really long time since a video game, or any story for that matter, has pulled me in so completely. This game has made me break down sobbing my eyes out several times.\n\nBut... this is a good thing. This game has really made me Feel Things. The writing is great, the characters are incredibly rich, and the more you play the more you learn what you need to know and do in order to make it right. This is an incredibly rich interactive story full of sweet and wonderful dragons that you find yourself really caring about and wanting to do right by. Brace yourself for an emotional rollercoaster and some heartbreak if you get experiencing this game as deeply as I did, but if you stay determined it rewards you.\n\nThis game has done things to my heart.

I've done a couple previously, but after everything I went through in my time with Angels with Scaly Wings, I knew I had to write something. I wasn't sure what I had to say though, so instead I decided to tell about my experience with this game. No spoilers, of course.\n\n... So I tried to tell about my experience with this game. Unfortunately, I had so much to say that I actually ran out of typing space in this review. Let me sum it up easily, then.\n\nI was drawn in by the idea of dragons as characters. What I was given was a handful of amazing, wonderful and very relatable characters. Characters that I genuinely cared for. I was also given characters that I genuinely hated. Ones that made me swear and curse at my monitor, something I haven't done since Handsome Jack in Borderlands 2. Not even to the extent that I did in this game.\n\nI was also given a gut wrenching story. A narrative that tugs at your heart strings at any moment it can. A game that's not afraid to give you hope and happiness, and then suddenly rip that all away from you in one fell swoop. It's a story that will sometimes bring twice as many questions than it does answers. Sometimes you need to come up with the answers for yourself, because this game doesn't always tell you everything you need to know.\n\nAngels with Scaly Wings was an emotional rollercoaster from beginning to end. You have to prepare yourself for that, and you have to push through to discover every secret you can. Do this, and you'll be granted an incredible ending that was absolutely worth the time. I hope that the developers add some DLC to this game, because I'd love to return and say hi again to all the amazing characters I met.\n\nIf there was a Dr. Modalot seal of approval, I would certainly give this game one.", "recommendationid": "34999562", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505574939, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505718040, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198005397993", "num_games_owned": 770, "playtime_forever": 914}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507447"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504661002, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game, all of my feels...\n\nSo I've played nearly 8 hours already in 24 hours, 2 hours when installed, 6 more when i woke and continued, and I can't hold all these feels.

If you read its Steam description carefully, you will see that it has not been explicitly advertised as one, but you could be forgiven for having that impression from some of the screenshots and Steam tags.\n\nWith the most important caveat out of the way, we can get to the actual plot.  Well, plots, really.\n\nThe main plot of the story is essentially a police procedural (but with dragons).  As with many visual novels, the plot is not gameified; there isn't much in the way of winning or losing here, unless you're playing for achievements.  As a result, this part of the game has almost no replay value.  You're not trying to win anything, so once you have seen the ending, the only part left is to explore the options you missed last time.  You do learn a few new things, and in one or two cases you can get better outcomes.  But there aren't any major reveals because they don't know which options you'll take the first time, and can't risk spoiling the ending.  The good news is that the developers knew this kind of material could be really annoying to click through when replaying, so you don't have to do that.  The game makes it easy to skip through anything you've already seen, without accidentally skipping things you haven't.  As a result, the lack of replay value in this section is unfortunate but does not drag down the rest of the game.\n\nAs the tag \"Dating Sim\" suggests, the rest of the story is focused on meeting and getting to know a few of the main characters in each playthrough.  Some of these characters have optional romance scenes, but not all of them.  The emphasis is on companionship rather than sex.  Unlike some dating sims, AWSW mostly fades to black rather than showing anything explicit, although there are a couple of suggestive images here and there.\n\nThe term \"dating sim\" is problematic in its own right.  If you click on the Dating Sim tag, you'll notice that it spans everything from shooters to visual novels, and everything from horror to comedy.  Outside of Steam tags, I have also seen it used to describe \"normal\" games like Mass Effect (actually, I'm pretty sure everything Bioware ever made has been called a \"dating sim\" at some point).  In the case of AWSW, it does have a grain of truth to it, since there are failure states for all of the characters (i.e. you can make them hate you).  In some cases, you can trigger these failures quite easily, with relatively little hinting that you're doing something wrong.  But it doesn't matter, because the game specifically encourages multiple playthroughs.  With the benefit of hindsight (and enough replays), you can befriend anyone.\n\nA game like this will largely stand or fall on its characters, especially given that it specifically wants you to make friends with all of them.  Personally, I found them a heartwarming and likable bunch.  You probably won't love every single one of them, of course.  They're a diverse group, and don't always get along with each other.  But they have all been well written, so the average player will take a strong liking to at least one or two of them.\n\nUnlike the main plot, the side plots have a great deal of replay value, and not just because you get to meet more characters.  The gameplay has a bit of a Majora's Mask feel to it, in that you're repeating through the same events, never able to help everyone in the same playthrough.  It's a bit depressing at first, but the game finds ways to improve on this formula.\n\nThe true ending is reasonably satisfying.  Most of the bad endings are quite painful to watch, as are some of the \"good\" endings.  This is deliberate, of course, and well executed.  The only major problem here is that most of the endings are nearly identical for large portions.  The game's skip functionality works as intended here (except for one brief scene which is ever-so-slightly different in each playthrough but still similar enough to annoy), but it further robs the game of replay value it could have had.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the time I had with this game, but I feel like it squandered some of its potential.  While AWSW certainly has more of a plot than a typical dating sim, it still feels less like a story and more like a vehicle for character development.  If a sequel is made, I hope it goes further, with a less linear plot and greater emphasis on player agency and story-relevant choices.", "recommendationid": "35144825", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506144990, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505801839, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198025483090", "num_games_owned": 375, "playtime_forever": 847}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505974295, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Angels With Scaley Wings is the FireFly of visual novels\n\nExperiencing the entire thing once is truly fantastic, and it's one of those games that you can enjoy once until you forget about it, then replay and get just as much out of it.\n\nThe characters are so rich and full of life, each with their own story and hardships\n\nI cared for each of these characters, and seeing all the game had to offer made me so happy to see their growth.\n\nThis game is a 10/10 for me.
