I opened it up  and became instantly addicted to it.  Puzzle Dimension is a fun, casual, puzzle game.  It is challenging, but not impossible.  The game has a tutorial, but you probably won't need it-  the rules are simple to learn so you will be in the game in no time.   There are many levels, to keep you playing for a long time.  If you find that you have made a mistake, you can quickly restart the puzzle and in a few seconds you are back in.  That feature keeps things moving and keeps frustration at a manageable  level.   You can use your keyboard or a gamepad (my preference) and swap the backgrounds.  Puzzle Dimension is well-designed and a steal at this price...I highly recommend this game."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1492280754, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507868", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31162129", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198037826188", "num_reviews": 23, "last_played": 1492280957, "num_games_owned": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1367}, "timestamp_updated": 1492280754, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I won't lie, I loved this game. It is a simple puzzle game, that has a pleasant difficulty curve. The premise is that you are a ball and you have to collect sunflowers in order to open up a portal, which when you go through ends the level. The game starts with normal tiles and easy paths, but soon starts to introduce special tiles, like inviseible, bouncy, snowy,... which make for some interesting levels. To me this was a game that I always went back to when I listened to youtube videos, or when I wanted a quick game. I think it's worth the price and that it definetly deserves a place on steam."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1496599293, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32181788", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_reviews": 1973, "last_played": 1496599194, "num_games_owned": 4956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1505087891, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Tags: Casual - Marble Routing\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Does not launch at all.
