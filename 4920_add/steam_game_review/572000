(Sorry, Smokey!)\n\nMy only disappointment is that while I spent at least 4 minutes (this time around, I will continue) trying to beat him with a chair, for the life of me I couldn't hold onto the bloody thing long enough to get a well made WWE style smack out of it... I swear I felt like I was too drunk to hold the chair properly for all it got me.\n\n\n\nSeriously though. The morphs and physics on Rump's face work amazingly well with a satisfyingly proper amount of jiggle. If you hold the controllers parallel to your wrists like a claw, using either your pinky or thumb to hold the trigger, it adds some more realistic \"I punched this motherf***er in the face\" feel to it. Some of the textures could be worked on, or a skydome added, but you know what? This thing is free, and beyond satisfying, especially since it got me off of my lazy arse for a while. \n\nPlease, if you do future updates, LET ME HIT HIM WITH A CHAIR! Or let me attach the dongs to a chair and get him in true [strike]gangbang[/strike] impeachment style.\n\nIf this is not in your library. Shame.
