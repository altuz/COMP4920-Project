Some sentences are spelled horribly wrong. The sound effects and the graphics are bad there's no music and you can't do almost anything rather than jump ,walk, find keys, open doors, and sometimes you might find a Pistol and a Zombie in a room which are placed there to make the game look better I guess. Every single room is a square withh just corners and there is even untextured walls and floors. The game is fully released though so it would make no sense to do something like that. The death animation is bad the walk animation the jump animation. Everything pretty much.\n\nMy opinion is this game is not worth it's price and not worth to buy. I didn't like the game at all.", "recommendationid": "34420129", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503422050, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502468492, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198272803875", "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 45}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501543"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1503658205, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Don't buy it , it's like one of google play's crappy games. I was expecting something but i'm disappointed. there is no mission, no storyline, only a girl  collecting keys while running away from zombies. jump doesn't work properly, there are no parkour elements, Also there are two guns( i think. haven't finish the game since i'm out of patience) you can use with very limited ammo. Aiming is sh*t.Doesn't give that feeling.. 3/10\nPlease developer. \nI see a potential, but with unreal engine 4 and paid assets? no..\nIf you're serious then shut this project off, do something better , find yourself a people to work together, and start new projects.
