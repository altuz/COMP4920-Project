The original disc would even work in a CD player, for example you could play the music in a car. The music is an original orchestral soundtrack, and it is quite good but short, because of limited space on a CD. The Steam version includes the music in OGG format, but it does not work in game. An external player is required.\n\nMusic aside, the Steam and the disc versions work perfectly fine on Windows 10 and 125 hz polling rate for me. I had mouse problems at higher polling rates.\n\nCall to Power 2 is the second and final Civilization competitor (clone) made by a very different Activision than the one that merged with Blizzard. In fact this very game almost bankrupted Activision, and it shows. The development of game was released content unfinished, it is very buggy for its time, support was quickly dropped, and the development team was dissolved. However, some developers on their own time helped the Apolyton community try to understand and modify the promising game. A long time after, and yet a long time ago, a much healthier Activision released the source code, but as it was stripped of all comments, perhaps the full potential of the game has never been realized. Nonetheless it allowed a very extensive overhaul of the game, the benefits of which can be found in the Apolyton Edition, which maintains the game content as released, but few mods. But since the source code was released so late, and then so much time was required to put it to use, many more high quality mods never saw the benefit of these finishing touches.\n\nGameplay is actually very different from the Civilization games. Compared, Call to Power 2 is far more streamlined with constant and smooth progression through the ages. The tech tree and in-game guide called the \"Great Library\" is where this game really shines. It is much more mature and realist than Civilization games.", "recommendationid": "31270064", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1494080804, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493356062, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198017855615", "num_games_owned": 377, "playtime_forever": 401}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530253"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 8, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1493006108, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "great game, but the apolyton patch is almost mandatory. grab it here http://motmod.ctp2.info/ctp-2-apolyton-edition.html\n\n", "recommendationid": "31332967", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493006108, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494397362, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561197966777581", "num_games_owned": 201, "playtime_forever": 1042}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517675"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492746082, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[h1] PLEASE READ THIS FULLY[/h1]\n\nPlease find the section regarding your operating system.\n\n[u]Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1:[/u]\n\nYour game should start fine, but the intro video won't play right away.\n\nHow to fix: Go to the steamapps/common/Call to Power II/ctp_program/ctp/ctp2.exe location. Put ctp2.exe into Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode.\n\nThis hopefully will fix this issue.\n\nI've noticed there is times when the cursor stops moving. Looking into it.\n\nOkay, based on my testing, if you have a high DPI mouse you may need to lower the DPI setting to slow the mouse down. I tested my GoG copy and it has the same issue. (I have a Corsair Scimitar.) Honestly, while slowing down your mouse may suck, it may be worthwhile to prevent the cursor from stopping.\n\n[u]Windows 10:[/u]\n\nHoo boy, this is fun. Guess what, you're game isn't going to start.. At all. It's just going to sit and eat CPU cycles without doing anything. [Edit: someone mentioned their copy worked on Win10, this may be a case by case basis]\n\nHow to fix: Navigate to steamapps/common/Call to Power II/ctp2_program/ctp/winmm.dll\nRename that file. \n\n[b]THIS WILL BREAK THE MUSIC[/b]\n\nHowever, you game [i]should[/i] start. This is not a 100% process I believe.\n\nI have tested both methods. For me they worked. I broke the winmm.dll and launched with steam.

If you are running Windows 10, there is a playlist on youtube of the music you can use, but I would suggest using caution before buying.\n\n( I played this game through GoG, this is how I know about these issues.)", "recommendationid": "31268087", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492929917, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492746361, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198042973026", "num_games_owned": 113, "playtime_forever": 14}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512012"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 10, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1492716993, "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I'm an owner of the original call to power, when it still had civilization on its name before the rights were taken. That game was probably one of the most fun I've had as a child, and was my introduction to strategy based games along with age of empires 2, and I have no doubt I'd spent more than hundreds of hours on each. \nI never got around to playing its sequel and had eventually forgotten about it until I foundthe activision's classics sale , in thoughts of buying for the nostalgia, as I've heard the games were just about the same, which ultimately I did.\nI don't remember the game being this terrible.\nIt runs like utter crap, as oposed to the original. It is slow and choppy, does not work at a suitable framerate, the HUD is somewhat similar to the prior game, and had I not have some prior knowledge of how it worked, I would've deemed it just as intuitive as the gameplay.\nThe game also presents some issues. The one I found most upsetting was how I couldn't ALT+TAB away from the game or it would crash.\nAs for the graphics, maybe you should take it with a grain of salt considering it's an old game, but ultimately I feel the need to express that it looks horrendous on an 1080p resolution as this wasn't so much the case on the original. It still didn't look good, but it wasn't as eye cringing as this one, and it was definitely playable. Besides, when it came to options within the game, I would have expected some improvement towards graphic settings, but the most you can manage is turn off certain effects in the game and change your resolution which is very disappointing.\nHonestly, I'd stay away from it. Perhaps there is some mod that can make it run smoother, but I shouldn't have to be searching for that to have a fully functional game. If you're still interested however, I'd advise you to go look for a copy of the original.
