Taking in consideration this game was totally made by just one person, which means design, programming, music, sound effects, the game plot, story and some other points on, I'd like to say:\n\nPros:\n-The story plot it's very clear since the beginning until the end;\n-The graphics aren't the best in the world, but like this, it give us some of the \"gore\" aspect of the game;\n-Some scenes are shown, they are very interesting and very realistic;\n-The insane state it's very awsome;\n-And, for people who like to see some jumpscares, the game have a quite.\n\nCons:\n-Overall game shadows, some of the item, are pixelated and the protagonist character \"us\" doesn't have a shadow;\n-The game puzzles and such as discovering items are way very dificult, the game has a lot of \"stuckers\";\n-The enemies that exist in the game are way too powerful and we need to find ways to kill them (This can actually be an interesting thing, up to each one of you, hehe);\n-The batteries are not renewed after you die, that means, if you die a lot of times, you end up without battery.\n-The lockers actually are there, but they don't have much usage, since you can only hide in them before you get noticed by the enemies.\n\nAnd that's all! Thank you so much for this game =)", "recommendationid": "29823572", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486738290, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486940861, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198019963194", "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_forever": 1020}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495966"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1502179070, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I tried to get on with this game but its just annoying.\nIf there is anything on the floor like boxes cones etc I get stuck, in episode 2 I find myself in a dark room and there are 2 doors which say I need a key or break the door down great I find an axe and a key and then a dog had entered the room luckily for me I have an axe, but NO the axe doesnt touch the dog having tried 4 times to hit the damn thing.\nSo the Deadtruth is I cannot recommend that you buy this its a Dark Path Ahead to annoyance and frustration.", "recommendationid": "34098122", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502179070, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502178484, "num_reviews": 152, "steamid": "76561198062085771", "num_games_owned": 212, "playtime_forever": 108}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
