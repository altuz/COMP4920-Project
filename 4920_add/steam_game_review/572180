The mechanic of the blaters being based on time, and not ammo makes the player really think about how they are going to tackle the next hallway they run through, and if they have enough time to reach the next ammo box without being knocked down by the adorable Zugs. Zoey, the protagonist, is a nice nod to Pac-Man, but stays her own, with her quips being a nice touch. I recommend this game for anyone who wants to take a nostalgia trip back to the arcade cabinets of yesterday, or anyone who wants to have fun playing a simple but challenging game.", "recommendationid": "29832223", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486759901, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486762236, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198207212043", "num_games_owned": 19, "playtime_forever": 59}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504752"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487178005, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Zap Zone is an extremely fun game, almost got it free from the card values alone.", "recommendationid": "29945341", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487178005, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487191695, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198121858442", "num_games_owned": 429, "playtime_forever": 222}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502969"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1486780897, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's just like playing Pac man with a whole new twist I don't see too many Pac man clones either but this one has more challenges that adds on to the game I would play it again and have to guess where the Zugs are at sometimes I run into them that I didn't know they was in that area", "recommendationid": "29837331", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486780897, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486771779, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198092329358", "num_games_owned": 122, "playtime_forever": 50}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497411"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487422444, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I just started to play this game and it is already a lot of fun.
