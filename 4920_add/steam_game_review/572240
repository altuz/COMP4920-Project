High 5 to the developers. Much like Snake, Rattle, and Roll. One of the most underrated classics from the Nintendo Entertainment System and also the Sega Genesis which systems also had BattleToads from the same developer Rare which shared the same type of isometric graphics and game engine. \n\nLooks, plays, and, feels like a modern version of the original. The controls work just great with my Xbox 360 gamepad. I feel like I am playing the actual game all over again. \n\nMy only complaint is no 2 player support. It's tough to beat a classic. At the same time for this low price I am out of my mind. And with over 30 levels I'm also noticing the levels getting more fun and challenging rivaling if not surpassing the original.\n\nVery happy to see this available. And even more happy its really good and a really good tribute to a classic. Now bring on a BattleToads remake!", "recommendationid": "34006640", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502590170, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1507080213, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198165480221", "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_forever": 216}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508369"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1503031961, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Colorul adventure packed with puzzles, sort of old-school - but in a positive way.
