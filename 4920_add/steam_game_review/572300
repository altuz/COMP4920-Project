Anyhow.)\n\nIt's an easier version of Elder Sign. \n\nWhen you first dive into it, both are just as hard. Once you get used to it though, you'll find that the food system and the ability to choose from random d8 sets largely eliminated the two most lethal things in the Elder Sign setup. So once you get past midgame, usually in Elder Sign you'll be half dead and probably fully dead soon, but in Nyheim you'd be strolling through the park waiting for it to end. The additions of EXP-based bonuses only makes it even easier, especially the \"more food\" and \"more item\" ones.\n\nStill, by itself it is a pretty good boardgame, and the beginning can still kill experienced players every now and then when they misjudged things. \n\nTakes a couple hours or so to finish a game, good for every now an then.", "recommendationid": "33474860", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499849625, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499415810, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198031767908", "num_games_owned": 4048, "playtime_forever": 210}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 27, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 22}}
