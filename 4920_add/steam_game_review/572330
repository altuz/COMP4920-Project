You leave the lair to collect from her and her boyfriends apartment  eight items .  Once you collect the eight items .  by pointing and clicking on  photographs to represent both apartments to find the four items  in each apartment  you then go back  to  your  lair  click on the girl and the final scene of the game slide show happens . \n\n\n After having played through it twice to get two possible endings   I did not feel a need to play through it again .  I am going to give this game a positive review as their is nothing technically wrong with it   but due to the extremely short gameplay. I suggest you purchase it on a sale for about one or two dollars .   and a warning of sorts even though their is some  violence  there is no nudity or sexuality in this game ,", "recommendationid": "34519874", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503804619, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503799779, "num_reviews": 63, "steamid": "76561198141804718", "num_games_owned": 162, "playtime_forever": 177}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498466"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1503657094, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I really liked this game and enjoyed every second of it.
