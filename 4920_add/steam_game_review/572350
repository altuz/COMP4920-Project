I will leave that to your imagination.) \n\nI didn't notice if there was a way to export my models, but it would be cool to be able to have the system dump them as *.obj or *.stl so we could use our company 3d printer to actually make the ornamants. \n\nOverall it was worth the few dollars and would reccamend to a friend with a Vive.", "recommendationid": "28589564", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1482575517, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482576013, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198164432610", "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 17}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498640"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
