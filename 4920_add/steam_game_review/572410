Contrary to a negative review, an AT gun unit that had a shot across the bow is well capable of still returning fire, although it may be impaired somewhat.\n\nThe units on both sides are varied enough, and although, as historically, they have counterparts on both sides (the german stostruppen and allied assault teams), playing different divisions and either axis or allies brings a different feel to it.

The mechanics are great, and combined they provide a very fun and different gameplay than anything else.\n\nFor example: \nThe frontline mechanic offers so much more options than capture points. Maps will still have strategically advantagous positions, but if your opponent wins the inital fight for the position you aren't forced to bash heads for the rest of the game. If he overcommits to one spot, simple go around him. Press in other places and attack from the flanks or even concede the position altogether. There's nothing forcing you to play by your opponents rules. This alone is a huge selling point and makes the player think about what he's really trying to accomplish.\n\nThe point system/battle phase is well thought out as well. Your spending points income is fixed, meaning nothing can happen in-game to allow you to earn more or less points to spend on units. Amount of points you earn changes in each phase, and each division will earn a different amount of points. Some divisions come out strong but have a weaker late-game, while other divisions start slow but ramp up as the game goes on. In other game's resource systems, starting on the wrong foot can snowball and put you at more and more of a disadvantage when you're already losing. That doesn't happen in Steel Division. In fact, when the front lines move closer to your spawn, it's an advantage in that units don't need to travel so far to get in the fight. This results in much closer games in my experience so far.\nThe phase system is also great. Some units can only be called out in later phases. This means that players need to be competent with the entire range of their division's units and makes the battles more dynamic as equipment gradually changes over the course of the match.\n\nThe divisions mechanic is pretty cool too. Go through all the available divisions and pick one. Then you can customise your division. There's a certain amount of slots you can fill with card decks. Each deck is one unit but there may be multiple cards of that unit in the deck. It gets really interesting, for example, do you choose one Tiger tank in phase B or do you wait unil phase C and get two of them? Or maybe you want them both and you'll sacrifice something else! Building and refining your division is a lot of fun, especially if you're playing with someone else and you can taylor your divisions to complement each other's.\n\nNo bases. Simple enough. If you call out a unit it comes from a road on the bottom of the map. But not just 'your road', it'll start from whichever road is closest to where you want the unit. Many players will divy up the map into areas of resposibility, but it's not necessery because your units can get to the left side just as quickly as the right side without fixed spawn points. The way I play with my friends is we won't have designated areas, but we'll all be everywhere as to multiply the effect of our combined arms. To me, no bases and no fixed spawn points makes the game more fun. If I wanted 'my side and your side' then I might as well play singleplayer because I'll never see you anyway.\n\nThe AI is good and will challenge you. This isn't a game where you can just set up all your fancy units and watch the ai run single file into the killing machine. If you want that then this isn't your game. Steel division will keep you on your toes. It's nigh impossible to camp as the AI will counter your cute little dug in troops with air, arty, and a big push that comes at ones instead of the tactically retarded single file lemming trains of other games. \n\nBe prepared to think about things as you can't just move troops up and expect to make ground with 'overwhelming firepower'. That's just not going to happen. You'll need to make objectives for yourself like 'I want to move up to the next road on the right\". From there you can plan on how to make that happen and how to hold that ground after you take it. All the while you need to be thinking about how much you can spend on said objective without compromising other areas too much. Combined arms and scouting is king. Each push is deliberate. Scout it, soften it up with arty or air, move infantry with their support weapons in, and back it all up with light or heavy armor. Each division will have it's way of attacking but the point is that it needs to be thought out and executed deliberately.\n\nI like to play vs AI with my friends without it being campy or too easy. I recommend this game to anyone who plays similarly to me.\n", "recommendationid": "34844749", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504984862, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 968, "last_played": 1507093164, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198024480521", "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_forever": 3181}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503399"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506190424, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The best game Eugen Systems has released so far (yes, I think it's better than RUSE).

This puzzles me because when Red Dragon was released, many fans were very dissapointed with the naval mechanics and there was a lot of negativity around the game. Many said RD was a waste of money and players should stick to the previous title, Wargame: Airland Battle, so now that Steel Division has come out, some players say to play their previous game.\n\n     Any talk about how it's a \"dead game\" is flat out wrong. I will create lobbies and they will almost always be filled in under 10 minutes. The only gamemode which suffers from a lack of players is 10v10s, while I rarely play them, I frequently see 10v10s stuck with 10-18 players. Furthermore, the 10v10 problem isn't even exclusive to Steel Division! queueing up for 10v10s in RD takes just as long! \n\n     Many complaints people have about the gameplay are just them being ignorant of how to play the game. By no means is it Wargame, and it should not be played as such. Steel Division is very much a 'Rock Paper Scissors' game. If you are getting fucked up by some scissors, don't keep playing fucking paper, and adjust your frontline composition accordingly. The units take awhile to reach the frontline so this requires planning and preparing for what your enemy will bring.\n\n     Complaints about balancing? No game has ever had perfect balancing, and the devs try their best to adjust the balancing as they see fit. Every battlegroup can be countered, but sometimes, the other player is just better than you and there isn't much you can do but learn from your mistakes and adjust your battlegroup for the next game. Each battlegroup is as good as you play it. \n\n     Complaints about map variety? Look up some pictures of Normandy and you'll see how it looks. I find complaints about map variety funny because people who complain about not enough map variety also complain units don't have historically accurate stats. That's just a huge contradiction, if you want historically accurate units wouldn't you want historically accurate maps? As far as the maps go, there is plenty of variety but the numerous hedgerows are a re-occuring theme throughout the game.\n\n     Veteran RTS players and newcomers alike, I highly reccomend you look past many of the negative reviews because many of these players simply aren't willing to learn the new strategies that are different from wargame's (you can't heli rush). I reccomend a purchase to anyone who is on the fence because of the negative reviews. RTS's aren't for everyone and if you don't like the genre then you won't like this game. I encourage Wargame players to make a purchase. Also, you can always refund games you don't like so if for some reason you don't enjoy the game just return it. \n\nTL;DR: Many complaints aren't warrented and Wargame players are mad that this isn't a wargame sequel so they flood with negative reviews.

You certainly get the bang for your buck, and the studio behind this game already have plans to release tons of free updates, as well as of course priced DLCs, which judging by the first soon to come, will certainly be worth their fair prices.\n\nOnto the game itself. One thing you will find very quickly is that scouting is a crucial part of the game, as is balancing between offense and defense, as well as artillery and support in the form of aircraft and paratroopers. The unit maneuvering and flow of battle reminded me of the Men of War series, but on a larger scale than MoW and with more focus on battlefield maneuvers than induvidual unit management (I should note that there is no resource management whatsoever - you recieve points relative to the amount of the map you control). There is no base building or villager management, as everything is done using a simple points system that accumulate over time. The AI is very competent and will use combined arms extensively to counter your units if you don't take your time to plan a strategy. They will certainly kick a new player's butt on medium or hard the first couple of times. Adapting your force to new threats and moving units around to where they will be most useful is key to victory. Establishing a defensive line before making a forward push is very important, as even the heavist of units can easily be wiped out due to poor reconaissance and lack of planning. Teamwork is also vital, and supporting a struggling teammate is very important, since a flanking counterattack from behind your front lines can completely decimate your forces, killing them or forcing surrender and securing that much more of the map for the enemy.\n\nThere is also a great deal of customization, allowing you to pick real historical divisions that fought in Normandy and assemble your forces out of a massive variety of units used by said divisions, all the way from a puny Schwimmwagen to the mighty Tiger II. Present factions are the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS on the German side, and the Americans, British, Canadians, Polish and French on the Allied side. In terms of mods, I highly recommend downloading the excellent \"Storm in the West '44\" mod if you want more historical accuracy, as well as setting the in-game resource income settings to the absolute lowest value in most games as this creates the most strategic and challenging experience and prevents any kind of unit spam.\n\nOverall, really great WWII strategy game with plenty of customization, variety, and tactics. I would recommend this to fans of the Men of War games, or perhaps the battle portion of the Total War series, as well as those with interest in the WWII period, as those are the games which came to mind first when playing this. Do not play if you're wanting a more straightforward game based around a few ironed-out strategies and a frantic pace, such as Company of Heroes or Age of Empires.\n\nFinal Rating: 8/10", "recommendationid": "34852070", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505013465, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 377, "last_played": 1506822543, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198044362910", "num_games_owned": 84, "playtime_forever": 1649}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503741"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 8, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506211115, "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I love this game, but ....
