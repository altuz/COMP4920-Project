I really dig the visual and the background music but I wanted the SFX to be much improved :)\n\nI already play the game alone and together with  three other friends. I might say that the game is very difficult and extremely punishing (you start from the beginning if you lost). The tactic when playing alone and together is vastly different. While it is easier to move alone but no one covering you which means that you need to move a lot. When playing multi player, your friends can have your back but the room of movement is fairly limited. Hopefully, the developer can address this problem.\n\nAll I can say is that the game have potential, and looking forward to the full release version.", "recommendationid": "29979936", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487321944, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500527164, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198102807112", "num_games_owned": 230, "playtime_forever": 229}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515855"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
