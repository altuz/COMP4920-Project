Managing a small team of 3 rigs (heroes) at once, and as the sole player for your side, the pace of a match becomes far more reliant on your ability to micro and macro-manage on the fly. I love this idea in concept, even if in practice I'm really poor at it!\n\nYet that's the compelling part to Dropzone. Where I'd quit a normal RTS for being far too overwhelming, this strikes a kind of positive-frustration in my brain. I feel like if I just play a match every other night, I get a little better. Not like, MLG Pro status, but better than I was a week ago.\n\nWhile I can't comment too much on the lineup (still working on the first 3 people I picked), I do like that individual characters only seem to influence ults. Other abilities are based on that character's class, and are interchangable with a wide array of class-specific unlockables. This means you can taylor a team to your liking and, even if you have the same characters as your opponent, may still end up playing differently from each other.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this to anyone who likes competitive games, moreso to those who are deeply familiar with either RTSes or MOBAs. And bonus, I've seen that it's going free to play soon!

There is no variety in weapons and pilots too. They are all the same essentially. You can slap most parts on any rig so whats the point in even having different ones?\n\nTerrible map design, both visually and functionally. There is nothing on the map other than watchtowers and hives that are all the same and a droppoint in the middle. Droppoint is literally 1 screen away from each teams resp, which means enemy will just walk there and become invincible/heal up all the time. Its impossible to kill someone unless they are horribly overextended.\n\nGame is basically 1vs1. It's boring and devs seems to understand that. As a solution to that they added a 3v3 mode in which each player only controls one rig. Which turns the game into the worst moba ever created possibly. I assume, cuz i couldnt find a match for 3v3 mode. \n\nThis game is 1/10 with 1 point for an original idea. Everything else is an insult.
