I'm not quite sure what to call that genre heh... maybe the construction foreman genre? Anyway, it's the pretty common casual game genre where you order a bunch of workers to build, repair, collect resources, and generally terraform a bunch of one screen maps as quickly as possible. Lots of examples, no good name for it. This game is one of those, and it does that fine. It's part of a series, with the distinctive bits being you have weather related spells to clear certain obstacles and enemies, and to reload resources for your workers to collect. Some items also have to be crafted from menus while you're managing everything else. Anyway, solid enough, and the achievements all work now after a patch.\n\nIt's a quite divisive casual genre; some people utterly despise these, others like them. I'm in the latter group. This title won't change your mind either way, but it's a better than average example if you do like them.", "recommendationid": "34003389", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504095773, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "5", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504094835, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561197983563701", "num_games_owned": 4698, "playtime_forever": 1127}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523600"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505217415, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Another great addition to the Weather Lord series and thankfully this one has Steam Achievements (C'mon Devs, surely it wouldn't be too difficult to convert the in game achievements to Steam Achievements for the couple of games in the series that don't have them, after all most of the work is done and it's guarenteed to increase sales) - sorry. side tracked.\nBack to this - Yeah, love these resource management/puzzle type games and this one is very entertaining with plenty of achievements to keep me occupied. This one seems a bit harder than the last one I played as I'm struggling to get gold on all levels on first playthrough which is a v. good thing, please, more like this with steam achievements and please, make the others all have steam achievements dev's.
