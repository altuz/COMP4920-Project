Oh man, i love it.\n\nIf you've ever played Electroplankton for NDS it has a similar vibe. However, unlike Electroplankton, beneath the surface there's a depth to Lyra's capabilities that excites me. This won't replace your DAW anytime soon but I can imagine a whole host of ways it could be very useful - if not for traditional studio work DEFINITELY for some sort of musical VR soundscape experiences we've yet to see. I'm very excited to see where the devs take this. \n\nCurrently there's a few CONS that stuck out immedietly:\n\n- Clunky Controls\n- Tutorial barely covers whats possible - It took some fumbling around to figure out that it has some powerful tools\n- Can't explore from in game my own sound libraries? (or couldn't figure out how)\n\nHowever the PROS outweight cons:\n\n- Polished and pretty\n- Little/no latency when triggering audio/samples\n- Visuals are crisp and clear (1080Ti, no supersampling)\n- As is powerful enough to make interesting and enjoyable music.\n- Fun\n\n\nAbsolute MUST BUY for 9.99 if you enjoy sound/music. \n\n\nedit:  FIRST!!", "recommendationid": "30677931", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1490231208, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495020153, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561197967050137", "num_games_owned": 193, "playtime_forever": 311}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515736"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1490361052, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This thing is awesome.

The ability to set up a default pallet for pitch colors ( I use modified scribian color scheme to sight read by color)\n    a.  this would allow me to arrange a graph in circle of fifths pattern\n2.
