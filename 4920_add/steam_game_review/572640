Nonetheless, it manages to be a fairly solid indie RPG with charming characters and a fairly interesting combat system.\n\nTo get my major nitpicks out of the way first: It's a fairly short game (by the in-game timer, my first playthrough took 5:37:22, my second playthrough took 2:49:54, my third playthrough took 1:34:11, and the postgame content took 47:46, for a total of around 11 hours for a 100% clear) by RPG standards, but not one that overstays its welcome. There's also a few puzzles with non-obvious fake hints, which I feel are somewhat unfair and likely to frustrate players, even if they find out the real solution. Thankfully, none of them are required to proceed through the main game.\n\nThe combat system is interesting, but ultimately felt a bit limited. Characters and enemies start each fight with 5 energy and regenerate 1 point per turn by default, up to a maximum of 10, with abilities costing 1-7 points. This is interesting insofar as it makes managing your energy an important part of combat and allows you to predict what enemies will do (and guard if necessary, for instance) by watching their energy bars, but ends up feeling a bit limiting by the end since abilities which cost over 5 energy will only get used on rare occasions. I don't think it really lived up to \"no boring spamming of a basic attack,\" because there's a few formulaic answers to 95% of fights that players will quickly arrive at, but it worked well enough.\n\nThe characters are fairly charming, though the choice of making the main character faceless unless you import a custom picture is a bit dubious - getting one in an appropriate size and style seemed like it would be more effort than it would be worth, so I didn't bother. Still, the three girls inspired me to go through the game 3 times to see all of their personal storylines and endings. (I'm also probably thankful I picked Aeri first, since in retrospect she was the least interesting.)\n\nThe dungeon maps are actually pretty interesting. As someone who plays more than their share of dungeon RPGs, I found them to be fairly well-designed, with the exception of the two fake-hint puzzles I mentioned earlier and the last area requiring an inordinate amount of backtracking even on NG+ with the full map revealed. Not implementing the normal 3D view was an unusual choice - on one hand, it's normally nice, but on the other hand, you often end up just navigating by minimap in those anyway - and I think it paid off for Neo Kuriyo by letting him make a dungeon RPG by himself.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend Fake Happy End to anyone who would be interested in either of a \"lite\" dungeon RPG or a \"lite\" waifu RPG, since it has some serious appeal in both of those ways but doesn't dive too deeply into either of those. Whether that means it won't put you off or it won't satisfy you is up to you, but I ended up happy with the time I spent with Fake Happy End.", "recommendationid": "32335359", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1497161628, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496995831, "num_reviews": 182, "steamid": "76561197988663774", "num_games_owned": 2229, "playtime_forever": 580}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509876"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 3}}
