This is mostly due to the character interaction and story, and not for the puzzles. I'm not the biggest fan of \"cowboy\" themed media, but I was honestly okay with this one. (Possibly because it reminded me a lot of the book/film \"Holes,\" with the Valentine/Humber romance plot.) I like the setting of this game, places like the ghost town and Mary's little shop being two of my favorites. The soundtrack is my absolute favorite of all the ND scores, and I'll listen to it frequently. I also loved Bet and Ed, even though you don't meet them, because they feel so real! And althoughI guessed who the villain was, I felt like there was propper motivation for anyone to be the villain. But I'll be honest; this one isn't for everyone. The puzzles can be attrocious (the fricken veggie picking), and some of the game mechanics can be tedious (taking off Bob's saddle EVERY TIME, and having to return it to the storage room EVERY TIME). There's also a puzzle that is pure chance, and I absolutely hate these. And if you lose, which you will, you have to jump through a ton of hoops to be able to try it again. All in all, I think I mainly have nostalgia for this one, and I still have a good time playing it today. Check it out at a discounted price, and see what you think!", "recommendationid": "30234172", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488258583, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488432636, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198260730931", "num_games_owned": 120, "playtime_forever": 192}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514019"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
