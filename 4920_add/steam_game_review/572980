Very repetitive. After a level is finished: try to guess what the Chinese interface is asking you.\nFor me, the abundance of space ships (big and large), meteors and planets, the HUD, the insanely big guns you have... it's all a bit too much info for me :).   I think Gunjack is a much better choice if you like this type of game.  But the price is low so if you are desperate for a new simple VR shooter that requires no thinking or skills, you might enjoy this game.\n", "recommendationid": "31698065", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1494580221, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494579817, "num_reviews": 143, "steamid": "76561198258022771", "num_games_owned": 371, "playtime_forever": 23}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510968"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1494610310, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a on rails VR shooter that unfortunatly isn't very fun. The gameplay in general is very limited, basically point and shoot at the enemies that don't really do much against you, they just mostly float around until you kill them, not very engaging or fun. The voice acting is pretty subpar, sounds design doesn't sound very punchy or noticeable, and at times there's no sound at all when there should be. \n\nGuess it looks nice though.\n\nOverall there isn't much to say, it's not bad persay, but there's nothing fun or engaging about it, and if you can't make something fun in VR, well then what's the point of making it in VR in the first place?\n\n", "recommendationid": "31706402", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1494610310, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494609881, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198102886038", "num_games_owned": 92, "playtime_forever": 15}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509042"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1495219964, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "crash crash that all happends and reset my pc", "recommendationid": "31845706", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1495219964, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495219404, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198153794962", "num_games_owned": 178, "playtime_forever": 100}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504174"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 0}}
