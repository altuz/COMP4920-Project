That's an element that's really key to any horror game, arguably the most important, and they really nailed it here. The voice-acting is phenomenal of course, where Sam Mowry and company really shine to make this game what it is. \n\nAlso, there's also a very full story associated with the game, which is something that's really rare to see as in most horror games to this day simply throw you into the world with no explanation whatsoever. The graphics aren't something to write home about, but in all fairness the game has been around for some time and somehow they fit the game just perfectly the way they are.\n\nOn the other hand, the game isn't as scary as some other games out there. Personally, I didn't mind that at all because like they say in the beginning of the game, it's important to let yourself become fully immersed in the atmosphere of the game, and sometimes in other horror games the developers try so hard to spook you that they don't create that same kind of feeling like in this one. On that same note, I do really appreciate how the game doesn't use cheap jumpscares whatsoever. Instead, you just pee your pants hiding in a wardrobe from hideous monsters.\n\nRegardless of whether or not you play horror games, give this one a shot.
