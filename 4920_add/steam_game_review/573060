It is worthwhile in the end, so don't give up on the game immediately get to know the controls and how you fill the objectives.\n\nThe base game without DLC offers hours of content to enjoy. The objective is simple; move trucks from one location to another to fill the objective. You can repair roads, upgrade industries and fill the town objectives. There are ton of achievements, that you have to earn. Yes, this game has many achievements but every achievement you have to earn. This is not a spam game, thats why I recommend it even more, it is one of the only games that I'm aware of with this many achievements that isn't classified as ''spam''. \n\nFurthermore, the developer is very active and really cares about the community. The game is constantly expanding and there are improvements to the hud aswell. \n\nAs many already said the game is very addicting. Just completing one more objective can be very satisfying, so say goodbye to your spare time. \n\nI would highly recommend this game as I think many more players should enjoy this hidden gem.", "recommendationid": "34764518", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504645056, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1693, "last_played": 1506612580, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198034758692", "num_games_owned": 415, "playtime_forever": 6986}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523871"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504941805, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is EXCELLENT!!!
