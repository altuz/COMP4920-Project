Major problem is the puzzles never increase in complexity so it feels the same throughout. It got a little boring by the end but the story is compelling so I didn't have a problem finishing it. I would recommend it on sale and for people who like want a story experience with casual puzzles.\n\nNote: I did find a bug where I fell to my death and the next checkpoint saved my progress. I had to restart the chapter over. It's easy to get back because once you finish a puzzle it doesn't change.", "recommendationid": "34275598", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502887758, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502478212, "num_reviews": 176, "steamid": "76561198006575550", "num_games_owned": 615, "playtime_forever": 204}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503018"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502224501, "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "What a beautiful game!
