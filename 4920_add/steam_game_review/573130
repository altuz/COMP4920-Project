For someone who likes exploration and solving puzzles like me, it is a quite relaxed experience.\nAt times I would have wished for some subtile hints whether or not an area is complete and it is safe to proceed, but that's just me.\nAlso note that, although there is a map available in the game, it is a) optional and b) does not show, where you are. You have to find your way around by yourself.\nSize-wise the whole map is not that large, but overall nicely done. They invested a lot of effort in lighting.\nFor me the game took about eight hours to complete.", "recommendationid": "34863807", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505055227, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505054835, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197963683045", "num_games_owned": 486, "playtime_forever": 468}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505271445, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a wonderfully freeform game that tosses you into a graphically stunning world with no idea of what's going on or even what to do - you figure that out as you go and draw your own conclusions from the bits of information you come across. The story is told entirely in pictograms and art that you discover as you explore the world, and is interesting enough to keep you wanting to move around from place to place to find more - the puzzles you accomplish along the way have a lot more meaning because of this, as compared to some puzzle games where your reward for completing them is just more puzzles. If you've played The Talos Principle you'll like this game quite a bit. That being the case it's obvious this is an indie game as there's a few weird graphical issues that appear from time to time and it's not the most stable game out there.
