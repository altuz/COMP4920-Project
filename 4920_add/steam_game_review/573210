It's not that easy and sometimes you just have to be lucky to survive. \n\nUntil the mage joins the party there is only one way to heal: pots.\nFights won't give you a lot of money and you can hardly buy everything needed. (especially at the beginning) Several overpowered weapons and armor pieces make it easier but you have to find them first.\n\nYour level doesn't matter and your equip only makes it slightly easier. This game offers you plenty of frustrating deaths and you'll have to get used to the game over screen. \n\nWhy? \nWhenever one of your teammates dies you just lose the game. Since there are one shotting enemies at the end you have to be lucky sometimes. There is also a high evasion/miss rate and some fights just feel like an eternity has passed. Enemies which attack more than once and battles with at least 5  mobs aren't rare. \n\nAt one point you'll have to enter a cave with some mobs which run around randomly. They have no given paths and could be anywhere in the dungeon. Whenever they see you they speed up and follow you way too long sometimes. Guess what happens when they get you. Ha, you die! \n\n\n\nMy savefile tells me I needed three hours and only 100 saves to finish this game.
