It is basically a wave shooter and not even a good one. Didn't have to play more in order to see this. Actually the first second you hold the plastic toy weapon in your hand you will exactly know that this game was not even worth the sale price of 2,79 EUR. Just publish games like this for free. And use the lessons learned to make an even better game. But no reason to make people pay for this.\n\nNot recommended.", "recommendationid": "32778049", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498408825, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498403963, "num_reviews": 221, "steamid": "76561198064106555", "num_games_owned": 2776, "playtime_forever": 5}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561125"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 10, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1493261772, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very disappointing, even for $5.99.  There is very little game play, same thing over and over again.  There are no menus, setup, instructions, just survival or campain mode.  Looks like it was put together over a weekend at the most.
