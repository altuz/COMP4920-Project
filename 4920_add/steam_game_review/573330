It has some flaws and first I gave it a thumbs up nonetheless since I actually enjoyed the game after I worked out how to avoid the flaws. Many small titles published for VR have some bugs or limitations on release and get fixed/expanded soon and I wanted to point out the positive. However since reviews are also recommendations I'm giving it a thumbs down as I can't recommend anybody to buy this. Here are more detailes:\n\nPros:\n- Graphics are nice\n- Music is nice\n- Control is easy: you only control the direction the eagle flies (see below under Con), no other actions necessary\n- Three game modes: Exploration (find checkpoints), Search (find blue feathers) and Race (against two AI eagles)\n\nCons:\n- Control is using your gaze: You steer the eagle by looking into the direction you want the bird to fly. While this was very common with the Occulus, for me as a Vive user I would prefere any other scheme since my neck simply is not the best way to steer the movement.\n- The game crashes after each single event. If you don't fly through the exit-loop (which exits the game cleanly) after an event but choose to start another event the game crashes and shows a crash box on the desktop which needs to be clicked using the mouse (or emulated mouse pointer with the vive controller).\n- The area/landscape is rather small.\n- First I started the game with the vive controllers inactive and the game was spinning uncontrollable (if you can't remove your headset fast enough this will cause some serious issues with your stomach...)\n\nConclusion: Most of my playtime was in the \"search\" event and finding all the feathers really required some efforts, but I enjoyed it. This is a small game and it is nice for some relaxing time and to show it off to friends and family (if they can stand such kind of movement as seen in the video of the game's shop page).", "recommendationid": "28987107", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1484155404, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505047256, "num_reviews": 35, "steamid": "76561198013020097", "num_games_owned": 810, "playtime_forever": 87}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535457"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 0}}
