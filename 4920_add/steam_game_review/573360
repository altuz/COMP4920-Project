You can't let that larger ball touch the small ball or you lose. The ballls move faster towards the tiny ball as you get more balls from the hoops. Sounds boring, but I caught myself getting really into it when I hit 15 balls. You don't have to have a lot of room at all either, which is perfect to me (I barely have enough play room).

As you go hazards appear making it harder to survive. It takes concentration, and a lot of moving around to keep it under control. While using finesse to be sure you don't hit the ball out of the play space. The only thing that I believe would make it even better is adding different backgrounds, and some semblance of background music. The one background track is interesting?.. but I feel doesn't add anything to the experience. Maybe if you survive to further levels the soundtrack kicks in, but I'm not sure. The gameplay is spot on for a simple idea, and controls perfectly. A instantly addictive game that I will definitely return to to improve my hand / eye skills. \n\n-8/10", "recommendationid": "28813265", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1483064612, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486254740, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561197972610271", "num_games_owned": 224, "playtime_forever": 30}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1483254763, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "would probably make a lot more sense with drugs", "recommendationid": "28893762", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1483254763, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484437486, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198042376025", "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_forever": 47}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1484756590, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is one of my favorite VR games for sure.
