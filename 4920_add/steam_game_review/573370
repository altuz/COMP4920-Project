How do you start a new game? I mean, even uninstalling and reinstalling starts you right where you were in the game before you erased it... so...\n___\nPROS:\nActive devs. They made my \"con-list\" half the size since I bought the game by fixing things the community needed fixed.\n\nGorgeous graphics. Their \"Advanced Graphics\" tab USED to be called \"GTX 1070\".\n\nPerformance. I have a 1070, but I get 100 fps on maxed graphics without vsync.\n\nSTORY. So far, I'm intrigued. There are obvious plot points that are blocked off because it's early access, but the story that is there is promising and unique.\n\nFantastic character customization. Not only is it aesthetic, but the game encourages you to find hidden accessories by making certain \"combinations of clothing\" supply you with perks. AKA, beenie+boxing gloves = more melee damage.\n\n\"Starting over\". Similar to how many platformer games have an INSTANT respawn upon failed attempt, you're able to REWIND time, for about 5 seconds. So, if you miss jumps, you don't have to run all the way back. And considering it's not too long, and requires battery (aka life points), it comes with it's limitations.\n\nCONS:\nNow, Combat and parkour mechanics are in the con list, but they won't be for long. Here's why.\n\nCombat USED to be very annoying, because (spoiler) you fight bugs and rats and even wasp creatures. Though, swinging your sword/weapon doesn't stop while hitting them. You'll damage them, but go right through them, so you have to turn ALL THE WAY AROUND to hit them again. They've temporarily patched this already by increasing combat sensitivity, so instead of having to do 180 degrees every 2 seconds in combat, you can just constantly turn and swing and become a tornado of death.\n\nParkour was never \"annoying,\" but it wasn't/isn't very polished. There is plenty of snapping, and it's made easy for the time being. They just rolled out a patch where it polishes it a little, getting rid of awkward moments between animations while climbing something vertically, making it quicker and increasing the games enjoyment over-all.\n___\nI'm very much looking forward to this game, but I will not be continuing it until I figure out how to start a new game. For recording, it's common to play a few minutes to see if the game will be good, (which I think it is) but now I'm stuck 15 minutes into the story without any way of showing my viewers the beginning. I'm sure there's a way, I just can't find a way, whilst actively looking for it, so making that more prominent would be nice.", "recommendationid": "29764735", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486484908, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495046061, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198146084553", "num_games_owned": 36, "playtime_forever": 184}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501893"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1486259924, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "havent played much but i am already addicted to this game. the controlls do need some polishing up, especially for controller support. but being in early access i belive that those situations wil be adressed.  for people considering picking this game up i would very much encourage you to do so.", "recommendationid": "29707814", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486259924, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486786907, "num_reviews": 17, "steamid": "76561198043938050", "num_games_owned": 210, "playtime_forever": 36}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1486188268, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is absolutely amazeing!

This one though, falls into the category of \"excellence in the making\" \nSure it's not very long, around 8% of the game apparantly, but give me quality over several hours of bug after bug. You will not be disappointed if this genre is yout thing. It's extremely well done.
