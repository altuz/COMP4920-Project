Started on earth on normal difficulty. The AI and I started sending ships back and forth from the moon and everything was ok. By the second year the AI totally vanished. No ships anywhere and they were negative a few hundred grand. The AI has no idea how to make money I guess. \n     Went and took over Mercury and Venus, then suddenly at year 2061, the AI suddenly decided to start back up and started using nothing but 1 way rockets to Europa.

This game is everything a management and sci fi lover could dream of, this game lets you be a trading tycoon who shapes the solar system by transporting goods with ever increasingly capable ships.

The game brings this out very well. It really feels like you are running the company that is responsible for the interstellar expansion of humanity. The visuals work well. The planets look cool. The ships have fun names. The line of ships you get going from home, out a colony, and back looks good. It is satisfying to see the progress as a colony develops. It feels like you are working to established permanent homes other worlds. \n\nStrategy. You have a lot of choices. You are always deciding what ships to buy, what they should carry, and what route they should take. You usually have options that are either \"cheaper and better now\" or \"more expensive and better later.\" You always have \"things to work on.\" You can choose where new colonies will go. You can tinker with current trade routes to make them more profitable.\n\n\nGood to Mixed:\nBalance. The overall balance seems good for what has been released. There are subtle changes that could improve things, and I think the devs have their eye on that. (They have made a few balance changes since the game was released and all the changes were steps in the right direction.) Later game stuff does need more work, and this is on the dev roadmap forward.\n\nReplayablilty: Generally one game versus another does progress in a similar way. You have information about what is needed and you take care of that. If Mars needs more water you buy a new water ship and send it to Mars. You can get a long way just by playing this way. That said, after a few games you understand more of the subtlties and can min/max your trade routes. I find that I enjoy trying to minimize extra costs and squeeze out maximum profit.\n\nThe UI. The UI has improved greatly with the latest patch. It seems that this is where the devs are currently focusing. It does take some getting used to, but with the new changes I feel like I have the tools I need.\n\nThe AI. I have played a number of games both with AI opponents and as the only company. Honestly, I've never felt like the AI opponents add much to the game. In games with AI opponents, they sometimes help get colonies going a bit faster, but usually I just notice them doing thing that I wouldn't do because it's inefficient. Generally they serve as a minor hinderance. By late game the AI doesn't have much of a presence. For me, the game is less about beating my opponents, and more about establishing a huge interstellar trade network. Whether the AI is present or not only affects that a little. Also, I have found games without AI opponents to be more fun. Without the AI you have more control in things like in fine-tuning demand without causing famine and deciding what colonies should get limited resourses. If playing against a competitive AI is important to you, this game might not be the right choice. If you aren't worried about the AI and your priority it to build up your trade empire, the weak AI won't hinder that. Also try playing without any AI opponents.\n\n\nReasons to wait a bit:\nLack of detailed information. Much of the financial numbers are \"under the hood\" at this point. There are ways to estimate the cost of a given trade route if you work it out. The calulations that go into how much a route earns is a mystery. The Devs have said that this is on their radar. \n\nThere are a few bugs (It's still in alpha). The devs have been doing a good job of dealing with these, but some can be annoying. That said, in my last game, there weren't any bugs that prevented me from making progress. \n\n\nOverall:\nI'm having a lot of fun. The theme is great. Bringing 500 million people to an interstellar Earth-like planet is satisfying. I find that I want to try out new strategies and maximize my income. The devs are working to make the game better, and it is improving. I certainly think it is worth the price in its current state.", "recommendationid": "35229030", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506455331, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1113, "last_played": 1506899707, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198030752471", "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_forever": 7020}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504677940, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I've given this game a thumbs up, but thats only if the game gets plenty of extra work in it. as it is, its an enjoyable game for a few hours but once you get past the new game experience, its lack of depth and flaws become apparent. I really hope the devs keep adding to the game and make a load of much needed changes and additions the game sorely needs as, as it is right now, although playable it needs a lot of love. For a economic trading game it doesnt give you enough information, it tells you supply and demand but doesnt go anyt further than saying it wants \"this\" and supplies \"this\" and although a lot of other games have done similar in the past to good effect, this game leaves you feeling unconnected and detached and not really involved in the planets success or failure. Also there doesnt seem to be any real reason to spend your own companies money on buildings on a planet as there doesnt seem to be any real positive from doing it besides from being able to sell more of that resource as the planet takes ownership of the building. To me that seems pretty stupid, I spend 290,000 of my own money to find that all ive done is made it that theres more resources on the planet that anyone can buy and I make nothing from it except what I ship myself. would rather spend my money on a ship and buy the resource elsewhere. also I thought you would be able too corner markets or even whole planets but atm it doesnt seem like you can at all, all your doing is buying a ship setting up a route and sending it off to make money to buy another ship and carry on the process without feeling like your accomplishing anything, or getting anything out of it on the whole. also atm your reputation on planets doesnt seem to have any real effect to yourself or the game at first i was buying a  headquarters on a planet thinking it would benefit me but then noticed my reputation was pretty much the same as i was delivering too on planets without a headquarters. But its not all bad even though im making it sound like it is. Its only in alpha, and the core of the game is there and it has the possibilty in becomming a great game but it needs a lot of work and attention.i doubt il play the game over the next few months, but I will come back and I am hoping the devs will of put atleast some of the things it needs into the game to make it feel immersive and like your actually doing something worthwhile.", "recommendationid": "34770285", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504677940, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504675085, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198033864155", "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 231}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505159116, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great idea pulled off quite well also intrests me as a business student", "recommendationid": "34889127", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505159116, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505161452, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198176970879", "num_games_owned": 73, "playtime_forever": 285}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505333412, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game is promising.
