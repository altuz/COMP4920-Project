I'm doing a search for the worst rated games on steam, and I came acrossed this game, because of the user rating. I don't see why this game was as bad as stated. In fact, I liked it! Please keep working on this premise, and fix some of these faults. Heres a quick run through of some problems I saw, you can correct me if I just missed something:\n\n-A drawer that I found at the start said that it was locked, I found a key. So I made a rightful assumption saying the key was for the drawer. Well, I spent a total of 5 minutes trying to find out how to use the key. 'I' was for inventory, I knew, but when I was trying to use the key for the locked drawer, I didn't know that the key for the door was for the door, not the drawer.\n\n-(dumb nitpick) the walls sometimes clip through other walls, the walls are paper thin, and the flashlight doesn't shine on some things, and the text on the notes don't fit. But none the less this is a simple thing that I don't really care about. I'm just mentioning so it's known.\n\n-Some people are pointing out grammatical errors, but I still know what's supposed to be said so I don't mind it. (I'm a fluent English speaker and my grammar can be just as bad so I don't see what the big deal is)\n\n-Sometimes random sound effects would play.\n\n-Apparently there was some intro? I'm not too sure but I thought someone said there was an intro explaining why you were in the hospital.\n\nThat's really all I saw that I didn't like, moving on to what I liked:\n\n-All the mechanics included (though kinda pointless objectively) to duck left or duck right.\n\n-I like the options to alternate between the flashlight and the nightvision, giving more options to survive.\n\n-One thing that I wish was still in the game: the bugged AI. While watching the trailer, I laughed so hard when I saw the jumpscare at the end! It's something that I wish could be added back into the game just to take us out of the game for a minute. Without the funny jumps, the game just takes itself too seriously.\n\n-I got the game for only 89 cents, that's pretty neat.\n\n-It's a standard horror game, but it does create a creepy atmosphere, and has a nice premise.\n\n-This game isn't like other washed down games that wouldn't even give the player a flashlight/night vision, this relies on actual horror not just a lack-of-sight type game.\n\nIn conclusion, if the description I gave of this game convinces you of this game, then get the game while it's on sale. I hope the developer might see this post and improve the features mentioned in my complaints.", "recommendationid": "32211553", "language": "english", "developer_response": "Hello,\n\nTo let you know, there is no intro to the game.
