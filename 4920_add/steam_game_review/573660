I read the reviews, but I love action RPGs so I had to find out for myself. And I did. This game is a piece of shit.\n\nI can get by the lackluster magic casting, the lack of a decent map overview, and the lack of variation in enemies. What is UNFORGIVABLE is the lack of difficulty. I mean the game is seriously broken and the devs have obviously abandoned this title barely a week into it's launch and turned it into a shovelware/moneygrab when they obviously put _some_ time into it (at least in the beginning of development). I mean I'm barely a third into the game and I can't die. All enemies hit me for 1 damage and I have not gone back or did any level grind of any kind. Boses die in 2 hits. It's ridiculous. I know there has been mention of this on their forum...hell, I mentioned it myself. But no response, no update...and it's too late for me to get a refund. AVOID THIS TITLE AND THIS DEVELOPER AT ALL COSTS.  The ONLY challenge this game offers is to avoid buying it. And if you read this review, YOU WIN!\n\nUPDATE: So just out of frustration, I took a level 1 character and put him into the level of the game I had achieved, and to my surprise, he was killing mobs as though it was the beginning of the game. Can the devs possibiliy know that there is ONE SINGLE DIFFICULTY LEVEL for all enemies??? This HAS to be a programming error! It certainly feels like they decided to release a completely unfinished game and then abandon it as a money grab. Who wants to fight level one enemies through an entire game?? Then a boss pushed me out of the play area (while doing only 1 damage to me for each attack), and I couldn't get back into the playfield to finish the quest.
