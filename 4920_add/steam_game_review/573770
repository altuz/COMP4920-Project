It is a fairly well-made 2D side-scroller with decent combat system, touching story, neat designs, and good music.\n\nThe combat system, while it feels a bit stiff, provides 3 different styles you can choose to your liking, features smooth combo chains that can be combined with special skills, and provides guard/dodge mechanics that enriches the battle experience.\n\nThe story, although the game is overall short, is surprisingly quite emotional with enough character development to make you like them.\n\nThe designs are pretty neat and cute to the point where people wouldn't likely think that this game is free-to-play just from the visuals. The main characters, bosses, and mobs are all uniquely designed and well-animated.\n\nThe music are unexpectedly dramatic, have a good variety, and are beautifully set up for different scenes to really amplify the players' immersion to the story.\n\nTherefore, RED is definitely quite a well-designed game overall that will likely impress you how solid and decent of an experience free-to-play content can offer.", "recommendationid": "30222344", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488263567, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488205016, "num_reviews": 22, "steamid": "76561198145055020", "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_forever": 186}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506338"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1488240553, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "When you think about it, Red tackles race issues, mental health issues, gun ownership (Red's parents gave her a pump-action shotgun at the age of 10, great parenting), discrimination, family, society's obsession with beauty...\n\nOr maybe I'm over analyzing this game and giving it too much credit. \n\n10/10 would animu again.\n\nObligatory Plug :  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UpcumXnyeU", "recommendationid": "30230697", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488240553, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488236657, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198145197827", "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_forever": 59}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487652547, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Allright im going to try my best to keep this spoiler free, but that might be a little hard becuase it's a really short game.\n\nFirst of i would like to say the game is far from perfect, but that doesnt mean its anthing but good. I rather enjoyed the  several 20-30 minute play throughs i did, and i believe there is alot of potential in this game, if it continues to get updates and more content.\n\nThroughout the game you will encounter different flaws such as the translations not being fully acurate, and maybe even a little cheesy and quite weird at some points. The combos can be a bit clunky at times. While there is a little variety, theres just not quite enough to make it a more fluent experience. However that could also just be me being crap at this sort of game. I also think they could have put a bit more effort in the characters names, and by this im not realy talking about the main character Red, i mean others that are in the story, more notably green and brown. Also there is no voice acting, but that isnt so important in this type of game i would assume.\n\nOk so that's basicly all the flaws i found with the game, except for the menu and lack of settings, but thats kind of expected in this type of game. Now lets get into some stuff i think are going well with the game.\n\nYou play as Red. A unique character that i think is a very strong point in this game. She shares her body with two other personalities, vermilion, and Camellia. They both have their own unique combat style and looks, and personalities.\n\nWhile the story is a very simple go from point A to point B, it actualy still has a pretty deep story jammed into the 20-30 minutes. You will find out the backstory of your own character and even several others. You will also come across several different monsters that all look magnificent, and bosses with their own attack patterns.\n\nThe game looks amazing with stunning environments filled filled different plants, and various things to find by pressing the space bar( This is how you unlock the 2nd ending, you have to find a specific item).\n\nThe sounds in the game are well put in, including the music. I didn't feel that it was so repetitive that i would want to turn of the sound. Like many other games out there.\n\nWhile there is no steam acheivments, and the developer has stated there are no plans to add them, there is acheivments in the actual game. The achievment option will appear in the main menu along with the challange mode after finishing the game for the first time. The challange mode is basicly just vsing the bosses over, while they are scaled in difficulty, and speaking of difficulty, there are several options to choose from. Easy,Normal,Hard,Extreame. I only managed to play on normal, and i found it pretty easy. But as soon as i turned it up to hard, i couldnt even beat the first boss, so there is deffinetly difference in what you pick.\n\nSo overall i think the game has potential and i would like to see more of it. The secret ending wasnt so good for me, becuase of how it handles the main characters. But that doesnt spoil it for it for me, it was stil entertaining.\n\nThis is my first review so it's probably not done right, but oh well.
