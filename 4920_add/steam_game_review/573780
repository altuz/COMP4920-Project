Our eyes are instantly drawn to shiny things, so when you have shiny things everywhere in front of the screen it becomes a chore to try to figure out your surroundings.\n\nThat being said if the problem of the visual clutter and slow/buggy weapon switch gets dealt with i can see myself enjoying this game.
