The materials are immensly hard to control, and milling lumber is incredibly tedious, and often/usually results in lumber missing sides. Needs copious amounts of new tools and equipment to make it reach its full potential. The price point is on par with the amount of content, i really wish this was early access and had more hope for future upgrades. \n\nMy overall consensus is: Its like minecraft where everything you love rockets out of your hands and no way to save what you build, and there is 1 kind of tree you can harvest. and no digging.\n\nPros: New angle on gameplay\n\nCons: Handling materials, falling trees have no sound, no crash. that should really wake you up when a 200 foot tree falls. really needs work on sound.\n\nNice effort, needs work before recommending.", "recommendationid": "31009105", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1491674074, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496371316, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561197964837756", "num_games_owned": 59, "playtime_forever": 145}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528833"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 16, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1491623084, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I was pretty sad to give this a thumbs down. It looked promising. As the previous reviewer said, the sound is kind of bland and the materials are extremely volatile. I like the concept but it could really use some work. Also, I don't know if it was supposed to end so abruptly, but the tutorial never had anything saying what to do next after it told me how to holster items. It simply stopped talking and I just went along and played around for about 30 minutes then got bored.\n\ntl/dr: Concept and design are cool, really boring in reality.

But for the rest, this game is bare and bones due to it's lack of actual things to do...\n\nCons :\n\n- Chopping wood gets tedious quickly.\n- Wood is extremely fragile and even a small poke with the axe will \n   completely slice it into pieces without you noticing.\n- The forest is so dense that big trees usually can't fall down without getting \n   stuck in the branches of another big tree.\n- There's only one type of wood, which seems like spruce.\n- There's only three types of chopping tools : axe, emerald axe, and a sword.\n- The emerald axe is just a re-skin, which is lazy.\n- The tutorial is just a voice recording with no text, so if you can't decipher\n   what he's saying, that's fine, because this game has \n   such a lack of features.\n- No procedural generation, the world is set so all the environments will look\n   drab and samey after a while.\n- Speaking of samey, literrally anywhere on the map looks the same except\n   for the liberty-city-esque statue and the giant lake as wells as your tent.\n- But I can't tell you where those are because there's no map/any sort of\n   navigation tool like a compass, just you and your eyes.\n- The big trees are actually hollow if you slice them in half vertically.\n\nPros :\n- The developer says he'll take minor suggestions, unlike any big game\n   studio.\n- At least there's a tutorial, some games don't have them at all. Granted\n   there's no text though...\n- Throwing axes like tomahawks is kind of fun.\n- Pretending the trees are giant monsters when they fall down is also\n   kind of fun, but not as fun as throwing axes.\n- Axes have zeroG so you won't have to calculate drop when you\n   throw.\n- Axes are easily accesible from the back of your shoulder, some\n   game devs would just have you go back to your tent to get a new axe\n   if you lost one.\n- You can build with the wood, granted, that does get repetitive quickly.\n   But you could make a cabin and stuff if you wanted to which could look\n   awesome and would be a pretty remarkable achievement.\n- This is actually pretty decent for a first-game, if you didn't know, This\n   is the dev's first game, thats why it seems kinda boring.\n- So far i've had no headset tracking issues.\n\nNOTE: I didn't play 6hrs, I just left the vive on for a long time, I actaually only played 2.5hrs.\n\nHope you found this review helpful, once again in it's current state i wouldn't recommend it. It's drab and cut dry of most of the potential, however, you might want to consider buying the game so the dev can have funds for the project and pay those sh*t taxes. Also remember that this is the dev's first game, so give him some slack.
