I paid roughly about 30 dollars and jumped on in. First of all I have to say the game runs very smooth on my gaming labtop which surprised me. The characters are new and fresh also the story exists. The combat is fun more fun than I would say DQH1. Now the reason I say this is because of a few things.\n\nYou can now explore the lands a bit between the big missions which you are stuck in once you accept.\n\nYou can call in a buddy or random person once you start a story mission.\n\nIf you jump into someone elses game or they jump into yours you can select any of the past characters from DQH1. \nYou can only select those characters when you are helping someone online or doing an online mission with them.\n\nMy favorite part personally is now you can transform into the bigger summons. This is one of the best parts of the game that was added that is just a delight. I love becoming the stone golem and smashing big bosses down town. If you do play online as a helper though you can not summon or transform only help with your one character which kinda is lame. You also lose your summon coins if you go to a new part of the story ect which is alright I understand as if you were hording the mega summon coins it would be a cake walk of a game.\n\nNow that I got some of the new cool features out of the game I need to talk about the delightful music. Its honestly great and makes the game keep going. Its colorful and does DQ justice in 3D, sometimes the characters 3D model looks better than their 2D art.  The voice acting is actually pretty good and you can choose between Japanese / English.\n\nYou can choose your class for your main character and level it up!\n\nNow the bad parts of this game.\nSome of the story missions are pretty dumb, like a 5 year old came up with the idea or something when it comes to some of the missions. The choices that are made you have no real options you just have to follow the story pretty much. If you are doing a story mission and some are really long and you die you have to restart from the very start of that story mission, mind you keep all your EXP so its not a total loss. Sometimes its worth it to lose just to grind a section for that EXP. \n\nOverall this game is an upgrade in my eyes from the last game and I recommend it.", "recommendationid": "34955053", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505415372, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504436130, "num_reviews": 50, "steamid": "76561197972728940", "num_games_owned": 994, "playtime_forever": 960}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514675"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505530766, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Good Game.

I was feeling nostalgic and decided to give it a whirl. The game is action-oriented, with some light RPG elements (stats and classes). Its often compared to Dynasty Warriors, which I have never played- basically you run around a semi-open world and destroy mobs upon mobs of enemies. Combat is fun, kinetic, and anime-style over the top.\n\nThe game is packed with collectibles, crafting, and achievements. I quite like this feature, because there is a lot of grinding to be done, but you never feel like you're just mowing down enemies to get a few levels. You're always progressing towards some goal or reward. Its actually what I like most about this game- it never wastes your time. Even if you lose a battle, you keep all of your earned XP and gold, so while there is grinding, you don't have to repeat it even in the event of a mistake.\n\nThe world is fun to explore and theres some light Metroid elements (need certain characters to unlock areas). Theres a large cast of characters to choose from, and they all feel reasonably unique.\n\nI didn't pay too much attention to the story, the slow pacing and extraneous dialogue is something I don't really like about anime/JRPGs in general, but thats just personal preference.
