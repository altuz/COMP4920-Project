Some throw stuff at you and others drop down like the giant spiders or the floating heads and then the random mid air objects force you to keep your guard up.\n\nI'm really impressed by the sword mechanics as the sword sounds good and tracks exceptionally well. The kunai's and shuriken's however could use a little more refining as they don't seem to follow motion properly. 1 out of ever 3 thrown seems to go way off course.\n\nI would like to see an option to adjust game music and SFX as well as a difficulty setting for harder levels. It does not take very long to advance through the stages.\n\nAll in all though this is a fun game that isn't costly and seems like it would be a really great introduction game for people who are new to virtual reality.", "recommendationid": "29686891", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486194559, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499436890, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561197984300232", "num_games_owned": 186, "playtime_forever": 188}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510604"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
