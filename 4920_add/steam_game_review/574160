The title was later ported to the Xbox 360 and the prequel was released in America as WarTech: Senko no Ronde. Gameplay wise, this is a mix of both a bullet hell shmup (shoot 'em up) and a fighting game. Think of it as a mix between Psychic Force and Virtual On. If you're a fan of anime, mecha, the shmup genre and the fighting game genre, you'll enjoy this game.\n\nThe characters are fully voiced in Japanese and each have a backstory. Design-wise, they're not too original, but their personalities are made apparent during the game. Each mecha (known as \"Rounders\") come equipped with a main weapon, a subweapon, a special ability (depending on the partner/variation you select), shield/force field, several dash attacks and the ability to transform into a B.O.S.S.! The B.O.S.S. mode is pretty cool and sounds exactly as the mode implies. You basically turn into a giant mechanized version of your regular Rounder for a limited period of time to unleash a barrage of bullets on the enemy. This is a great tactic, especially during the endgame, since it is a somewhat of a last-ditch comeback mechanic.\n\nI haven't tried online mode yet, but from what I hear, it's quite laggy and not optimized well at all. I hope the developers / G.Rev fixes this.\n\nIn summary, if you are a fan of Japanese arcade games, you'll probably like this title. \n\nLet's hope G.Rev releases more Steam titles like this one, in the near future!\n\n\n", "recommendationid": "34855883", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505030374, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 72, "last_played": 1506660805, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198082185292", "num_games_owned": 29, "playtime_forever": 324}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520078"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 12, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504879584, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Beside Acceleration of Suguri, this is another one of the rare gem from Japan. A mix between shoot-em-up and fighting game that I would call a 'Danmaku (Bullet Hell) Fighting Game'.\n\nIt is not too hard to pick up, but as the bots showed me, it is not easy to master the arts of dodging countless bullets and counterattacking at the same time either. No tutorials on specific character specials and moves, but the basic tutorial covers enough.\n\nSpeaking of characters, at first glance, they seemed generic and the mechas are not quite memorable. This game, however, comes with a detailed story mode which provides us glances into each characters personality and their lives with full professional voice acting. It also presents an excellent opportunity to familiarise yourself with all the mechs this game has to offer, while the story is no Pulitzer Award winner, it is okay in its own rights.\n\nI have not tried multiplayer yet though, though the part of making this review in the first place is to get people to buy it and have someone to play with lol.\n\nMusic and sound, your mileage may vary here. Some may find it good, excellent and memorable; But some may find it generic. I am on the former stance though.\n\nRough around the edges, but lovable game in this age of AAA blockbuster releases one after another, an A grade game done with care and soul poured in it is a very lovely option right now.", "recommendationid": "34815239", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504879584, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504882194, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561197970914751", "num_games_owned": 386, "playtime_forever": 585}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513449"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504800676, "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Awesome game.
