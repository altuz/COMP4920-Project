This includes the stunning simplistic style of the visuals, a nice soundtrack and a innovative puzzle mechanic. \n\nBut these things are not enough for you to invest the amount the developers are asking for, unless it is on sale, in which it may be worth spending a couple of dollars for.\n\nThe game is extremely short, the puzzles are far too easy and the music cuts in and out so awkwardly that it almost makes the soothing and relaxing soundtrack almost unbareable to listen to.  \n", "recommendationid": "29329998", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1484712249, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484711673, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198088155342", "num_games_owned": 99, "playtime_forever": 26}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507552"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1490816563, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Love Engine is fun, relaxing, and challenging. I really enjoyed this game. I found myself breezing through the puzzles pretty quickly; however, a few of them stumped me for a bit. \n\nThe game is incredibly fun to play overall, but is it worth the money? If you don't mind paying for only 2 hours worth of content, then yes. The game is cute, easy to pick up, and a great way to burn a couple of hours.\n\n\nPros- Beautiful music\n-----        Easy to play\n-----         Somewhat challenging puzzles\n         \n\n\nCons-       No option to pick specific levels\n------              (I have looked for this option and haven't found it.
