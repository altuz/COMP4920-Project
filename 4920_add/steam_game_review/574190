It has a single snowy environment with nice snow and fireworks effect, and you have to shoot the floating snowballs. \n\nThe game gets quite addictive from 10th level. The game has 30 levels, but I wish there were more levels. The game is small, but worth it, considering few more levels coming soon.  A great VR game for the season, especially for the young ones!", "recommendationid": "28835797", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1483118323, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483120392, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198106247405", "num_games_owned": 20, "playtime_forever": 63}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502382"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
