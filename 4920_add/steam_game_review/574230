I actually got stuck on a campaign mission 1 hour in, which means that it will probably take me a while before I understand the mechanics of the game. While the tutorial explains what each of your actions does to the cells, reaching your goal is a much more gradual procedure and your actions could easily backfire if you rush things or don't observe the stats closely. Definitely not one of those games that you beat in a day. \n\nWhile the game struck me as really polished at first, I soon realized why it's still in alpha. My CPU usage kept ramping up until it hit 100%. I have an overclocked i5 by the way. I don't know why that happened. I could still play the game just fine, but I would also like to be able to do other stuff on my PC when I run an indie game in the background. Either way, at just \u20ac2.99, I think it's still worth buying.", "recommendationid": "29004991", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1483533138, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483635391, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198312654676", "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 148}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525917"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1484782204, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I don't normally write reviews, which I'm not really doing anyways.
