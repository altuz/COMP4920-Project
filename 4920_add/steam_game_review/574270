It doesn\u2019t sacrifice most of its gameplay elements and play time to tell a tale, it rather uses its simple plot as nothing more but a small incentive to drive the player forward, by offering the next snippet of the story as a small reward for completing a batch of puzzles.\n\nCompared to the more abundant point \u2018n\u2019 click nature of the first game, Shard of Mystery likes its hidden object scenes and alchemy mixing minigame a lot more; which, considering this is the hidden object genre, makes it all the better.\nThere was a price though: Lost Kingdom\u2019s moral shades of grey are gone, replaced by a generic evil witch, who kidnaps the now adult son of the king we saved in the first game. Although our returning alchemist protagonist does everything to keep this clich\u00e9 interesting, in the end it is the puzzles that will move the player onwards, and not the story itself.", "recommendationid": "31201627", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492443221, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492283271, "num_reviews": 443, "steamid": "76561198042831386", "num_games_owned": 443, "playtime_forever": 195}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520902"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1492449883, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Lost Grimoires 2... In terms of graphics and music it's par of the course. The voiceovers are somewhat sub-par, but bearable. i enjoyed the HO scenes, but the puzzles were largely more of the same we've seen in every other HO game.\n\nWhere i had to stop - and change my rating from \"ok\" to \"not ok\" - was the stage where the castle you're stuck in shakes every few seconds. Such frequent, unpredictable shaking of the scene literally gives me motion sickness. At that point i had to quit, and won't be starting it back up.\n\nIf you're a die-hard HOP fan and are not prone to screen-induced motion sickness, pick this one up on sale sometime.
