If you like lots of story and making deductions based on clues, I think you will like this one too.  Clues and important info show up as inventory items.  To move forward in your investgations, you need to like them together and to the right objects and characters.  Very clever and interesting.   It took me 6.5 hours to do my playthrough but I screwed one part up and so am going back to fix it and the solve everything correctly.  I thought it was well the price and I had a lot of fun playing detective.\n\n2 things I needed to do to play this properly:\n\n* I had to set my Display in the Control Panel to 100% to keep dialogue and text from being cut off.  Devs are working on a fix but it is crucial to make your setting work or you won't get the info you need from the dialogue and descriptions.  Easy to do.\n\n* No voiceovers so Devs decided to do a kind of Charlie Brown adult sort of talking noise when characters talked.  This drove me CRAZY as there is a ton of dialogue.  So, I turned the sound down in options and kept the music (which is very good) on and kept playing irritation free.  I recommend doing this so you can just enjoy the story.", "recommendationid": "32179643", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1496592539, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496593811, "num_reviews": 20, "steamid": "76561198011515841", "num_games_owned": 199, "playtime_forever": 417}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514606"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
