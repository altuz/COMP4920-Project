You have enemies approach from different locations as well (like The Lab). However, the enemies take a few arrows to shoot down. You regenerate the crystal by shooting fish in the pond in game (compared to shooting balloons).\n\nThe game is  OK but dont expect to be playing The Labs archery game which I did. I couldnt play it more than 10 minutes.\n\nI would like to see both bows have better traction and the enemies a 1 shot 1 kill sort of thing.\n\n", "recommendationid": "29501708", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485437795, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "12", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485260048, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198354145966", "num_games_owned": 19, "playtime_forever": 11}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509522"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 0}}
