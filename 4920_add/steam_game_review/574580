That being said there are too many balance issues and annoyances to really make this game enjoyable. One of them primarily being the encounter rate. Yes it says JRPG but that shouldnt apply to having a random battle every 2-3 steps(I avereaged it out.) Second more often than not you are stuck just messing around outside each town until you can scounge up enough coin to buy enough meds to survive a trip to the next town. yes you can goto a cave/dungeon that is usually near each town for a chance for some free gear cept it really isnt. You end up having to essentially trade your hard earned meds for items that you actually cant use for another 2-3 levels. Which then puts you at a disadvantage timewise as you have to go grind again for enough coin to buy back the med supplies.\n\nAlso the loading to each battle screen takes far to long ESPECIALLY when you consider how frequently you get attacked.\n\nOverall I have to say it it worth?
