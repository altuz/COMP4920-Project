Not even curiosity should even tempt you to this game. Installing this game is just as disturbing as placing your grandfathers teeth in your mouth. Why would you do that to yourself? It\u2019s just wrong I tell you.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/mihan0id evidently knows how to make good games, just as much as he knows how to spell. In the info section your given basically a 'war and peace' novel about Zorgilonians a alien race come to decapitate us all and we stop them by typing the target words to one of the three lane turrets which spew out saw blades destroying them as we enter in the appropriate passwords.\n\nAs the levels progress it becomes impossible with long words that don't make sense and that have to be typed out at supersonic speeds, over long gruelling time spans, with zero tolerance for mistakes. Words like 'antidisestablishmentarianism' and remember NO MISTAKES.
