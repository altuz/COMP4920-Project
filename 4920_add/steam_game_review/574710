Explore an island, uncover story through collectables with added twist of also having to collect items to survive. Multi-line story is achieved due to multiple characters you control but all characters personalities and characteristics are the same not adding much extra depth to gameplay through this dynamic. Game could of done with a slower start maybe explaining features like the map and hiding symbol on screen. But in all for the genre the game exists I feel its a good addition. Being under violent gore I would also call questionable (The game is much better at jump scaring them immersion scares from my experience)\n\nFull review: https://youtu.be/3aQRmjN70zk", "recommendationid": "29901978", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486999050, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487003624, "num_reviews": 51, "steamid": "76561197994868319", "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 149}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510560"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 10, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1487025087, "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great premise behind this, just felt it was clunky in it's execution below is my video on it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rgIGgbvLRBU", "recommendationid": "29910349", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487025087, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487016347, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198020161661", "num_games_owned": 352, "playtime_forever": 55}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492331"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
