Stopped playing because I was getting towards the end of the research tree and it was just kind of a grind.

It took a lot of trial and error, restarting multiple times, and reloading saves to get there.  The game is early access and there are quite a few bugs.  Once you get past that you have a wonderful game that in some ways reminds me of FTL, only I get to build my ship how I want.  You have crew members who level up stats as they perform tasks, you have various weapons and defenses for your ship.  You can choose to fight, bribe, or warp jump away in combat situations.  You have ships that wish to buy/sell resources and crew members.  \n     \n     The game is very difficult at first, until you get in the mindset of building stuff that you need and then removing it only after you have resources to start expanding your ship.  You constantly need to balance your research between weapons, defenses, and upgrades for ship components.  As you build the size of your ship, you encounter bigger and bigger enemy ships.  This type of game may not be for everyone, but I have had a very enjoyable (sometimes frustrating) time learning and playing this game and am eagerly looking forward to what this game will become in the future.  Don't give up on it after dying for the 5th+ time early on.  It takes some patience and luck with mining asteroids to get the resources you need to build.
