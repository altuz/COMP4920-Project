Still haven't finished it, and honestly, I am going to jump into some better VNs and leave this one until I have nothing left to play.\n\nUpdate: Okay, so I finished it. Writing it terrible, I powered through to the so-called endings, each of which were profoundly disappointing.\n\nBee tee dubs, if you think there is a route where you can romance the elf, you're wrong. This is a single story game, that barely changes depending on route. Worst off, the achievements for this game didn't even unlock, despite going through it multiple times.\n\nVoice acting is also sub-par, Nerith's VO needed a pop-filter on her microphone when reading these lines.\n\nThis game is trash.
