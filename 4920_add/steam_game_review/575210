I tend to be positive about everything experimental, but currently the drums aren't functional. It is not playable because of the ergonomics is designed with traditional game mechanic (collision detection) instead of airdrumming. The change needed should be simple, but the difference would be huge on usability.\n\nI saw on the forum a 2 months old post pointing 3 simple flaws that make the game unplayable. So far, no fix was done. I'd watch the topic and wait. Chances are alternative games are abandoned. If that remains the case, I'd say that, as sweet as it looks, in practice it is not usable by humans and you would do best passing this one.\n\nThe flaws are:\n- hit detection: it register on virtual space collision, which is not intuitive when air drumming. When actually playing, you need to look away from the drums. Hit should be first about movement and second about space. It's quite impossible to hit tempo consistently like this. See video below to how it's done well.\n- hit areas kinda overlap to make things worse, and they register any slight contact\n- no strength sensitivity, any contact is recorded fully and loud which is bad considering the above.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CavlglPYVvQ\n\nI'm sorry to sound like the average nitpicker reviewer, but those are genuine problems that have solutions very straight forward and simple to implement. I hope this gets fixed because it's very close to be a fun experience, but as is, it is nothing fun. It's the difference between having a road trip and having a road trip on a car with one driving tire flat.
