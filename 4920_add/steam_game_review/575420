I absolutely love his last video, \"Old Friend\", and \"Chocolate\" does not disappoint. Tyler's VR stuff is not only incredibly immeraive, but is able to fill you with an absolute sense of unbridled sense of joy (and rhythm) that not many others can match. I've gone back to Old Friend several times since purchasing it, and I have no doubt I'll do the same with this one. It's short (much like his previous work), but it leaves you wanting more, which in my opinion is a good thing. You dont want the happiness to end. You dont want to lose that goofy smile on your face. I loved Chocolate, and I definitely look forward to Tyler's future releases.", "recommendationid": "34319991", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503033361, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503116210, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198025033642", "num_games_owned": 179, "playtime_forever": 19}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510518"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1503273032, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Old Friend is the first thing I show people who are new to VR- now Chocolate will take that spot!
