It's very well balanced -- all four weapons are needed and useful against specific enemies, yet you can't rely on one over the others. The basic gun isn't strong enough to kill some of the nastier bad guys, but you can't just spam special weapons, you'll run out of energy. It's a constant back and forth, split second decision making in the middle of a fire fight.\n\nThe game starts out easy but the difficulty ramps up nicely by the second planet. Online leaderboards, achievements, trading cards, cloud saves -- this is a high quality title, well worth the price if you like shooters.", "recommendationid": "34228607", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502685279, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503298006, "num_reviews": 40, "steamid": "76561197997477460", "num_games_owned": 11599, "playtime_forever": 366}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533632"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 13, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502554041, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "[b][i]We Are Doomed[/i] was awesome, and [i]Graceful Explosion Machine[/i] follows suit.[/b] Nothing terribly fresh here, nor large in scope BUT everything is done remarkably well.

Actually you can't smash it all the time because weapons cost energy and you need to balance the energy of your ship by collecting the crystals dropped by the enemies. There are 4 planets with about 10 levels each, seems a little short for a $13 game but the difficulty rise up quickly and chance is you wouldn't beat them on a single run. Overall this isn't classical shooter like Striker 1945 or Dodonpachi, it's more like a top-down beat em up game trapped in a alternative view angle, or Resogun in a panic room.\n\nI really like the game, so despite the following flaws I still give it a thumb up, I hope the developers could address them in future updates.\n\nSo about the a few flaws I had with the Steam version of the game:\n\n1. The default control scheme for keyboard sucks. You got arrows keys for movement and A/S/D/LShift/Space for weapons/dash. It needs to be made configurable ASAP, maybe change the default scheme to be WSAD movement based.\n\n2. (update) This might not be the developer's fault, but the game has vsync problem with my laptop. According to the developer the game always run with vsync on, yet the frame rate caps at 120 instead of 60 on my 60hz laptop, and occasionally the graphics tears up a little while the game loses the ability to recognize my control for like half a second. Forcing vsync ON with the nvidia control panel didn't solve the problem. Capping frame rate at 60 with RivaTuner Statistics Server makes the game skipping a lot of frames like running at 30fps (but displayed as 60fps). I've yet to find a working solution to this particular problem.\n\n3. (fixed in the 1.1.2 update) Support for Nvidia Optimus needs to improve a bit. The game defaults to integrated graphics which made my laptop 10C hotter than it should be, forcing discrete graphics with nvidia control panel solves the problem, but I think the problem deserves to be mentioned and should be avoided by the developers in the first place.", "recommendationid": "34118264", "language": "english", "developer_response": "Hi there,\n\nI just wanted to follow up on your VSync issue. Graceful Explosion Machine always runs with VSync enabled, set to the default refresh rate of the primary monitor. (I just double-checked the code and ran some tests to confirm this.) You may have third-party software running in the background that is overriding the VSync setting?\n\nThanks for your feedback and thanks for playing GEM! :D\n\nUpdate: just pushed an update (v1.1.2) that improves Optimus support. It should always run on your dedicated card now.
