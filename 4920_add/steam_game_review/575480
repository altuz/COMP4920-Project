The fact that the art is gorgeous should be obvious from the store page, a lot of detail went into the sprites and it shows.\n\nThe fact that this is primarily a comedy isn't really obvious though. \n\nI spent 29 hours playing this, and of those about 25 involved me laughing out loud or grinning like an idiot. The cast of characters is well rounded, and most of the humor comes seemlessly from the character personalities and the dialogue between them. That is to say that the jokes aren't forced in. I would even go as far as to say that it feels like the story gets caught up in the characters' pace, it just naturally gravitates towards hilarious interactions.\n\nThis is a feel-good VN through and through. It's not a thriller, nor will it give you \"the feels.\" It will however make you laugh until you can't sit up straight.\n\nThe story is well written, though not exceptional. The scenarios aren't particularly new or interesting, and the writers managed to drop the ball on the endings of most of the routes. \n\nThe romance is cute, and admittedly more realistic than standard VN fare in the way the relationships progress. Despite the obligatory flaming about censorship (Can we just get over it already? Please.), this game handles sex and sexuality much better than most VN's I've read. Sex is not taboo, it's a part of a healthy relationship and for ****'s sake, by the time you're ready to proclaim your love to someone you should be ready to kiss and have sex.\n\nAll the buildup wether that be a steamy exchange or the abrupt \"Let's fuck for no apparent reason\" that you find in VN's is left in tact along with any pillow talk afterwords. All they did was replace the hentai slide show + erotica with a black screen that leaves no doubt as to what just happened.\n\nThat said, none of the romances were particularly heartwarming or moving, they were just cute.\n\nOf the four routes, I rated them 8, 7, 7, 6, which is pretty decent, though none blew me away.\n\nMy biggest complaint with the novel is that the writers completely dropped the ball when it came to finishing up the routes. A good epilogue can cinch the route, and stay with you. It's what you'll remember when you think back to the game a year later. I think that the routes could have been at least a point or two higher across the board if they had gone for a big finish. Instead they usually had a cop out, which is just sad considering I can immediately think of ways the ending could have been impactful and meaningful in 3 of the four routes.\n\nDue to the lackluster endings, really I'll just remember this as an extremely funny game, where the journey, not the end is what matters.\n\nIf it weren't for the comedy gold in this novel, it would be thoroughly mediocre, however it's just so enjoyable overall that I give it a 7.5 out of 10.\n\nTo enjoy the novel to the fullest, I would suggest only that you end on Kaoruko's route and don't start with Ashe's.\n\nTLDR:\nIf you enjoy VN's this is worth a buy just for the laughs.", "recommendationid": "34070267", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502058804, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502056087, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561198138564746", "num_games_owned": 349, "playtime_forever": 1768}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507565"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1503808111, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "First found out about this VN back in 2013/2014, whenever the anime shorts of it aired. The anime was cute and the VN art is amazing so I was looking forward to SP bringing this over.\n\nIt's a typical, but enjoyable SoL RomCom with a hint of drama and a cast of cute characters that mesh really well. The soundtrack is also pretty nice to listen to and doesn't get stale. The plot proceeds in a day-by-day fashion with occasional timeskips (like from a school day to that weekend date). Any drama really doesn't happen until after you finish the common route and get on one of the main 4 girls' routes, but it's not TOO heavy given that this is a RomCom first after all.  The pacing can sometimes be a bit random, but I find it makes for good comedic effect most of the time. Also they use heart-pupils for comedic effect occasionally so if that's your thing go for it lol.\n\nThere are 4 girls to choose from, which is quite easy given that choices are usually obvious and are binary:\n\nKaoruko - the very nice and adorable student council president who is slightly airheaded. She's very compassionate and all-around enjoyable. Also the main girl of the 4. I usually don't even think much of anime girls like her and she still caught my attention.\n\nAshe - the tsundere of the game and the vice president (aka Kaoruko's right hand woman). Her tsundere-ometer isn't maxed out and generally her tsun only comes in when appropriate. It's not like every interaction of hers is full of tsun, b-baka! (forgive me for the terrible joke). I think she's one of the better well-written tsunderes because being tsundere really isn't her main selling point. It helps define her personality\n\nToa - MC's BLOOD-RELATED younger sister you sick fuck /s. Doesn't help how subservient MC is to her. She's a lazy NEET super-programmer and makes the most money in the house (hence her 5/6 monitor setup at the foot of her bed).\n\nMihiro - Toa's childhood friend who, by extension, is also MC's childhood friend. Also best girl. Fite me. Her family runs a restaurant called Miyase's, after their family name. It also happens to be located pretty much right across the street. She's very teasing and playful, but still a good friend when it matters. I love how the game switches to her POV occasionally on her route. It adds so much to her character compared to the other girls.\n\nOverall I'd give it 8-8.5/10", "recommendationid": "34520611", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503808111, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502428319, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198161924331", "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_forever": 1679}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502130229, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Wonderful game.
