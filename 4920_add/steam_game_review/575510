My last experience with Winged Clouds, Sakura Santa, promised overall improvements in how they developed visual novels. And I always loved this artist's (called Inma, btw) anime girls at least as much as I love secret agent stories. Mix it with a supernatural theme giving off an MIB-vibe like here and I'll practically be your personal b*tch.\n\nLet it be said that having all this going in its favor, Sakura Agent may be the Winged Clouds WORST effort to date in making a Visual Novel. This time, they couldn't even properly program the music to play in the title screen. Congratulations in that regard, I guess.\n\nThe story and characters are so forgettable, I don't even know where to start since stuff just seems to happen here and there, out of nowhere. There was a poker scene that I halfway enjoyed and was the highlight of my experience. I swear things just happened randomly in the story to forcefully tie in with the commissioned artwork from Inma. I'm not exaggerating.\n\nDon't buy this abherration of a VN, except if you are studying on how NOT to develop one. Or morbid curiosity. Please, please, PLEASE, remember that if you are here for dem sweet animu tiddays, you can find them very easily looking in the right places.", "recommendationid": "34938988", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505405384, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505344868, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198147140160", "num_games_owned": 79, "playtime_forever": 224}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505007549, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "They are tits..
