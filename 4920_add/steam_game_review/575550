Hell Girls is NOT as 18+ as Huniepop, there are only 5-6 lewd CG pics and none of the huniepop \"night dates\",  but the gameplay is the same type of instantly gratifying semi-deep fun. Hell girls take on match 3 is pretty interesting and engaging, the game has no turn limits like in huniepop but instead your combos on the match 3 board do damage or give you health and mana. The opponent you are facing attacks you every couple moves, lowering your hp and/or placing damaging tiles on the map that must be destroyed. This system makes the game a bit easier than huniepop and more of a nice mindless timesink. The match3 system in this game is pretty interesting as well, as you can match in any direction and make matches over all of the board, leading to insane combos even in earlier parts of the game. There are 3 girls with different spells, playstyles, and stat-changing outfits, that give variety to the game.\n\nPros\n- Its 2 bucks and has easily 8 hours of gameplay with tons of easy achievements\n- Has anime girls\n- Gameplay is easy but makes you feel like a match 3 god and has a few fun broken spells/builds\n- Enemy variation is actually pretty good and balanced, and some girls are actually better/weaker against certain enemies\n- Game has very little grinding for levels or gear\n\nCons\n- Lots of piss easy unnecessary fights early on\n- Gui is glitchy and dialogue boxes and parts of game overworld look bad\n- Doesn't have a hardcore mode or difficulty\n- The leveling is that lame jrpg type of leveling where your stats just go up a set percent every level and don't bring in anyhthing new or interesting\n\nOverall: For what it is its 4/5 ~ 4.5/5.
