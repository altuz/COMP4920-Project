You will die a lot, but you don't lose a lot of progress + you get achievements from it, so it didn't frustrate me. The money achievements are broken but I don't mind since they said they'll fix it and the game was cheap so I'm not losing much. A great way to spend a couple of hours if you wanna unlock achievements and not just get to the end.", "recommendationid": "34899402", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505216778, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505216577, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198304016474", "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_forever": 139}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500265"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506187451, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Cool", "recommendationid": "35159346", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506187451, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505668123, "num_reviews": 546, "steamid": "76561198071144444", "num_games_owned": 606, "playtime_forever": 189}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495830"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 11, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 9}}
