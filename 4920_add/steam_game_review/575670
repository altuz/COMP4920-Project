BUT this time you try to fight aginst fear and rage and so on in order to cleanse your consciousness to reach enlightenement. You gain upgradable spells to freeze or regenerate a pod or to draw new lines of attack. The really clever part: the five colors used have a rock-paper-stone-lizard-spock countering system. Each color has a neutral opponent, one that it destroys, one that it absorbs, one that it heals and one that it is powerless against. A nice touch, setting it aside from the other games with this style of play, making it an actually challenging RTS of some sort. Has different modes and (not so) deep wisdom presented in the story bits.\n \nA nice one. If you don't know if you'd like it, try one of the browser versions like the aforementioned Biotix game. Then come back if you found one of these compelling.\n\nFollow me as a curator at http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28337205-Fair-Minded-Witness/?appid=298050", "recommendationid": "34261967", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504476914, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502822940, "num_reviews": 67, "steamid": "76561197980796094", "num_games_owned": 480, "playtime_forever": 274}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500450"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 3}}
