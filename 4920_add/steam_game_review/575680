It reminds me a lot of an old unpublished game that I made a long time ago (except this one is way better). I love the calming music, the color choice, the puzzle difficulty, and overall everything about it. Honestly one of my favorite games I've played recently. It makes me sad to see all of the negative comments, this game is great!", "recommendationid": "32281083", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1496973909, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496973598, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198186915039", "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 42}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
