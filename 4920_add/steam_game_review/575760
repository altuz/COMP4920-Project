That\u2019s going to have to be a strong no. \nIf you want to watch some gameplay and listen to my thoughts on the game, a link is below. If you\u2019d rather read my thoughts on the game, those will be beneath the video. If you choose to watch the video please be warned that there are vulgarities in the video.\n\n[URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKvayrugViU[/URL]\n\nThere is no option menu, there is very little control, the music restarts every time you die in the game, and the music is incredibly loud. These four items, when combined make for an incredibly unenjoyable experience when playing a platforming game. You can\u2019t turn down the music that is constantly restarting in your ear because you keep dying due to the lack of reasonable controls. This game is awful. There is no excuse for a developer to put this out as a full release game and be okay with it. This game is incredibly unsatisfying to play. I spent about ten minutes in the game and I had enough. I quite simply quit the game.\n In my opinion, a platforming game should have amazing control, look at N++ or Super Meat Boy. These games are incredibly satisfying to play and allow the player to become better and better at the game until ultimately the game is complete. These games ramp up in difficulty and forces the player to continuously die until they become good enough to beat the game, or give up all together. This game does not have that. It has quite the opposite of that. This game offers no control to the user and forces you to rely on luck to navigate through the obstacles. Indie Games Studio claims that there are thirty levels to this game, I couldn\u2019t tell you what level six looks like, it was impossible for me to get to that point in the game without wanting to throw my PC out of my window.\nIndie Games Studio has four games published on Steam, and this is the second game in the Reboot series. There is ZERO excuse for publishing this game as a full release. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! If you\u2019d like to see me go more in depth about the game feel free to watch the video above. Buyer beware.\nAfter thought: Can you please, for the love of God, at least review your \u201cAbout this game\u201d part of your steam game page before trying to sell a game?", "recommendationid": "29553813", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485745455, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485647486, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198119615531", "num_games_owned": 249, "playtime_forever": 41}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513389"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492150314, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is really colorful and blocky.
