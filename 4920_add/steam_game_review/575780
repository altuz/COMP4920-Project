For a game that seems to require extremely precise movement, when you tap forward of back you jump about a player character length.

The jump mechanic feels good though, your character has weight. It takes its cues from VVVVV but that's ok AFAIC.\nSadly, the game wants to be a fast-paced platformer, but it kills its own rythm with clumsy obstacle placement, requiring you to slow down and lose momentum often (\"often\" as in I played the game like 6mn and it happened to me four times). Also, this game has fake branching paths: you think you can either jump down a pit or exit right, and both paths drop you in the same spot. [EDIT: later on there are actual branching paths within levels. The level design is quite inventive beyond the first few levels]\nStill, it's a \u20ac0.70 game, the aesthetic is nice, the music is repetitive but energetic, I guess it's fine for a coffee-break.", "recommendationid": "29942787", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487170752, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487295447, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198002099664", "num_games_owned": 373, "playtime_forever": 10}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499176"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487133893, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I don't typically dig on platformers, as my skill is 100% gone from the old Mario days.\n\nAnd I won't say this game is unique, although I don't recall any other platformers that require such precise movement at such high speed. As simple as the controls are, it's pretty difficult to master the movement needed to beat most levels. I'd attribute that more to the fact that you can't see the ground/ceiling in most levels unless you're on the ground/ceiling.\n\nAs the description says, the game is indeed retro. You play some Arthur Fonsarelli looking cool cat with an eternal cigarette in his mouth. As I played the game I just kept thinking of Comfort Eagle. \"His cigarette is burning but he never seems to ash.\" The graphics are directly out of the Gameboy era, with the same limited color scheme as an old Pokemon or Wario or Tetris or Zelda game, etc.  I have to agree with the other reviewer - the hitboxes seem to be bollocks, as you will die if you even get remotely near one of the gigantic spikes or other obstacles, but it doesn't make the game broken - just more challenging.\n\nI had one issue with the game where I did indeed die on the first level, and the game froze so I had to reopen it, but after that I died again on the first level and the respawn worked fine. After that no issues at all. For the time being I had to give up on the game after about the 6th level, as I got tired of repeatedly dying, but it's certainly challenging enough to be fun. \n\nAnd the soundtrack is pretty good - it also does a good job with the \"retro\" feel.\n\nThe game is worth more than a dollar and it's 60 cents right now so it's worth checking out if you're needing a retro platformer.", "recommendationid": "29934888", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487134149, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487752783, "num_reviews": 105, "steamid": "76561197961221174", "num_games_owned": 1263, "playtime_forever": 111}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496024"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
