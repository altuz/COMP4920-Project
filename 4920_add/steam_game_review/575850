You can play up to six people at a time. Worth the 2.99. Not really a community as of right now, but the game is cheap enough to grab some friends and fight. Multiplayer is gold based. Every player gets a set amount of gold to recruit and gear team.  I have not even touched the campaign yet, but watched it played. More team development through campaign. Using the controller is not bad and they're working on mouse/keyboard support. Please keep adding and making this game better. Good grab for the price.", "recommendationid": "34094689", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502162847, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502162209, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198010529188", "num_games_owned": 122, "playtime_forever": 165}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505332"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502019189, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Nice party turn-based tactics!\nMultiplayer and a single player campaign are already enjoyable along with a map editor.\nThe difficulty options should allow casuals and hardcore gamers to find what they seek.\nHartacon Tactics is stable (Single Player experience only), not a single issue!\nIf you're picky, wait for the next two classes maybe.\nWill update as the game evolves but right now Hartacon Tactics looks like a steal to me for that price tag and a true successor to the old Turn-Based Tactics of the 90's.\n\nHighest requests for me so far:\n- Keybinding (Done with 09/08/17 update)\n- More Campaign Setting Options\n- Passive Skills :)\n\nUpdate #1: Mouse support on Beta branch: The game is now fully playable in \"mouse-only\" mode for those who like that.\nUpdate #2: Full mouse support and key bindings!", "recommendationid": "34058201", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504897985, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503936241, "num_reviews": 33, "steamid": "76561198080123570", "num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_forever": 628}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502531"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1500351006, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I will give it a thumbs up, not bad tactics. but be advised uses controller only and in doing so, is so annoying, almost put this to a no for that reason. graphics are passible, views are only from set points which is also bothersome, but at lest can zoom a bit.", "recommendationid": "33622161", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1500351006, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "5", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500350676, "num_reviews": 52, "steamid": "76561198040557124", "num_games_owned": 1419, "playtime_forever": 64}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500389"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502222093, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I don't often write reviews, but here goes! I'll start by saying alot of the downvotes are for a lack of mouse support, which is clearly stated. The game itself is good, if you've enjoyed FF tactics disgaea and the sort this game is probably for you. The added bonus of being able to play against your friends is very nice, I look forward to the future of this game as it grows.
