Kinda came off as like a bad movie that's so bad it's good kinda deal for me. \n\nIt doesn't start off too bad as far as the level layout goes, being pretty simple and just having you jump/whip your enemies till you reach the end. This lets you get used to the controls, which while really awkward, you can get used to. The first level feels like the only one that has anything kinda interesting in it since it has branching paths. I ran into bug I'd presume that took me where I was needed to go, but had no idea where it actually took me, so I had to backtrack where it teleported me to continue forward. Everything after the first stage is straight forward, only go right. \n\nThis is where the game just starts falling apart. Enemies are layered behind objects, leap of fates start happening in darken areas and enemies are spawned in a way that the whip becomes worthless in most regards. The game repeats the boulder scene for each stage but unlike stage one, the game transition causes you to pause on a screen, die, then the game continues as normal. The random rock drops during this is so overkill, I just couldn't stop laughing at it. They don't even need the big rock when the little ones slam you into the pits. \n\nOne of the areas I actually go stuck at was just odd. You get this bat you can't hit and a really long gap pretty platforms. You can't run when the bat is as far as he is to the right, since the hitboxes are kinda off a bit on the guy you control and you can't get enough jump from where you can jump. So what do ya do? You slam into the wall and jump 50 feet into the air of course. The only reason you can get past this point is due to a bug. Hilarious. \n\nThere is no ending, it just drops you back off at the final stage again. Anything would have been nice to know it ended, but eh. Fairly short game. Unless you think you'd find entertainment in how bad the game can be, probably might wanna skip it. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqBmLbHwZKE", "recommendationid": "31378085", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493233018, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493220879, "num_reviews": 17, "steamid": "76561197966489900", "num_games_owned": 1259, "playtime_forever": 39}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502351"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1493102299, "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Goes for a story.\nFlails wildly at the steps of Nazi bad guys when you have to EXIT THE GAME to restart after you die.\nControls are mediocre.\nNo Controller support.\nStay away until this is fixed.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hfKqaeGOrcA\n", "recommendationid": "31352062", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493102299, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493098217, "num_reviews": 395, "steamid": "76561198019816374", "num_games_owned": 537, "playtime_forever": 6}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490552"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1493235401, "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So many bugs and short... but it's like old game, better than nothing.", "recommendationid": "31381548", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493235401, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1506248828, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198066915358", "num_games_owned": 195, "playtime_forever": 74}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478689"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
