You wake up in a room with nothing but a camera attached to you, and you must figure out how to escape. Starting this task would be a whole lot easier if the game would actually load instead of crash. Even if you do decide to attempt the one crash fix that the developer mentioned in a single thread in the Steam community hub, which is to delete a .png file from the install directory, the gameplay itself just isn't worth it.\n\nAt the beginning, you find yourself in a room with a locked door and a keypad, after a while you will click on an air duct on the floor only to believe nothing happened, but then you find yourself transported to another room; turns out clicking that duct worked, but there's no animation or even transition screen to indicate that it did. You get the keypad combination, leave, enter it, open the door, and find yourself with a series of more doors. If you happen to click on a door that's locked, your character becomes stuck for whatever reason, but it's easily fixed by clicking again... found that one out through trial and error.\n\nThe rest is just proceeding through doorways and dying; these are not \"traps\" as the store page indicates, Call to 10 is just a flat out death simulator. Walk near a pipe? Die from steam. Open the wrong door? Something that looks like a mouse flies out at you and you die. Open the wrong circuit panel? You die. This \"game\" is nothing more than directionless trial and error, which wouldn't be so awful if you didn't have to start back at the keypad and enter the combination every single time that you screw up. What's even worse is that sometimes, for some unknown reason, instead of tossing you back to the keypad the game just puts you back to the title screen, where you may or may not be able to resume gameplay due to the CRASHING ISSUE THAT THE DEVELOPER WON'T FIX.\n\nHaving only spent 7 minutes in total on Call to 10, even I'm surprised that I have so much to say about it. Needless to say, it's another shoddy indie horror \"masterpiece\" made in FPS Creator that has zero developer support. It should be noted that this game is by the same guy who made Whispers, Krampus, Case #8, and Jackal. A word to the developer: maybe you should stop shoveling garbage onto Steam without first fixing your previous titles. People catch on, and horror connoisseurs will be sure to avoid your \"work\" in the future. If this game is inspired by Saw, it's when Amanda was in charge of the traps. Unless it's on sale for $0.10, avoid.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.5/5.0[/b] - Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork#curation]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "recommendationid": "30646250", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502050611, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490069477, "num_reviews": 203, "steamid": "76561198049701098", "num_games_owned": 2338, "playtime_forever": 7}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520438"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1486031185, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Full review here - https://youtu.be/Fg4ihm1f63I\nWith gametime little less than 15 minutes, and having the player feel absolutely nothing whilst playing, it makes me not recommend this game.
