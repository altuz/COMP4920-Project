Repeated explosions make it [strike]difficult[/strike] impossible to see if things are coming at you, particularly missiles that kill you.  You can see examples of this in the screenshots.  That's on top of the confusing blue background that is nearly the same color as your ship.  \n\nI think there was a reason old-school shooters kept the graphics simple with a black background.  If the dev cleared up some of the color confusion and get rid of the distortion, it'd be a decent remake of old-school space invaders.  Otherwise, it's hard to recommend, even when it's on sale for a decent price.", "recommendationid": "33031793", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498817381, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499621607, "num_reviews": 54, "steamid": "76561197986553417", "num_games_owned": 663, "playtime_forever": 36}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
