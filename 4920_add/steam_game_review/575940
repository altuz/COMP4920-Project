The mechanics can be overwhelming at first glance, but the game does a good job pacing itself so that you learn what the menus do as you progress. It\u2019s a sort of shout out to a lot of RPGs from the late 90s and early 2000s and seems to draw a bunch of inspiration from titles like Valkyrie Profile, FFX, and Wild ARMs 3.

Feels very well polished and doesn't feel rushed or incomplete. I love the music, the feel of the game, and it's nostalgic to the 90's era of gameplay without feeling \"old\". I play the game on \"light\", the medium dificulty. Has light platforming, and nice RPG elements. I like the way progression works in this game. No gear to worry about, and items you pick up randomly actually become part of your core stats. Neat, I like it.

The gameplay aspect may seem confusing at first (unless you play in Light Mode, it's easier to understand what's going on), or frustrating, but once you master the mechanics it's a really fun game. The music didn't really get to me at first, but as I continued playing the game it started growing on me. The art is beautiful, and so is the animation of the pixelated characters, kind of makes you want to hunt the artist for commissions lol. The story aspect is well paced, with some heartfelt moments here and there as the story progresses. The characters each have their own depth to them and I ended up liking each one (but the long unusual names given to some of them I felt were not really good for my eyes to see). This is an indie game I HIGHLY recommend! It's a little bit in the unknown realms right now, but gosh darnit I will help make it more known, it's that good!", "recommendationid": "31644775", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1494331594, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505974279, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198005134986", "num_games_owned": 43, "playtime_forever": 1610}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504650"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492838650, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Basic:\nAt its core its a good rpg with a good plot and fun characters\nThough it's biggest issue is that it tends to overcomplicate things somewhat with its level up and training mechanics, and these can require a bit too much micromanaging in some parts; though on lower dificulties the attention necessary for those greatly diminishes\nIt also has a really addicting and rather fun card minigame similar to FF9's own card game minigame\n\ncombat:\nIt takes some practice to get used to how combat works, in particular the defences, but you eventually get there and it can be rather satisfying to get everything working well.\nIt is based on button presses (depending on the attack chosen) timing and knowing when to attack or rest; as well as what types of defences to use\nDefences also based on button presses, where normally you have to watch the attacks and which characters they are going to hit and time the button presses right, with each of the 3 characters having diferent styles of defence\neach of the 3 also has a super defence that is a direct counter to an enemy attack type, ranging from blocking all physical close ranged attacks, all physical ranged, and all magic; each with its own side bonuses to it (such as the physical block healing allies with every blocked attack) and timing to be triggered for maximun effect\n\nDungeons/levels\nOn bigger gameplay sessions these can be rather annoying and time consuming; though I found that, if played in smaller bursts, they are not as bad.\nthey are heavy on a sort of puzzle element, where you work to bring all 3 characters to the end of the dungeon, finding all treasures and possible sidequests along the way, each of the characters having a diferent ability to use, and diferent capabilites of movement (for example: one of them moves rather slowly, and cannot clear distances with his jump; but they jump much higher than other party members and have a longer ranged in their battle-starting attack)\nenemies are present in the map, you can attack them, either for a surprise attack (if they are not aware of you) or an normal battle (they are aware but have not attacked you first); being attacked first will have you be ambushed\nin adition to that, you must mind the distances between each character; as the farther away they are from each other the longer it takes for them to join the battle, with them joining instantly if close enough (though not in the case of an ambush)\n\nMechanics\nAs mentioned above, mechanics in this game can be somewhat overly complicated; as you have not only a linsence board style leveling up system (which is the simpler one, and easier to manage) and a more complicated training system that varies from character to character\nall leveling up and training is item based; you get bulks of items from enemies, buying them via the menu or treasure chests\nthe regular leveling up is simpler, you place items in tiles to gain certain stats and work your way towards unlocking skills (matching item types with the right tiles gets you bonuses)\nTraining is... rather more complicated, as it is limited in between battles/events; it is required to strenghten your weapons (while you do obtain weapon level ups during the main game, those just increase the max you can train your weapon up, and will have NO effect unless you first train the character up)\nwhile weapong strenghtening IS permanent, other things are not (such as bonus damage, and one character's defence duration)\nIn adition to that, the training option can be used to alter each individual character's personal mechanic, with some preparation definetely necessary to face certain thougher fights (or to solve some puzzles in the dungeons)\n\nFinal note:\nIt is definetely a good game and well worth a purchase\none just has to pace their time with the game, as bigger sessions can and will likely lead to some frustration\nin addition to that the world and story are interesting; and the game feature post ending content and even as new game plus", "recommendationid": "31289433", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492838650, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492835163, "num_reviews": 18, "steamid": "76561198112838066", "num_games_owned": 193, "playtime_forever": 1261}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502184"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492008940, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Enjoying it quite a lot so far, it has a lil of everything to keep you hung up, especially if you love 'hem RPGs.\nIt does takes a lil to get used to the combat system and all the things you've to grasp before actually getting good at fighting,this in particular when playing Normal mode, a few frustrations here and there but so far so good.\n\nI also feel in love with the care for details:\nThe 3 main chars comment differently each single chest you've opened, or, when you've to proceed to another stage, they'll have something different to say if they're to first to arrive or if they're waiting for the last one to come, i just enjoy reading all they've to say! This also apply to npcs talks!\nThe story by itself is... interesting?
