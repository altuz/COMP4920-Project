Terrible grammar. and hearing obvious Eastern European/Russian voice actors with heavy accents mispronounce common English words, BADLY mispronounce them... HORRID. Cringeworthiness at its best. [*]Awful story. No real cohesion, it jumps from one stretch of the imagination to the next with no real logic or reasoning behind each jump. It was shallower than Mark Ruffalo or Paris Hilton. Yeah. That shallow.
