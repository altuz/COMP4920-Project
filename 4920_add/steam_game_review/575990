As you progress, the constructions become more complex and require more planning and time to disassemble.  There is no time limit, so you can take as long as you need.\n\nThese are very good puzzles, they still look fine at high resolution, and the physics of the interlocking parts behave just as they would with actual solids.  Still, the game itself has some rough edges - the rotation mechanics are cumbersome, and sometimes you have to restart a puzzle when you have maneuvered yourself into a situation you cannot undo; a rotation reset button would be welcome here.\n\nThere is only one option, and that is to mute all sound.  Though the menu has an 'Extras' entry, clicking on it shows there are actually no extras.  The 'Tutorial' is just a list of keyboard and controller behaviors.\n\nThough the puzzle manipulation is a bit rough around the edges, I still recommend this to those who enjoy finding the right way to disassemble things.  Thankfully, you do not have to put them back together.", "recommendationid": "29853745", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486836376, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486903619, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197973951928", "num_games_owned": 850, "playtime_forever": 62}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511832"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487962522, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's not bad, could do with more puzzles though, but a decent puzzle game", "recommendationid": "30147871", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487962522, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487963717, "num_reviews": 41, "steamid": "76561198081642107", "num_games_owned": 188, "playtime_forever": 138}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510298"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487270309, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Good concept that needs some work in its execution. It's certainly playable but finicky at times, no matter how many times you mute that damn annoying music it'll play again as soon as you start it back up, and often you either can't get a piece to budge when it's got plenty of room OR it'll go shooting off at lightspeed (especially when you need it carefully placed to remove another piece). These are all relatively minor flaws in a game that stands up pretty well for $5.99, but until these issues are addressed I would recommend buying it on sale. It also won't last you too long, at just over 90 minutes I'm nearly 40 puzzles in and rapidly approaching the last puzzle.
