But after 5 playthrough's, I have discovered that 99% of all text is generic and used for every character. The 1% being some flavour text in meeting a Romance option. \n\nIf you are looking for a game where you can make choices to affect the story, you'll not like this game. It's linear, buggy, has no skip function beside \"Auto\", no option to increase text speed, spelling errors abound, I'm fairly sure the dev isn't a Native English speaker so I can't hold that against them too much.\n\nThe \"Romance\" characters are crap. They have no story, there's little to no interaction with them that doesn't have the same text as every other character. The only characters you spend time getting to know aren't even available to choose so you're basically picking \"the prettest sprite\" since the text is the same for everyone.\n\nThe story... oh god where do I start. I feel like they made a card game and then got drunk and tried to make a VN around it. The story is... dumb. I've played some pretty terribly written indie games, I test and correct grammar in more than a few every month, but usually they've at least put some thought into it. The characters sound like idiots and constantly change tone like they are bipolar and having and episode(Seriously, Nun told MC to \"Shut Up\" more than once then calmly started speaking again). \n\nThe art reminds me of the old 90's VNs but with better graphics. That being said, the only images I saw were the avatars. There were no CG, no cutout scenes... it's just an amatuer on rails novela with pictures. \n\n2/10 - Try again.", "recommendationid": "33118582", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499033849, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498978492, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561197972339821", "num_games_owned": 210, "playtime_forever": 173}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510369"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1498780000, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Overall I would recommend this game simply because of the price and this is a new studio trying to break in the market so some leeway is needed considering how it offers far more than most its competition at the same price. For instance some text only games on here are more expensive than this is. Admitedly I bought it on a sale so I did save some money so I might be a little more generous than I should be but I will keep this simple with a list of pros and cons. Since I have started a little negative we will begin with the Pros.\n\nPros\n+Cheap and offers a lot for its price.\n+ Diverse cast of multiple nationalities and backgrounds making it more interesting.\n+ This is personal opinion but I enjoyed the art work but there is one issue I have with it which I will mention in the cons.\n+ Very intriguing concept only wish it was fleshed out a little more.\n+ No sexual orientation will be lacking in choice\n+ Very large differences based on the gender of your character. Considering AAA games don't do this right its a huge +\n\nCons\n- Very short story even for its price. Interesting characters and concept but so little time.\n- Too many characters overall for new devs its good to be ambitious but try not to take on too much.\n- Some romance choices are bizarre. For example I chose a high school girl who went from not speaking to me to my lover within two scenes.\n- The more interesting characters aren't romancable. Funny how the best developed characters the 2nd level souls can't be romanced a real shame.\n- A certain plot twist later was a little ham fisted while the hints were there more time would have fleshed it out better.\n-No kiss scenes. Just characters with text around them describing their love. A huge shame with that art work and a deal breaker for some but for those with more active imaginations you can work around this problem.\n-Card game kind of sucks I know its a nice extra but its a little pointless.\n\nBasiclally the cons all tie into the devs having too little time and budget to attempt something that on the surface could have been far better than it was. For instance a more complicated card game would be nice and knocking it down to around 10 romancable characters would have allowed them to be fleshed out more or perhaps the 2nd level souls being dateable? I like the ideas in the game and it was still enjoyable what was there and its far better than most of its compeition at this price so I wish the dev team the best of luck with their future projects and hope to see some drawn kiss scenes in the future if they can put them in. With some more support who knows what the dev team will be capable of if they can achieve this much with such a cheap game.", "recommendationid": "33015304", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498780272, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498778429, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198173806069", "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_forever": 173}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504983"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
