I love me a good metroidvania, but this one...first of all, you can't change the key bindings, and it was created in some country that uses an AZERTY keyboard, which took a while to figure out why the key bindings were so unintuitive as I'm US bound and use QWERTY.  Also, most enemies one-shot kill you, and often charge at sonic speed from across the screen, so if you haven't memorized the entire map, or shoot relentlessly (which will kill deer, which depletes your money) you're going to die over and over and over again.  I don't remember any of the Belmont clan, or Samus, giving me such a bothersome time learning their levels.  I'm going to give this game the ol' college try, because maybe it'll grow on me, but I regret paying money for it, and waiting for the developer to patch it so that it would stop crashing every time I opened it.  I don't recommend it if you want to play a game that's fun.  It says it's hard; well, Nethack is a hard game.
