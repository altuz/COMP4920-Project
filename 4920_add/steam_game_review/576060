Shame could of been something that contended but under someone who has no faith in their own game unless others do what does anyone expect. RIP Greenlight, hopefully games with half a thought can get some light again. \n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/KflRticY1P0\n\n#RIPGreenlight", "recommendationid": "29858916", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486852050, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486853718, "num_reviews": 51, "steamid": "76561197994868319", "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 64}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511272"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1486902353, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "At least, to me this gas was bullshit.\nNo tutorial, complicate UI, Uncomfortable combining system and fucking FRAME DROP while raining.\nYou'd better to buy another game until the maker fix this shitty game.", "recommendationid": "29871648", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486902353, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486901783, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198124220534", "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_forever": 40}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501980"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1488154611, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Good 2D survival/crafting game.Controls well and has good mechanics.Fun to play.Main thing missing is content.Maybe some kind of back story as well as current story and  things that hamper surviving would make it better. Things like animals or some mobs that you have to fight/avoid or just watch out for would add a lot. This could lead to more reason to have variety of weapons and a leveling up of weapons.This really is a fun game in early access which I totallly forgot to mention....untill now.Price is not very much at all now......with proper good additions current price will be a steal. Developers seem nice and are wanting feeedback to help advance their game.....which is usely a good sign for a early access game in my experience. So overall  I am not a professional game reviewer but I do know if I like playing a game or not and a few things I personaly would like to see in  a game.......so I like playing Faraway Islands and  recommend it to all  types of gamers.........I see it getting better with a little love.", "recommendationid": "30209510", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488154611, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488152198, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198163993775", "num_games_owned": 429, "playtime_forever": 485}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502273"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1490712578, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "People forget this is still a work in progress, I see alot of potential and I look forward to further development", "recommendationid": "30794567", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1490712578, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502994436, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198072940107", "num_games_owned": 109, "playtime_forever": 41}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1491838613, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Its ok need some work not worth $4 maybe $2 but thats the highis I wood go should be free thogh I mite get a refund idk I dont recommend it right now but maybe if they fix it up a bit and add more to it it mite be a little good game you can kill sometime with", "recommendationid": "31061984", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1491838613, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491841718, "num_reviews": 35, "steamid": "76561198107596987", "num_games_owned": 209, "playtime_forever": 114}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496894"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1489361526, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is extremely laggy and lacks functionality.
