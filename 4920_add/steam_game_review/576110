The loading times are indeed longer as usual. This is because all objects and enemies are resettet completly. \n\nButtons affect the gameplay. If you charge, you have to hold charge + jump. Hold jump for 1 - 3 seconds and release the jump button. Then you jump higher. \n\nTutorial is a good idea, but i thought for a jump and run it's not realy necessary.", "timestamp_updated": 1489321939, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489321429, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198007108901", "num_games_owned": 236, "playtime_forever": 63}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1489295466, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I found this game mostly enjoyable, a few issues here and there, but for ~$5 its a decent platformer.\n\nPros\n- Fun quirky style, nice visual design, solid voice acting (everything sounds cooler in German) and an appropriately odd but charming story line\n- Solid movement and controls\n- Level design is challenging and mostly intuitive (if a bit old-school)\n\nCons\n- Reloading times after death could be better usu. 3-7 seconds, a bit on the long side\n- Hitboxes are sometimes a bit funky \n- Checkpoints sometimes don't occur directly after completing a section, leaving you to re-do some longish rooms if you die\n\nCheck out some gameplay here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6cRpXf5e_o&feature=youtu.be", "recommendationid": "30462833", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1489295466, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489300853, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198030287064", "num_games_owned": 110, "playtime_forever": 190}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1496464560, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Holy sh1t man, the effects are awesome thanks to UE4 and dedicated efforts of the developers. This is actually capable of being an engine showcase in my book comparable to some official tech demos.\n\nThe game itself isn't bad at all but needs some fine tuning in terms of UI and controls. I played this with a logitech F310 and new players will have issues with operating lifts due to the lift/door do not have a \"operation indicator\" or sort. Doors sometimes will not respond until you take a few steps back and forward again, I believe this has something to do with the trigger volume or whatever it's called in UE4 these days. \nLoading time could do some tweaking, but wasn't game breaking. Checkpoint is well placed and so far so i didn't encounter any issues. Combat is okay, which is kinda reminded me a simpler variant of megaman/bionic commando play style. The voiceover isn't in English but it kinda gave me a chappie/b13 vibe with the cutscenes.\n\nThe level design is pretty good and even better than \"most\" of the indie games including the pixelated indie stuff, even being in 3D!", "recommendationid": "32144124", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1496464560, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496548395, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561197999156883", "num_games_owned": 106, "playtime_forever": 40}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1504560145, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Therer are quite a few bugs and the menu isn't properly translated, or full translated.
