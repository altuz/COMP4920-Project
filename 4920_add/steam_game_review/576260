The Patricians, Rise of Venice etc. all are my favorites, so I really wanted to like this game but unfortunately I can't. The game has a lot of interesting new ideas, however the graphics are far from the similar ones, but this wouldn't be the problem. The problem is the algorithm of the supply and demand system, which is basically the core of the game. We can call it to an \"exploit\" (like mentioned here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/576260/discussions/0/1473095331503624096/ ) or whatever, but the game simply fails in its core because of this nonsense issue. However, the solution has done by the other similar games, it would be just a matter of time to implement something similar. \n[strike]But it seems the Dev doesn't care\n[/strike].* I was waiting for almost month to get any feedback from the Dev before this review but the time was here to speak up.  It's sad to see that such a good idea failed. I won't ask for a refund, I still hope I can change this review to positive one time...\n\n*update 30/09/2017: finally something is happening here http://steamcommunity.com/app/576260/discussions/0/1520386297688391237/", "recommendationid": "35267959", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506751911, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504465545, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198185417299", "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 1705}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 11, "total_reviews": 43, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 32}}
