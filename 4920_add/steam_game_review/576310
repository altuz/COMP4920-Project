I purchased this title based on other reviews comparing it to Dear Esther\u2026 this game is nothing like Dear Esther. The visuals and atmosphere are good, however the story just got in the way and never really engaged me. After a few paragraphs, the needlessly complex script just felt drawn out and unnecessary. \n\nIf you are looking for a simple walk on an unfamiliar island, then Oracle is for you, however this is all you should really expect. Last word of advice, buy a mini-weight for your W key, you will need it.  \n", "recommendationid": "35011072", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505610823, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505609611, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198203090948", "num_games_owned": 36, "playtime_forever": 140}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505427"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 28, "total_reviews": 77, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 49}}
