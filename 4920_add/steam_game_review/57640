So Broken Sword was among the top on one line with a classic masterpieces like Monkey Island series, etc. I decided to give it a shot and you know what? It's the same thing if you would watch Shawshank Redemption in 2017..That movie is good, it's a definitely a masterpiece, but it doesnt feel the same now as it was back in that days. Cause now we are already spoiled by all these blockbusters, cliffhangers movies and amazing plot twists, etc. So what I am trying to say here, that the same thing is with this game for me. I missed it, cause to be honest, I was somewhere around in the first grade,I believe,when it was released. And I am pretty much sure that all of these 91% positive reviews here are the nostalgic reason first of all, 'cause to be honest, for me it doesnt look special or even unique now here, in 2017. It's just good and that's it and it probably was like a sip of fresh air back in the 1996.\n\nOnly recommend if you are a big fan og p'n'c games and wanna get hooked in a classic games. Otherwise, try something more modern."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500428548, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508688", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33642040", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198063475755", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1500583009, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 163}, "timestamp_updated": 1500428662, "received_for_free": false, "review": "As a long-time fan of the original Broken Sword, I can only recommend this Director's Cut for the original game, which comes with it as a DLC.\n\nDirector's Cut is hardly the word for this - Director's Chop is more like it. Loads of new, needless content has been made and stitched on top of the original game, and it feels like it every bit of the way. Nico gets way more of a role than she should - this is supposed to be George's story. Her opening puzzles are way too much to lay on a first time player as well. The new art and voice acting clashes very badly with that of the original game. It's very repelling, and amateurish-looking. This supposed Director's Cut just messes up everything that still makes the original Broken Sword so appealing.\n\nI recommend that you buy this, but ONLY so that you can download the original Broken Sword as a DLC. Play this game as it was meant to be, not this lopsided alternate version masquerading as a 'director's cut'."}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499705440, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481453", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33435454", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197993236460", "num_reviews": 60, "last_played": 1499705344, "num_games_owned": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 528}, "timestamp_updated": 1499705440, "received_for_free": false, "review": "meh a mediocre old school point and click - stupid sexism abound that makes the characters and plot stupid, the puzzles are way too random at points. The story is interesting and that kept me going til the end, and they were smart enough to heavily edit the amount of walking and talking, and some of the dialogue was funny, but it just wasn't good overall."}]}
