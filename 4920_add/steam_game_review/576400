Every single character is such a piece of crap, being characatured stereotypes of their vocations: You have a douchy prince who thinks his name is enough to woo Elisa, a merchant who thinks his wealth will woo Elisa, a servant who thinks that his loyalty will woo Elisa and, interestingly, a MGTOW knight that wants nothing to do with her until she actively makes it her business to seduce him. There is next to no character development, and the charactes never stop being the most annoying I'v ever seen in a VN. I do have to give them credit for the decent music, nice visuals and at times quite funny moments, but still, I bought this on sale and feel ripped off.
