But it is reasonably entertaining.\n\nThe stupid launcher and need to register and reply to emails and make up passwords before you even load the game, plus installing DRM software, puts paid to the idea that this is a special steam edition. It's a slap in the face before you even get started. That's what gets this game a negative review. Once you get past that though you can have some fun."}]}
