As of this writing, there is no score/user reviews on Metacritic (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/brother-wings). A 'shoot em up' vertical game. This product is far, far away from giving consumer a 'bullet hell' type of gaming experience nor does it even come close in providing moments of 'madness'  'excitement' 'Thrill' \n\nIt's just a very 'tame' product with very little innovation in it's design. Sadly. but that doesn't warrant it as an awful/bad game. and no, its not a terrific game either. \n\nWhat is it about? \nBrother Wings (BW) is an action, top down view, shoot-em up air craft game. You basically need to survive the endless waves of enemy ships on your screen. You are given to play 2 characters; Marko and Guida. Who apparently are brothers - this coming from the product description. A brother with a long pink hair? hmmmm. Hmm indeed.\n\nThe Controls\nStandard WSAD keyboard and mouse. Nothing fancy.\n\nThe Visuals & User Interface\nIt's simple, plain, clean and bright. \n\nThe UI is simple, it shows the important stuff [b]BUT[/b] it overlaps/covers the battlefield on the left hand side of the screen - which I find it annoying. I can understand that without some fancy design to show your ship life information, it may look dull..but overlapping the battlefield is a no no. Especially for a game that requires your \"agility/reflex\" - you practically doomed people who strafe their ship to the left - unable to see incoming enemy ships/missiles in that region.\n\n\nAs of this writing, BW offers 2 game mode: \n[olist]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[*]Infinity Mode - Free play. Endless.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[*]Timed Attack Mode - You need to destroy x amount of ships in x <time>\n[/olist] \nThere is also a leaderboard but from my own experience, I am not sure whether it's working as intended. \n\nAs the product describes, you get to play either 2 of the brother characters with (very little) \"different\" looking ships. You are given 5 life and your goal is to survive@destory as many ships as you can possible can. Once you lose all your life, it's game over.\n\nThroughout your battle, you can pick up health drops and ammo drops. health drops replenish your missing life while ammo drops upgrades your ship shooting ability. Your ship starts of with a single missile firing mode. You can upgrade it to a double missile firing mode and the final form is a barrage of 5 or 6 missiles. No more.\n\nEnemy ships comes in at least 3 forms but they only have 2 roles; mobile fighters and immobile fighters.\n\nmobile fighters = moving targets\nimmobile fighters = not moving targets\n\nThere are \"Boss\" fights too. Sometimes 2 boss ships at once. Talk about the mess.\n\nOther than this, there's no story, no level progression, no ship upgrade abilities, no weapon upgrade abilities (just the 3 different mode of missiles)...I think I covered it all.\n\n\nMy Personal Thoughts\nI am not sure how to approach BW. For me, this product is sitting on a flimsy fence and depending on how I word this writing, 1 little gush of air is all it takes to topple it into the shredder machine or into a bin for safe keeping. \n\nIt's a simple product with no bugs. It has a variety looking enemies but with only 2 roles (mobile & immobile) - this hampers the gaming experience. It's not exciting. There's no thrill. If I may reference a classic game: TwinBee - for example offers so much more excitement. Different form of enemies with different movements and theres a secondary fire mode for land enemies and the random drop \"bell\" loot that gives upgrade to your ship..makes the whole game so much better than what BW has to offer.  (minus the co-op experience of course)\n\n2 brothers 2 ships but there's just so little difference between them. It's just aesthetic and both ship function the same way. Why not be a little bit brave@creative and design both ship to behave differently? \n\nAs I've mentioned in the above, theres no level progression. If you added in different levels/maps - you could offer your consumer with a different gaming experience; different map/different enemies/different boss. Here in BW, 1 map. 1 song. 3-4 standard enemies. Period.\n\nOf course, I will give credit to Brogames for the visual design of the ships. The ships are okay for me. That includes the bosses ships. On another separate note, I must credit the audio team for the epic rock song..its awesome only for the first 10 minutes. After that it will drive you crazy with the same tune over and over and over again. I had to mute it and play my own mp3's.\n\nIf you look at TwinBee, you'd notice they extended the audio to a lot of other stuff other than just providing a background music. That feedback is a nice thing to have.\n\nMy Summary\nI definitely had fun in BW but there's a huge gap left wanting more. I understand that for all this \"changes/improvements\" that I wish to see in BW ..which I believe will definitely make a difference in terms of game experience [b]BUT[/b] it will no longer cost the same. So that's a major decision to decide if you're breaking into the market as a new indie company. BW was designed in a small scale (due to that, there's a huge room of improvements!) and I believe it will entertain younger consumer audience or probably for very casual gamers. Definitely. \n\nFor more experienced/hardcore gamers, who's seeking for challenge or thrill in a shoot em up style of game, this is (sadly) not [u][i]the[/i][/u] product to do so.\n\n*runs to the stage with Marko on the drums and Guida on the guitar - plays some rock song* So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Brother Wings is a [b]Rocking[/b] 5/10. \n\n\\m/ Rock on brota & sista \\m/ pew pew pew", "recommendationid": "31817113", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1495088706, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500739128, "num_reviews": 25, "steamid": "76561198083736752", "num_games_owned": 162, "playtime_forever": 144}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_positive": 3}}
