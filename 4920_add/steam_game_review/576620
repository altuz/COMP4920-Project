[/spoiler] Also, I spent 10 minutes shooting the gun and buildiung the robot in the spawn room. So what essentially is a 40-50 minute game should not cost 13 dollars for puzzles that does not offer anything new or too interesting. \n\nPuzzles: Some of the puzzles were cool. None of them took much thinking which, for me, is what makes escape room games fun. While the puzzles were fairly simple, they were sometimes fun to solve. I will not go into depth just in case of people not wanting to know what puzzles they should be looking out for in the game. \n\nWhy do I not recomend this: I know I liked some of the puzzles, but none of them were unbelieveably cool. If the game was a little longer, the puzzles were a little bit more though provoking, or the game a little bit cheaper I would have recomended it, but that is not the case.", "recommendationid": "33726168", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1500746035, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500743307, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198064587785", "num_games_owned": 833, "playtime_forever": 58}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505661"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 22, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 20}}
