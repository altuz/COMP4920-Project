Good gunplay and the lack of rounds in the clips is effective when under pressure. \n\nthe first 2 levels were very effective (really straining to see the Z's coming out of the grass in the dark), but the last level went on way too long and the uphill angle does not work with the player standing on a flat floor (in reality), its causes a disconnect especially when turning around in that space\n\nlittle details like having the NPC interact more or tell a story whilst wheelbarrowing would enhance the immersion, as would detailing the zombies with different skins\n\noverall, an effective and frightening experience, that can only get better with further development. recommended to check out..its free as well :)", "recommendationid": "29535089", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485585017, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485333519, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561197996885673", "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_forever": 13}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485495922, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very well done creepiness factor.
