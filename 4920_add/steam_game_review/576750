This is a .99 cent game.  And it's quite the bargain now on sale for even less at .60 cents.  This game is basically Cut The Rope, but with dragons instead.  \n\nThere's 12 levels in 4 different environments.  Each level has a unique puzzle to solve.  The puzzles do add more challenges, but they were all relatively easy for me as an adult.  I think kids may find more of a challenge. \n\nThe Oculus Rift with Touch controllers does have some issues.  Basically, you have to point the wand and then hold on to the A button until it starts.  Look down at the floor and point wand at home icon and hold on to the A button to exit.  \n\nRating 6/10 (but probably an 8/10 for kids)", "recommendationid": "35134732", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506105344, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1506104166, "num_reviews": 210, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 11}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 12, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 10}}
