This meme filled rage game is not an enjoyable time at all. With mismatched graphics that range from decent pixel art to crap clipart, terrible voice acting, and the least fun checkpoint gauntlets I have seen in a long time, please don't waste your time like I did. If you already own this game because of a sale or bundle, first, my condolences, second, just idle for cards and uninstall.\n\nAlso, this game ends with a dick shapped tank, and it wasn't even a well done dick tank.", "recommendationid": "33495000", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499919047, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499918544, "num_reviews": 28, "steamid": "76561198044721583", "num_games_owned": 677, "playtime_forever": 302}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506148"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 25, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 19}}
