Behind its generic looking exterior and bland LOOKING gameplay, see the emphasis on LOOKING, there really is a great game here. Enemies come from every direction at anytime and some scenarios perfectly melded the tense and reflex needed action with problem solving skills because of its ingenious, puzzle like enemy placement. Almost every time I died, I felt that it was my own fault and never the games fault, whether it was my awful accuracy or inability to take in the situation around me. This game is the best kind of changelling and trust me when I say, keep a window open, it gets sweaty in that headset. Also sidenote, one really fun challenge I love doing is in one section, just leave at least two enemies alive, and as they fire at you, simply just try and dodge the bullets coming at you. The bullets are slow enough for you to dodge them, but fast enoguh to still have it be a challenge. I was laughing my first time just out of how fun it was and even with almost half a year with the HTC vive, a game hasn't got me laughing since I first put on the thing on, well at least until now. This game is great and It's free, it's a match made in heaven.\nA tip of the hat to the developers/developer of this game.\nBravo...

For a free game I'm actually thoroughly impressed.  I picked this up thinking it would be the dumb usual shovelware for Vive, but considering it's free, it's not bad.  Having taken only 15 minutes to beat, I definitely wouldn't pay more than 2$ for it.  However, the gameplay is surprisingly solid enough that if it were more than an hour long, I'd actually pay upwards of 5-10$ or so for it, which really isn't bad.  The game runs remarkably smoothly compared to many worse-looking VR titles, the action is nice and responsive, and I felt immersed in the action.  \nThe game plays almost exactly like a classic arcade shooter.  And I don't mean \"arcade\" like a steam \"arcade\" game- I mean this actually feels like one of the classic rail shooters that you play with friends at an arcade, paying tokens and being rewarded tickets.  Surprisingly, very (VERY) few VR games actually take advantage of this type of game mechanic, clearly making the false assumption that it's not worth making it less immersive.  The action makes you feel badass enough that it's borderline silly (similar to arcades- as long as you have good aim, you can see all the opponents collapse in almost an instant).  Between the aesthetics, music, and action, this game feels *exactly* like a traditionalistic early 1980's sci-fi classic vibe.  \nThere are only two cons that I'd say are substantial:\n1.  There are things that appear as fun, intimidating boss battles, of two kinds: A giant exosuit, and a powerful shielded knight.  Apparently, the giant exosuit isn't implemented in the game yet, since shooting it immediately brings you to the next area without any fight.  Although the shield knights would otherwise be badass, they go down in almost a single hit.\n2.  The reloading system feels a bit dumb.  It's interesting- when you run out of ammo, a clip automatically appears in your non-dominant hand and you have to slap it into the gun.  This actually feels pretty cool.  However, seeing as how bare-bones it is, I'd rather just press a button.  I like it when vive games let you use only one controller.  In this game, you need to use the second controller, but solely for this one purpose that isn't even necessary.  \n\nOverall, I've gone on too long seeing as this is a free game.  I'd say it's 1000% worth downloading and playing.  It's not spam, and I promise that it actually gave me a wholeheartedly FUN experience for a solid 20 minutes or so.  It doesn't even take up too much disc space.", "recommendationid": "29708024", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486260991, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486259715, "num_reviews": 23, "steamid": "76561198008591010", "num_games_owned": 621, "playtime_forever": 13}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495711"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485962922, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Actually pretty good", "recommendationid": "29629915", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485962922, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486238403, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198045937743", "num_games_owned": 164, "playtime_forever": 78}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490733"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485316409, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is pretty good , will be MUCH better when we get wireless because there is a lot of turning and moving out of the way/dodging ... cable an issue if you want to play agressive in this one , enemies come at you from everywhere so beware and dont take out the humans!!!   aiming seems good but maybe a few more weapons.....", "recommendationid": "29475498", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485316409, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494010322, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198117251812", "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 76}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498339"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485418794, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is really good and deserves more attention.
