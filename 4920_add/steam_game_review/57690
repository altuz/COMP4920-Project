It's really hard to rate, because it's a very enjoyable experience yet it manages to be very lacking in some aspects which are basically a norm in other 'tycoon' games.\n\nThe game's visuals are great, even 6 years after release. The texture quality of buildings/rocks/vegetation is sweet. Can't lay a finger on a bad thing about the sound either.\n\nBut when it comes to the mechanics and gameplay it feels like game is either not giving you enough information to properly manage your city or everything is cramped inside unintuitive menu. Sure, I can build plantations, destilleries, cigar factories farms, fishing huts but nowhere in the game can I find information on how much of each resource I currently have. I have no numbers on how much sugar I'm producing and how much is being taken to produce alcohol, why the factory is not doing well, how much food is currently being consumed etc. I can't see which part of the production chain is lacking. This is a huge downside for me, after games like Anno. There are some clues in the 'book' but it's a simple information that im currently producing enough food, welp.\n\nYou can produce power plants and yet there are no charts about consumption, production. You have to manually click on the power plant/wind turbine to see how's it doing. It starts getting obnoxious after you reach populations of 500+ where there is no time for such micromanagement.\n\nThe game allows you to allign your island towards some political views, yet there's no visual differences and anything special about doing any of the paths. Your island looks the game and people mostly behave the same whether you're full time commie or a capitalist. I wish I could distinguish communists/religious people/nationalists, not only read that they belong to these groups after clicking on them.\n\nYeah, each citizen has personality, political views, belongs to some group yet I can't see some more important information - how many people are unemployed, how many people work at selected education levels. I have no idea why selected citizen left his job as a doctor, priest.\n\nSimple tutorials/information displayed when hovering over on option or more advanced charts could solve most of these problems. Yet, this is one of a kind game, and it's generally enjoyable (sometimes too easy) so I'd give it a go if you can get it at decent price."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504661845, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34767774", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198103612146", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1487244393, "num_games_owned": 585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1152}, "timestamp_updated": 1504661845, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Best worst presidente simulator ever.

Can please somebody give me one reason why this would be required and what exactly does it protect? It is just frustrating, Are you so desperate to send me your spam e-mails? And if I registered once and then forget the password? \n\nDear, Kalypso developers, I hope everything that you use in life will require some strange password. It is not an insult I hope, because passwords are fun, aren't they!\n\nOk, please have a nice day thinking about what else can you do to frustrate people. And then have a sales meeting about how to increase sales, probably make a password window more bright? ....\n\np.s. I DO recomend Tropico 4 as a game, I am frustrated with company's attitude"}]}
