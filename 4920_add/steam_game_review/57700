I made it to the final boss and just had enough before beating it. Why can I play bullet hell shmups like Touhou for hours and yet can't stand this game for more than an hour and a half? It boils down to the health system the game uses. This game treats enemies passing the left side of the screen as a decrease in hit points, which is fine; it's not the first time that idea has been used in a shmup. The problem is the enemy design. Because the player character has no health, the large enemies instead stun the player and reverse the controls, while the small grunts move towards the left side of the screen. This leads to pure frustration when you screw up and just have to watch a small horde of enemies pass you by while you wait the obligatory 3 seconds or so to get back in the action. And it's infuriating. The combo system, required to get attacks capable of destroying some of the enemy waves, makes this more punishing. One mistake and you lose that super-beam you needed to even pass the level. This leads to a rich-get-richer style scenario which, while fine, just pisses me off. \n\nIt's an alright shmup. Get it if you don't mind being stunned for about 3 seconds when hit and really enjoy trying to get perfect runs in shmups. If loss of control annoys you like it does me, however, stay far away.\n\nOh and force vsync when running or the game will play at a ridiculous speed that is literally impossible.
