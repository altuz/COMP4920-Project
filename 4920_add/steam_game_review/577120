They looked at a nice little windmill on the coast (which the suit guy said he couldn't afford) before looking at a nearby island where real estate guy suggests they build a theme park. That's when things started to get weird. Before you know it real estate guy is claiming he's been able to control hot air balloons using his mind since he was a baby and suit guy is talking about capturing a Kaiju penguin to exhibit in some sort of demented cartoon Jurassic Park he plans to build!\n   There are lots of these characters all doing their own thing in this island microcosm. You can move (fly) around the island using the touchpad on a controller. When you near a character the speech bubble above his head becomes visible. It's passive, you can't interact with the characters so it's not a game - more like being a spectator in a sort of freeform animated tv show. The dialogue is eclectic but often amusing. \n  \nCons:\n-no sound effects.  \n-movement system needs some work.  Can make turns in approx 45 degree increments but the screen blanks for a second whilst you do so, which is annoying.\n-would be great to be able to 'lock' onto a character and auto follow them. Sometimes dialogue gets blocked by other objects in the scene.\n- I'll never know if suit guy got to exhibit the giant Penguin!\n\n   If you've got kids this would be great to use as a storytelling tool, maybe with voiceover from the adult watching the monitor as the child follows the exploits of a  character in VR. I enjoyed this far more than i expected even without kids. With clever writing and more evolved engine this could be a really interesting branch of VR.\n\nRating 8/10", "recommendationid": "29117849", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1483888411, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485697306, "num_reviews": 75, "steamid": "76561198002872077", "num_games_owned": 214, "playtime_forever": 91}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509412"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1486516980, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Boring and big stories without any action and Intrigue =(\nBluefish?
