The shooting feels good, but grabbing the drinks is sometimes an issue as they either spill immediately or don't count when you bring them to your face. The drinks also need to be a more to your side as after the first couple they are too far behind you to be comfortable. But honestly the biggest problem is that I want to be able to switch sides so I can shoot with my right and drink with my left.\n\nBut all that said, it's a fun concept. Having to keep yourself at a moderate level of drunk is a nice change of pace from just constantly shooting and forces you to manage 2 things at once. For the price, it's a fun game.\n\nUpdate:\nI came back for another round and ended up beating the first level, which I hadn't even realized was a thing. I enjoyed the first level, but the second one is a blast. It's still a small game, but it's priced well for the experience and it's worth having in VR library.", "recommendationid": "34405608", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506042428, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 33, "last_played": 1506035787, "num_reviews": 113, "steamid": "76561198060821109", "num_games_owned": 639, "playtime_forever": 59}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1503871347, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "\"Drunk or dead\" is a very funny wave-shooter!
