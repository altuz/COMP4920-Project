If they had made the whole game old-school-fully-turnbased combat, it could have been absolutely amazing. If the AI was working better and balancing wasn't extremely wonky, it would have been great.\n\nThe way it is, it is solely not bad and can fill the void of tactical iso-combat within the heart of the older generation of gamers, but being a diehard Jagged Alliance fan since the first game, I was let down by this fundamentally flawed remake. Only after just ignoring the title name and the fact that I do remember the story vividly from the original game, I was able to start to look at Back in Action in its own right and stopped to compare it with its original successor.\n\nAnd after doing that, I did actually manage to sink in quite a bit of time into it and after getting used to weird AI range proficiency and being in cover at all times, it suddenly started to be more and more fun.\n\nIf I ever had really mixed feelings about a game, then it was Back in Action in the last two to three weeks. It's not a worthy Jagged Alliance game, but it is not a bad game either. If you like semi-turnbased iso tactical combat, it could be for you. If you want to relive Jagged Alliance, you'll have to replay the original. And don't do the same mistake of comparing titles like I did, because it will ultimately make you feel let down.\n\nAll in all, I still had fun and even with those mixed feelings I feel like I can recommend this title to genre fans."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502750856, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504047", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34245043", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198021953887", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1502962038, "num_games_owned": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 12428}, "timestamp_updated": 1502750912, "received_for_free": false, "review": "My recomendation is based on:\n- I played the game on Hardest difficulty, with the \"Realistic Rebalance\" mod installed, that made stealth combat much more enjoyable and improved many things in the game. Many thanks to Killatomate for his fantastic modding work.\n- I played JA2 back on the '90s (original and Wildfire), and am a big fun of the original games, which I also recomment to everyone.\n\nIn general: \nJA - Back In Action (moded) had me staying awake for nights on the row, with many fulfilling and rewording moments when my combined attack plan succeded in nutralizing six-seven enemies in a matter of seconds, when my stealth inflitration commado managed to get more than ten kills before remaining enemies even knew he was arround, and when my 'Boom Boom' squad cleared the batlefield with a rain of granates and RPGs. \n\nDetails:\n\nThe \"pause-able real time\" mechanic is not the \"turn based\" I loved in the older JA and X-com series tactical games. But it is more 'realistic' and can result in really nice momments . I am enjoying playing also JA2-Wildfire simultaneusly with JA-Back in action, since the different mechanics provide two fantastic but indepented game experiences.\n\nOne-time purchase cost of the mercs, and AI insisting on getting only two assoult routs (so no more than one-two sectors need defending), means that money soon will not be a problem. So, I got overenthusiastic and got more than 24 merks under my command (something almost imposible in JA2). At that point, micromanagment of their re-equipment took more than the combat itself, and I started getting a bit frastrated, even though I liked the huge variety of weapons available.\n\nA critical fumble of the developers: They didnt include the option to create a character to be your avatgar in the game. I got angry on them, but afterwards I got over it...\n\nLeveling with skill points and no training option as it was at JA2: As a result the local free-merks can never be super-merks. So I use them as packing-mules, while at JA2 games I always had the main squad consist of my character and the local fighters.\n\nDO NOT PURCHASE THE \"xxx Specialist Kit\" DLCs. They just provide at the start of the game one above-average weapon and a one-time-use armor-helmet set. The variety of weapons and ammunition in my gamming, ment that really soon I had other alternative options, so the money spend on the particular DLCs were not justified.\n\nPersonally I value more the JA2 (Wildfire and original), so I propose you start with them, and afterwards go into Back In Action."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502640196, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489715", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34216996", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198412555769", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1502579059, "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 10}, "timestamp_updated": 1502642157, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Really bad game, the similar turn based is quite no the same, such a pity, the second of this series was the best gam ei have ever played\n\n\nYou get really lost, specially when shooting, you pause, than program to hit the enemy 3 times and the merc only shoots once and keeps getting fire, such a crap - FOTGET IT !!!
