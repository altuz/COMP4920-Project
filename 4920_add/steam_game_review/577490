Enemy minotaurs (and, eventually, other creatures) come in from the sides of the board to kill your stones and claim the victory point locations for themselves. Kill them and they'll respawn. An individual round only takes a couple of minutes, and if you win enough, it gets harder- more minotaurs and more score required to clear the board. \n\nYou get a handful of cards that each have a strong, specific effect that requires your stones to be in a given position. You can only use one card per turn, so choose carefully. \n\nThe game is both brilliant and simple, and I highly recommend it to anybody who likes tactical strategy games.", "recommendationid": "33910367", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501437255, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497110127, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561197999259031", "num_games_owned": 306, "playtime_forever": 139}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502735811, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I support every single game that mentions Ancient Greek Mythology.", "recommendationid": "34241054", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502735811, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489661285, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198311200072", "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_forever": 82}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 11, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 11}}
