A card game that has no storyline and no multiplayer!  You can make up your own story and let the imagination flow.  No multiplayer = you are the best and no one needs to cheat to best you.  The training teaches you the basics and I understand how it is to have English as a 2nd or 3rd language.  However, it turned out to be fun to read (not laughing at mistakes, but the way humor presented itself).  You can then easily figure out what to do and edit your deck accordingly.  Then you get excited over new cards and new levels of cards!  And I LOVE grinding!  So hooray to having lots of opponents to train on and practice your skills.\n\nCan this game be better?  I already think it is good for its price.  It offers way more content than some other games for the same pricing.  BUT if the Creator chooses to expand on some areas, that is their choice.\n\nThank you for making this game - I can't wait to play more of it. :)))", "recommendationid": "31046897", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1491764826, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491763675, "num_reviews": 39, "steamid": "76561198207083779", "num_games_owned": 125, "playtime_forever": 79}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505348"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
