Very short. But it promises so much and is definitely worth the download, if only to show support to the developers for the full experience to be worked upon and released.\n\nAs somebody who has been to sea as a crewman and a lifeboat trained leader on many passenger liners throughout the years, I have sailed the dreaded route taken across the Atlantic by the Titanic many times. I have clung desperately onto the rails of many a focsle deck whilst the waves raised some 30-40ft above my head. Sometimes I wondered if the bow would ever come back up, and we're talking ships twice the size of the Titanic here! It's a ridiculously scary experience, especially knowing that you will be responsible for the lives of every passenger and crew member in your lifeboat if the worst should happen.\n\nBut what's even more harrowing about the Titanic tale, is that the Atlantic that night was even calmer than the Pacific (\"Pacify\"). Titanic sailed to her doom upon a bed of glass like water with merely a ripple of distress. She contained enough lifeboats and rafts for every soul on board until the 'visual designers' deemed them unsightly before she sailed.\n\n\"Why do we need these unsightly lifeboats? After all, she's unsinkable, isn't she?\", they queried.\n\nIn this demo we get to hear the voice (unsure if it's acted, or the actual voice) of a survivor's words. We get to hear and see the majesty of the Titanic sailing by a small fishing boat, and we also preview the hulk of a majestic liner doomed to a life beneath the waves instead of upon them.\n\nThis could be an incredible experience: a lesson of reflection for us all, and a moment to ponder, as we witness the fate of 'yesteryear's technological breakthrough\" via the lenses of today's breakthrough tech.\n\nVery exciting!", "recommendationid": "29620013", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485921033, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489452061, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561197974617712", "num_games_owned": 153, "playtime_forever": 51}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549079"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 13, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485909825, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The experience takes approximately 6 minutes, and is definitely worth your time.

I'm fascinated by the Titantic and this demo has made me excited to see where else they will put us in this experience. I hope we step inside and I hope we get an onboard experience of it cracking in half. Who knows. What I do know is that based on this, I believe I will enjoy it. I've been wanting a Titantic experience since... the early 2,000s (?) when I had some 1st person PC game where you walked around the ship.\n\nThe demo is short, around 6 minutes, but brilliant IMO. No stutters here. The graphics look great to me. Sure, none of the VR games currently look like my monitor with Titan X but for me, these graphics are fine and I'm grateful to the devs for putting me on Apollo 11 and now this! This has great sound design and cinematics like a movie trailer. I'm glad I tried it.\n\nSomeone said the scale is off when you are underwater looking at the ship. Hmmm maybe? I wouldn't have thought this if he hadn't mentioned it. Should it look larger at this point of view? IDK. I feel like I could have stepped onto it and it would have been correct.
