The amount of different characters you recognise that you had forgot about is amazing. They have packed a lot of references in there. I won't name them as half the fun is recognising them and shouting it out. \nThe game is an obvious clone of Paperboy but in my opinion it is much better and more fun to play. Plus you don't need a bicycle controller to play it!  I find it easier to play with a controller. Unfortunately the game does not support a controller but I use Pinnacle to get around this. There are only 4 keys anyway so its not really an issue. \nThe difficulty level is spot on leading you to the feeling of \"Just one more go\" and one more go becomes 10 more goes etc... \nHighly recommended at the full price.", "recommendationid": "33383593", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499542311, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501795563, "num_reviews": 53, "steamid": "76561198017076824", "num_games_owned": 6276, "playtime_forever": 253}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509880"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 15, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 15}}
