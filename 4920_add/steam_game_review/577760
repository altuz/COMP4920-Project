Looking through the main concept of the game you notice there is a hidden message throughout the game that could symbolise with that of mental health where you are given the option to just break and become that dark side that has pressured you all your life and although it means beating on the weak you feel stronger because of it. \n\npersonally find it quite a strong message and really love the fact the developer has included myself among others who have supported him through the game. I have had the pleasure of testing the game through its start and to see all the progress that has been in the game was truly inspiring and couldnt be more greatful. \n\nI would highly recommend this game to all rpg fans as there are multiple ways of playing the game (trying not to spoil it for those who haven't) the game touches on different forms of gameplay. Romance, multiple endings, good vs evil evil vs evil and so on. The replayability for the game is definitely a plus side.", "recommendationid": "34715766", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504455594, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499532221, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198027975199", "num_games_owned": 375, "playtime_forever": 112}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500713"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504183121, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I really enjoyed playing this rpg game that was created by a friend and fellow You Tuber Savage Dragoon. To create this old school Final Fantasy type of game was an achievement in itself and I really liked the story of one man's quest to defeat the darkness around him. As a sufferer of mental illness myself, particularly anxiety, I know what it is like to battle against the demons inside your head telling u that u cannot do this even though u want to. The whole game itself was a joy from start to finish and I can never fault it whether it is from the narrative, character designs, enemies, boss battles etc. There are hints to other rpg games and animes particularly FF7. It wasn't easy but it wasn't overly hard either. I love a game where decisions can lead to consequences, however bad they might be.\n\nThanks to Savage Dragoon for creating this amazing game. I can highly recommend that u give this game a try and u never know it might make u want to replay it to get different endings and new achievements.

The story features multiple branches and so you're almost guaranteed to find something new each time you play.\n\nI personally haven't come across any bugs yet, but I know the developer is working very hard on fixing any that appear along with adding new content.
