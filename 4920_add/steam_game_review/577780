This could have been anything. A non interactive spooky staged play, or a scary ride, who knows. It's actually a full on horror experience similar to The Bellows, but with more interesting puzzles and a spookier ethos. The intro scene where you steal the item to start the game was confusing, you actually have to bring it to the door. There were some small bugs in some of the scenes, but nothing too extreme. There's alot of value here for the price! It is very impressive! You will get stuck at the wireframe challenge puzzle, it's impossible, nobody has that kind of dexterity or stamina to do it. Like seriously, it's impossible, so I couldn't complete this otherwise great game. [spoiler]Has anyone seen what happens after that?

You have to pass a green square over black pipes without touching the edges. This is an awful thing in VR. I'm not at all convinced I'm actually touching the edges, yet I fail over and over again. I thought maybe my hands were too shakey so I asked my nimble kids to try it, and they couldn't do it either. It's too bad. Prior to that point, this was a well done game (other than a pretty big bug at the beginning where the game you're supposed to steal just disappears before you can get it out of the shop.) \n\nTo the devs: I promise to re-rate this game if you'll fix it up and make it playable.
