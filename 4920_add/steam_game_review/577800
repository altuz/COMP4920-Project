I mainly play My Career so this review is from that prospective.\n\nPros: Character models look pretty good. Gameplay feels smooth. I actually like how defense feels this time out. \n\nCons: 2k has always been pretty greedy but this year just feels savage. First there are only about 5 hairstyles unlocked for your character at the start of the game. You have to pay for any other ones that you want. They also do not stay unlocked. If you switch to one hairstyle, then get a different one, you will have to pay to switch back to the first one.\n\nSure the story in My Career is cheesy but it wouldn't matter if it weren't for that fact that... You can't skip cutscenes. This is unexcusable. When you make a character, it takes over an hour before your character is even able to play his first game in the NBA. Also when upgrading a character, you can't see how each upgrade point corresponds to each attribute point. Will increasing my ball handling increase my speed with ball attribute 3 points or 1? There's no way to know unless you hand over that sweet, sweet VC.\n\nNow that 2k has implemented the neighborhood you have to load into it to play My Player, even if you didn't plan on playing Park or ProAM! \n\n2k is lucky that they have addicts like me buying the game because they have proved time and time again that they don't care about their fan base. \n\nI will update this review as updates start coming out for the game.\n\nUPDATE: I just had MyCareer player data deleted. Apparently this is a common occurence right now that 2K is trying to push a patch for on XB1 and PS.... BUT no news about when/if this patch will be coming to PC.
