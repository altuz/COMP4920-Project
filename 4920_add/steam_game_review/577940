Imo It's head to head with Tekken7 (or maybe almost as good as that) regarding quality, fun and technical aspects. And then KoF14. I don't need to say sfv and mvci are plain rubbish. Sorry if u got scammed by crapcom (again).\n\nThe Steam Game:\n\n* 29 chars. Full roster included here. All season chars. All costumes. \n\n* Full and I mean full customization. Unlockable colours, and features like skins, profile icons and things like those, with KI gold (nothing compared to what crapcom does with their failed and unfinished games).\n\n* Steam Version does support crossplay amon w10-xbx1 and ofc Steam. However ranked is not supported here (Ranked Steam vs Steam only, the rest of online modes are cross play supported though).\n\n* Fluid game, fights are indeed pretty dynamic and attractive. Game is also colourful and interesting, full of cool and nice effects and quite impressive during combos and special moves, visually speaking. So It's also nice to watch other ppl's matches. \n\n*Great music and ost!\n\n* Many technical mechanics, such as classical combo breakers; shadow combos, normal combos, jabs, grabs, normal moves, special moves, etc. Still have a lot to learn and practice.\n\n* Chars designs are terrific and quite different to each other. Animations are also great and you may find quite distinctive fighting styles.\n\n* Just tried online against xbx1 players which ran smooth and quite good (only 1 match was laggy and opponent left, the rest was just perfect). And then a bit of tutorial because I still have little to none idea about the game mechanics (I've been destroyed online).\n\n* I could appreciate it has many single content modes. So, if you are not into competitive matches, you'll be fine too.\n\n* Till October 4th it has a -25% discount, therefore I strongly advise you to get it asap if you are looking for a good FG (other options are ofc T7 and KoF14). \n\n* Microtransactions are just cosmetic and unlockable by just playing the game, so don't freak out if you see the \"gold\" being sold at the store or within the game. You get gold by playing anyway.\n\n* Again I'm a total newcommer to KI, never bought the w10 version but already loving this full game.\n\n* Fun fact? It supports W7 lol.\n\nOnly cons? It come to Steam with huge delay (after a couple of years) and does not support ranked crosspay. Again it supports full cross play for lobbies and it's finally here. Cross play will help you to always find matches, which is the most important.\n\nRecommended for FG lovers!! \n\nKI along with Tekken7 and KoF14 are a must have imo.", "recommendationid": "35253027", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506638551, "votes_funny": 3, "comment_count": "7", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 396, "last_played": 1506895054, "num_reviews": 24, "steamid": "76561198081787138", "num_games_owned": 279, "playtime_forever": 396}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585735"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 47, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506615166, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Been playing this game since it's release on Windows Store\n\nOne of my favourite fighting games and plus it's got Rash in it!\n\nEdit: Just to leave out any confusion, I did have to purchase the game again as there's no cross-buy between W10 version and Steam version\n\nAlso some people seem to be confused in that they keep saying this game was \"free\" on W10 and Xbox, this was not the case, it used a F2P ecomony with 1 character that would rotate every week\n\nThis includes *everything* and when I bought the windows store version, at the time, to buy *everything* in the game would of cost way over $100 USD so the current price on Steam is really good for what you get \n\nAlso alot of people are under the impression this uses micro-transactions, however that KI gold you see under the 'buy' button is not needed, you can unlock everything in the game just by playing regularly.. the KI coins work more like the 'unlock krypt' pack for Mortal Kombat X", "recommendationid": "35265399", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506623262, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "7", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1451, "last_played": 1507152159, "num_reviews": 28, "steamid": "76561197974841200", "num_games_owned": 462, "playtime_forever": 1451}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569020"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 57, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506548977, "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The only reason to use the Windows store finally arrives on Steam, complete with Windows 7 support and limited crossplay support with the other releases of the game.\n\nCrossplay aside, this is the definitive release of the game.", "recommendationid": "35250028", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506548977, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "last_played": 1506546101, "num_reviews": 39, "steamid": "76561198002465515", "num_games_owned": 1008, "playtime_forever": 19}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563625"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 41, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506994699, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Important Stuff:\n\nComes with all characters including Shadow Jago, Kilgore, and Shin Hisako. \nComes with all colors except the figurine special colors. \nNetcode is great.

Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.", "recommendationid": "35419262", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1507042191, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 487, "last_played": 1507108744, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198047269494", "num_games_owned": 509, "playtime_forever": 487}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551804"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 45, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506829597, "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Killer Instinct on the SNES was one of the first video games I ever played, so the series is special to me.\n\nI never owned an Xbox One and Windows 10 is cancer, so this was my first chance to play this game, and wow, I just can't believe how much content there is in this game.\n\nSingle player: It's sad to me that in 2017 I am surprised to see fully fledged out single player modes in a fighting game, but here it is. You have Shadow Lords, two different story modes, Arcade, two different types of Survival mode, a fully featured tutorial mode that is arguably one of the best ones out there, and an extensive practice that even allows you to take some of the practice mode parameters and use it in the other 1p modes. I did a playthrough of arcade with all of the hitboxes turned on just for fun. \n\nFor fans of Super Smash Bros 4, there is also a mode similar to how the Amiibos work, where you can train up a CPU character that has your fighting style and then it can earn you points towards unlocking skins, even when you're offline, when other players play through Shadow Survival mode. \n\nMultiplayer: Netcode is flawless, but be wary that the crossplay feature is only available for lobbies and exhibition, so if you want to play ranked it will be kind of dead or you'll be fighting the same guy over and over.\n\nGameplay system: Easy to learn, hard to master. My favorite type of game. You can start the game up and within a few matches you'll have most of the basic mechanics down. Very new player friendly.\n\nSound: The sound design in this game is amazing. Between the musical menus, the background music being truely dynamic and syncing up to the action (or lack thereof) in a match, and how guttural and viscious each attack sounds, I just can't praise it enough.\n\nSummary: Amazing fighting game, especially as a fan of the series. One of the best ones on the market right now. My only gripes are the fact that there's no f2p model so there won't get to be as many people to try it out, and the lack of the original 2 Killer Instincts that's on the XB1 version.", "recommendationid": "35362619", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506915959, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1921, "last_played": 1507164826, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198117310633", "num_games_owned": 230, "playtime_forever": 1921}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536042"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 29, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506645160, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game comes with all of the characters (including the Shin Hisako, Kilgore, and Eagle) from each season.

As such, all characters are fully unlocked. Although there are micro transactions, these are entirely optional--as all skins/badges et al. are accessible via regular game play/grinding and are all totally cosmetic.\n\nThe major two complaints with this iteration of Killer Instinct are as follows:\n\n1. Cross platform play for Ranked Matches is blocked between Steam and Win/Xbox player bases. This seems arbitrary and very short sighted on the part of M$.\n\n2. The online performance test, which is required for online ranked matches, can prohibit players from participating in ranked matches if their system is deemed to be below certain undisclosed thresholds. This \"black box\" testing is unacceptable as several instances of otherwise viable rigs have been reported as failing this test. However, the feedback afforded from the ingame diagnostic does not give any viable information/suggestions as to what is causing the respective low score (It simply gives a score with a minimum threshold of 1000). This can result in systems, which can run the game perfectly well in unranked matches and single player, being unable to participate in the ranked system.\n\nOverall the game is fun and fits well with the original coin-op iterations of KI1 and KI2. However, for online play, due to the opaque performance testing and segregated ranked player bases, cannot be fully recommended. Simply put, the design and implementation of these two elements are abject failures and seem highly arbitrary.\n\nPurchase the game for solo play or online unranked play.\nDo not purchase the game for online ranked play (as you may well be blocked from participating by the game itself).\nDo not purchase the game if you are keen to complete all achievements -- as several require access to online ranked matches to which you may not have access.", "recommendationid": "35316345", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506729035, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 700, "last_played": 1507088377, "num_reviews": 33, "steamid": "76561197989273094", "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 700}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525310"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 14, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506800788, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I've been playing fighting games all my life (not tournament-calibur however), and I think that this remake of KI is incredible.  \n\nI love the creativity and balance between all the characters (from what I've seen and heard).  That's really hard to achieve in a game.  Plus it runs butterly smooth on my 2-year old midrange pc, the loading is fast, and the sound and hits are really sharp and visceral.  You CAN tell that the facial detail isn't as good as that found in other AAA titles in the genre, but it doesn't make that much of a difference once you start spectating the action on the 2d plane where the fighting takes place.  \n\nWhile I do like how fast the game plays, I wish there were some \"slow but rewarding if it connects\" kind of moves too.  Think of the charge moves in the Soul Calbir/Tekken series.  Granted I haven't played KI for that long, but I think I've only seen one charge move from Sabrewolf, and when the streamer playing as him tried to perform it in an online match, he failed both attempts.  I know there are characters like Aganos too, but besides those few examples, it seems like the vast majority of attacks are super fast.  However that's just a minor gripe that draws itself from my days with SF2. The fighting game genre has evolved, and KI has moved with the times just fine.  \n\nThere is of course other gripes like me STILL not being able to figure out how to get my Hori Fighting Commander 3 pad to fully work (in the meantime, I'm still playing on the keyboard), and the fact that I get a \"Killer Instinct didn't shut down properly\" message each time I exit.  But those aren't dealbreakers.  \n\nSo far, KI offers so much in style, character creativity and balanced systems that really makes this game stand out from a lot of other fighters I've seen in modern times.  And the fact that it finally came out on Steam makes it possible for Windows 7 users like myself to play this gem for their first time.", "recommendationid": "35351944", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506807413, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 598, "last_played": 1507114992, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198117861835", "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_forever": 598}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512426"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 15, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506591634, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "All Characters + dlc Skins unlocked from the get go... amazing stages and a badass soundtrack! +CROSSPLAY and a good NETCODE!\n\nFor 30 bucks this game is totally worth it!\n\nLots of single player content, lots of customization (tekken7 like) and you can unlock everything else by just playing the game.
