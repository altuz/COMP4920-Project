Or at least it wasn't bad. When it was released back in 2000 it was a state of the art game. And it's based around a interesting idea. However there are some serious reasons why I am not going to give it a thumbs up for now:\n\n1st: It's a very bad port. Instead of fixing the Direct3D incompatibilities relating to the new Windows versions the publisher just added a compatibility layer for the old 3dfx Glide API (which became obsolete approximately 15 years ago). Because of that settings that were present in the original Direct3D version (which is still in the same directory but is no longer working) are missing. Also there are only 4:3-resolutions up to 1600x1200. That's an issue for new widescreen monitors. And then there are issues with sound. Also the ugly visual deformations of the characters are not nesessary anymore, since the computing power increased by several orders of magnitude. There is just so mutch stuff that could have been improved in this game, but nobody took care of that.\n\n2nd: The game's big pricetag is unjustified. Plainly spoken it's not 2000 anymore and the game does not meet today's standards in order to cost that mutch. However if the 1st reason wasn't there then the 2nd reason probably would not been such a big issue for me.", "recommendationid": "30783088", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1490660169, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "8", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492401647, "num_reviews": 57, "steamid": "76561198022395043", "num_games_owned": 341, "playtime_forever": 74}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565764"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 31, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1484604578, "votes_down": 47, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "bob is not your average baby because he has wings. the controls are obscure. videogames are art. highly recommended for players wanting a little more PANACHE in their gaming diet.", "recommendationid": "29305276", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1484604578, "votes_funny": 10, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484604313, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561197977498013", "num_games_owned": 544, "playtime_forever": 39}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458791"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
