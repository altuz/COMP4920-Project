Its an amazing game in concept that I would love to give the chance to be great...if it could manage to do that. Its a piece of garbage that is thrown together into a contraption that just barely manages to reach its goal (oh wow, I totally just explained the entirety of the gameplay) \n\nIs it a cool idea, yes. Is it a fun game, ...hard to say because its basically unplayable. Several times has this game refused to work...or has done something so ...wrong I can't fix it even with the included time rewind. Imagine Prince of Persia: Sands of Time with its time rewind except instead of being a game mechanic that is cool and awesome its a tool used to make sure that if you break the game you can rewind to when it wasn't broken. Like...you can rewind time...which is ONLY used to fix mistakes either you or the game has made. \n\nThere are some levels I remember playing that I don't know what to do on, the goal is obviously there, but no meaningful solution is there to reach it. Most the time, I just tried to get as many flying items as I could to strap to myself to fly over everything so I wouldn't have to deal with the terrible game. \n\nFinally, I know in full well that I did not beat this game and so I cannot honestly say my review has full credible weight...but I did give it a good try, I wanted this game to be fun and work.. knowing full well it could be bad.

The problem is that once you've designed a two-wheeled bike with an umbrella, spring and rotablades all round, in some sort of trash-pile mess, you realise that there's very little imagination needed. Glue all parts to the engine and it works. Also, poor, generic level design will have you easily forgetting what level you are on; there's green, there's ice and there's fire. Not that any of these are particularly well done either. The designers just assumed you'd come across the levers that open the doors without giving you any indication where they should be or what they open. \n\nThe building is as irritating as the physics are twitchy. The movement off vehicle is slow and you'll often die because he fell in a certain way.\n\nAnd let's not forget the 'hilarious' banter between Sack and the Doc. Which wouldn't be a problem except that the speech bubble also gets in the way sometimes.\n\n\nI also had a problem when the game decided to corrupt all my saves at one point. Not something I've seen in a game for a long time. Might be a one off.\n\nOn the plus side, you can rewind time to correct any mistakes. You'll be using this a lot. Not because you will fail but because it is easier to rewind than rebuild after being hit by a projectile that came from an enemy outside the screen.\n\nIf you want to use your creative mind to solve puzzles (not that there's much puzzling here) try Crayon Physics instead."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1480637632, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504710", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "28129646", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197991118983", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1446333611, "num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 270}, "timestamp_updated": 1480637632, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game was sitting in my library for years.

It's easier than it might sound, the machines I came up with were all small variations of the same vehicle.
