The menu and buttons are messy and don't work half the time. The gameplay is basic as hell. Stats are VERY unrealistic in my opinion (Ruckman ALWAYS have the most disposals in each game). And for the price of almost $20, I just can't see it being worth it.\n\nI'll have another look in the future, but right now, I'm requesting a refund.", "recommendationid": "34872457", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505082459, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505082183, "num_reviews": 33, "steamid": "76561198067492765", "num_games_owned": 270, "playtime_forever": 26}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
