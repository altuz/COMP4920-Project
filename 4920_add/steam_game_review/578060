Figured out the controls pretty quickly (the \"Control Layout\" poster in the app was helpful). \n\nChecked out the menu panel/tablet first, which pops into view near your controller upon button press. I played mostly with the settings, changing the environment and its time of day. Was a nice surprise to realize that the sun is moving.\n\nThe menu is placed below and beyond your controller, which makes sense for being immediately able to interact with it. If you're looking upwards, however, you won't see the panel until you look down a bit. This could be frustrating if I have a map that's all around/above me, and I'm looking upwards a lot. The bottom 4cm (or so) of the panel was not grabbable for me (and also doesn't cause a highlight) -- maybe the hit area is too small? I naturally reached for the bottom of the panel to move it, so this was confusing until I realized I needed to grab higher up.\n\nI didn't have a real \"mind-map\" goal for this round, so I mostly just drew some patterns. Creating new nodes and edges is quick and easy. The linking tool was fun to use, and I liked that I didn't have to release the trigger when drawing many edges (the next edge just starts with the most-recently touched node). \n\nI added several tags at one point, but didn't realize where they were appearing (I had moved the menu a bit). After I looked up, I saw where they were stacked up. I forgot how to delete for a moment -- I kept looking for a delete button on the tag menu, and tried to clear all the text to see if it would go away. Then I remembered that I had seen a delete option on the thumbpad menu, and was able to use that. The delete tool requires some care when using it -- if the \"delete spike\" is touching more than one thing, it will delete both of them.\n\nGrabbing the nodes was a little tricky for me. Like the menu panel (and also the other panels) with its non-grabbable bottom area, the nodes didn't seem to be grabbable in all places. There were times when the controller was near to the node, and made it highlight, yet still wouldn't grab it. Once grabbed, the node would jump into a particular position relative to my controller -- I'd like to see it maintain the relative position upon grab instead (i.e. capture the controller-to-node offset upon grab).\n\nThe menu interfaces were easy to use. It was clear how to navigate the main menu (via tabs), how to use the keyboard, and how to use the drop-down inputs.\n\nI have grown used to a particular type of menu-positioning behavior (with EXA), so I was surprised when my node/tag menus would jump to a new position when I selected a new one. This approach does make sense, ensuring that the menu is never far away from the selected item. However, I found myself wanting to put the keyboard menu in front of me, at a comfortable position, and have it stay in place while I selected each new item.", "recommendationid": "32389140", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1497362245, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497362276, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198226589444", "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 57}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499882"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_positive": 4}}
