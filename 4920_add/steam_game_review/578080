Because there is no Chinese server and playing in any server like NA or AS will give players a lag over 200ms, nearly every single player in China needs to spend considerable extra cash compared to the price of the game monthly to purchase access of a net proxy to get rid of the lag. Usually 4 months membership fee of a decent proxy costs the same money to buy a PUBG. But instead of trying to solve that problem for the region that has the most players in the world, Bluehole just made partnership with the most popular proxy company in China and claimed it to be the official proxy for PUBG. And that is absolutely ludicrous! There is not a second region in this world that needs to pay extra money beside the cost of the game itself to play, not to mention that cost is paid monthly. The developer is not only not trying to make that extra spending go away but also making new partners to rip players off more. As a player I found that very very insulting and Chinese players are treated very unfairly. \nUpon of all that, the game itself still have a significant amount of bugs and lack of optimization. Even for my PC, which has 7800x and 1080Ti as well as 32g ram, I still need to adjust certain settings to low even very low to have a relatively smooth game experience. And that \"smooth\" is still relative. I literally have fps dropping every single game, especially when it is raining or when im in a redzone, which is really annoying and irratating when I am trying to shoot someone or scounting the nearby environment. \nAnyway, that's the reason why I dont recommend this game.

I feel I am a bit more towards not recommending it since the game overall is not that special. It can be fun when playing with friends but the fun comes more from the tension created by interacting with your friends always watching out and being on the move since running around is really all you do for the most part. There is not much variety in the game. \n\nThe game does not look amazing, but can run very poorly. even on a machine that should run the game smoothly, specially for how it looks.  Opening doors feels like its own game, since opening doors, getting into vehicles and picking up items is unresponsive and frustrating. \n\nThe game shines in its combat and sound design though, specially in close quarters environments. Unfortunatelly most combat usually takes place near the end of the game. Turning into a who can flash, rush, hide or run around the closing circle the fastest competition. Unless you decide to drop into one of the large cities players frequent. In which case you will likely be fighting more often but at 20fps.\n\nUntil the game is optimized more, made more responsive and injected with more variety in both graphics and gameplay, I will lean towards not recommending it. \n", "recommendationid": "35095398", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505958495, "votes_funny": 12, "comment_count": "17", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505955293, "num_reviews": 29, "steamid": "76561198092444616", "num_games_owned": 150, "playtime_forever": 1952}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595501"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 155, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1506940400, "votes_down": 30, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Developments since release\n>Kill streamer \nGet banned\n>honk at a streamer\nGet banned\n>you like free cosmetics ?\nNow pay for them\n>performance\nStill sh^t\n>server\nmega sh^t", "recommendationid": "35411435", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506940400, "votes_funny": 18, "comment_count": "5", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505748812, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198015654143", "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_forever": 9576}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624442"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 200, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1506722322, "votes_down": 50, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "In PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BANNINGGROUNDS one player (you) must find a way to make it to the end of a 100 man battle royale located in modern day Detroit without getting banned for killing streamers whether they are streaming or not.
