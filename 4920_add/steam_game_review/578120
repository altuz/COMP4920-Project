Please read full review!***\n\nThis game is fun. You run around swinging your weapon left or right hoping to kill anyone and everyone. Even so there is skill to it. \n\n There are daily quests and log in rewards without being a full on pay-to-win game with the standard gimmicks you see in such pay-to-win games. I have been playing it for free in browser for about 50 hours now and enjoyed every bit of it. You can also download it and play it for free in Facebook, but I like having it in steam so I can use my steam purchases if and when I choose to support this game.\n\nI have even had to contact support once for help and they were on it instantly.\n\nThe voice and audio affects are well done; all the way up to double kills and killing sprees.\n\nThere are many servers for potential growth.\n\n\n****************************\n\nUPDATE: The game is going down, temporarily. Here is the text from their website\n\n\"\nFriends, good news!\n\nWe began to cooperate with Pride Games Studio - we had an opportunity to carry out a large-scale revision of the project.\n\nWhat does it mean?\nIn the coming days, the distribution of versions in social networks and other sites where the game is hosted will be suspended. Similarly, the possibility of buying a game on Steam and on mobile platforms will be closed.\nWithin a few months the game will be actively updated, and soon will launch Beta a new version of Slash Arena.\n\nAnd you can still play?\nEveryone who installed the game on android and bought in the Steam, will be able to continue to play. At least a month the main servers will work.\nFull support for users for this period of time is not expected, but the most critical problems we will try to solve.\n\nWhat will happen with progress?\nBalance, the economy will be changed, so when the new version is released, the progress will be reset.\nDon't worry!\nAll old players will receive compensation in the form of a unique starting pack\"\n\n\nThey're going to reset all of our progress. At the moment it is true that it is unfairly balanced in some minor ways. Given how much you have to play to get high end equipment without paying (good thing equipment isn't as useful as good skill,) this is a bit of a bummer. I won't be putting more time into the game until the beta is out.\n\nIt is good they're balancing it more and I look forward to playing the Beta.", "recommendationid": "33999022", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1507143812, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505705849, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198094643916", "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_forever": 3170}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504595"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502746819, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a really interesting game. It is fast paced and very simple to get used to.\nThe controls exist of no more than WASD and arrow keys. \nYou simply spin around slashing your enemies. \n\nThe concept is really interesting and for the price it is a bargain even in early access.\nThere however isn't much content in game yet. It is ofcourse still in early access and does bring it's flaws with it. There are basically 2 maps and 2 game modes. There is a simple equipment upgrading system and that's it. But the games are really fun and can be difficult. \n\nGameplay wise as said, you spin around with your weapon to kill enemies. You eat food to grow big and you grab (or steal) loot to make yourself stronger with upgrades. The community isn't big compared to other arena type of games but it is a growing community. Especially at this stage it is very promising.\n\nI have a high end system so I can't really talk about how it would run on a potato, but since the models are very simplistic I do think that low end systems can run this fine. \n\nI think some visual footage is always the best to show how this game is, this is a tdm match.\nThis is a really interesting game. It is fast paced and very simple to get used to.\nThe controls exist of no more than WASD and arrow keys. \nYou simply spin around slashing your enemies. \n\nAlso do keep in mind that many \"players\" are bots, making them eventually predictive. I feel that the devs chose to do so in order to fill up the servers, which at this stage, is a really good move. I hope the community will grow big enough so that there won't be a need for the bots. Most players won't notice the bots, so don't worry about it, but it is worth mentioning.\n\nI think some visual footage is always the best to show how this game is, this is a tdm match. \nhttps://youtu.be/5S9FXioMy-A?t=2m55s\n\nOverall my ratings for this game (I will re-rate once it enters a new stage or gets released):\n[b]Music: 6/10[/b] - more songs would be appreciated\n[b]Audio: 9/10[/b] - effects are good and fun, love the surround\n[b]Visuals: 8/10[/b] - very simple and clean, art-style suits the concept pretty well\n[b]Gameplay: 7/10[/b] - while it is fun it is still not too challenging\n[b]Content: 6/10[/b] - for it's price it is sufficient, but overall maybe more maps/game modes would do the trick\n[b]User friendlyness: 9/10[/b] - game is really easy to get used to, due to simple mechanics", "recommendationid": "34244024", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502989950, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503081952, "num_reviews": 44, "steamid": "76561198020952971", "num_games_owned": 485, "playtime_forever": 359}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511588"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502544483, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Already played the mobile version long ago....there really was a lot of progress since then.\nThe combat is very simple,you can spin into 2 directions(left and right click)and move around with the wasd keys.\nBut there are many techniques you can come up with,like taking a defensive stance,feinting,dragging a opponent around,blocking and then following up with a counterattack...it all depends on your timing and how close you are to your opponent.\nThe fighting system is very easy to learn,but since you have total control over your spinning,there is room for different and more complex fighting styles than just the usual,,spin to win''.\n\n+Simple combat system that is easy to get into,while still being flexible enough to learn more advanced techniques.\n+Instant action.There is no long preperation time,you can get into a fight very fast.\n+Different weapons/characters that dont just look different,they are also offering different advantages and dissadvantages.\n+The game can also be played in your browser or on your phone.\n+Its free(if you play the mobile/browser version.If you dont,its at least very cheap.\n\n\n-Repetive music.\n-Only 2 maps(1 for each mode).\n-A bit pay to win,since you can buy gold with real money and use it to get the best gear very fast.\n-The global ranking rewards players for being active(getting a lot of points),not for having a good KD ratio or points that you gain when killing someone,and LOSING when you get killed by someone.\nThat means you have to play A LOT to make your way to the top,no matter how good you are.\n-No ingame chat.\n-No clans/playing with friends.\n\n\nAs i see it,the game is a good choice if you want some instant action every now and then.\nThere are so many hero/champion based mobas or shooters,but there are not many good melee only multiplayer games.\nI listed a lot of negative things for a game that i recommend,thats because most of them will surely get improved soon,like no ingame chat,the lack of maps or the lack of music diversity.\nThe game is really entertaining,if you play it casually,you can have some fun with it,and in the future,it may be a even better experience,after some updates.\nIf youre unsure,you can try out the game for free first.", "recommendationid": "34191277", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502544526, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502942419, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561197999138003", "num_games_owned": 201, "playtime_forever": 338}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1501851823, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I discovered this game on NewGrounds & have been a fan ever since.
