Bothering to describe what you'll find here in detail is roughly akin to forcing an elderly Jew to explicitly recount his Holocaust days with a wistful gleam in his eyes. We know The Horror already, no need to rub our fucking noses in it.\n\n   The best thing you can say about this game, in comparison to other GG product? At least it's all over with in under five minutes. Most of these games take at least ten.\n\nVerdict: 1/10.\n\n(PS If you're wondering why I bothered to play this when I already knew what to expect, the answer is that I'm a professional who plays games this bad so you don't have to. There's no need to try things like this at home, kids...leave the dirty work up to shit-heads like yours truly instead.)", "recommendationid": "33630481", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1500570569, "votes_funny": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500293403, "num_reviews": 429, "steamid": "76561198048974498", "num_games_owned": 1513, "playtime_forever": 30}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516222"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 9, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1501644438, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "RED ALERT 100% cash-grab scam\n\n1.
