It feels satisfying to play, and and I can't wait for the full-on release with a story mode. My only complaint, which is something that doesnt even matter, is that the teleportation option looks wierd - as well as the beam to grab items: which don't ruin the experience at all other than losing a little immersion. (also those reading this, yes there are locomotion controls; not just teleport.) But if you like DOOM and like wave shooters, then this is the game for you.", "recommendationid": "35229139", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506455666, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 106, "last_played": 1506912006, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198307425429", "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_forever": 106}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500454"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 9, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_positive": 7}}
