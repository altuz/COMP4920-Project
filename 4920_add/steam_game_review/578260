Your pet will continuously get in your way, you'll bounce off him just as you're making a jump and get killed, or he'll wander off and not be there to complete the level. Having to control the pet in addition to your main character, adds a significant level of difficulty. But the game is fun!  The graphics are well done.  But expect to die a lot, and keep repeating levels until you get it right.\n\nMake up your own mind with this gameplay: [url]https://youtu.be/3_rWvcHzbvs[/url]", "recommendationid": "29181814", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1484138137, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484136848, "num_reviews": 190, "steamid": "76561198137240226", "num_games_owned": 114, "playtime_forever": 19}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472362"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1484156900, "votes_down": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is Amazing, but it's CRAZY Rage Inducing!
