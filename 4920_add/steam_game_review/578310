If you remember the days of 'Pawn', you'll recognise a very similar game here. Featured within the game is a decent arsenal of weapons, from the AS VAL and AK12 to the M1911 and SPAS-12, as well as various options for equipment including C4 and a Barricade Tool/Builder, and a choice of perks, from running faster to carrying a little more ammo.\n\nToday being the game's debut, it somewhat lacks in variety of maps and gamemodes, although this is understandable. You have your standard Deathmatch (Free For All), Team Deathmatch, and a mode similar to CoD's Domination, or Battlefield's Conquest where you must hold three points and beat the other team for points. The maps are interesting, with some breakable windows and plenty of ladders, but nothing too extravagant. What stands out however is that the game is a lot harder than it looks on the surface. You won't be able to see any enemies until they are in your line of sight, or if you have just recently seen them. So be careful descending that ladder, or you could suddenly bump into a couple of angry foes. As well as this, guns are very lethal, and you'll only be able to survive a couple of hits at most. This keeps things interesting and challenging, as you could be returning fire on the shooter across the screen, to run for cover, then you'll be ambushed by another enemy and killed very quickly. It's a game which punishes you for not thinking before you act.\n\nThe weapons are nicely varied and you have a selection of firearms to choose from, but from the start you'll have unlocked the Makarov Pistol, TOZ-34 Shotgun, AKS-74U Carbine, and the MP5 SMG. They allow for a bit of experimentation at the start which is great, since you don't want to be stuck at the start of a multiplayer experience with maybe two useless weapons. All the weapons I've used so far have played very well and realistically, with the sole exception of the TOZ-34. This shotgun is not treated like any of the other shotguns which fire pellets. This one fires slugs, and so it fires one accurate projectile at a time. It's horrendously accurate at that, so it's an early game AWP essentially. I cannot say if this is due to unbalance or keeping in the hardcore nature of the game. Otherwise the gunplay is good and really what makes the game.\n\nYou also have your equipment selection which lets you bring in gear like a Flashbang, or two Grenades, or maybe even an Ammo Box or Medkit. You also have a kind of building tool, which lets you place sandbags. They are affected by gravity and won't stand still in midair, but they can be stuck to walls to be used as a ladder. You can also create an improvised bunker from them. It's an interesting feature I've seen in a few games, but it has high potential for exploitation. You also have a slot for perks, which are rather run-of-the-mill in any shooter - run faster, shoot better, more ammo, tougher, etc. Nothing unusual but it allows for a bit more options in combat.\n\nThe weapons themselves can be upgraded with several attachments, but they are preset and unique for that weapon, so there's not a huge range for customisation. Along with this you can upgrade the base stats of the weapon, so you can shoot more accurately, reload faster, and such. You can unlock more for your weapon by using it more, and some weapons can only be unlocked by using others, ie. 120 M4A1 kills gets you the SCAR. It's a good way of encouraging the player to try other weapons out instead of sticking to the same one forever. Weapon skins are also available, but must be unlocked through a crate drop.\n\nNow this is the part that might turn some people off - but the game will drop a few crates at the end of the match. They can be opened for free and can contain things like bonus XP and Scrap for repairing and upgrading weapons you use a lot, but you can also get Golden Crates for real money. THANKFULLY, they only tend to drop stuff in the Standard crate, with a high chance for better items such as player and weapon skins. It's not a game breaker by any means, but if you enjoy the game enough and want to try and get a fancy new character skin (STALKER's Cheeki Breeki tracksuit Bandit and Jacket from Hotline Miami are two of the several skins), then I would suggest it's worth the $0.99 (\u00a30.79).\n\nLastly you have a trophy system where you can pick up enemy weapons and it will add them to your trophy collection - this is cool since it's also very similar to the Battlefield Tag collecting idea, and you can scrap trophies you don't want to keep in your collection for more scrap, useful for weapon upgrades and repairs. Trophies will also include the name of the player they belong to so it works as a bragging rights table if you have a lot of trophies.\n\nOther than this I think I have covered most of what I have experienced in my first day of playing this game. I would recommend it to people who enjoy side-scrolling shooters and are looking for a challenging F2P multiplayer game. Currently free of P2W and hopefully it stays like that, as it is definitely a fun game to kill some time.", "recommendationid": "30154833", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487985249, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": "8", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494353240, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198055879714", "num_games_owned": 421, "playtime_forever": 734}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527674"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 17, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1488107260, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It is suprisingly fun and balanced, no p2w, you can buy boxes with loot but you can also get them for free.\nIt still needs some work but i highly recommend trying it out since it is free and alot of fun.", "recommendationid": "30192840", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488107260, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1506258841, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198216372860", "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_forever": 4374}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516610"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 12, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1488266036, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Looks like the devs played too much Soldat and Counter Strike. 10/10", "recommendationid": "30235520", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488266036, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489737328, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561197984770447", "num_games_owned": 71, "playtime_forever": 664}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513441"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 19, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1488193419, "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "8/10\nMy toaster is able to run this .", "recommendationid": "30217306", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488193419, "votes_funny": 10, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497116208, "num_reviews": 16, "steamid": "76561198067326475", "num_games_owned": 258, "playtime_forever": 95}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512721"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 16, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1488080251, "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great game after 4 hours of play im not tired of playing !!!
