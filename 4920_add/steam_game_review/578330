To accomplish this you have to solve simple puzzles, collect LEGO\u00ae pieces, rebuild the city with them and advance the story to unlock different powers. The gameplay consists of the standard LEGO\u00ae games formula, except there is not as much action as in LEGO\u00ae Batman (fighting bad guys with your fists), which is the other LEGO\u00ae game I own.\n\nIs it a fun relaxing game? Yes! Will the kids humor make you cringe as an adult player? Absolutely! Can you look past this? Yes - most of the time, when it's not super in your face. Besides, I enjoyed some of the jokes.\n\nUnfortunately it is borderline unplayable due to many game breaking bugs and random crashes. Some reviewers stated that this game is supposed to be fixed. If this is the case, I am glad I didn't see an earlier state of it. All in all I can't recommend it due to it's technical state and pricing of 29,99 \u20ac or your regional equivalent.\n\nI have mentioned earlier that I own LEGO\u00ae Batman aswell. I played it on the XBOX 360 and there were a lot of technical issues, especially with the sound. After my recent experiences with LEGO\u00ae CITY Undercover, I won't buy a LEGO\u00ae game again.
