This game is AWESOME! This is the kind of VR game I've been dying for. The developers absolutely nailed the aesthetic, the cyberspace you explore in this game is so cool, looming and has this sense of foreboding thanks to both its visuals and its awesome soundtrack. Lastly, one of the coolest things about this game is the scale. Most of the enemies you fight are HUGE in comparison to you and their attacks are super flashy. One of the first VR games I've played to truly capture the essence of a boss fight.\n\nHonestly, I'm in love with this game. My only gripes are that the trackpad locomotion is a tiny bit finnicky, slight adjustments of the thumb seem to move you way more than they should, and the gun not being bound to your arm but rather floating in front of you is a little weird. But it works well for how they designed it.", "recommendationid": "34771518", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504685966, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504685642, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198024800960", "num_games_owned": 389, "playtime_forever": 16}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502216"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504838862, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1504857055, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Unfortunately I couldn't get this game to work.\n---\nUPDATE: I took another look at this game after the Developer response, and I went through the startup instructions more carefully.
