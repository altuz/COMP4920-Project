I am clearly in the minority in my rating so bear in mind, this is just my personal opinion. If you're interested, buy it, test it for 1.9 hours and make up your mind. But I found the following with this game - \n\nThe positive:\nThe movement in this game is original and causes no motion sickness at all. I mean really, it's slick.\n\nA nice mix of weapons and challenges, some of which revolve around picking up dead foes weapons. So you actually have to think.\n\nDamn good exercie. I was all sweaty and [strike]worn[/strike] GORN out. It was a good workout.\n\nSome of the animations were funny the 1st few times.\n\nYou can actually give the finger lol.\n\nThe negative:\nI know this is EA so it's difficult to complain but, really, after just under 2 hours I realized all this is, is repeatedly trying to melee the exact same, cartoony looking, 1-3 wobbly guys with bendy legs and weapons over, and over, and over. For all of that positive, I just got... bored. Hopelessly bored. \n\nAfter just 2 hours I had almost every weapon, and was working my way though the challenges (more or less). It's a fun game, really fun, at first. Most of the reviews (though not all) have less than 5-7 hours played, that's about how long this game is fun for in my opinion. \n\nIt can be very frustrating, watch Jacksepticeye and how annoyed he gets at not being able to effectively parry certain hits because the weapons actually wobble. \n\nAll in all, it is a fun game at first.
