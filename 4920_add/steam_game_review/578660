That's exsactly what I got, it's happy, a little spooky but in a inviting way. The atmosphere makes it clear the game is glad to have you here. It's like going on a imaginary adventure when your a kid, everything is so happy and at your own pace. \n\nMy recommendation is to not try to \"beat\" this game, instead take your time and enjoy it. There is no rush, and if you  try to rush through the game you'll be left with a source taste in your mouth because the game is so short. But if you instead really take everything in you'll get a nice walk through a friendly cavern. \n", "recommendationid": "33366460", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499500079, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500851953, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198051421978", "num_games_owned": 182, "playtime_forever": 182}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_positive": 4}}
