This one is definitely a rare and well polished gem.\n\nI have [strike]wasted[/strike] spent countless hours playing this game and it is definitely worth checking out. It has some interesting concepts that rarely appear in other games, like playing across multiple maps, managing supply lines, special hero-like admirals, that make fleet management much easier. \n\nThe campaign storyline is somewhat linear, but very enjoyable and a great way to get into the game's lore, which I find is one of the most fun aspects of the game.\n\nFor a game that is over 15 years old it has certainly aged well and, while perhaps not quite up to today's standards with regards to graphical fidelity it definitely had imensely well polished graphics for when it was released (2001).\n\nAll that's left to say is that I can definitely recommend this.
