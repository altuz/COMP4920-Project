The concept I love, along with te artwork but the aiming system along with the way the respawning works. The way you have to navigate the menu is annoying. Having to press the W to enter a room and S to exit a room doesn't really make sense it should be one button. I know the game is new and I doubt you are putting a lot of your time to updating or changing anything but if you do please change things, make it more smooth.", "recommendationid": "31247894", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492652383, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492651963, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198338259542", "num_games_owned": 39, "playtime_forever": 11}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503253"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
