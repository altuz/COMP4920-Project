Perhaps one day in a year or so this game might be really fun to play. As it is...It's lacking in a few things. So if you like the idea and want to support them I would consider getting the game while it's on sale.\n\nFor the developers:\nThere are serveral things that could be done to improve Phantom:\n\n1. Fix the english so everything can be read in english. And you can skip on the swearing it doesn't make it funny or realistic, whichever one you were going for. \n\n2. When you start out the game in the desert you start deep in a pit filled with junk, I would suggest that you either \n        (1) make it so no robots spawn until you get out or \n        (2) make it so the robots won't attack buildings. \nLet me explain further. The robots only come at night, but they will stay forever unless you destroy them and they are extremely hard to destroy even with a constant stream of power. That being said not only will they attack you, but they will attack and destroy anything that you have built, making it nearly impossible to play the game. \n\n3. Make day and night more obvious. Make the switch between them almost instantly and make it really dark at night and really bright during day. Either that or add a in game clock. Consider making the day longer then the night. \n\n4. Consider making it possible to upgrade your robot rather then just the cosmetics. Like make it possible to extend your robots battery life by making it possible to build a battery backpack. \n\n5. The robot damages itself too quickly from even the smallest of things like bumping into something or falling from a small height,\n\n6. Consider making the robots weapon untility tool run of a different source of power, thereby making it possible to use it without consuming your robots personal energy. In my opinion your robots personal power should be only used by walking and running. \n\n7. Consider adding in quests as a way to help players get started and to make the game more fun. When inside the pit help the player by adding quests that take the player to the items within the pit that are neccessary to start building (Battery, Solar Panel, etc). \n\n8. Lastly, the pixalation effect that occurs as you get towards the end of your power makes sense, however it starts at about half way. In reality like what I said above you should have way more power normally and the pixalation effect shouldn't start until you reach the last quarter of your power.", "recommendationid": "34813130", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504872550, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504870847, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198198560725", "num_games_owned": 98, "playtime_forever": 133}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494502"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 7, "total_reviews": 14, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 7}}
