The music is good, the concept is simple and it seems fun, but the controls aren't responsive enough.  Keyboard is fine for levels that are up/down/left/right, but diagonals feel wonky and unnatural.  On a controller, using the stick for directional input feels the best to me, but too many times did I die from something not responding in time versus actually screwing up.  I've tried with an Xbox One controller and a Steam Controller and both feel the same :-/\n\nI'll probably give this game another shot every once in a while, but I feel like it's not worth a standalone buy.", "recommendationid": "35194332", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506303867, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "last_played": 1506307113, "num_reviews": 90, "steamid": "76561197992801270", "num_games_owned": 1800, "playtime_forever": 65}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 9, "total_reviews": 91, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 82}}
