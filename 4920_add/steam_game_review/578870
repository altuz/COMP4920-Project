This is by no means a perfect game, but anyone who enjoys a RTS game that will bring them hours of entertainment will love this (seriously, this is an excellent example of a properly made RTS game). There are plenty of factions to play as, each with its own learning curve, as well as several maps and tilesets. Though the base game is rather extensive and fun, the overall quality of the game can be improved by mods, which are easy to access and meld seemlessly with the stock game (most of the time). This is, however, a strategy game, and strategy is the most important aspect. All I will say is that without a decent strategy, you will be thoroughly dessimated on the more difficult AI levels and online (which is a good thing). All in all, Megaglest is an absolutely amazing RTS game that deserves more recognition than it has.", "recommendationid": "33660455", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505582353, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "last_played": 1506794105, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198097541789", "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 255}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499790"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_positive": 4}}
