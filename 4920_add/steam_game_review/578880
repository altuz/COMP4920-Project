I verified it was limited to just MIST VR before calling it quits.\n\nFor an interactive horror puzzler there are glaring flaws, here are a few:\n1) Limited/no sound other than ambient. No collision on objects etc (audio wise).\n2) If you touch an object to another object you drop it.\n3) Incredibly unfriendly interaction, to the point where I couldn't progress.\n4) Puzzle elements very basic and uninspired.\n5) Overpriced for the quality, I am fairly lenient on startups and even so this price point is inexcusable even if there are potentially some enjoyable moments to be found.\n\nCheck out my video for the full list. I do not advise buying this game.\n\nWill be putting in for a refund, I can tolerate a bad game - but I can't pay for a game that doesn't work as intended.", "recommendationid": "29253819", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1484420528, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484413899, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561197972283208", "num_games_owned": 403, "playtime_forever": 28}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514747"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 19, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1484429996, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible controls.

Kinda intriguing but not in a tooooo brainy way. I do like them. Need to play all those to get to the end which is ... well I'd better shush and  not spare any surprise( trust me, u will have a big one @_@  ) anyways it z like a B-movie, which is not perfect but haunts you in a good way.u can't just stop thinking about it!!!
