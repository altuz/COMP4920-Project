I really enjoyed that game and about 5 years ago wanted to play it again but could not reminisce the name of the game. Recently I found Constructor in my reccomendation list and bought it straight away for around 17 USD, and another 8 USD for Mob rule and Old fashioned Constructor.\nI did not enjoy new Constructor, since it was not really optimized and had no campaign. But I read the game thread and found out that devs are aware of the problems and are working on it. I just decided that I will wait for some time and enjoy ot later. Unfrotuanately, it was a big challenge for me to play old school game since control movement was way too bad. But what I was ready for this, since the game is 20 years old!\nToday there is an update for new Constructor, nothing global, still no campaign, few bug fixes and a new DLC for 3 USD!! I have already paid 25, and they want another 3 for few bew houses? have never claimed for a refund, but i am really considering it. \nI found Constructor buggy, boring and I think it is a rip off, there are many much more user friendly and bug-free games for such money. \nI have a feeling that Devs are trying to make money on our nostalgy. I hope they will prove me wrong, really soon.", "recommendationid": "33836488", "language": "english", "developer_response": "Hi, ArsenalTillIDie. Hope you're well!\n\nI just want to clarify that the latest DLC you are seeing is currently being given away [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/579020/discussions/0/1291817208491762456/]here[/url]. So, if you need a key for it please visit that thread and grab one. :) If you have issues with it please send me a request on Steam and I will get one for you.\n\nWe will be adding the missions to the game but unfortunately multiplayer took up more time than was anticipated so that wasn't possible for this patch. For that we apologise, and if you would pursue a refund for the game then that's completely understandable as we know waiting can be frustrating! :)\n\nIf you haven't already please give the newest update a go and let me know if you have any issues with it. :)\n\nEDIT 1 : \n\nGlad to hear you are well. :) \n\nWe're looking forward to delivering the missions too - it was our plan originally to deliver them sooner but multiplayer turned out to be a bit of a problem! While we're not 100% sure multiplayer has been completely fixed (nothing is quite so perfect =( ) we hope that work on it can start to wind down. \n\nThe DLC was added to the store for future purchases when the giveaway has ended - I still have a lot of codes to give to our wonderful fans! \n\nSome key changes from the original that were introduced in this patch and the previous one:\n\n[list]\n[*] AI can attack each other - you will find this in options -> gameplay -> Attack AI teams set to \"yes\".\n\n[*] AI build speed can be changed if you find that the AI is a little too slow for your liking. This will also make them place buildings faster the higher you set it! You can change this setting in options -> gameplay -> Build Speed. You can set the speed as low as 50% or increase it all the way to 400%. \n\n[*] New and old building method - You probably know about the new building method but we've also added the old one back in which you can find in options -> controls -> site placement set to \"old\". This is if you prefer the old method. \n\n[*] Gadgets, fences and garden decorations now affect a tenant's mood. You might find that your Slobs love their new dog kennel, or that the Students can't stop admiring their lovely Green House! You might also find that your Nerds just can't get enough of their new picket fence or that corral you gave to the Punks is \"totally cool\". There are different things which you will discover as you play. I am looking to release a supplement in the next few weeks which will act as a cheat-sheet for people who haven't quite figured it out yet!\n\n[*] Houses affect breeding speed as well as rent. You might find that your Greasers are paying a little more rent to live in that flashy Soweto Hut rather than the run-down Log Cabin. Whilst this was partly true in the original because of the rent being based on free-hold value, we've made the system a little more dynamic. :) Slobs may also breed a little faster in the Log Cabin or Caravan so have fun experimenting with different combinations! Each house is unique in its own right. :) The supplement will also cover this area of the game too so don't worry if you're unsure - we've got you covered!\n\nThere's probably something I've missed but hopefully this has given you some peace of mind that we are indeed still listening to our fantastic fans. :)\n\n- BrightPaw\n", "timestamp_updated": 1501173587, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500230776, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198032360327", "num_games_owned": 64, "playtime_forever": 71}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463488"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1500230884, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is just an HD remake of the original Constructor game.  They've made a few enhancements that the original game was always lacking like your maintenance guy actually repairing undesirable buildings automatically and the map always being visible.  The game sometimes randomly crashes, so there's still a few bugs they have to fix - although this has only happened to me after playing a loaded saved game for about 10-20 minutes.  I haven't had a chance to try multiplayer yet. System 3 says they will continue to patch the game to fix all the errors and add additional maps to play and such. This was my first and favorite RTS game I ever played and this is a wonderful refresh of that original game.

However this version is seriously flawed. You cant play for long (about an hour) before you fail on a task and at the first failure the game ends. I think that you are supposed to aquire black marks but the system does not seem to be working. Very frustrating.\nThe game crashed once while sending a thief to steel a gun, apart from that it ran well on my Windows 10, GTX680, i7 system. \nLooking at System 3 (developers) web site, the status of the game is unclear.

Hope you're well. :)\n\nI'm not sure which task you failed but it sounds like it may have been the cockroach one. This mission requires that you upgrade all of the bathrooms on the estate to the next level as well as killing ten cockroaches. You can kill the cockroaches using your workers but a gangster with a shotgun generally works better! :)  It's true that if you fail this task you will lose the game, though generally the missions will state that \"you will be sacked\". \n\nYou can avoid this task altogether by simply upgrading the bathrooms of any new houses you construct. Additionally, you will generally receive black marks for failing to fulfil tenant complaints and overproducing workers or tenants. Council missions are generally more serious so you will either lose the game or have some of your buildings taken away among other potential punishments.\n\nAs you play the game more you'll get used to how everything works - if you require additional assistance you should definitely let us know on the forum. :)\n\nHope you have a wonderful day!", "timestamp_updated": 1500978861, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501780496, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198012120869", "num_games_owned": 148, "playtime_forever": 2829}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505633"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1499611842, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "couldn't finish one game yet because the game crashes frequently! i loved the original but this remake is at the moment not was the game deserves! the updated ui is nice. other buyers should wait until patch 5+ fix all the f***ing bugs... is frustrating :/", "recommendationid": "33406083", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499611842, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501434860, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198001324214", "num_games_owned": 3, "playtime_forever": 307}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503803"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1503765200, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I never played the original so i'm reviewing this game as it is now, not how it used to be or is supposed to be or whatever.
