I feel the sounds could be worked on and the jerking of the boat looking aft makes me feel I am not infact there in real life but infact in a game. Never sailed a racing vessel this size but from my understanding it's what I expected to feel like when I grabbed the tiller. Main sheet and sail trim would be nice and I agree with Donald in his assessment in wanting shroud tell-tales and or wind instruments possibly under the glass sprayhood. If it kept me interested longer there may have been more issues or interesting cool things. Still thumbs up it's free.\n\nPros: \n1. It's free, someone has took the time to make a game and not put a price tag on it so no one can complain.\n2. It will give you an idea of what It looks like and feels like at the tiller while doing from what I can tell about 15-20 knots.\n3. graphics not the best but not the worst.\n\nCons:\n1. Didn't feel like I was there due to the jerking of the stern and over all boat not been smooth.\n2. The ability to only control the tiller makes it for anyone wanting to learn sailing highly limited.\n3. Sounds I feel they didn't sell me and the spray didn't get anywhere close to realistic for the speed of the vessel and wave hight\n", "recommendationid": "29562382", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485690617, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486482365, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198083197497", "num_games_owned": 169, "playtime_forever": 18}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485910264, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "When your life goes tough. \ngrap a beer \njust watch the sea\n\nOn a boat\n\nFeels, how old I am. damn :(\n\nhttp://www.vrn.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=4826\n", "recommendationid": "29617594", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485910264, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1506651119, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198100924539", "num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_forever": 13}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485344277, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very cool!
