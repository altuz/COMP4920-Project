And it dosent help that Nasa try to contact you and ask you to do things while Russia say something els... it is up to you to deside what you want to do sometimes ;-)\n\nBut all in all what you do in the game is sit in your capsul and open/close your oxygen, flip some switchen, and reset fuses.\nAnd at some point you have to aim your capsul in the right direction and click some other buttons.\nOn easy level some of the keys light up when you have to press them.\nMost of the time the story and buttons lighten up and are easy to find, while other times you can get a bit confused.\n\nThe game is funny ( the audio / story ) .. the game feel like you get a new command every 30 seconds... Check oxygen, overpresure release gas, change to backup power ect ect ect.  do this and do that all the way from start to finish.\n\nAs you progress in the story it will unlock so you in the main menu can quick start  and example try again where you died.\nI would not say the game have that much replay value, but you might be interested in trying to complete the story in one go without dying.\n\nFor the 5 euro it cost It is a nice short experience. For 5 euro you should try it though you maybe only play it a few times.\n\n- Bad things..\nwell I think the graphics are not that good and grumsy, would be nice to be able to adjust it and get a better picture( increase super sampling )\n- I think the part about the landing gear is a bit comfusing, dont really know where the disable landing gear button is even though i managed to land on earth ;-)\n\nTIP..: The best way to control your oxygen and presure, is to turn the handle near your left knee, and look left and avoid overpresure... now stop, and look right and see if you can reduce the c02 level and fill more in your tank.. Just keep looking left and right and you refil without much problems.\nAnd note that you do not have to run all systems on your primary battery, but example can make one of them run on the backup so you avoid over voltage. :-)\n\nPs.. Played with Oculus rift + touch controlers. working.. you can grab things, and click buttons with one finger.", "recommendationid": "34620513", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504133743, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504127857, "num_reviews": 85, "steamid": "76561197971692751", "num_games_owned": 322, "playtime_forever": 9}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 34, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 30}}
