It's boring. I can\u2019t really some it up in any other way.\n\nThe first 5 minutes of the game are laughably bad with an opening scene that runs like a PowerPoint presentation along with terrible grammar on top of a black background. It's also painfully obvious early on that the game is a mobile port because little has been done to make the PC's controls actually quick to get the hang of. The feature to swipe across the screen wasn't even taken out from the PC version either. It also opens up with a quest where you have to stand on top of a barrel...and yes I'm not joking, you literally stand on a barrel and your first quest is completed.\n\nCombat is also flawed, the enemies, once they swing, they're almost defined a hit, even if you're 50 feet away from them, which also means there's no strategy to the game, you just go up to them, mash the attack button and run circles around them till your healing power recharges.\n\nThe quests are also some of the most copy and pasted quests you can get in RPGs and are mostly just kill this, stand on a barrel, get this and that's as far as it goes. There's little to no story to play out to you because the game doesn't go into much about its own story as if it doesn't even care to tell you much which makes the story seem pointless and seems lazily tacked on which is something that's important in RPGs.\n\nOverall the game is boring and seems incredibly tacked on and the developer's behaviour just makes things worse.\n\n[h1]Update 02/02/2017[/h1]\n\nSince I've now gotten editing privileges back, I wanted to inform you all the developer flagged the review for being abusive temporarily and has of this date been unflagged after it had been reviewed by a Steam moderator:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MellowOnline1/status/826946801337036800\n\nMy Steam curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews", "recommendationid": "29638126", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505649097, "votes_funny": 8, "comment_count": "21", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491068537, "num_reviews": 47, "steamid": "76561198018006511", "num_games_owned": 1011, "playtime_forever": 158}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765174"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 80, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1486020363, "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "https://youtu.be/RTrD9uVp0bs\n\nThe Sorceress is an MMO style-based single-player experience without any of the concepts that make an MMO worthwhile. Bland and overly generic gameplay that is marred extensively with broken english showing that the Developers couldn't even be bothered to hire an English translation service outside of Google. The game is so boring I couldn't even be bothered to suffer past the first 1/2 hour of gameplay.\n\nNothing about this game is good. The controls are exceptionally counter-intuitive. The \"I\" button to engage dialogue, are you kidding me!?!?! \n\nNote to Dev: Standard practices for most video games denote a certain intuitive control scheme for most games. These are typically dictated by minimal movement of the entire hand to be able to control your game. That makes your control scheme objectively bad. But, to be fair it's indicative of the entire experience. \n\nThis game is a chore. Not a game. The $7 price tag makes me want to punch my screen. It is an insult to any gamer to actually expect money for this crap.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nGame 3/10\nDeveloper integrity and honesty -1/10", "recommendationid": "29643710", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486020363, "votes_funny": 3, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485990910, "num_reviews": 174, "steamid": "76561198030863487", "num_games_owned": 427, "playtime_forever": 44}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569297"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 58, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1486174049, "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not too long ago I talked about The Sorceress, a game so good that it fraudulently touted itself as winning numerous awards and promptly banned anyone who dared to say otherwise. But how bad can a game be that, in a theoretical alternate universe, managed to take home best graphics, best atmosphere, best action, the Indie World Award, and the Dev Gamm award that hadn't even happened yet?\n\nPretty bad.\n\nThe sorceress tells the story of a world torn asunder by bad creatures, and you the sorceress are the only one that can stop them. The game tells you this through broken English narration and recorded video of the main character hitting things with her sword while numbers pop out. You'd be forgiven if you mistook this for a bad fan-made machinima project, all it's missing is the five frames per second video and the 'unregistered bandicam' logo splashed at the top.\n\nYou often hear game critics talk about developers not bothering to put any effort into their quests, but I think Karabas Studio should be claiming a patent on the concept. The second quest you receive in the game is from an innkeeper and literally just says \"I need to kill 2 Skeletons. Can you kill the skeletons for me, please?\" So you kill the 2 skeletons, come back, and receive a healing potion. Your next quest? \"I need to kill 10 skeletons. Can you kill the skeletons for me, please?\" It has nothing to do with the broken English, that I could at least have some sympathy for.\n\nAfter you kill the skeleton king, the game gains more of a semblance of plot, but not really. There are monsters in a nearby dungeon and they want to destroy the town. If you want to stop them from doing that, you're going to have to kill them. That's pretty much it.\n\nThe controls and mechanics in the game are an utter mess, almost as if it was developed by someone who didn't have the faintest clue on how to create a video game, from the action hotbar that doesn't work much of the time to the health/mana potions that are button operated and have no cooldown between use. Your first interaction will likely be wondering why the hell none of the NPCs are interactive until you figure out that the developer has mapped that button to I. Yes, I, the universally accepted interact button.\n\nThe dungeon that makes up the breadth of the game is a one way series of corridors randomly dotted with a small assortment of lazily cobbled together generic fantasy mobs. Enemies in the game respawn so quickly, including bosses, that by the time you've cleared out a room the one behind you has repopulated. That's assuming of course that they don't just immediately respawn where the previous one dropped. That's also assuming that you can manage to stay locked on to an enemy, since the tab targeting barely functions and using the mouse to target is like trying to walk a cat on a leash.\n\nThere are a ton of little things here and there that should be second grade knowledge when building a game, but somehow still managed to be missed. Inventory management is, well, nonexistent. You can't move items to different slots, you can't drop stacks, and the button disappears whenever you do something. In order to drop the stack of 20 'sculls' (their spelling, not mine) that you've collected, you need to click the skull, click drop, rinse, and repeat. And be sure to drop them in a place you'll never go back to, the items stay on the floor forever, even after shutting the game off, and you pick them up automatically by walking near them.\n\nBy the end of the game, your inventory is a cluttered mess of teleport gems and keys that are forever placed at the earliest spot you had an open inventory space. The teleport gems, presumably a workaround to the game's awful spawning system, teleports you deeper into the dungeon since you respawn at the front when you die. There is a five minute cooldown, however there wasn't a visible countdown that I saw. You just have to keep using the item until it works.\n\nCharacters and enemies in the game are a mixed bag of store bought assets, including your player character who appears to be a random stock anime girl. You pick up palette swap armor and weapons over the course of the game that don't affect your appearance, since that would require someone with modeling knowledge and thus be far beyond this game's technical budget. Armor and weapons are just six color swaps of the same items, and there's only a small handful of enemies that the game reuses prolifically.\n\nEnemy AI is, expectedly, idiotic. Since mobs respond based on your proximity alone rather than to damage received, it is entirely possible to set yourself up with longer range spells and just keep peppering them from afar. In fact, this is how I beat the final boss. A sad, but not unexpected end to an equally sad and not all that unexpected game. You should keep your eyes open, for a game with early 2000's graphics and not a hint of atmosphere, the draw distance is disgustingly short, rarely going as far as the length of the room you're in.\n\nI managed to beat The Sorceress in under five hours, because part of me wanted to finish the game and prove some semblance of \"it wasn't all that bad,\" but I'm not going to turn this into a cost analysis based on the seven dollars I paid because it was five hours of pain and frustration. In a world where one-man games are becoming increasingly high quality, where Steam is getting piled on like a landfill with trash, games like The Sorceress don't have a place, not even for the people who like the 'so bad it's funny' aspect. It's not funny anymore.\n\nOne thing I didn't mention about the game is the graphics, since they are Unity assets and it doesn't seem right to pass judgement on something the developer didn't make. It's like praising your dad's baking skills over the Marie Callender pie he picked up at Wal Mart and moved from the tin over to a fancy looking plate. What I will say is that the assets are the gaming equivalent of a ransom note made out of cut up newspaper clippings, with characters that look like they were hastily ripped from a dollar store toy box and thrown together without much thought to consistency or quality.\n\nThe best we can hope for is that games like this continue to be smothered in the white noise that is the current Steam release climate.", "recommendationid": "29682555", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486405476, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486728969, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561197968546812", "num_games_owned": 559, "playtime_forever": 285}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557229"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 57, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1486015748, "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Oh, look!

The only issue is that this was all fake, and here's why.  The award shows usually award games of the previous calendar year.  So for example, in the case of Indie World show, he claimed that he won those awards in 2016.  The only problem is that to be eligible for that show's awards, the developer has to release this game in 2015.  The Dev Gamm award that he so featured on his game's store page was for this year, 2017.  To generally be eligible for that award, on Planet Earth, the game would have to be released in 2016.\n\nBy this humble reviewer's opinion, either he never was nominated for those awards, or he pulled a fast one on all of us and released the game on three separate occasions on three consecutive years, one for each year.  Since we haven't heard of this game until last week, the former is the most likely scenario.\n\nWhen called out on the use of these awards to bolster the prestige of the game, the developer acted swiftly and banned everyone who had called him out on it, with one member eating a 48-hour Steam community ban over his review of the game.  These bans have since been reversed by a Steam community moderator, but the damage has already been done to the developer.  His reputation has been shot by censoring the criticism that he so desparitly tried to avoid.\n\n[h1]Now concerning the game[/h1]\n\nThe game has a very simple plot that goes along the lines of this, \"[i]On a very terrible and stormy night, the dead rises from the grave to cause terror to the citizens of a very peaceful kingdom.  The king of the kingdom rallied his forces against the dead, but he fails to stop them from ravaging the countryside.  The task then falls on a peasant girl in a remote village to stop the dead.[/i]\"\n\nThe plot is very basic, but it doesn't do much to bolster the game, which claims to be an RPG at its core.  Gameplay wise, the game plays a lot like a MMO, but even then the execution is flawed, which doesn't speak for much.\n\nFor example, To buy an weapon AND armor in the game, you have to interact with the relevant merchant twice, once for your weapon, and once for your armor.  The armor in this game doesn't really boost your defense stat, but rather increases your HP by a relevant factor.  The lowest armor boosts your HP by 10, for example.  Weapons are not that much better, as your basic sword only does 1-2 points of damage, and to buy an upgrade to the next level cost you 500 gold.\n\nSpeaking of gold, the way that you obtain gold in this game is completely laughable.  You get gold from monsters as a drop (maybe even as a rare drop), but even then the amount of gold you get from monsters can vary from one gold to ten gold.  The game actually encourages you to grind for your equipment rather than levels, which you can build rather quickly if you can track down the proper monsters, and you are willing to spend a little time killing them.\n\nOn the subject of monsters, the monsters in this game is a joke at best.  The skeletons in this game have only one behavior, charge and attack, something that only basic monsters with a little programming can do, but the first boss fight doesn't require the player to play with a little skill, and can defeat it by spaming one attack and healing up when necessary.  The only good thing concerning monsters is that their levels do go up with the player's levels, so that there is a little bit of difficulty that is maintained when fighting them.  But that doesn't even mention that when you defeat a monster, another one can sometimes spawn right on top of you, sometimes killing you in the process if you don't heal up in time.  That isn't good game design.\n\n[h1]Overall, is it worth my money?[/h1]\n\nThe winded answer is that the game does offer a bit of challenge for your gaming dollar, but with the current price point of $6.99 USD, there are a lot better games out there that offer a much greater value for your gaming dollar, and some are even free.\n\nFinal Verdict: 1/10\n\n[h1]Video[/h1]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K91kHGTulOc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVlT4nUc_BE", "recommendationid": "29753431", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486436491, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498960003, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198014223463", "num_games_owned": 103, "playtime_forever": 47}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527836"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 17, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1486003210, "votes_down": 83, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "TLDR at bottom if you just want the bullet points.\n\nThe following is my impressions of the game after about 3 hours of gameplay. I would really suggest you try the demo. If you do enjoy it, the rest of the game is more of the same. The graphics aren't mind blowing, but I find them to be really charming, and it kind of feels like a throwback. The gameplay is very basic and straight forward, kill things to get exp and gear to make your numbers bigger, so you can kill bigger things and get more bigger numbers to fight even more bigger things.The quests are basic kill/fetch quests and it's basically a grindfest. The English in the game isn't perfect and will make you crindge if you're a grammar nazi or intolerant of poor English.\n\nBy pretty much all standards this game is bad. It's got the addictiveness of a clicker in that you are basically doing nothing, but seeing your numbers get bigger is fun; The narrative is weak (if there is one, feels like every quest is just side missions), all items are just \"whites\", your next chest piece will have more armor, and your next sword more damage, but that is all they're good for and there is no visual difference; sections of the game are poorly balanced and frustrating (around level 13 you have to go through a room of level 2 spiders, but there are so many that if they get off a volley of venom you get one shot unless you're drastically over geared, boss that spawns adds continued to spawn adds after death, etc.); spells feel uninspired, and so far seem to be featuring \"enchanted\" melee attacks and various bolts (fire bolt/lightning bolt/etc.); and lots of interface issues (you can't hotkey potions, all of the interfaces such as your bag, character screen, etc. can only be closed by clicking the X and can only be opened by physically clicking on them).\n\nDespite all this I just find the game damn charming and nostalgic. I'm not sure if that is what the developer was going for, but it truly feels like something I would have been playing as a kid about 15-16 years ago and has the same sort of issues as games of that time. Definitely not a game for everyone, but if a pointless grindfest sound like fun, you like clicker-esque games that are just all about getting bigger numbers, or you just want to remember how far games have come... Try the demo, it's a good representation of the whole.\n\nTLDR: The game is bad, but bad in a way that I think it has an audience. Ultimately, if you think this might appeal to you play the demo. Don't even finish it. If you don't like the game in the first 5 minutes, you're not going to like it.\n\nThe Bad: Rehashes age old bad design decisions, bugs, imbalance, uninspired combat\\loot, interface, grindfest, graphics, poor English, Comic Sans.\n\nThe Good: Rehashes age old bad design decisions, bugs, imbalance, uninspired combat\\loot, interface, grindfest, graphics, poor English, Comic Sans.", "recommendationid": "29640586", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486061530, "votes_funny": 7, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486066872, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198035915155", "num_games_owned": 287, "playtime_forever": 192}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.418415"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
