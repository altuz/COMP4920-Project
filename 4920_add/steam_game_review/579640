(Built-in profiles listed at the end of the review).\n\nAs there are a lack of reviews for this little app I thought I'd add my two-cents.\nProbably best right away to answer the three obvious questions:\n\n1. Why would you want this when you can get free video tools which do the same?\n2. Do you lose quality?\n3. Why use a fisheye in the first place?\n\n1. Why buy it at all?\neg. If you use a GoPro they have their own dedicated app. There is a vast difference in the fisheye effect between the hero2 and 3, and until they and the other makers come to their senses and include the fisheye correction apps in-camera for some people it's still easier to pick up one  pocket-change app like this on steam than download various other apps and plugins for Vegas or Adobe or whatever video editing suite you use.\n\n2. Does it distort?\nYes, and No.  It alters the video you put in, but that video has already been distorted into a fisheye which makes it a hard one to answer. its like asking someone if he still beats his wife, whatever answer he gives is going to sound dubious. \nJust look on it as swapping one type of distortion for another and getting the choice of the one which you like the best (or which is the least distracting).\n\nFor example Take a look at any panned video image on in a real TV programme, discovery channel make huge use of fisheye action cameras, half the time the edges have been corrected in the same way this programme works, but you barely noticed at all because you were looking in the centre. If that had been a rounded fisheye it would have distracted you from what was going on in the centre at first.  That's about all there is to it. If you do notice the blurry edge at all, it's far less distracting than the fisheye effect. \n\n3. Why use a fisheye lens at all?\nSoon there will be some troll, usually the one leaving a thumbs down as a negative review of a review (the irony of that) asking us all why we use fisheye lenses in the first place.  On behalf of all of us who do use action cameras with fisheye lenses, I think I'm speaking for us all in saying get a life, there is nothing for you here. If you don't know why you sometimes need fisheye correction, then why are you reading a review about a fisheye correction app anyway? If you have popped in to troll us for buying an app that other various apps do for free, may I refer you to the the previous two paragraphs above, indicating that  the review is for helping people decide whether the software is any good, and not inviting judgement of our video equipment choices,  which you probably haven't read anyway, before you jog on.\n\nBuilt-in profiles currently include: GoPro Hero3, Hero3+, Hero4 & Hero4 Session, Hero5 Black & Hero5 Session, Sony HDR-AS100V, HDR-AS50, HDR-CX220, FDR-X1000V, Drift HD Ghost, SJCAM SJ4000 & SJ 5000, DJI Phantom 3 & Zenmuse X3, Garmin VIRB, Parrot Bebop 2, Rollei 6S, Rollei 410, Zoom Q8, GitUp Git2, Mobius ActionCam (lenses A, C2), Yi 4K.", "recommendationid": "31730622", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499534025, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505941897, "num_reviews": 105, "steamid": "76561197970350988", "num_games_owned": 138, "playtime_forever": 264}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501819"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1495109586, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Work great!\nI reccomend!", "recommendationid": "31820609", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1495109586, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505770725, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198177325010", "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 143}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499819"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
