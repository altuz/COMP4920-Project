Easily the best escape the room puzzle game in VR, has a portal type feel to it with the puzzles but more of a grim cell type escape situation.\n\nHave to say there is a lot  of shit in VR at the moment but this is in my top 10 VR games so far. Just the atmosphere, visuals and puzzles with the deaths actually making you want to avoid them. I was starting to actually fear dying in game, not sure why but it felt a little real when a box landed on you I could almost feel the pain. \n\nAnyway a must buy for anyone with VR that enjoys escape the room puzzle games.\n\n8 out of ten deaths by falling boxes.", "recommendationid": "32261228", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1496897571, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496897156, "num_reviews": 336, "steamid": "76561197974522156", "num_games_owned": 1810, "playtime_forever": 51}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507325"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_positive": 5}}
