But I don't think it's worth \u00a315/$18 for the following reasons:\n\nI loved the first and second instalment but I must say this is the weaker of the three. I was devastated to find out that the composer passed away during the development of the second game, because I feel like this chapter and its ambience noticeably suffers. The first two games had a nice feel-good Caribbean atmosphere to them and this last one just seems to take a giant leap into a different genre, as if they were desperate to push a grand plot in the last game. I watched the trailer after completing the game and was surprised to see that they chose to highlight that rock and roll was gonna save the day... it's just so far from their initial vision.\n\nI'm also disappointed to see that they used what looks like cheap particle effects (eg. gifs of explosions) and that they've left in a bunch of jagged artefacts from the animation (wish I could include screenshots here, but oh well), which makes this game feel as if they rushed the release. The juice girl and Lina's voice acting were a bit awkward and the puzzles were less complicated than I expected. \n\nAll this being said, I did like the end and the puzzles were fun to complete. The general animation was amazing and had great frame rates, and the composition of the camera shots were nice and effective in building suspense. Generally, the backgrounds were beautifully designed, although it feels like the developers were unsure of what they wanted to do with the game so they just threw in every possible environment (beaches, evil caves, snowy mountains, cyberpunk cities... what?). \n\nI just want to end this by saying that I know I'm being harsh on this game, but it's out of love. I know they already had to push this release back from August til now, I just wish they hadn't set a deadline and instead had taken all the time they needed to polish the small details, because this is one of the best point and click series and I think it deserved something more. \n\nTLDR: Overall it was an alright game, but it is weak in comparison to the past releases and lacks some polish.

Still, I honestly cannot recommend this game at anything close to original price.\nAs with many other projects spanning several years and several releases, this game series also seems to have lost its originally intended direction, and it's a damn shame.\n\n- The game suffers from the same value for money spent issue as the earlier episodes (at their release).\n- The puzzles are MUCH too easy and shallow, I could count the amount of long-lasting puzzles without obvious solutions on one hand; it feels like the puzzles were added afterwards to make an animated movie into barely a video game.\n- The direction they went with in terms of ambiance and art style, however aesthetically pleasing to me, just seems really odd after having played the first two episodes. It's very far from having an \"Afro-Caribbean\" vibe. It just feels like the original direction of the trilogy was lost somewhere long ago and only the characters remained.\n- Voice acting is remarkably atrocious at times. More often than not, this is due to poor mastering or recording, not due to the voice actors. Voiceovers and their scripts felt very rushed to me in several spots.\n\n[b]On the flipside:[/b]\n\n- The sountrack is great, it's absolutely amazing, actually. Jamie Salisbury did a really good job.\n- The story, while forgettable and without any real plot twists, had a decent conclusion.\n- While (as aforementioned) unfitting, the art is gorgeous and I found myself appreciating the scenery of the city in a lot of places, especially when accompanied by the unique soundtrack. I'm a sucker for Blade Runner-like gritty cyberpunk. Dark nights, neon lights and lit up highrises. Raised highways with cars whizzing past.

I loved Bwana. He remained the same, as hilarious as ever. And the cactus! But....the game, overall, felt less challenging then the other two. Only two parts really stumped me-the islands with Lena and the microphone bit with Bwana. That in itself isn't enough to make the game that bad but....\n\n(cons)\n\n-There's a moment when someone is talking about cops and they say \"police beastiality.\" ....Was that purposeful? Or was it supposed to say \"brutality\"? Cause if that was purposeful, that's cool....\n-This game was released a month late. But the graphics weren't quite there. At least 3 characters didn't fit with the surroundings. They didn't look right, they didn't look like the background or other characters. Apart from being different, they also looked bad. 2 were the juice ladies, and 1 was the dad (I can't spell his name) when he was with Lena. At one point he was fuzzy as all get out.\n-Also on the island there was a quite clear distortion in pixels, down a straight line (when you'd sail away.)\n-There was a lag on most of the cut scenes, it was really skippy. Kinda like an unbuffered streamed movie.\nI'm not a computer person, so I don't know if these are just my computer and the way it downloaded (the skipping and the weird island distortion line), or actual problems with the game.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me in this game was incomplete actions and animation felt rough. For instance: When Bwana and Kito are climbing into the chain thing, you don't get to see them hop in. Bwana says \"lets go!\" and it cuts to them already being in it (which I think takes away from possible fun moments). Or the elevator shaft with Gabi, Bwana is by the open door way, and then it cuts to their both safe. That's just two examples. Cut scene to action was also rough. And one moment I thought was really bad was in the rubble, the rocker and gabi were on the ground and then Bwana pops in frame. Like if he was supposed to be under a rubble pile, that wasn't there either. It was two people in frame and then he popped right in, as opposed to if he had been under rubble already there. It was two people and then POP! Bwana was there too.\n\nSo for an extra month, there are a lot of rough graphics. \n\nPros:\n-the people were cool. I couldn't believe Rose existed. I thought I had misunderstood what her job was. Nope. \n-the cussing startled me. Maybe it shouldn't have. I guess I'm used to games like Nancy Drew.\n-Bwana and the cactus\n-Getting to see Bwanas dad.\n-I didn't get stuck forever in this game like the last two. I guess it was just a lot easier. That's a win/lose.\n-I adored the scenery though.\n\nOverall, I'd say wait for any kind of sale for this game and that it's a little behind the first two games, overall polish and in terms of enjoyment.
