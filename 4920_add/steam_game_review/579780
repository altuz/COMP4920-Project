So far I can only confirm 3 or 4 different scenarios. You sit in your chair and embody a mental patient constrained to his/her chair and using the trackpad you maneuver through the asylum from room to room visualizing certain things. The object is to get out safely or die but you really don't have much control over what will happen in each case. Just pick the right doors. The graphics are good and I noticed no real bugs. Make sure you start the game while seated wearing your HMD or you will be too high up or too low.The horror scenes are startling and somewhat scary. Who isn't afraid of killer babies? This is gorey so not really for under-teens. My main gripe was the choice of the way you do locomotion. If I was the dev I would have just had us press trigger and turn controller up down left or right to move the wheelchair but it is such that the forward and backwards and roation is a little unintuative on the track pad and can cause some sickly feeling if you turn too fast left or right. Once you get used to it it is tolerable but a little annoying. Other than that this is a solid experience for those horror fans out there. I bought the game on sale for $2.50 and the full price is $5. It is definately worth having in the library for the lesser price but for $5 well it is fine too but really needs more content. This is another great party and scare your best friend kind of game. It does deliver a great immersive experience but just lacks content. my rating for it right now is 5/10. Average but good for the price. \n\nVideo below. 4k will be ready after it fully processes. Enjoy.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1138422799", "recommendationid": "35053632", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505771592, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505763212, "num_reviews": 221, "steamid": "76561197974765747", "num_games_owned": 477, "playtime_forever": 33}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477977"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 15, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 12}}
