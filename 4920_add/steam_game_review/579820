Easily one of the greatest VR game out now.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe graphics are 10/10, truly amazing lighting mixed with superb deatils. Sharp shadows, and SSAO. Looks gorgeous. Even in current gen VR resolution.\n\nSOUND\nThe sound is phenomenal, just hearing dozen of nearby dinos, both in the air climbing the cave walls and roaring in the distance all adds to the imersion, not including the sweet music.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay, is quite imersive, I find myself getting lost in this foreign land of dinosaurs.\nThere's so much to see, you just wander the land looking and observing all kinds of dinos and insects all scurrying along the ground, even moles that burry up from the ground. And you can sneak up on them and scan them all.\nRead about thme in the \"infotarium\" (sort of a in-game dino-pedia)\nThere's so much I don't want to spoil for you, you need to go out there and discover this for yourself.\n\nIt's basically a dinosaur exploration game. It's nice, quite and relaxing. Not to repetitve.\nYou can give you pet t-rex(yes that's right, I said pet t-rex) orders and even tell it to roar, in result, scaring off unwated dinosaurs that wander to close.\n\nThe oculus controls are are nice touch... see what I did there?;)\n\nNEGATIVE POINT\nI would love to see some more interactivity with the enviroment. Such as plants and stuff, or even use the grip controls to pick up objects, would be cool. Right now there's alot of object pass through. The last step right now is an eviroment I can touch.\n\n9/10\nAn absolute MUST BUY. Especially for Dino nerds.\n\nWell worth the asking price, and more.\n\nFor those still unsure, then wait. Check out my Let's play of this game, where I talk about all that's great in this game and just take it all in.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD7ZSk6JT3U&t=612s", "recommendationid": "35086454", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505921438, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 262, "last_played": 1506589049, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198028358390", "num_games_owned": 133, "playtime_forever": 366}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520011"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 8, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505898198, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This review is for the developers to fix the vives version mistake.\n\n1. Hands position is wrong, when the game starts i had to change controllers right to left + left to right.\n\n2. The location of the hands is not quite accurate. I mean that when i see my hand i feel that the hand of the character is a bit higher than my real hand & shifted a little bit which force u to lose the immersive.  \n\n3. The character is higher than my real hight, adding hight calibration is highly recommended. \n\n4. The movement system & rotation cause motion sickness, I would recommend to:\n\nA. Access to modify the movement speed.\n\nB. Allow the player to chose either walking or running. \n\nC. Direction of movement to be linked with the hands direction, not head direction (sometimes we head for a direction with moving our heads to explore surrounds.)  \n\nD. To add teleportation because it is the best way to avoid motion sickness. \n\nE. When climbing cliffs, the whole character & camera angle changes according to the main facing side. Which means that i find my self inside the rocks & i had to move & rotate myself in real life to relocate my self.\n\nNote: I do have psvr but I didn't buy Robinson cuz i believe that vr games are more immersive & enjoyable when u r free to move & can use ur hands.\n\nSo plz, either u modify the problems or refund us.", "recommendationid": "35080311", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505898198, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 247, "last_played": 1506015716, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198325569113", "num_games_owned": 48, "playtime_forever": 351}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511624"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506292446, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great game, beautiful, easy to use, fun, immersive, runs smoothly on a 1070 with everything on maximum quality.\nShame this game quality is so rare in VR.", "recommendationid": "35192112", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506292446, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 245, "last_played": 1506512114, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197970623843", "num_games_owned": 60, "playtime_forever": 245}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507340"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506537284, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is definitely one of the best games you can get for Vive right now.  The sense of scale and immersion you get from Cytek's beautiful CryEngine graphics is worth the price alone.  I have not played this with a regular gamepad and will be basing everything from here on around motion controllers.   \n\nCrytek really upset me when they launched The Climb as an Oculus exclusive and still to this day have not given official OpenVR support for it.  This game pretty much makes up for that however by bringing those awesome climbing mechanics to a vast story driven world centered around discovery.  Gameplay pretty much consists of scanning the life forms that occupy the prehistoric planet you've landed on and discovering lore building upon the story of why you're there in the first place.  This game is actually the first to keep me interested enough in the story to actually want to find and read all the lore I can.  It's short, to the point and keeps you wanting to find out more.  There are also some puzzle elements but nothing over bearing or tedious. The climbing you'll be familiar with if you've ever played \"The Climb\" or \"Climbey\".  Definitely my favorite element of the game and keeps you're heart racing when you're hundreds of feet in the air with hungry predators below, waiting for you to slip up.  To increase the sense of immersion you also get a little T-rex pet that follows you around and will play hide and seek with you.  I would gladly have payed $60 for what I've experienced so far and still have more of the game to explore.", "recommendationid": "35247150", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1507074646, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 356, "last_played": 1507073679, "num_reviews": 51, "steamid": "76561198019046685", "num_games_owned": 306, "playtime_forever": 356}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502649"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506153584, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "HTC Vive Review\n\nFirst of all they put so much love into this game with so many details. The world is just incredible. The jungle just feels alive and you are guided quite well by your friend, the flying robot, which explains the controls bit by bit when you need them and he is also very entertaining and tells you what to do next.\n\nCONTROLS:\n\nThey are ok at best. Only the climbing part feels very nice. You dont actually use your hand in terms of grabbing stuff. You have your device in your hand which lets objects move. Thats absolutly ok, it's just different. I personally like it because you have longer range and you can easily pick up things on the floor.\n\nBut there is not much interaction going on compared to other games. Worst part is that you sometimes have to press thumbpad up (on vive) instead of trigger for opening doors etc. which is very confusing at the start.\n\nThe movement is different, too: You move in the direction you look (not where your controller is pointing like in Onward). It feels weird but i got used to it very quick.\n\nNo true room scale: The game has one exact spot which is your standing point. If you move somewhere else in your playspace you must readjust the spot by holding your left menu button.\n\nUnnescery camera movents when you start to climb or jump on a rope.\n\nSo to sum it up: The controls are different than expected but they are working. The game could be much better with very small changes so i hope there will be an update.\n\nPERFORMANCE:\n\nPerfect performance (R9 390) on high settings, Super Sampling 1.4. Some parts still look a bit blurry but nevertheless the graphics are gorgeous when you turn them up!\n\nAll in all this is really one of the best VR experiences if not the best! It's like a perfect VR movie. The background story is not very interesting but behind every corner a surprise is waiting for you. And especially the jungle is absolutly amazing! Dozens of little scripted events and thousands of creatures everywhere. The background music is on point. I played robinson already 3 times and it wasn't the last time.\n\n10/10 minus 2 for weird controls", "recommendationid": "35146889", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1507018889, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 611, "last_played": 1507018077, "num_reviews": 37, "steamid": "76561197962242093", "num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_forever": 611}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502649"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506213411, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I really like this game other than being a little pricey.
