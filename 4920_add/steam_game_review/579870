During my 1/2 hour playthrough for my First Impressions review the game lockeed up on me twice, crashed once, I was utterly unable to make use of the controller that this game was clearly designed for. Not to mention the keybindings are the worst I have seen in a long time. Non-rebindable and you use the directional keys to move and the \"A\" key is your action key?? And somehow the escape key is tied to the function that your \"W\" key is bound to as well. Also Spacebar and Enter do the exact same thing. These Devs need to look into the standardized control schemes that have been optimized for keyboard/mouse over a decade ago. This is not an improvement.\n\nAnd the power kick or \"Sparta Kick\" as I kept calling it is the only attack you will need. It is the most damaging attack I had, did significantly more damage than the \"powers\" that you obtain, and was capable of destroying massed enemies all at once.\n\nAll I'll say about the story is that it has more cliche's than a Bond Villain.\n\nUnfortunately I will not be recommending this game to my viewers.", "recommendationid": "30421596", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1489129714, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489118699, "num_reviews": 174, "steamid": "76561198030863487", "num_games_owned": 427, "playtime_forever": 34}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523396"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1489123174, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It is hard for me to really recommend this game, while I do not think it is bad, it does have quite a few problems. The artwork is beautiful and the design of the environments are really nice. The problem is that I got stuck in the environment a few times. The gameplay is very strange, it feels weird to play and it is hard to describe. You pick up powers from enemies and bosses as you go, and of all those powers you can pick 3 (switchable at any time) to use at once. I don't think I managed to get all of them by the end of the game, but I noticed myself abusing a few of them by the end of the game. The music is nothing special either. All in all, you could beat this game in maybe an hour if you rush, my final gameplay time is pretty generous.\n\nI would say this game is a rather mixed bag rather than bad or negative.
