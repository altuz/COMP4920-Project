I think the interface is well designed and everything works smooth. I also like the background music which I think fits the game well, as well as the art design they went with.\n\nMy major problem is two-fold:\n1) The multi player interface is garbage. They make it difficult to see a list of games available, and the multiplayer scene is absolutely dead.\n2) The computer, while a competent opponent, absolutely cheats. Without a doubt. I've watched closely and the computer chooses actions that would make absolutely zero sense (and I'm not talking just a risky choice - that would be understandable). It clearly makes choices that maximize knowing what you have chosen and than it coordinates with other AI players. I also suspect that the code \"top decks\" cards that will help it if boxed into a corner.\n\nSo, with multiplayer dead, you have to play a cheating AI (Hard Mode) to have any worthwhile interaction.", "recommendationid": "34960597", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505435155, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505434591, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197969457801", "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_forever": 1028}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497377"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 7, "total_reviews": 26, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 19}}
