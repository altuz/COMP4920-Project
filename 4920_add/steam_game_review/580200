It has such a calm and relaxing vibe, that I haven't experienced in many games before. But, this game is as shallow as a puddle.\n\nAt first, the game seems like there is a lot of depth and content but while there is a lot, nothing is really fleshed out. The farm aspect seemed awesome, but there's literally nothing to do except set up a farm and then move onto a new zone. Which makes no sense, because there are more farm plots in the other zones, so you'll never go back to an old farm plot.\n\nIf the crafting and the exploration had more depth, I could figure this game. But the plot is is barely a plot and everything feels like it has no weight.

That's the first thing everyone notices, I guess. Especially in the beginning there are a lot of awwww moments. The music is amazing, even though it gets repetitive after a while. The colours are bright, the areas are gorgeous, the sun's shining, it's a real mood-lifter.\n\nSince there are already a lot of positive reviews, I'd like to talk about the few negative points of the game: the NPC voices and \"language\" is ridiculous, it would have been better to not give them a voice at all. Moaning and groaning doesn't do anything to immerse me in the game. And, and this is the biggest negative, the grind is real. The storyline is mere background, the most important thing seems to be to build up your little farm and become master in various trades. Which will see you run all over the map in order to gather fish or wood, stone and flowers. You will need a spreadsheet to remember which trader has what and where you might find the extremely valuable water or rare oil or eggs. Building a new shed for your pets takes a lot of steps and material!\n\nI still give this game a recommendation, because I enjoy it a lot.

The characters are cardboard cutouts lacking a history, story, goals, and personality.  If you're after that harvest moon style of gameplay, look elsewhere.\n\nI still think Yonder is worth a buy, though.  Simply put, the world is very pretty and the audio and visual elements work together to create a deep sense of immersion.  Unfortunately the UI is at odds with that immersion every step of the way. To chop a tree and plant a seedling you must scroll through a dynamically created toolbar twice, first to find your axe and again to find your seeds.  This could be a one-button operation.  Yonder could be a one-button game.  Every interaction is the same except the animation, swinging a hammer versus swinging a sickle.\n\nWait for this one to go on sale.  $25 is a hard price to stomach for a digital art piece with no story and no replayability, but it's a great big world to get lost in and a nice way to wind down after a long night of gaming.", "recommendationid": "35088153", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505926932, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 159, "last_played": 1506387889, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561197994056144", "num_games_owned": 550, "playtime_forever": 442}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507224"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506420829, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great adventure game.\nQuests are basically just collection quests.\nAdventure, collect, farm and make zones happy by completing tasks.\n\nVery relaxing game!", "recommendationid": "35219118", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506420829, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 935, "last_played": 1506841629, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198061837003", "num_games_owned": 601, "playtime_forever": 935}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497278"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1506480943, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I was really hoping that the game's great art would mix with good characterization, interesting plot, and farming and I would be sucked in.
