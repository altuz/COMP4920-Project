On the one hand, I've seen it described as a survival game, and it's definitely a platformer (at least in building interiors) -- and I'm not a big fan of either style. On the other hand, it's an open-world game, and \"pick up and play\" (i.e., you can spend 15 or 30 minutes on it and most likely have something to show for it), and I love both of those styles.\n\nI'm still early into it (and have restarted a few times as I learn more about how it works), but I've seen enough to confidently recommend it. The initial stages aren't too punishing -- at least once you know what's going on -- though you should expect to die and take it in stride while learning the ropes (you can continue from a checkpoint if you're non-hardcore like me).\n\nGraphics are very low-res pixel art but they have a ton of character. \n\nRan into one bug that the developer patched within two days of my bug report. Also ran into a basement I couldn't get out of, but I can't say whether it was an oubliette or just my own failure to git gud. The jumping in general requires a little practice but is not bad once you get a feel for it. Damage inflicted on you in building interiors is fairly light so you have room to screw up.\n\nBeginner tips:\n\n* The game will say you shouldn't get too attached to your car, but try to keep it intact for the first couple missions; park a little way from the mission objective so it doesn't take collateral damage when you get into fights. You will have some distances to travel that will be impractical on foot unless you can take shelter in a building.\n\n* To refuel the car, stand near it and Use your fuel can in your inventory. Don't refuel until the car runs out of gas, or you may get shortchanged.\n\n* If you're initially timid, be aware that plain old fisticuffs can be quite effective. But don't go into the darkness and get mobbed. Wait for morning. The clock runs fast enough that it won't take long for the sun to rise.\n\n* The developer was kind enough to respond to my begging for tips in the Steam Discussions; check out his response for a few additional ideas. If you're really interested in the game, check out the developer's website for some blog entries on how the sausage is made. It was fascinating to me but could be too much detail for some players.\n\n* There are some YouTube videos that show how other people approach the game. Watching a couple of these was very useful to me. One commenter noted that Energy in this game (replenished by food and water) is similar to how a shield or body armor works in many other games. Haven't played enough to know whether this is an exact parallel but it seems right.\n\nLooking forward to playing a lot more of this.", "recommendationid": "35214711", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506395859, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 76, "last_played": 1506377833, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198066676208", "num_games_owned": 323, "playtime_forever": 76}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506449871, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "good game\n..................\nyeah i know i suck at reviews", "recommendationid": "35227253", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506449871, "votes_funny": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 66, "last_played": 1506447630, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198121640353", "num_games_owned": 740, "playtime_forever": 66}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1506536738, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Absolutely not.
