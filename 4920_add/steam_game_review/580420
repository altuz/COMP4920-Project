A nice pixel-art top-down hack and slash (of sorts) is TKLB. You play as a tiny bear dressed for combat and moving like a ninja would in the dead of night, so must you the player control Little Bear as he hacks and spears the mean people who would harm him and his kind. \n\nLeft click is a melee ranged attack for big points and the right click is a projectile with a cost, only 3 can be used per level and it not only has rather poor distance, it can break on any surface. Use wisely your limited spears as they spin during travel. The targets for slaughter use a cone line of sight system like metal gear solid was known for so if Little Bear is outside the line of sight cone, he is invisible. Getting in the outside ring will cause the larget to produce a ? above their head and going inside the inside ring will cause the target to produce a ! above their head and you will fail the map. Maps are timed as well, so being to methotical or patient will cause panic and chaos. \n\nIt makes you think, it makes you take risks and for the love of it I have no damn idea what the points for items system does or how to use items if items do exist. Im getting things from swords to hot liquids to happy faces, none of it does anything to change the flow of gameplay.\n\nAchievements and badges. Its a nice get.
