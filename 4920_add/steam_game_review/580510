Have to say the game is absolutely beautiful. The mechanics of the game are interesting so far, looking forward to unlocking more abilities to see their effects. I think the general direction of controls is good, but there is some trouble with pathing at times, which does make the dodge based progression a bit harder. Suspect with more updates and polish that'll get smoothed over and there'll be less pathing hitches.\n\nThe most disappointing part so far was the limited resolution choices when setting up the game, my resolution 2560x1440 wasn't listed and running at non-native resolutions just doesn't look as nice. But this is early access, I'm hoping that they'll increase the number of resolutions available as part of the pre-release polish.\n\nSo gameplay and graphics are good, little bit of clunkiness in the controls and only a few resolutions seem to be natively supported.\n\nOverall I recommend picking up this game if you would like a hack and slash that requires a bit more thought and consideration.", "recommendationid": "30881634", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1491067401, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491074094, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198005990147", "num_games_owned": 280, "playtime_forever": 56}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511503"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
