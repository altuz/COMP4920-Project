Word aren\u00b4t just good enough to tell how awesome this game is! JUST CAUSE I LOVE IT SO MUCH!\n\nI got this game at first I was like \"ouh it\u00b4s just a platformer kinda like super meat boy\" and in a way it is. BUT don\u00b4t think that this game is just like super meat  boy ouh nononono. It still feels like a different game TRUST ME! The jumping need to be accurate so you can\u00b4t just spam the jump and get good bounces out of that! So it kinda reminds me of CS:GO\u00b4s bhopping you need to be accurate with thouse jumps! \n\nThis isn\u00b4t a game that you can just play hours with out having a break cause then you keep doing the same mistakes and can\u00b4t really do good! You need to have a \"clear mind\" in oder to figure out how to get some hidden things in the game. This game is easy to just open and play and get hooked on so I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS GAME!\n\nI even gave my friends lilttle brother a change to play this game and he loved it he is only 10 but still he loved it!", "recommendationid": "32341438", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1497183604, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497465483, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198220525253", "num_games_owned": 124, "playtime_forever": 655}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516558"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1493676221, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A lovely game that really draws you in, the music and ui aswel as the sound effects really work together to draw someone into playing the game more. \n\nThe puzzles start off easy and get progressively harder and if you cannot be challenged by the puzzles, try out the editor! :D", "recommendationid": "31495784", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493676221, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493499685, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198059636830", "num_games_owned": 126, "playtime_forever": 41}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499468"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
