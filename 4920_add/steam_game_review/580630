I highly suggest listening to your own music over the top.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty good, it's a great concept but needs some improving.  Here are some suggestions:\n\n> Higher tolerances for missing.  This isn't real life, not everyone can smack a tiny target with a sword in the opposite hand with ~1 seconds notice.  I understand there must be a skill curve, but I feel allowing for small errors would be great.\n\n> When the sheild is used to deflect an item, it should not be allowed to roll back and cause you to lose a life.  This screwed me on many occasions.  Instead I suggest having the sheild \"smash\" the projectiles on impact.\n\n> Longer sword.  Some projectiles are out of reach for sitting players/people that stand still.  I do have room-scale enabled but if I was a stationary player I would certainly struggle to hit some of the targets.\n\n> Power ups.  I feel like there is little to no reward for performing well in this game, and the combo system in place doesn't accurately represent or reflect your performance.  I would suggest rewarding the player with perks for high combos/low miss rates in the form of power up projectiles that you slice to gain a temporary advantage (such as seeing where projectiles are going to go, or a magnetic sheild that pulls projectiles towards it).\n\nTL;DR Game is 6/10, needs improvements but I would reccommend.", "recommendationid": "29802738", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486651855, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498479931, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198125535733", "num_games_owned": 72, "playtime_forever": 285}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506376"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487088707, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "a really good game if you like space pirate trainer.

Basically some spheres are flying towards you and you can either cut them with your sword or deflect them with your shield. It has a good learning curve and gets harder in each level, but you can train your reflexes and then it leaves a nice satisfaction if you master the next level. The most important point is to remember that you need to be fast, but you don't need force to cut the spheres - it suffices to \"touch\" the spheres with the sword to cut them.\nAnd I like the female voice with the dry type of humor! \nIt is well made, provides a good amount of fun and it's free so just try it out!", "recommendationid": "29929662", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487110367, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495222446, "num_reviews": 35, "steamid": "76561198013020097", "num_games_owned": 810, "playtime_forever": 70}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_positive": 4}}
