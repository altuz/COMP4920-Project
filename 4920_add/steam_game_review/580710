However, it isn't so much a wargame, tactical, operational or otherwise as it is a LOGCAP one. You'll spend more time conducting ReSupp missions to your FOB's and units in the field than actually engaging in COIN operations, which eventually becomes the sole focus of your playtime. I understand that this game mechanic is meant to be a sort of juggling act but it simply consumes far too much gameplay time.\n\nIt would've been nice to have this system somewhat automated - Create a convoy with the required assets, supplies and predefine the departure time at a given turn to resupply the FOB's, the convoys could then do their thing. The player could then inject themselves back into these missions should there be any damage or losses. \n\nPerhaps the largest issue is that there is no way to conduct any sort of combat ops, large or otherwise to secure a village or town under Taliban or Militia control. Instead you're forced to do it via a rather abstract system of winning 'Hearts and Minds'. That's great and all for the locales that are neutral but not so much for those villages or towns that are firmly under enemy control (eg. Marjah/Op. Moshtarak). The Hearts and Minds aspect just doesn't work here and is simply a fundamentally flawed component as the time for building waterworks and delivering aid has long since past.\n\nI hoping some of these issues will be addressed in the future, especially that of enemy strongholds.", "recommendationid": "34237895", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502724811, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502723012, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198011095485", "num_games_owned": 216, "playtime_forever": 58}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560806"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 20, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1501658850, "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "\"Amateurs talk about tactics, professionals are studying logistics.\"\n", "recommendationid": "33965524", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501658850, "votes_funny": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501845077, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561198007132747", "num_games_owned": 239, "playtime_forever": 1449}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512473"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502588079, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Are you a bad enough dude to bring peace and stability to a troubled, proceduraly generated region in Afghanistan?\n\nWell, being tacticool and calling in artillery and air strikes is only half the battle, because you will need to win the trust (Hearts & Minds) of the local people.\n\nThis includes building roads to isolated mountainous villages, dodging MANPADs and IEDs to deliver UN aid, and protecting them from raids by local warlords and the Taliban, who also want a piece of the Hearts & Minds pie you're after!\n\nDon't forget the American people too, because they and Washington get to decide how much of a budget (Political Points) you can get to buy nifty toys like Apaches, MRAPS and Recon Drones.\n\nIf your troops get killed by Taliban, or are losing Hearts & Minds to the enemy, Washington might decide to pull the plug on this operation as well as an Anti-War movement developing at home if you mess up real bad, leading to your true defeat, a political one, and forced withdrawl, which means you lose!\n\nAll in all, pretty fun game which shows the complexity of counter insurgency operations, where a mix of political, humanitarian and good old fashioned military means can decisively win the day!", "recommendationid": "34203810", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502653562, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503149796, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198018887358", "num_games_owned": 132, "playtime_forever": 1474}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510856"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1503101703, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game is fun, but it also has some problems.\n\nMy biggest problems with the game is it's length and simplicity. It kinda feels like a watered-down version of Sid Meier's CIV. \nFor example... there is only one way to really play the game. Sure, the random generation means you can get  a different map each time... but a different map doesn't really change much. Everything still unfolds the exact same way. The enemy units you encounter in the beginning... are what you will be fighting in a few hours at the end of the game. \n\nIt IS fun at first... but once you realize what you are supposed to do, there is no challenge left. Each game basically plays like this:\n\n*Build Huskies and search for IED's on road\n*Build an MRAP and send them behind the Husky with some troops.\n*Build an FOB (takes only 2-3 turns).\n*Build water towers at villages for income\n*Station troops from your MRAV at water towers to protect them\n*Rinse and repeat till you win\n\nEven playing on the highest difficulty, the Taliban provide very little challenge 10 minutes in. Once you have a Husky for each convoy, the Taliban lose 95% of their ability to fight back. They do not attack anything that you place guards around, so they kinda just give up and quit fighting you halfway through. Then you just bomb any of their groups dumb enough to try something.\n\nTL;DR - The game provides a few hours of fun... but best to wait for a sale. $30 is just a bit too steep for a handful of hours in my opinion.\n\n\n", "recommendationid": "34339350", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503101703, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505192155, "num_reviews": 25, "steamid": "76561198142557826", "num_games_owned": 92, "playtime_forever": 1013}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505596"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1501439112, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I purchased this game months ago, however I still play a few games a month and enjoy every minute!

This Dev is only interested in turning and churning old and tried game code, rather than enhance games, test properly and fix bugs.  However, the most annoying thing is that the Dev for the most part never responds to Steam.  Their own forums may have some chatter, but here not so much.  I think they look at Steam as just one more way to advertise and sell the game but are not going to be bothered to provide any other input.  \n\nBugs include things like when you \"buy\" a unit you are given a choice to accept or cancel, but hit cancel, you still bought the unit. \n\nGameplay gets repetitive limiting any fun to being a logistics handler, making sure units are supplied, etc.  There is no easy automated way to handle supply, perhaps that was the intent.  So it's not going to model and sort of combat properly, you are basically handing air lifts and truck loads of supplies.  It's about 80% logistics and 20% combat.  \n\nSkirmish battles are like custom procedurally generated battles, but the enemy ALWAYS attacks from the right side of the map, while usually your base is at the left side or left/center.  That means you will spend a lot of time setting up a FOB (Foward Operation Base - think a smaller base that costs you points to build up and maintain) and/or heading to the right side of the map to look for and attack enemies.  They still have the capability to randomly spawn (\"from caves\") anywhere on the map with a nasty habit of just appearing at your base's doorsteps, so not only will you need to have units at your base for protection (which I get, but come on they can never spot enemies), you will have to shuttle units back and forth from the FOB with units, supplies, evacuating wounded units, etc.  \n\nYou will likely only \"operate\" in small areas of the map, perhaps only visiting 1 or 2 villages.  For the most part it takes to UN truck convoys or more to turn an unfriendly village to a friendly one, although you get very little back in return.  In other words for skirmish/random battles, there's no point in having these villages, and you will find your self building a FOB (forget having more than one due to the expense) and running helis to search enemies, and using a few forward troops to help spot enemies.  \n\nNow the thing is since you know the enemy will come from the right side of the map, once you find a \"spawn\" hex, you just wait for them to appear and attack and destroy.  Repeat and rinse.  \n\nIt all comes down to running supplies everywhere, searching for a spawn point and camp out to fight it out.  60 turns becomes repetitive.  Then there's the bugs.   Then there's the lack of any Dev responses.  \n\nIt would be better as an RTS (maybe) but limited to hexes for that old game board feel.  But it's a huge fail IMO.  Save the money, and look for a different RTS game.
