If Steam had a better review system with a \"so so\" option, I would choose that instead of pure thumbs down.\n\nFirst let me say, that for many it will still be worth $10.  You can still have a lot of fun with it.  So, I'm not telling you to avoid it, but rather, know what you're getting before buying.  It is still in active development, and many positive changes  and bug fixes have been made, so many of us are hoping that all the issues will be addressed at some point, but there hasn't been any word lately about a new patch.\n\nThe 3 single biggest cons, IMO, are:\n\n1) The RNG factor is many times so far out of balance that it destroys the game, even in the easier modes and missions, and that is definitely not fun.  The dev seems to be resistant on adjusting this, claiming that it's 'hard to get right'.  \n\nI simply have to disagree, because the easiest way to address it is to limit the number of enemy craft to the number of available defensive craft.  It's hard to imagine that this would be difficult.  This may not be the most elegant solution, but it would be far better than having to restart a mission because the RNG has made it impossible to play.\n\n2)  There is no unlimited play mode, which is quite bizarre for a game of this type.  Unlimited play / crash is kind of a must have mode for these kinds of games to allow for more relaxed play.  I have quite often played Unlimited mode in Airport Madness.  The dev has all but rejected the idea of unlimited mode, saying or implying that, \"the game is supposed to end....you're supposed to die\".\n\nUnlimited modes are also great for training.\n\n3) Limited replayability.\n\nSo, those are the top 3 for me.\n\nThere are a small variety of other bugs, as well as design issues, and opinions will vary on the design issues.  Here are a few of the design issues.\n\n* Aside from the campaigns, you have 'quick game' mode and 'surivival' mode.  Quick game has a set number of missions for its' 3 levels, and survival is theoretically unlimited, however, the RNG is designed to kill you off after awhile by sending you more missions than you can handle, or, send you missions for which you don't have enough craft to defeat.\n\nSurvival mode is where some of us have a beef, because the mode is deliberately rigged in favor of the AI, and as such, it's not entirely skill based.\n\n* Another debatable issue is the inability to send more than one craft type on a standard mission.  It's considered by some to be 'part of the challenge' of managing the logistics, but some of us would prefer to have the option to do it, even if there's a penalty of some kind.\n\n* There is no point system, and no real depth to bring additional tatics and strategy in to the game.  Now, the game is still very new, so I wouldn't expect it necessarily to have all of this stuff out of the gate, but eventually it would help the replayabiltiy a lot to have a point system, which could work in conjunction with other options, for example, you would get maximum points for using the ideal craft on a mission, and lesser points for using sub prime craft on an attack.  This would let players keep a game going in a pinch by sacrificing points.\n\n* No custom mission creator, and as such, no way to share custom missions with fellow players.  Once you've done all the campaigns, you're only option is to replay them and try to get 5 stars across the board.\n\n* Another thing, that isn't really an 'issue' per se, but just something that could be improved, is that the other 2 viewing modes are impossible to use when the action is heavy, which is much of the time.  During a typical fast paced game, you have to be in deck view, and you miss out on take offs and landings.  The only real solution here is multi monitor support, but there doesn't seem to be any talk from the dev about that.    This is somewhat trivial, but it would be nice to have.\n\nSo, that's the jist of it.  For many, it's worth the $10 even with these issues, but for me and some others, we have kind of burned out due to the issues and lack of replayability.", "recommendationid": "34477371", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503653378, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 454, "last_played": 1506744253, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198003007834", "num_games_owned": 172, "playtime_forever": 11896}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511381"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1502085360, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is an awesome idea, and the gameplay is... ususally fun, and tense at times, with great graphics! But unfortunately, the UI issues and AI pathing issues plague this game nearly to the point of monitor-breaking frustration. The UI often simply doesn't respond to your hectic clicking, or will select the wrong option or aircraft. In other cases, the hitbox to select a certain aircraft or selection is ridiculously small. And the AI pathing is mind bogglingly bad, with two aircraft heading to places near each other simply not able to find a way around each other. Also, there is no queue system for your movement orders, so you cannot queue aircraft to do action x after completing y, or to move to spot a once the aircraft in that spot moves. Which leads me to one of my biggest frustrations: if an aircraft is rearming, and you give it a move order, it will CANCEL the rearming to move the aircraft immediately, meaning you have to start from scratch!\n\nFinally, go-around probability is waaaaaaaaay too high. I understand that if it was the same as real life, it might not happen in 50 or 60 hours of game time, but this is still kinda ridiculous! Aircraft go around practically every other landing, resulting in frustrating crashes with aircraft that would have been safe had the landing aircraft not gone around. I understand it's a gameplay mechanic, but it needs to be toned down a good bit.\n\nEDIT 8/17: Aircraft come back damaged waaaaay too often, which screws you over 9 times out of 10 because your only available heli to kill a sub came back damaged after one mission, and crashes on takeoff. Or even worse, your 4+1 Battleship missions get screwed over because You can't mix and match aircraft? Need 4 blue aircraft, and have two blue harriers and two f18s? Nope, sorry, absolutely impossible.\n\nTl;dr: I want to love this game, I had quite a few fun moments with it, but awful UI and AI issues make the game unreasonably hard due to it's own rather iffy design.", "recommendationid": "34075446", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503029536, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504233623, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198048903058", "num_games_owned": 410, "playtime_forever": 569}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506748"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502440728, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "There are really only two things i can complain about with this game.\n\n1.

In short, 'Carrier Deck' takes this concept and executes it incredibly well with little to criticize. The result is simple, fun, and immersive multi-layered gameplay.\n\nBased around a wave system, 'Carrier Deck' gives you command of a large variety of U.S. Navy combat aircraft, such as F-18s, E-2s, V-22s and many more, to combat a faceless enemy. Displayed on a series of bars at the bottom of the screen, enemy contacts will attempt to reach the carrier by sea, air, and land. In the event that something does reach your carrier it will cause damage and deplete a segment of your carrier\u2019s health pool. Once this pool is drained your carrier is destroyed. To avoid taking damage you must utilise your aircraft to pull back the fog of war which covers these bars by default (with the exception of the land bar) and then queue and launch air missions to destroy these threats. Each aircraft can be used in multiple roles and must be equipped for the right mission before it can be employed to execute said mission. In addition to this you must recover aircraft coming into land and make sure that your carrier deck does not become too crowded with aircraft crossing paths. If an aircraft lands and the previous aircraft has not yet been removed from the rear of the deck, then this can cause a collision which will also result in damage to your carrier. In addition to the actual flight deck you also have access to the hanger deck which can be used for aircraft storage when the flight deck is becoming a little crowded but its primary purpose serves as the area in which you repair damaged aircraft. When returning from sorties aircraft have a chance of being damaged, these aircraft can be sent out again but they will often crash upon return, potentially destroying other aircraft on the flight deck and so the best option is to repair them ASAP. This is done by transferring aircraft between decks with the use of the four elevators. This serves to add an extra layer to the gameplay and keep your mind frantically ticking over. In addition to this, during some game modes the carrier may also have to take on cargo, or additional aircraft, on top of the combat duties you are also attempting to perform. All of these elements come together to produce a multi-layered and immersive experience which will often leave you juggling several things at the same time and serve to add diversity to gameplay. If all of this sounds at all confusing though not to worry! 'Carrier Deck' features an informative tutorial on all elements of gameplay and once you start playing it will all become second nature.\n\n'Carrier Deck' features three modes to choose from; Campaign, Survival, and Quick Play. The campaign mode offers a series of mini campaigns which each consist of a small number of missions with scripted opponents, aircraft sets, and obstacles. However these campaigns can be anything but quick to complete if you are aiming for five stars of completion on each mission. This star rating system which accompanies the campaign missions is determined by the damage your carrier takes, with five stars indicating that your carrier suffered no damage. Attempting to achieve this took me around 30 hours in total with some missions offering significant enough challenge to have restarting them countless times. While these campaigns are displayed on a world map the location of each campaign is not of significance to the gameplay and does not serve to change the backdrop in any real way. Survival, as you can probably guess, sees you facing off against an endless wave of enemies with the objective of lasting as long as possible. This mode is available to play in three difficulties which scales the threats you will face. Lastly the quick play mode is somewhat similar to the survival mode in that is offers you the choice of three difficulties but the function of these difficulties differ. Essentially quick play is a random mode like survival but with a time limit, the difficulties decide the length of time your game will last with 10, 20, and 30 minutes being represented by each of the three difficulties.\n\nLike many other games from \u2018Every Single Soldier,\u2019 'Carrier Deck' is a game which is available on tablet/smart phone platforms as well as on PC. While this means that elements of the user interface (UI) are often larger than it may seem that they need to be on PC, they are not horribly large and are by no means too obtrusive in my opinion, however it would have been nice to see an option to scale the UI. Additionally the options for \u2018Carrier Deck\u2019 are rather sparse and though this is in part because it is a simple game, it would have been nice to see some more options for something like hotkeys for the PC version which would come in useful managing all there is to do aboard the USS Ronald Reagan. Another issue that this game has is that when aircraft meet on the deck on intersecting paths, the pathing of aircraft leaves much to be desired. These encounters often end in both of the aircraft turning around and returning to their points of origin. While this is something that can be resolved though stricter management of aircraft on the deck and an understanding of AI pathing, it is definitely something which could use some improvement. One final small criticism I would make is that the time of day, weather, and setting of the backdrop could have been manipulated more. While this is not an important aspect of the game the same plain ocean setting, for the most part in the clear bright day, feels like a missed opportunity and I think it would have been particularly interesting to have had missions set at night, or in a storm for example, as well as increasing the diversity of the games visuals, it could also be used as another mechanism to increase difficulty as aircraft on the flight deck could be harder to see or instance.\n\nIn summary 'Carrier Deck' is an interesting concept and a well-executed game which treads new ground both for the genre and the developer. Despite the few improvements I believe could be made to the game, 'Carrier Deck' remains a simple, multi-layered, unique, and enjoyable experience within the genre and even for the full price of \u00a36.99 (or your regional equivalent), 'Carrier Deck' is well worth the price for the time and enjoyment that can be had from it.", "recommendationid": "34265907", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502839306, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502836879, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198082944696", "num_games_owned": 143, "playtime_forever": 1929}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493733"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1503656324, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Very good game.
