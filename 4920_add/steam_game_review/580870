The devs weren't kidding in the trailer when they said the game has a \"vicious skill curve.\" This game is HARD.\n\nIf you're the kind of gamer that loves a challenge, pick this game up, you wont regret it.\n\nThis is the kind of platformer that takes both skill and precision to play, and the game isn't going to hold your hand AT ALL. \n\nBesides a bare-bones keybind guide, you're given little to no instruction on how to actually play. You just have to start playing and learn the hard way; Through trial-and-error. You have to learn how to wall-jump with megadrive. How to abuse slo-mo to bash drones and to aim jumps. How to get a giant speed boost by ramming yourself into the floor several times in quick succession.\n\nPrepare for a master-class in platforming. Prepare to miss jumps and scream \"FUUUUUHHHHHCCCCCKKK\" at the top of your lungs. Prepare to restart that level for the 100th time to get that ONE jump JUST right. I've been playing for 6 hours and only made it to level 6... Out of 33 levels.\n\nIt's what Super Meat Boy would be like if it were made in 3D.\n\nBut you know what? I keep coming back. There's something weirdly addictive about it. I'm DETERMINED to beat this game.\n\nWhat seems at first like an overly simple game mechanic - getting boost charges by colliding with things - turns out to be a surprisingly satisfying way to navigate.\n\nOnce you get comfortable, you'll find yourself banging your shiny metal body into surfaces in time with the beat and careening around recklessly, ricocheting from wall to floor to ceiling and making giant leaps of faith.\n\nThe levels are very cleverly designed. Each level adds some new wrinkle to the experience.\n\nAnd when you finally DO beat a level you've been working on, woooo boy that feels nice!\n\nOn top of it all, the game has BEAUTIFUL art. I constantly find myself enjoying the lighting and effects. It's got a crazy retro-neon vaporwave vibe that is very pleasing to look at. It also has a long soundtrack full of relaxing tracks to help calm you down when you get blasted off of a platform by a laser for the umpteenth time.\n\nI'm hooked!
