I am even familiar with OpenBOR. Most gmes that play like that, pretty much have a similar play style.\n\nThis game needs lot of work, but has a lot of potential. Gameplay itself needs a lot of fine tuning. Some of the problems I have ran into are...\n\n1.) Getting hit when there's no monster there\n2.) Collision detection is very off\n3.) When you get hit, you get pushed backwards a bit (This can be bad if monsters are behind you)\n4.) Boss battles take way too long (First boss battle took me close to 15 minutes to beat and 14 continues)\n5.) Some of the foreground objects force you to walk around more than normal\n6.) No jump button\n7.) F12 exits you out of the game, so it's not possible to take screen shots without changing the Steam default\n8.) Keys take a while to get used to as you can't change them around\n\nGraphics I do like as they are very horrific in style and the characters are pretty cool. Some of their moves take a while to get used to, as you are forced to use only the buttons as are set in the options. You can change some of the options around like the difficulty, lives, etc.\n\nOverall not a bad game, and you have unlimited continues, but the frustrations of ever playing a perfect game are very impossible. Price is not too bad for this game, and so it's not bad to have in your list. You will die and continue tons of times. Since there's no \"Middle\" or \"Mixed Reaction\" button, I am only saying \"Bad\" as you will have a lot ot work with when you buy this game.", "recommendationid": "29973014", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487287828, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487286673, "num_reviews": 38, "steamid": "76561198022104383", "num_games_owned": 619, "playtime_forever": 49}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520870"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487131117, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I've been playing this game for past an hour. Personally it's really fun, fighting through hordes of zombies with some pretty fun mechanics and weapons you'll find lying around.\n\nThe music as usual with Frank's other work (City of Rott, Dead Fury, and Shock Invasion) is well put together, it gets you pumped up as you play.\n\nThough some of my complaints is the collision and how the zombie touches, they'll barely touch you and you'll lose so many health. Sometimes when you use the gun it will not kill them, the bullets will just fly past them. Most importantly the control mechanic, I'm just not use to playing on keyboard, I was really hoping there was a control mechanic so I could play with my xbone controller.\n\nAll that being said, It's still a fun game regardless, I mean the game is 2.99 so it's a win win.\n\nI give this game a 7/10, it could be better but it's not bad.", "recommendationid": "29934398", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487131117, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503474543, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198361259186", "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 307}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505067"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487101847, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "While it is not a Streets of Rage and has some flaws It is a great game for a City of Rott fans.
