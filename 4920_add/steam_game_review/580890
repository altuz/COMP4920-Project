Online seemed smooth and the gameplay so far is a perfect mix of fair and \"What Why\". I will update this soon, but it's great for what i played. Glad there is a singleplayer wave mode too, great for a game like this. A great advancement from the itchio demo!\n\nUpdate: Have played more games, and I have stuff to say. A friend complained of input lag, but he was running intel integrated. Some levels have walls you can fire through, which is ridiculous. Some hitboxes are wonky (beartraps). Some bugs persist, notably an elevator bug. The high ground and instakills possible in some levels is a little silly. The dash that can daze you feels a bit op, with no way to counter, really. Internet play seems ok. It's still fun, and well made, so i still recommend it.\n\nUpdate 2: Note to Devs: Please, please, please refine the animations- the running animation looks all weird and so does the jump. It really looks not great.

It's fun to play for an hour or two at a time no problem. It may seem boring at the beginning, but like most other wave-based games, the waves get more difficult as you progress through them. And that's what keeps bringing me back. As I mentioned in my original review, it does get chaotic.\n\nIt's true that this game's local multiplayer is what shines. If you're looking for a local multiplayer game, then this is one I'd definitely recommend. If you want a game you can still play even once all your friends leave, then this game offers that. If you plan on never touching multiplayer mode, unless you enjoy facing wave after wave of enemies, this may not be your type of game.\n\n\nOriginal:\n\nI had a blast playing this game!\n\nIt's still new, so I understand the lack of online community. I'm hoping that changes, because multiplayer is a blast. I played local multiplayer at a local Toronto convention and even facing off against random people there was awesome! It didn't matter than I always kept losing. How can you not enjoy getting shot and then flopping around trying to annoy the person who shot you and stopping them from getting the win?\n\nIn terms of the single player, I enjoyed it. Yes, it is similar to most other games that have waves of enemies coming at you, but the projectile aiming gives it a different dimension. Maybe because my aim isn't great, but the sheer craziness of it all was great. Power-ups are very handy in the multiplayer arena, but they've still managed to include them in the single player to give it some variety.\n\nThis is definitely a game I'll continue to play. I can play offline multiplayer and single player, and as the community grows, I'll be playing more online.", "recommendationid": "35116384", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506192024, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 174, "last_played": 1506562913, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198027649252", "num_games_owned": 132, "playtime_forever": 174}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506009166, "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Really fun game if u wanna just sit there and play and have a laugh with your friends this is the game for you\n", "recommendationid": "35107750", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506009166, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 208, "last_played": 1506163470, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198204823204", "num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_forever": 208}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480897"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506042984, "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great game!
