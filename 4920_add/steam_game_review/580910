The game has about 4 mechanics that will take you about 5 minutes to get bored off. The game doesen't scale very well either and comes to a point where you'll get bored of waiting around to be able to buy one more point per click upgrade instead for it feeling rewarding. Needless to say, the game isn't fun enough, nor interesting enough to be worth the price it's being sold at.", "recommendationid": "35225974", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506445932, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 84, "last_played": 1506444911, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198108698562", "num_games_owned": 252, "playtime_forever": 84}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505075"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505161754, "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "gg, just add some achievements and it's done", "recommendationid": "34889784", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505161754, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505225807, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198118586051", "num_games_owned": 190, "playtime_forever": 49}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465859"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 5, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
