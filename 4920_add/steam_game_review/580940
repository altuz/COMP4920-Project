Also with the GoG version you get three games; Redneck rampage, Redneck suckin on grits on route 66, and Redneck rides again; it doesn't have Redneck huntin. The GoG version is also better value for money; for an extra 80 pence you will get the other two games as well, instead of \u00a36.99 for just one game on steam. Unfortunately with Redneck rides again a settings option hasn't been provide, when you first load up the game; you have to mess around with the dosbox keymapper; I had a look at the file dictionary and couldn't find the configuration file to change the controls.      \n\n\n\n\n\n[u]What I liked about the game[/u]\n[list]\n[*]\tLarge open levels, which are fun to shoot through. You will be fighing in the swamps, riding your motorbike on the race tracks and kicking ass in Elvises home.  \n\n[*]\tMany hidden secrets throughout the levels, which are hidden quite cleverly. \n\n[*]\tThis time round you can drive vehicles; like a chopper and a swamp boat, and it's not like theres only one level where you can drive a vehicle, driveable vehicles appear in quite a few levels. \n\n[*]\tNot as many pain in the arse dogs and alien vixens.\n\n[*]\tNew enemies and more enemy varietys. \n\n[*]\tThe protaganist has been given new lines.\n\n[*]\tStill the same awesome game play.\n\n[*]\tSome pretty cool film references.  \n\n[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u] \n\n[*]\tI wish they could of added more new weapons. I liked the sling blade, but I wasn't that keen on the chicken dynamite.\n\n[*]\tShame they couldn't have done a redux version of the game, with steam achievements. \n\n[*]\tYou have to do a lot of messing around with the dosbox keymapper,  if you want to customize the controls to your liking. Unfortunately, when you launch the game you can't select the settings like you could in redneck rampage, which means you can't customize the controls like you could in the previous game; you have to mess around with Dosbox keymapper.\n\n[*]\tWasn't keen on the final boss, it was just reused. \n\n[*]\tWould have been nice to have some new inventory items. \n\n[*]\tStill missing the music.\n\n[*]\tDuring the game you get to revist some locations, which to be honest I would of prefered not to. I  like to be in a new location in every level. \n[/list]\n[u]Conclusion[/u] \n\nI enjoyed the game. I thought the idea of adding vehicles was brilliant; it kept the game fresh. The level design this time round wasn't as good as the first game; but still pretty good. Don't buy this version, buy the gog version instead, because it has the soundtrack and it also comes with all three games, including suckin on grits which isn't available on steam. \n\n\n[h1]8/10 very good[/h1]", "recommendationid": "34462591", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503590287, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503097429, "num_reviews": 79, "steamid": "76561197987175590", "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_forever": 491}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499300"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 3}}
