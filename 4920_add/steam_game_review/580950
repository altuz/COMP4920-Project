There is a dark elf that once was a good guy and with gaining power he became the big bad guy, summoning forces of darkness. Some minor keystones of the stories are told by scrolls you find during your dungeon crawls. The gameplay consists most part of the game by pressing 1 and then spamming left click. Health potions are almost only filing inventory, since most enemies die in few spells so you only need mana potions. \n\n[b] Combat & Challenge : 2/10 [/b]\nThe combat is absolutely terrible. It feels clunky, slow and unresponsive. Most of the time as stated, you just spam the damage spells to kill enemies one by one. The only \"challenging\" fights are monster with high hp so you have to take multiple seconds spamming spells, then using mana potion and spamming spells again.\n\n[b] Graphic & Interface : 2/10 [/b]\nThe best details you will find in the game are some books in the shelves on some walls. Besides that you run through grey stones and look at brown doors. Not much more to say here.\n\n[b] Progress & Mini-Games : 3/10 [/b]\nIt is hard to tell in which level you are, how many levels left, when you get your next spells, etc. From time to time you encounter new enemy types that signify that you did some progress. Besides that there is no leveling or anything similar. The only \"mini-games\" are consisted of opening the doors with certain spell combinations.\n\n[b] Audio & Immersion : 3/10 [/b]\nThe music is some oldschool electro, which does not fit the game at all. The sound feedback is simple and not really worth talking about.\n\n[b] Side-Notes [/b]\n[list]\n[*]This game is single player only.\n[*]This game contains steam achievements.\n[*]This game offers none to minimal replayability. I dont see any reason why you would want to replay this game.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Summary [/b]\nArcane Maelstrom is a boring dungeon crawler with bad graphic, unfitting sound, zero immersion and absolutely cheap story. I would not recommend this game to anyone and feel it is absolutely overcharged with its quality.\n\nI hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game.
