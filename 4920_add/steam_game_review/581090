The price is ridiculous for what is available right now.  I've also researched more about what others have talked about with the developer asset flipping.\n\nI'm surprised people are giving this game such a negative review early on.  When you start the game, the main menu clearly states the single player is buggy, have a long loading time, and may crash.  I think the gun mechanics are great so far.  This is Early Access and obviously needs some work.  Some bugs I found aside from the single player that didn't work at all really for me are: hard to holster weapons/magazines, sometimes the gun needs to be cocked sometimes it doesn't, zombies have terrible AI as of now.\n\nI think this game has great promise as long as the developers keep working on it.  Multiplayer for this game would be amazing.
