It had a lot of spreadsheets and numbers, and very little visual information. This is much more of a game than that was, but in a way it suffers for that. The original was all about manipulating movement and building a very deep dungeon, with lots of strange mechanics; this is more of a tower defense. You still can build a dungeon, which is neat, but rather than the complicated free-play mode there's a campaign in which the starting dungeons are set up to challenge you. So it's more of a puzzle game or a tower defense than the strange dungeon MANAGER sim of the original, and I'm not sure I approve of that change... Still, it's a neat game, it's just different from the original. But if you're into dungeon keeper and stuff like that, then you'll probably dig it!", "recommendationid": "29986372", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487344928, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487345165, "num_reviews": 344, "steamid": "76561198015075204", "num_games_owned": 1358, "playtime_forever": 19}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450293"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1488740353, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I absolutely love this game.
