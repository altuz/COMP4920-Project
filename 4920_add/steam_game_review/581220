The news industry is a fascinating concept to explore, given then industry's social-engineering, black-propaganda and other aspects. News Tycoon gently touches on this this, with various entites offering incentives, often large cash payments, to spin articles in their favor. However, the game is very much in an incomplete and partly broken state, and it doesn't appear that the developers are very interested in correcting even the simplest flaws, despite their critical impact. As of the writing of this review, the last response to a bug report was in April of 2017. To make matters worse, they've been advised of and acknowledged easily remedied flaws, such as mispelling \"Korea\" as \"Corea,\" but they've yet to correct the problem. \n\nMajor flaws include such things as the player being unable to sort topics by relevance. The option to sort be relevance is available, but not all topics are displayed when doing so. In fact, only a very small percentage is. This means that as your staff grows, you can either micromanage everyone, choosing each topic for them, or you can allow them to choose their own topics, but the relevance will be random. This is comparable to India declaring war on China tomorrow, and newspapers printing articles on increasing electricity prices and the sale of a spoon manufacturer, but never an article on anything relevant to the war, or relevant to the reader at all. The \"relevance\" of your paper will plummet, as will your revenue and subscribers. The bugged relevance sorting is probably an easy fix, but the developers can't be bothered with correcting that bug, nor any other. \n\nWhile the relevance issue is a glaring flaw which forces the player to tediously micromanage their journalists, or suffer poor ratings and sales, a variety of smaller issues will also be immediately obvious. There's little variety in the subjects available. You'll be writing the same articles over and over again. You might be surprised how often America's president decides to fire the entire government on New Years Day, how often that same president resigns, or how often NASA announces a mission to Mars. There's also very few topics available in general. Whatever subject your journalists specializes in, they'll run out of subjects to report on often. There's an entire world of \"economics,\" \"politics\" and so forth taking place, but your staff is oblivious, and you'll have to invest massive sums of money, maxing-out your news organization's ability to discover news, just to ensure a single journalist in any subject will be aware of enough events to consistently have something to write about on their assigned subject, and even then he/she will still have to write about some other random topic fairly regularly. Apparently your journalists have never heard of the internet, and apparently the game's developers have never heard of newswires like Reuters or AFP. \n\nA game on this topic could be fascinating, and thus this game has potential. The developers are however investing no effort what-so-ever. News Tycoon looks dead. To make matters worse, the developers have disabled Steam Workshop, so even if the community wished to correct the game's problems, it can't be done in any practical fashion. Not that there is a community. Until the developers start developing again, if that day ever comes, and until, at a bare minimum, the developers correct the easy-to-fix autosearch/relevance bug, I don't recommend this game. As of this moment, News Tycoon appears to be abandoned, incomplete and broken.\n\nLastly, even if the developers begin developing again, and even if the relevance/autosearch bug is corrected, I can't recommend this game at any price greater than $4.99, especially considering Steam Workshop has been disabled. That limits the game's potential, and also suggests the developers intend to intentionally leave things out so that they can sell them to you later as DLC.", "recommendationid": "34448511", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503531880, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503491733, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198030701262", "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_forever": 513}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1500264051, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game has potential, but is unfinished and confusing in the beginning.
