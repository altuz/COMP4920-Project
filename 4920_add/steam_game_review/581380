The horror element of this game is on target, with a creepy atmosphere and a feeling of suspense.  The changing level design keeps things unpredictable, which adds to the element of surprise.  Graphics are great, and I like that this is on the Unreal engine.  Audio is well done and certainly adds to that layer of uneasiness. \n\nUnfortunately, the game does suffer from a few issues.  As far as bugs are concerned, it could use some polish.  In one specific room, a sliding chair pushed me into the world and I was stuck and unable to continue.  Which brings up another point: no saves.  Makes this very frustrating, especially when you have to reload due to no fault of your own.  The game also suffers from massive frame drops and stuttering from unknown causes.  Apart from that, the game is fun.  It's a really solid horror game, the developer just needs to tighten the bolts.\n\nAll in all, the negatives seem to be general release issues.  Nothing seriously wrong with the core game-play.  If the developer can push out some hot-fixes, this will be a very solid addition to the horror genre.  I will recommend.\n\n[H1]PROS[/h1]\n-Solid concept of the horror genre\n-Beautiful graphics \n-Great sound work\n-Good horror atmosphere\n-The beginning menu is unique and I like it a lot\n-Puzzle game-play is simplistic, but fun\n-Good price\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\n-Needs optimization, frames drop horribly and there's a lot of stuttering\n-No saves\n-General glitches (like getting stuck in the environment and having to restart)\n-Just needs some overall polish\n", "recommendationid": "31515233", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493769052, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493754093, "num_reviews": 76, "steamid": "76561197984712587", "num_games_owned": 168, "playtime_forever": 41}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502786"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1493673122, "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The developer has just added a patch that improves the perfromance, and also adds a sort of chapter selection to the game so you no longer have to play in one sitting. Full original review below.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hZbi0kYQ1dQ\n\nOkay so lets the bad out of the way first. Despite being built on the UDK engine I had some pretty choppy performance in game with lag spikes and hitching, but overall the perfomance was okay. Also the game is short with no saves, so you will need to complete it in a sitting. Oh and the less said about that menu screen the better. Finally controls are not rebindable.\n\nSo as to the game? Actually its half decent. The graphics are fairly good - if somewhat repetative with the same textures and gloomy area's. Both the puzzle and horror elements are fairly light. Most of the puzzle elements are a bit find the key, and the horror is more a decent creepy vibe and the odd jump scare - but it does not over use them. And the procedural generation does at least keep the layout interesting, and leads to have I been here before vibe. \n\nAudio is quite sparse but again is used pretty effectivly to build tension and atmosphere.\n\nSo if your in the mood for a game that veers to the more atmospheric creepy horror then for the money this a half decent offering, but not a must play by any means.", "recommendationid": "31495073", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493832030, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497150888, "num_reviews": 108, "steamid": "76561197989290281", "num_games_owned": 1203, "playtime_forever": 139}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487824"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1493943460, "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Here is a 15 min funny gameplay! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNWjc5BHo7w\n\nHope you guys enjoy it and find it helpful! \nPlease feel free to leave any comments!", "recommendationid": "31550228", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493943460, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493943453, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561197972060319", "num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_forever": 11}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460126"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_positive": 3}}
