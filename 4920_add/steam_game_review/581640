(You have to discover that changing a square four times takes it back to 1)\n- Full screen only, zero graphical or sound options\n- According to several people you can lose all progress if you select the first level in the level selection screen\n- Partial solutions are marked as correct if there's one square of difference\n- No response from the developer to reported bugs\n\nThe last point is what drive me towards not recommending this game.", "recommendationid": "33446732", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499743292, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499722082, "num_reviews": 39, "steamid": "76561198025559404", "num_games_owned": 1864, "playtime_forever": 127}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516005"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1503879072, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Cool puzzle game.
