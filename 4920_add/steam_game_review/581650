(You can choose her first name and she may have ended up with the awkward name of Donald Trump Lee in my play-through, but I digress.) Ms. Lee is taking a hike on a mountain with her friends when a landslide happens that knocks her unconscious. When she wakes up it is raining and she desperately looks for shelter when she comes across a beautiful mansion in the mountains. She heads for it and is given shelter by its residents, a trio of brothers about her age named Vonn, Vern, and Viktor. Ms. Lee tries to figure out what is going on, but also tries to get to know these young men better.\n\nThis game is a visual novel, a type of video game that is entirely story-driven. Much of the gameplay is reading through the story, though there are several decision points to make along the way that decide what route you will take along with different kinds of dialogue. In total, there are four different endings in this game.\n\nTo start with some aspects that I liked in this game, I would say that the art is good. The background art is really nice and clean. It works well in the game. The character sprites are a little more plain, though distinctive. I thought the music was only okay. It was a nice addition, but it was not long before it started to feel repetitive.\n\nI do have to admit, I was disappointed with the writing in the game. While it never really felt bad to me, it never felt good, either. The establishing premise of the game was quite interesting and I was curious to see where it would go, but it never went very far. The ending was somewhat interesting, even if it was a bit predictable. However, between the beginning and ending, there was not much going on. The relationship between Ms. Lee and the other characters felt forced and unnatural. Too much of it felt like a dopey romance plot without much depth. It is rather disappointing because the premise of the game has such great potential and the writers could have ran with it, but what is in the game was a deeply unsatisfying experience.\n\nOverall, this visual novel left me frustrated. While not terrible, the lack of a more in-depth story and characters in an otherwise interesting premise was a disappointment. This game is available for free and it might be worth a play if you really like visual novels.", "recommendationid": "29861995", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487125114, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486861227, "num_reviews": 39, "steamid": "76561198129411711", "num_games_owned": 19, "playtime_forever": 188}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514500"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485445343, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a really great otome game and it is definitely worth your time if you like VN(visual novel) games. Although I'm a guy, I find out this otome one is more enjoyable than other galgame i ever played. This game is developed by a female writer who devoted to otome games, so compare to male-creator this game is more elaborated and natural on interpersonal interaction, espacially on girl's side. After all a female is definitely better than male knowing how a girl would act, think, react, and this is what matter the most in a girl-as-protagonist harem game. The Relation-Shift is natural, the personality of boys and girl are vivid, the interactions are lifelike. No god-know-what interanl struggle that try to make deep but only bring confusion. No suddenly twist try to impress but only bring unnatural plot. Simple but elaborated, all 3 main route with each characters are worth exploring, and more important, it's free.\n\n\nThe developer - Ran, made other otome game if you interesting: https://ainoshiki.wordpress.com/", "recommendationid": "29503715", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486225186, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485394273, "num_reviews": 28, "steamid": "76561198041857532", "num_games_owned": 241, "playtime_forever": 562}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503546"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1486321629, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I am not good with wrods, especially when it comes to talking about literature, so I shall be keeping this short. \n\nThis is my first time reading through an Otome.
