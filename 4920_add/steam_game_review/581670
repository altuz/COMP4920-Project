Good to pass time.\nAlso this game is very cheap.\n\nHowever there are few things that i confused and i like to talk about : \n1. The purpose of jumping in this game.\n I felt that jumping make this game harder and you'll easily get damage from enemy.\n2. 5 Different map with no different or unique features make this game feel boring after playing for 20 minutes nonstop.\nNeed more variation of enemy skin not just the background type of traps, etc to be released asap.\n3.Customizeable Character or different character will be a good feature.\nCustomizeable character or Characters with a set of skills that only avaiable to specific character.\n\nMaybe you can also add gift for achieving specific achievement.\nIf you add the different character feature, you may make some character avaiable through certain achievement. \n\nBut hey, this game is just released, so i expect great feature to be released in the future.\n\nI rate 4.5/10", "recommendationid": "31629615", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499098597, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494426382, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198340171678", "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_forever": 15}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493538"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
