Sadly, the game suffers from lackluster setting, over-used orchestral sounds, worse than basic gunplay, and dull character models.  It is a shame really, the game had me nervous for the first ten minutes I played, when you first begin to suspect that a monster lurks somewhere I actually felt a chill down my spine, but any fears that I had were soon dismissed when I saw the beast.  Horribly animated and designed, it looked like an asset ripped straight from Killing Floor.\n\nThe real shame is that the game obviously has direction.  There is a plot Peace is trying to manifest in Whispers: Last Hope but it seems they are having hard time with the pacing.  One section I'm in a cafe cleaning up, the next I'm playing a point-n-click adventure game in a car, then suddenly I've crashed in a rundown shack in the middle of town for some reason.  The only way to understand the plot is to read the captions on the loading pages.\n\nIn short, Whispers: Last Hope is a far below average game with a far below average plot.  How can I recommend a game like this where there are so many better horror games, and some for less at that, that I CAN recommend?\nWLH is not worth it, even on sale.\nThank you for your time.\nWaffles\u00a9\n\nI did not make a video review, but I did make a gameplay of my first impressions.

It's a bunch of stock assets that someone has fudged together into a handful of bland rooms. The A.I gets stuck on every door and corner so there is very little to worry about as you leisurely clean a toilet, collect keys, open doors, and eventually sigh in relief as the game crashes and you get a refund.
