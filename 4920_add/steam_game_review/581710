This would still make the game difficult but not as hard.\n- Maybe add some more modes such as an \"arcade mode\" to see how long you can last\n- More music or something to tell us that we are close to winning\n- Some steam acheivements would make this game more rewarding \n\nI do like how they have Steam Trading Cards.\n\nOther than that the game is simple and could be better but, meh at the moment.
