This game was slightly entertaining in how poor the AI, voice acting and animations were. If you sneak up on an enemy they will magically be alerted to your presence by shooting and turning at the same time. The muzzle flash and bullets come from their face for a split second before they even raise their guns. Its easy to lure enemies into the edge of wall and finish them off with a pistol as they run at you relentlessly as if the wall didnt exist. The voice acting reminded me of the terminator how every enemy said the same thing when you were discovered and when I say discovered, i mean it loosely. The enemies stand still with zero idle animation and only notice you if you come close enough to them, or if you manage to sneak past them outside of their zone they will chase after you. \n\nAs far as combat goes, firing any weapon once will instantly change your aim so you actively have to drag your mouse downwards while firing in order to have a steady aim. Enemies will fire at you endlessly without the need to reload and their bullets seem to do more damage than yours do. I understand these enemies are wearing armor, but it shouldnt take 4-5 headshots from 3 ft away to kill some of them. I dont claim to be an expert at shooters, but im not terrible either, the difficulty is too high for there to be as few health packs as there are, or atleast the health packs should give more hp in order to deal with the enemies who never have to reload. \n\nI also enjoy stress testing the enviroments to see if i can find any hidden secret areas or flaws in level design that cause me to fall through the world, in this regard the game is pretty solid. I tried to clip up the mountains with no success due to invisable walls. However I was able to discover that if you climb high enough on the walls, you can actually travel along them without falling regardless of how steep the mountain is. This is how i discovered that the enemies are designed to trigger if you pass their area without killing them. \n\nOverall I was unable to complete the game in the 1 hour I played it for because I became too frustrated with checkpoints that would send you far back, and I also got stuck inside of a truck that had a random hole in the roof just because I was exploring. I do not recommend this game even at 50 cents because DOS games featured better mechanics as a FPS, and its a frustrating game with slight comedic value.", "recommendationid": "30776738", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1490637402, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490583496, "num_reviews": 17, "steamid": "76561198007706278", "num_games_owned": 247, "playtime_forever": 60}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511283"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1490462433, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Buy a product for 0.70 euros.
