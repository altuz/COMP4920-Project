I only played for about 10 minutes and came across ALL of the following issues:\n\n* Music volume WAY quieter than the sound effects with no way to change it\n* Framerate issues (I have a GTX 1070 card! How is that NOT enough?!)\n* Rather poor field of view (you can adjust it but not enough to feel right)\n* Cannot customize controls\n* No ammoless weapon; if you run out of ammo you're defenceless!\n* No actual ammo counter, just gems which change form as ammo is used up\n* No automap\n* Wide open maps without the design/charm of old Doom/Wolf3D maps\n* Crosshair is a lie; your shots always hit below the crosshair, not centred\n* Cannot adjust options mid-game; have to quit to change options\n* Cannot loop menu cursor past the top or bottom of the menu\n\nYeah, they're all minor issues... but there's SO many of them... and again, it only took 10 minutes to encounter ALL of these... x_x;", "recommendationid": "33817179", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501105516, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501100484, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198042140258", "num_games_owned": 181, "playtime_forever": 11}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502920"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1501747243, "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Quite possibly the most I have ever been disappointed by a game. Looks great, looks fun, and I still had fun with it for about five minutes, but unfortunately some bizarre design choices cripple the game to the point of making it unplayable. For starters, the horizontal sensitivity is too low, and the vertical sensitivity is too high. No way to change that. Controls are extremely sticky and cumbersome besides. Retro style is no excuse because the games that inspired this one are much smoother. There's also no way to tell how much ammo you have. There's no running, no jumping. It feels like a game made for a graphic calculator, only I paid money for this.
