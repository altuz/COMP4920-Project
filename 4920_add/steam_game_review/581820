Not a bad game aside from the fact that it made me puke. Minor spoilers have been blacked out.\n\nThis was a really tough one to get through because I am easily motion sick and there is no toggle for the head bob. I've said it in my other reviews and I'll say it again: Head Bob NEEDS to have a toggle!!\n\nMy other gripe is that one of the puzzles required me to [spoiler]search every single tile in a bathroom. Mousing over each tile slowly and carefully to painstakingly piece together a code.[/spoiler] It was terrible and only served to make me more nauseous.\n\nAside from those problems, the spooks were decent(until I noticed that all the audio was on loop) and the story was solid. I was a little confused by the ending but that's ok. [spoiler]Was I dead too? Did I adopt the little girl ghost? Was I the father all along?[/spoiler]\n\nAll in all, this is a semi-creepy game that would probably get a much better review from somebody who doesn't get sick as easily. I think the price is tiny bit steep for what I got. I would drop it down to $1.99.  :P", "recommendationid": "34016652", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501855965, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501854842, "num_reviews": 89, "steamid": "76561197997678124", "num_games_owned": 911, "playtime_forever": 70}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 16, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 13}}
