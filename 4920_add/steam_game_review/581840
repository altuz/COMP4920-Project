Read The Virgin Queen's \"New Description\" post instead.\nBut this is a great little puzzle game, once you figure out what you're supposed to be doing.\nGo into the yellow entrances, push and/or kick the various blocks around to collect the star and press the red button to get back out the portal doorway.\nOnce completed the doorway will turn green. Red doorways are locked.\nGreat game, nice graphics, very addictive.
