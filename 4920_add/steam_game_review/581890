The game has a few bugs (although at the time of writing this some have been fixed.) It has a unique indie game appeal to it. \n\nThe only notable thing I would say is that it's not very challenging. It is more like we are watching and interacting with an animated film or an interactive comic.

The music is really good but I guess this is down to preference, I personally like it. The voice acting is funny hearing a strong German accent(It is german right?) when the guy is from New York haha, but I don't mind, the fact the developer has even bothered with voice acting is great and shows effort.\n\nThe reason I'm giving this a thumbs down is because it's painfully buggy, it's buggy that it's not currently playable on my system. I have had to leave the game to reload it 4 times in only 15 mins of play. Sometimes a new game spawns me in a train station, sometimes in a fun fair, each time it's so full with bugs that I cannot advance.\n\nFor the developer:\nWhen my game loads up at the trainstation, if I press esc and then try to resume game, it will not resume game, the only option that will work is quit game.\n\nWhen I'm spawned at the fun fair and need to go the firing range, I go left it puts me on the pier. I tried again I went up to the simulation space ride thing, then left again with the arrow pointing (firing range) it puts me back at the pier.\n\nIf you need a beta tester give me a message/friend request, I'm a developer my self and want to support fellow indies.", "recommendationid": "29584367", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485779743, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486056475, "num_reviews": 67, "steamid": "76561198068703259", "num_games_owned": 310, "playtime_forever": 18}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502862"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485891977, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "it's ok for 2$ i guess.\nWaiting for the episode 2!", "recommendationid": "29612859", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485891977, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485957654, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198130116078", "num_games_owned": 132, "playtime_forever": 36}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500494"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487676844, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "great trash adventure! a few bugs, a lot of trash and all in all a great trash adventure! did i say trash? yeah trash but great! \u00b0_\u00b0", "recommendationid": "30076985", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487676844, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487676733, "num_reviews": 22, "steamid": "76561197998571119", "num_games_owned": 505, "playtime_forever": 27}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493470"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1495266753, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "HONESTLY I WISH I HAD A TIME MACHINE SO I COULD STOP MY PAST SELF FROM BUYING THIS GAME\n\ncons\nbad voice acting\nshort\nboring\nto expensive for 2 dollors\n\npros\nI do like the graphics look\nI mean I had a few lauhgs\n\nconclusion\nI mean if your looking for a game to play the drinking game with or something like that get it\nbut if your looking for a game (thats what I was looking for) DO NOT GET IT", "recommendationid": "31855360", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1495266753, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486851905, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198272106980", "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 26}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1485647713, "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Think of all those creepy dudes you see commenting on pornstars Instagram accounts.
