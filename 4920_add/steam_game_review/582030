Needs some polish still. Things like at the start it has an instruction screen. It's very blurry at first. I finally figured out if I leaned toward it, it would come into focus. Also did not realize it scrolled side to side with more pages at first. Also the game needs left handed setup. I am right handed, but I can see that a left handed person might have some trouble as the vender crystal is on the left side set up for a right handed person.", "recommendationid": "31341621", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493049650, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492921563, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198025415930", "num_games_owned": 692, "playtime_forever": 26}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504823"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
