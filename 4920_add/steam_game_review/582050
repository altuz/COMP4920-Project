Runs well on low end systems.\n+Four maps that are varied, with round based tanks, fliers and gun emplacements.\n+used wired XBox controller - no issues and control system works well.\n+It's a tank game!\n\nCons:\n- Unable to elevate the turret, so elevated enemies (ie: on platforms) are hard to target and hit.\n- AI isn't the smartest. Game currently lacks depth (although as EA this is to be expected)\n- Resolution doesn't appear the sharpest and text is hard to read. No in-game options to change graphics settings.\n- Basic audio effects. \n\nOpinion:\n   At the moment this is a fun VR tank game in a minimalist but effective 'Tron' style environment. In smaller maps the bot tanks will seek you out - in larger ones you can utilise the the radar to find them, which is a bit of a chore. Eliminate them, get some more to find. You earn money for upgrades by destroying enemies who'll also drop health/shield powerups. Your targeting system will lock on to enemies but it's occasionally frustratingly ineffective. In the present guise as a wave shooter this is fun for a short while but i couldn't help thinking what if... 'i could drop mines or use a cloaking device... what if instead of just wandering around the map trying to find random targets I was stalking through a cities defences - like the old 80's game Tau Ceti'. \n   Thankfully it sounds like the devs have big plans. I hope they deliver on planned missions and don't rely on multiplayer to add that spark - there still aren't enough VR players and not everyone lives in US or Europe. I'll be putting this aside until the next update and crossing my fingers.\n    \nRating 8/10", "recommendationid": "29415822", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485084645, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485060681, "num_reviews": 75, "steamid": "76561198002872077", "num_games_owned": 214, "playtime_forever": 71}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498712"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1484896328, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game has potetional!

Thanks for the responses who were trying to help.  Oddly enough before I saw those I was able to get everything to work.  I ran the Steam setup for VR and re-defined my play space, re-defined where ground was, and did nothing with the controller but all worked.  So I didn't take the given advice, in my case I guess I needed to run the Steam-based VR setup (and the controller issue was just an odd hiccup).\n\nSadly my overall recommendation of the game doesn't change, yet.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, very well done, but so far it's feeling like a game I will have played once or twice and never gone back to.
