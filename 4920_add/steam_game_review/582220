I really like whiteboards, and this is the program I've been looking for since I've bought my Vive headset. Very simple and beautiful interface. Also drawing with the down side of a controller is very convinient. \nGreat app and it does what it should do, but I would recommend to add some more instruments like straight line - it will make drawing much easier in some cases. \nThis app is great by itself, and it has much potential. I would recommend it to everyone who has HTC Vive and needs much space to write and draw on!", "recommendationid": "31138197", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492185568, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502793071, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198315862606", "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 284}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511962"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492944278, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Really simple, but quite useful functionality, I like this for planning and coming up with ideas etc. So far though I've had a number of crashes which is quite frustrating (especially as it erases some progress... not ideal in an idea area). \n\nPros:\n\n- Does exactly what it says, an infinite area with near-infinite white boards (haven't tested how many I can have yet)\n- Tons of space!\n- Doesn't feel disorienting / nausea inducing.\n- Pen/Eraser combo works nicely\n- Like the ability to leave tooltips in the space (Can leave colour-picker, background editor in the space while you use other tools)\n- Teleporter shows where you are standing in the space, allows you to position yourself easily without triggering the Vive's virtual walls\n\nCons: \n\n- only one size of marker, would really love to see adjustable sizes of marker and eraser (it's really difficult to colour in a large area with a tiny marker... and it's hard to see some things from far away so would like to be able to use a bigger marker for headings etc.)\n- Limit on the size of boards (yeah you can stack many of them together but sometimes you just want a giant board)\n- Press-controls don't ramp up with time, makes expanding/contracting things quite slow\n- It keeps crashing...\n\n", "recommendationid": "31317059", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492944278, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493638499, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198023202622", "num_games_owned": 293, "playtime_forever": 176}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509585"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1493109733, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "just a simple whiteboard in your VR headset.\n\ndoes perfectly what it says, although there are some caveats.\n\n- hard to actually write down stuff legibly with the vive controller (some kind of haptic feedback if the pen is touching the whiteboard would really help.)\n- needs to have more functionality to it, e.g. being able to access your desktop or even calculators, so that you do not actually have to go out of VR all the time for the basic stuff.\n\nits not a must have purchase for me, recommend skipping it unless you have cash to burn.", "recommendationid": "31353331", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493109733, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495613565, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198005300201", "num_games_owned": 277, "playtime_forever": 86}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497760"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1492894603, "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Usually, all games under VR tag have some kind of whiteboarding ability, this software only have whiteboards.\n\nAnd by \"only\" i mean, it does not even have a floor.
