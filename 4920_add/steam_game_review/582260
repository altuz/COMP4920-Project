This is an awful port.  They've gone for the self-fulfilling prophecy of releasing garbage, and then using the low sales to defend not making a new game.\n\nTerrible compatability and optimization.  As you can see in other reviews, people with solid computers have serious issues with framerates et al.\n\nIt's a console port, and it doesn't have controller support.  Console game.  No controller.  Boggles the mind.\n\nNo splitscreen.  So no getting friends interested in it.  No challenge in beating the AI.\n\nPlethora of other technical issues; for instance:  not only does it require a keyboard and mouse, but you also need very specific hardware.  It won't work with wireless keyboards, for instance -- you have to be plugged in.  The resolution is buggy and may stretch off the screen.  Etc.\n\nThrowback continues to be a company that sits on valuable assets, and does little with them other than to push things like iOS \"stickers\".  After this release, I can see why.", "recommendationid": "31533298", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493857460, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493859227, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197997144901", "num_games_owned": 167, "playtime_forever": 31}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523753"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1497187258, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a game that requires patience in learning its quirks, the sometimes wonky bike physics and controls, but rewards you immensely if you persevere. And this is coming from someone who plays using a keyboard and is fundamentally bad at racing games.\n\nThere are a few bugs here and there (nothing game-breaking: just don't decline a save when you're offered one, or the game might stop offering), and I should elaborate on the wonkiness. The bikes are very fond of turning sideways or even backwards upon collision with a badly shaped wall or other bikes. Sometimes you might grind along a wall no problem, and sometimes you might snag on something and get turned around. The controls for left and right like reversing themselves at this point, as well as the gas pedal just kinda breaking, but you learn to deal with this very quickly (hint: it's good to let go of all buttons briefly and then try moving again).\n\nNow for the overwhelming good part and why I heartily recommend this game. Unless you hate trial and error, learning the tracks, the quirks of the bike, the times to use nitro and various weapons, and eventually pulling it all off is IMMENSELY satisfying. I know the comparison is very tired now, but I would compare the feeling to the times in the Souls games after a big victory. And it's not even that hard to learn.\n\nThe tracks are diverse and interesting, most of them futuristic and gloomy, but a few hopeful and bright. It's cartoony, but carries the mood perfectly. You'll visit industrial complexes, jungles, underwater bases, snowy mountains, utopian-looking cities and abandoned and overgrown ones. The general theme holds up through the entire game but nearly every track is unique and interesting (though I would love it if someone explained to me what the final track - Eschaton - is meant to be. Some type of supervillain base on a hell planet maybe?).\n\nA great thing about the tracks is that they are much crazier than you'd typically expect from a racing game. They twist in all directions and go upside-down and vertical on a whim, and it's pretty breathtaking to experience at this game's high speeds. And when you go so fast that the music gets silent and you only hear the rushing wind as gusts of wing-shaped air rush past your bike? The sense of speed is fantastic.\n\nThe music is phenomenal. My pick for the definitive version of the soundtrack to use - and you do get choices here - would be the original EX-G2 PC soundtrack. It's the most complete one at the moment, and features the best versions of most of the tracks in the game, fitting for the environments and creating a simply unparallelled mood as you race. (The music is of the Drum'n'Bass genre, I'm told).\n\nThe visuals... well, it's n64-level visuals. You'll have to look past lowres textures, some missing polygons here and there, pop-in and such, but stylistically and artistically I would not hesitate to say it's beautiful. If you can handle old graphics, you'll definitely enjoy the variety of environments in this game, each with a lot of character and soul.\n\nOverall, take my opinion on the gameplay with a grain of salt - my experience with racing games is pretty much limited to this and a few versions of Mario Kart - but trust me on the presentation and content of this game. If you're into games like this, don't miss it.

But guess what! I don't know how they did it but you can even play music from the entire series in this game! AMAZING now I can play Extreme G 2 with the awesome sound track of XGRA! Best of both worlds!. The game runs flawlessly for me being faster and more intense than the N64 and the buggy pc port! with awesome framerates and faster than ever! Now I no longer have to worry about going into specific levels knowing they are a FPS killer like the original N64 version. I use to play it through 1964 Ultrafast! but now I no longer have to because it runs so much better the sounds are so much better and I can pick whatever soundtrack from the series I wanna listen to before I launch the game. \n\nThe only thing that needs to be added is the ability to shuffle every song while playing from the entire series! Amazing game thank you so much I never thought I would exist in the same universe where my childhood from a company that no longer exists would actually exist on steam!\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=943241927", "recommendationid": "32299869", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1497036681, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505894546, "num_reviews": 16, "steamid": "76561198074569591", "num_games_owned": 163, "playtime_forever": 618}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500618"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1493829396, "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Another classic racing game by Throwback and Acclaim.\nThe racing is fast paced and intense, the weapons are really fun to use and the and OST is absolutely amazing.\nI can absolutely recommend this game especially to fans of Racing games or Classic 90's games.", "recommendationid": "31527197", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493829396, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494615169, "num_reviews": 18, "steamid": "76561198117953718", "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_forever": 72}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496065"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1493812745, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I personally love this game the most out of all the extream G games i have played.\ni have seen some reports of issues but i have not faced any my self (mind you i am playing without audio at this time)\n\na solid buy but understand this game has some physics quorks after you get over them the game is fun and plays quite well on p.c. \n\n", "recommendationid": "31522729", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493812745, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498254291, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197980129314", "num_games_owned": 466, "playtime_forever": 810}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492891"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 8, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 10, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 8}}
