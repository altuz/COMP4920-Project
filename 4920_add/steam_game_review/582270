Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest \u2013 whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories \u2013 comes afterwards. These are games; one must first answer. And if it is true, as Nietzsche claims, that a philosopher, to deserve our respect, must preach by example, you can appreciate the importance of that reply, for it will precede the definitive act. These are facts the heart can feel; yet they call for careful study before they become clear to the intellect.
