Consisting of 5 maps that feel like the love baby of a childs time whilst playing Garys Mod. This game has nothing to offer. \n\nThe developer has shoved in several key hunts, whilst an audio book from Don Quixote plays. Nothing in the game makes sense and not in a surreal way.

But there is many of things that need to be fixed. For example:\n1. To many empty spaces. (Game has rooms with nothing in it, just walls and some mist)\n2. Planty of bugs and messed up textures. (especially hate messed up font)\n3. Game doesnt have a control manual, so I accidentally quit the game all over again and redo all my progress. \n4. Save button doesnt save game, like seriously :D\n5. Sometimes sounds are too loud and its uncontrollably.\n\nOkay, now move to the good part.\n1. Really nice and catchy music. (I want soundtrack from this game if its original)\n2. When rooms are actually filled with something, it looks pretty good.\n3. Although it was confusing and sometimes silly, I got scared twice or more. :D\n\nSo, thats all, I hope this game gonna be a lot better with time and I will come back and play it again.", "recommendationid": "29812013", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486688911, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486635244, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198073520043", "num_games_owned": 210, "playtime_forever": 171}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486523"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1486740244, "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is the most confusing one i've ever played, you spawn garlics on right click and make explosions on left click.
