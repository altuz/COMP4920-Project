You steal this amulet that gets permanently attached to you which allows you to change into a werewolf using moonlight.

You have certain abilities and restrictions in wolf form such as moving objects which you can't do when in human form. But in human form, you can use terminals and move through water which you can't do in wolf form. The shape shifting element plus the different puzzle rules for each character really makes for a great mental workout.\n\nOn top of the great puzzles they throw in a cool story and a few side missions to keep things interesting. Some of the later missions seem to end up being fetch quests, but they weren't excruciatingly painful to deal with.\n\nThe game is really well balanced and has a decent coat of polish on it. It has great music too and offers a lot of attention to detail. Puzzle lovers can't go wrong here. Check it out."}]}
