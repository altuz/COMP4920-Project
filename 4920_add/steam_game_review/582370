You need to collect 4 carrots, you manage to collect 3,  BUT suddenly the ground shakes & opens up beneath you, then BAM you fall to the bottom of a pit. Your only chance is to find your way back out the pit alive. You only get 99 life chances to do this GOODLUCK :D\n\nThe only weapon I managed to obtain & find was a puppy to spit out at enemys, they are not continuous. I only got 1 when I last played. You mostly have to avoid enemys & obstacle's, & find a save way around, you do have your paw to wack enemys with which does help a little. Did I say SAFE, well good luck with that ! You will die ALOT & I mean ALOT Unless you are a Hardcore platformer, which I am not.\n\nThere are save points if you make it to them, WARNING if you die, you just get droped by a crow down the pit again, so try guide yourself back to the last save point if you can. Otherwise its start again at the bottom, watch out for the nasty spikes, they hurt :)\n\nOK Im at a side ways thumb here with this game, so I gonna downvote it because its just to Hardcore for the average gamer, & I can see people getting very annoyed and raged by a platformer like this one.\n\nIf you are curious & think its a game you may enjoy OR would like to try, sure buy it when its on sale for a good discounted % off price OR wait for it to get bundled 1 day instead. :)\n\nI found the game quite frustrating, I may go back and try again 1 day, BUT I dont like my chances of making out the pit to safety, its just to difficult for me Im afraid.", "recommendationid": "31853016", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1495493041, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "7", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495358088, "num_reviews": 98, "steamid": "76561198079335824", "num_games_owned": 4216, "playtime_forever": 414}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525981"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1494728123, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you are reading this, you have found one of the hidden gems of the internet, so congratulations. Do not alarm yourself by the fact that I have only one game in my library, it's a long story but I have had other gaming experiences in the past. This one is frankly remarkable.\n\nI will evaluate multiple aspects of this game based on what I think, and you can make your general opinion based on that.\n\n[h1] Difficulty [/h1]\n\nThe game advertises itself as being very hard, let me tell you that [b]  IT'S NOT LYING\t[/b].\nThis is really not for everyone. If you look at the achievements list, you will see that only 3 players have beat the game completely out of 250 people. (At the moment I'm writing this). If you look for YouTube playthroughs, there aren't many indepth gameplay videos. This game likes to throw away hours of hard work on a single miscalculation and then to rub it in your face. If you're looking for just something you will try \"just for fun\", then this is not the game for you.\n\n\nYou don't need to be super good in gaming, you just need serious dedication.\n\n\n[h1] Gameplay\t[/h1]\n\n\nOverall, the game mechanics are really creative and interesting. You have two health points between life and death, and you lose everything on a simple mistake. The game rewards you for not dying by allowing you to take shortcuts. (Monkey and Crab statues). You can use various animals as distractions, ranged weaponry, death protection and more. Each one has a different effect. The game is heavily based on exploration, there are a lot of secrets and hidden shortcuts requiring specific animals.\n\nSomething I loved about the game is that you often have two ways to go, left and right, each one with different enemies and patterns. Pick the least annoying paths.\n\nYou will find yourself going through diverse areas with special traits such as [spoiler] a deadly fortress filled with traps, a space stage with low gravity and the Devil's lair. [/spoiler] Of course, if you rage quit early you'll never see any of this.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nAs the title suggests, everything here is hand drawn in a style you can judge by looking at the screenshots. I personally like it but it's really up to you.\n\nEverytime you die, a short gruesome death animation will occur. The most disgusting ones in my opinion are [spoiler] the \"mind control owls\", the chainsaws and the spike traps.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Performance [/h1]\n\nI had no FPS issues on a regular work laptop. You might experience some lag with older computers but everything seems to be fine.\n\nI used a keyboard, which is quite responsive. Some said the controller controls are a bit off, but I think that's been fixed in 1.1.5.\n\n[h1] Atmosphere and Music[/h1]\n\nYou play as a powerless rabbit in Hell. Enough said.\n\nNot much to the story, you [spoiler]ate a cursed corn cob in the beginning of the game[/spoiler] and find yourself inside The Pit.\n\nI liked how there's almost no text to read in the game besides item tooltips and tutorial signs. Everything is well written, I've noticed only one typo in the whole game [i] (If you catch them unawares)\t[/i].\n\nThe music is very good. Most tracks are not something you'd listen out of the game, but they set the mood very well. However, 5 tracks are amazing and are definitly worth the 5$. Listen to the trailer to get a feel for it. The last track in the video is actually the [spoiler] boss theme. [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Conclusion and Final Grade[/h1]\n\nOverall I loved this game. I will keep playing it to achieve the  [spoiler] 'good ending', but the bad ending is still a very hard challenge.  EDIT: After some messing around with the karma system, I managed to reach the \"good ending\" and to complete a hidden challenge (Do No Harm) without even knowing it. Still need to do the rest of the achievements though...[/spoiler]\n\nBefore you buy this, make sure you don't have any other uncompleted games waiting, as you will never beat Snowflake if you get distracted.\n\nIt made me rage and scream a bit even though I'm not that kind of guy, so congratulations.\n\nMy final score is a 9/10. It's extremely unforgiving and seems like the game was never playtested when you start, but when you get the hang of it it's really fun to see so much progress  being made. I probably [strike] squandered [/strike] used carefully over 1000 chances/lives, but it's worth it in the end, trust me.\n\nShould you buy this game to prove your determination and your willpower to finish it?\nIt's your choice, but if that sounds like your kind of game, go ahead. I think you should.\n\nI definitly recommend you look at some YouTube videos first. BubbleKnight has finished most of the game, which can help you get the hang of it.\n\nGood luck...", "recommendationid": "31737599", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1495936823, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496582590, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198375349768", "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 1935}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508613"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_positive": 5}}
