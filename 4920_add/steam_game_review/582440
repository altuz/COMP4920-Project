Extremely low quality textures, cheesy sounds, and lighting that made me want to punch my monitor made this game an absolute chore. Many areas, I couldn't even see anything at all. Which is exactly what you want in a video game.... Utter blackness.\n\nNot scary, not well done, and not a quality product in any way, shape, or form, Nine left me wishing I had lobotomized myself as opposed to actually suffering through the game even as far as I did. It is an insult to charge any money at all for a game such as this.\n\n2/10.
