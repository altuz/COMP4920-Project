Which is perfectly fine. There is simply something enjoyable in having to exchange information with a friend in order to solve puzzles, no matter how easy or basic in their conception these puzzles may end up being. It's also entertaining to listen to a friend freaking out over seeing something mildly creepy, while all you're doing is patiently pressing levers in a completely different room with no idea what you're doing or what it is they're freaking out about.\n\nThere were still some kinks the game hadn't ironed out yet at the time of writing. Most important ones: The ingame chat didn't work (we used steam chat to play instead) and I got stuck in location at some point, having to wait till I died to be able to restart the puzzle. And frankly it's not a particularly pretty game, in fact it feels like your standard unity game in a rather obvious way. But it does have some creepy moments here and there, and there is a segment in a frozen yard that was equal parts annoying and nicely immersive. I also laughed maniacly at the ending, for reasons I will not spoil for you. \n\nAll in all, it's just plain ol' good fun, and the rough edges are forgiveable for a free game. So if you're still waiting for [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/341800]Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes[/url] to get a deeper discount, this game should help scratch a similar itch for free. Just find a buddy to play with, and make sure to set aside those 1-2 hours, because despite having checkpoints to allow for toilet breaks and drink refills, there is no real save system. \n\nLooking forward to more from these devs.", "recommendationid": "29810130", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487211559, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486418963, "num_reviews": 77, "steamid": "76561198058687420", "num_games_owned": 611, "playtime_forever": 118}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566711"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 36, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487807075, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I really like this game.

I played through the game twice with my friend, (Once as explorer, once as librarian) and I have to say, it did not dissapoint. It is a breath of fresh air from conventional horror games, and although the visuals aren't all that scary, the puzzle element adds an extra layer on tension into the gameplay. Almost all of the game takes place in a dark, dingy castle, however, if you do decide to play this game, take time to stop and admire the art style (Just pick your moments wisely). I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game and will admit I got a little emotional at the end. This game definitely deserves a sequel or something similiar, maybe some DLC's. Even though the game is free, I would be more than happy to pay for it. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes the suspense or thrill of horror games, yet enjoys working alongside others to solve puzzles.
