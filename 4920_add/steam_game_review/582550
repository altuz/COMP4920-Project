Would be nice if there were more colours or you could mix them.  Also more effects although you unlock a few.\n\nOverall its a depressingly realistic simulator (to make it as an artist you will have to deal with the rich and pompous) with a lovely touch of humor. My younger brother also loves it and its nice to take turns painting with him.

Not bad, but better than others. \n-The art for the game, while not ground-breaking or gorgeous, is creative and cute. \n-I love the sarcasm in this game. For example, the lowest graphics setting is \"potato.\"\n-Benjamin.\n-I love how the story is played out like a stage play.\n-The fact LavenderTowne played this.\n\nCons:\n-Act II.\n-It's very hard to get people to buy your art sometimes. WHY DON'T YOU ACCEPT THE COLOUR PINK?!?!?\n-The game does get boring and repetitive after a while.\n\nOverall, for those art nerds and people who generally enjoy art, I recommend this!
