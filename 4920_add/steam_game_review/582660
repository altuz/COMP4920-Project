Maybe even too much; however, the end game system revolves around blowing up all your gear for a small chance that one item might upgrade. This is pretty much designed to prolong the game's life. It's simply horrible and extremely unfun. I don't mind the challenge, but the entire process is seriously awful. You have to build \"fail stacks\" on trash items to increase the chances of the item you actually want to upgrade. Problem is, the trash items will frequently upgrade and you will have to throw them on an alt character with negative karma, have them die 10-20 times to guards for a chance that the item might downgrade. This is all done just so you can repeat the entire process all over. By the way, each fail also costs you millions and your items downgrade and have to be enhanced all over. To be honest, no one in this game thinks enhancing is fine whatsoever. I just blew up all my gear going for TET (+19), and I don't really feel that it's worth it to continue anymore. I play games for fun and this system is not fun whatsoever.\n\nIn addition, the NA/EU versions are completely out of the loop. Take Valencia for example, this is supposed to be a viable end game grind region with multiple good spots, and for Korea, it absolutely is. Korea has daily loot scrolls they're given for logging in, which increase drop rate of items significantly. For NA/EU, we don't have the loot scrolls. Why? No reason, we just don't. Thus, the only good grind spot in Valencia is Pila Ku. This means that pretty much from level 51+ you'll be fighting for a spot at Sausans or Pirates. Fun times.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential, but the disconnect between the developers and NA/EU publisher is just too much, and there are no signs of it being fixed. There are tons of other things wrong with the game like artisan memories (huge P2W) and the karma system for pvp. By the way, the base price of the game is deceiving because pets are required and eventually you will want more weight upgrades, maids, and possibly processing outfit, etc. \n\nThis game tries to squeeze money out of you at every turn.

Nice graphics. Nice world. A very original blend of management and action. Features rich.\n\nBAD:\nThey all blow those good things for the decision to force the player to extreme, daily, AFK intensive, not fun, not rewarding grind.\nAnd this seems to be done for a simple strategy in mind: annoy the player until he pay money for in game items to ease the suffering... \n\nSo what you have to expect is:\n\n-Long AFK \"play\" is require. So keeping the game in system tray while processing.\n\n-\"Events & Reward\" generally are about being online 5-6h a day at least, daily attendance, repeat every day few fetch/produce/kill quest.\n\n-Pay for in game items. The game is absolute hell if you do not pay. In particular, small inventory, overweight, unnecessary travel for to perform small chores, manual looting of the hundred mob/hour you kill... will drag down the play experience.\n\n-Absolutely uncalibrated grow. Rushed early level advancement, and grind hell after liv 56.\n\n-Uncalibrated PvE. Let's clear this. You are not rewarded to go to challenging  zones. This game is made to kill armies of mob, very fast. And it's fun for a while. However this means that you need to go in zones where you outgear and outlevel the enemy, and stick to those areas killing the same mobs for hours, days months. Otherwise, it become exponentially longer to advance, in a super grind game not a wise decision.\n\n-PvP... is fun only when you duel someone of you same level/gear-level. In those rare occasion is rewarding challenging and require skill. But is a rare condition being extremely gear based in the extreme majority of case you outgear or be outgeared making the fight too easy and not rewarding for the stronger, and annoyingly hopeless for the weaker.\n \n-Weak and butchered story. Story is fragmented. Mostly because accelerating the grow in early level. You will solo kill in 2 hit \"cooperative Bosses\". You will encounter block and jumps in the story... as part of the story was cut off, put as optional, moved to a later part of the game... the narration as result is a complete mess. So basically the main story  and 1-50 level growth is a long tutorial.  \n\n-RNG. Everything is random. That it makes sense or not. This give a \u201cslot machine\u201d feel to all the game. Luck worth more than skill.\nLoot? RNG, ok. Even if a bit exaggerated. You can get in few kill what other grind for month to get if you are luky.\nGear Enchanting? RNG, with damaging/destroying resources, so be prepared to blow month of grind worth of material in a try to upgrade something .\nBut they extend this to things that don\u2019t make any sense. For example in the desert you get A debuf that require to drink water. Nice. But is RNG. So sometime you can travel in the desert for 30minutes without getting the debuf\u2026 and sometime you can get it every 30 seconds. For my travel route in the desert, 20 minutes on cammel I drink from 0 to 30 water bottles. -_- \n", "recommendationid": "35286936", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506675587, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": "20", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1294, "last_played": 1506546597, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198005428262", "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_forever": 80681}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668977"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 226, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1505062408, "votes_down": 69, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1505155445, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Hey, I've played this game for 250-300 hours, and I've come to the conclusions that this game is really bad. Like really, really bad. I'll try to keep the review simple to the best of my ability, whilst still giving the reader and good understanding of the negatives of the game.\n\nGetting from level 1-56 is an easy thing to do, there's not a lot of complex leveling requirements, but past level 56 it gets substantially harder, and takes much longer. for example, playing on a \"returning player\" server (+200% xp), as well as using xp scrolls, (around a total of 250% xp), for an hour of same level grinding with okay-good gear, only gives you about 3-5% of the entire xp bar on each level past 56, it also goes down after each level, so once you get to 58-59, you will only get about 0.5-1% xp per hour of grinding. The game is really grind heavy at higher levels, which is a big negative for me.\n\n\nPay to Win, but still a chance you can get bent over by RNG!\n\nRNG IS ANNOYING * The game is very RNG, all the time. If you want to upgrade your armor/weapons it requires black stones (there are 2 types of stones armor/weapon stones). upgrading accessories requires another accessory of the same type. The upgrade itself is not guaranteed at all, it is a chance to proc an upgrade. When you fail, the durability of the item goes down by 10 (total of 100 dura on each item). You can repair the durability, but you need a blacksmith NPC and another item of the same type to repair 10 dura each repair. \n\nUpgrading Items Sucks * Since the upgrading process for items is RNG, there's a function in the game called \"failstacking\", where you take another piece of armor, or a weapon and keep failing to upgrade it so you can boost the chance of upgrading another item. The problem with this is when you are trying to failstack on another item, to upgrade your equipped item, you have a chance of proccing on the failstack item, which removes all of your \"failstacks\". You have to use black stones to failstack, which gets really expensive.\n\nItem Levels are fine, but the upgrade process sucks * weapons and armor have 20 max levels, 1-15 are the regular levels, and 16-20 are the higher levels. for 1-15 you use regular black stones, which already costs a significant amount of money in the first place because the market system is messed up (i'll explain later). levels 16-20 costs even more than 1-15 because you need \"special\" black stones, called Sharpened Weapon Stones, and Hardened Armor Stones. These stones cost 3-4 times as much as regular stones, and the chance that you can \"snipe\" them off the market, is next to nothing, because the market system is sucky, and there could be a chance that people use market bots to snipe items.\n\nMarket system Sucks * The market system in the game works by a bidding system, but the bidding system is complete RNG. When you want to buy an item, the lowest priced items have to be bid on, you can't buy anything that's listed if there's already a lower price item listed, so you can't skip the bidding process. When you bid, each person that bids is given a chance to win the bid, There could be 10 people bidding, or 100 people bidding on the same item. once a person wins the bid, they can buy the item. There is a pre-order function where you list the amount ur willing to buy, and the price for each item your willing to buy, but if somebody has a higher preorder than you, they get the item first (it's competitive) although it's not guaranteed at all, you don't get a guaranteed item if you have the highest preorder, items still have a large chance to go to the bid.\n\nItems in Market are price fixed * The developer of the game price fixes items in the game, giving them a max price and a min price, many of the popular items are fixed to have a minmax that is the same value, such as a weapon black stone's price is min 300,000, and max 300,000. This means that items that should be much lower in value on the market, are inflated by the developers so they can have more control over the game's markets.\n\nGrinding for Black Stones is Hell on earth * The chance of black stones dropping from enemy mobs is really low, about 1-5% chance on most mobs. This means the most black stones you can get in a day is really low as well. You would think there would be a bunch of quests that you can get black stones from daily, which is wrong. Most daily quests do not give you black stones. the only quests that give you black stones are the quests in which you recieve tokens called \"seals\", I did a few of them, and then they stopped popping up, and i couldn't complete any more of them. So you only have a certain amount of black stones you can get in the first place. Eventually the most reliable way of getting black stones is purchasing them through the market. Which really sucks because they cost significantly more than they should, because getting them is hard af. and they are price fixed.\n\nBlack stones are rare, and you need a bunch to upgrade armor, but it's not a guarantee because of RNG, so you could waste more than 50 black stones just to get enough failstacks to upgrade a weapon from +17 to +18. easily, getting a weapon or armor to +20 will require over 1000 black stones, it's extreme RNG just to upgrade your gear so you can fight mobs and not die all the time.\n\nWays to downgrade items so u can keep failstacking on them * the only way i know of to donwgrade an item so you can resume failstacking, is you have to create and alt, below level 10, and kill a horse to get negative karma, then you have to die with negative karma and your +15 armor will downgrade to +14. That's a whole lot of Horseshit just to resume failstacking. it's dumb af.\n\nThe looting system is dumb af * There is no area loot in the game, it's done on a 1 by 1 basis, so you have to keep going around clicking your loot key to loot all the dead mobs.\nThe only way to speed this up is buying a \"pet\" which is a little companion that goes around looting for you. But the catch is, the pet doesn't area loot, it does loot by the same 1 by 1 basis. And each pet costs $10 USD. $10 USD for a pet that only picks up one loot node every 10 seconds max, you can get them to do it every 4 seconds, but that's after the pet levels up to level 30, which takes a long ass time to do. you can have a max of 4 pets at a time, so $40 USD gets you enough pets to pick up 4 loot nodes every 4-10 seconds.\n$40 for a function that should be free by implementing area loot like in all the other MMOs i've played. SWTOR lets you area loot everything in a 100 mile radius for FREE!\n\nSo the game is semi-pay to win, meanig you have to invest money in it if you want to have a good time, but even if you invest money, you are still going to get F***** by RNG and waste tons of stones, which means tons of time investing in the game amounts to nothing because you can't even upgrade your items from +15 to +20 without spending almost all of your bank money in-game.\n\nGrinding for upgrade stones is shit, the microtransactions are shit, the market is shit, the game itself is even poorly optimized.\n\nI have a i5-4690k which is OCed, and a AMD r9 gaming GPU (8 gb gddr5) along with a lot of other good components, but every time I go near a city, it fails to load the cells and I get stuck in a graphical tear for about 15 seconds before the cells load.\n\nThank god i only spent $9 USD to buy the game, but I really wish I didn't spend $10 on that stupid fucking pet. That $10 could have gotten me something else, much more useful.", "recommendationid": "34866428", "language": "english", "developer_response": "Hey there.\n\nThanks for taking the time to leave us a review.

You land your first combo, sending an enemy into the air or knocking them off their feet then following up with a perfectly timed strike. Yeah. The combat in this game, while it eventually gets a bit repetitive, is a lot more fun that most games I've played lately. But combat is, quite literally, the only good part about this game. And the other mechanics degrade it to the point that you can't even enjoy it anymore. Let me explain. \n\nFirst of all, when I'm playing an mmo, I expect a certain set of things to be available to me, or to become available to me over time. Things like raids/ dungeons, for example. An acceptable storyline (and I say this in lieu of \"decent\" or \"good\" because mmo's tend to have mediocre storylines in general). Or, I don't know, some sort of reason to actually play the fucking game other than to gain minuscule increments of xp to ultimately never reach a goal of having higher stats than someone else. \n\nThe only thing this game cares about or focuses on is pvp. Which would be fine, considering how great the combat system seems on the surface. The problem is, while the combat seems satisfying, it's literally only up to the numbers. Your level has such an impact on how well you do in pvp that literally 1 level is the difference between winning or losing. And the time it takes to gain a level is absolutely fucking ridiculous. My friends and I were playing on the exp boosted noob servers and still none of us made it past level 57. \n\nThe other aspect that completely ruins this game is the gear system. Now, your character has 2 main combat stats that are affected by your gear: AP and DP. The thing is that gear is all levelled by improvement. So all gear starts basically the same, and by upgrading your gear, you get better stats. This seems good at first because it means you can have similar stats as someone but have different gear effects to maximize your characters potential. However, this is completely fucked up again by the ridiculous rng luck needed to get an upgrade, so much that it's relatively cheaper to just buy your gear. But it's still not cheap. \n\n\"Oh, so how do you make money?\" You may ask. There's two main ways. The first includes an endless mob grind cycle which you'll probably never get out of because you'll have the same gear without gaining levels, which means you can't farm the high level spots for drops (not to mention that all of these spots are extremely overcrowded by people of higher level than you, so when they kill you for \"taking their spot\", you can't do anything about it. Seriously, ask me how my two friends and I, a team of 3, got fucked by someone 2 levels higher than us. That's how bad the stat curves are in this game.) The second way involves training one or more of the game's \"productivity\" skills, or whatever they're called. Things like trading, cooking, fishing, etc. My first problem with this is, again, FUCKING GRINDING. You really don't make any money until you hit \"master\" in any skill. And honestly if you have the time and patience to hit master then you should be doing more productive things than playing this piece of shit game. \n\nThe last thing I have to say about this game, is don't, for the love of god, spend money in the in game shop. Don't buy pets. I don't care how much you want the auto loot. It's not worth the $20. Don't buy the outfits. They may look good, but they're definitely not worth the sometimes $60. Yes, $60 CAD for a fucking outfit in a video game. Bottom line just don't buy anything from the shop. \n\nThe summary, don't buy this trash. Unless you want to get stuck in an endless grindfest with no reward or visible type of achievement for your efforts, go play something else. I get that it's a Korean mmo, but there's quite literally nothing to do in this game except try and grind to get better stats for pvp. It's dressed up with a bunch of extra features to lure you in, but they're all bullshit and either behind a pay wall or a grind wall.", "recommendationid": "35316728", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506730140, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503109190, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198093696957", "num_games_owned": 26, "playtime_forever": 14156}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528179"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 31, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506669614, "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It's a good game, it's not a great game and it's only good for a short time.

When I'm attempting to upgrade gear and it fails... repeatedly smashing me back down to a lower tier and I run out of materials and then have to wait for another week of gathering/grinding or pay out the nose to try again - I HATES IT. \n\nHowever... one of the things that BDO has done very well, IMO, is looked at what were problems in other games and tried to find solutions to them. For example, for most MMO's when new content is released your previous gear that you worked so hard to acquire becomes quickly obsolete. There is a PLETHORA of random gear in most games for every class. I'm not a coder, and won't even pretend to think I know anything, but to me it seems like that would create more work/require more memory in some way. \n\nIn this game your gear can be used by any of your other toons, which is nice. So the original gear I leveled my toon in can be passed on to an alt once I replace pieces, or sold. Additionally, all of those \"extra\" drops that would ordinarily be used to DE for chanting mats are now used here to repair instead - I don't see an issue with the logic in that, it keeps the drops relavent. \n\nPTW - \n\nWhat can I buy to win - and how much does it cost? Can someone show me this item, are there hidden stats I'm unaware of on something? I paid 5 dollars for this game, and I'm clearly spending a lot of time playing it. So yes, I am OK with spending money to support the thing thats providing me with hours of entertainment. You can pay for convienence, I'll give you that. Honestly, if you're enjoying the game paying for items really shouldn't bum you out. If you're broke, that sucks and I'm sorry, but would you go to an arcade, a bowling alley, mini golf, whatever, and say, \"You mean I have to pay to play this game?\" \n\nActually, no heres a better one - lets say Universal opened up their doors, for $9.99 and then sold a fast pass for the lines for $X, you gonna complain? I mean your ticket was only 10 bucks, you're in the park, you just gotta wait in the line dude. Its the same thing. \n\nThe Grind -\n\nWhats the rush? One of the biggest issues I've had in other games I've played is once I hit max level I get bored. I don't think I'm alone in this - so can you blame them for saying woah there, lets hit the brakes a little and work for this. I mean it all depends on what's important to you, where your priorities lie. You can easily get 56 in a day on a weekend, and that makes sense because at 56 the class changes significantly - so why would you want to spend days/weeks to get to that awakening and then discover you no longer like the class?\n\nI mean if that were the case then yes, much aggro, but its not. \n\nIf you want to get to max level then you should spend all of your time dedicated to getting there, it won't take all that crazy long to get to 60. I did 56-57 in a caffiene fueled 24 hours of mahem at Bashims. I didn't even pay all that much attention to it and got to 58 a bit at a time a couple weeks later. \n\nI'm no longer leveling my toon because I want to spend some time doing other things. Like killing bosses so I can try to get out of Heves, lul. And increasing energy - you want to talk about some annoyance OMG that amity game... klsbdkfkjfsdkbn And also because yes, to just \"grind\" would be no fun. But guess what, theres a ton of other stuff to do! It all depends on where your priorities are. \n\nI played the first month of this game doing nothing but horses. It appealed to me, so now I have a t8 courser with 156% speed. Did I spend some money on mount skill change coupons, yeppers, did I get really frakken annoyed when I spent too much money because I didn't understand how they worked, oh hells yeah. But I mean, honestly, research... I shoulda known better. So when I got my second and my 3rd t8 courser I spent probably 15 bucks each to get there. And I'm OK with that, cuz I had fun doing it. And before you scream PTW! I will also mention that the fastest t7 I have, that I didn't spend a dime on, is 151% speed. So, no. But awakened horses, yes you do need one of them for that. But remember it will also still take a shitton of time to gather resources to pray for a 1% chance of getting, so again priorities - imma get my hellhorse dagnabit.\n\n PVP - \n\nYou don't wanna pvp don't go to pvp locations. The good loots is where the pvp happens. Go to less popular grind spots, don't be bothered and get your levels if thats what you want to do. I did not say to myself, hmmm, I wanna level in a day/night and make all teh fat loots so imma go to pirates. Hah, cuz you know whats at that location. If pvp ain't fun for you, don't go to pvp locations. Or don't insist on holding the best rotation, or switch channels. \n\nOr quit the game cuz maybe you'd prefer some sleepy time chamomile tea, and thats just fine too. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "recommendationid": "34918316", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505304790, "votes_funny": 12, "comment_count": "16", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 19008, "last_played": 1507206507, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198083208182", "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_forever": 174403}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562257"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 16, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506754668, "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I keep getting surprised on how cheap this game is, compared to what you're paying for when buying the game.\n\nThis is a Sandbox MMO, not a Theatrical MMO (WoW, ESO, SWTOR, etc), meaning you are free to do whatever you want when you create your character.

Set yourself to fish while ur at work or sleeping, and earn money fishing while you're not there.\n\nThe game also has a forced PvP aspect to it, and a karma system around it. Once you reach lvl 50, you are able to attack other players above lvl 50 outside of safezones. However, attack to many players, and your karma will drop to negative, which means you can't enter certain cities without being attacked by NPC guards that will most likely kill you within a few punches. If you die to an NPC or a mob while you have negative karma, your armor and weapon might degrade in gear level, which might mean hours grinding money to get your item to TRI (+18) a complete waste of time. So don't expect to be attacked constantly.\n\nHowever, if you enter Valencia 6, which has been made into a PvP server, they have removed the negative effects of PvP fighting others, meaning you won't drop karma. So if you do enter Val6, DO expect to be attacked constantly.\n\nThis game is also quite new-player friendly, as you are given access to certain servers called Olvia server during the first month of joining, which gives you 100% XP boost, which makes it quite easy to catch up to high lvl players. You also regain access to the Olvia servers if you have been inactive from the game for more then a month.\n\nA future update to the game are also adding gear and weapons which you can get from drops, which is pre-set upgraded and gives you enough stats for beginners end-game PvP.\n\nThere aren't any dungeons in this game, but a recent update added something called Savage Rift, which is a horde mode, where you and 9 other players defend an object from being destroyed during 25 waves of enemies attacking. \n\nYou also have world bosses, which is quite popular to grind using an ALT char, simply for boss drops. Most veteran players have different chars stationed at different bosses, so they simply switch between chars when a world boss spawns, for a chance to get a boss armor/weapon drop, which are the end-game goal when it comes to gear.\n\nAs I'm writing this review, it's listed for 42 NOK (5 Dollars) during a 40% weekend deal, and it's sure as hell worth every cent of those 5 dollars.\n\nThere is no mandatory monthly cost to play this game, so it is free to play monthly. So the 1 time payment when you buy the game is all you need to pay for this game if you are willing to grind a bit in the game to earn some cash, which you are forced to do either way if you wanna get good gear.\n\nThere is a cash shop in the game, and if you do decide to spend some extra money on the game, I highly recommend googling a guide on what items you should spend money on, as several of the cash shop items is purchaseable through the marketplace if you grind enough silver for it, and have the patience of trying to snipe it from marketplace before anyone else does.\n\nI highly recommend this game, and I give it a  9/10.", "recommendationid": "35325842", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506755119, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1406, "last_played": 1506884618, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198020489440", "num_games_owned": 193, "playtime_forever": 72618}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528796"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 9, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1506724820, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "  I played this game in Beta, and is has improved a lot since then.
