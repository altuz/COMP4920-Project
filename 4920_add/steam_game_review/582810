Then suddenly I saw the news on Steam: Serious Metal Detecting was coming soon! My utter desperation transformed to unbridled joy as I dropped to my knees, looked towards the heavens, and said \"thank you Lord Jesus Christ, for hearing my prayers.\" I am now able to fully simulate the exciting, action-filled tour-de-force of Serious Metal Detecting from the luxury of my own (my aunt's) home. I owe the developer a debt I cannot possibly ever replay, for saving my life and giving me something to hope for.\n\nBless you, Serious Metal Detecting.", "recommendationid": "31546063", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493923435, "votes_funny": 25, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495925114, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561198027445739", "num_games_owned": 197, "playtime_forever": 222}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558360"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 14, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1493747494, "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I can confirm this is very serious metal detecting", "recommendationid": "31510613", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493747494, "votes_funny": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493725390, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198042814937", "num_games_owned": 475, "playtime_forever": 34}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512325"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1494111379, "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Nothing yet has captured the soul and sense of me like this game. For me, personally, this is a game changer. I have yet to experience anything unlike the godlike feeling of finding that one coin under the tree. Many a game go by, with their fancy triple A titles and their bad mechanics. I'm not about that. The video gaming industry is increasingly being cheaper and cheaper, and this is jut about the only solace. It's a perfect capsule of what makes video games so fun.\n1. It's addictive. I can not stop playing this game, but I don't have a problem with it consuming me.\n\n2. It's immersive. Everything, from the chirping birds to the incredible trees add to the immersion of the game. Walking through those barren woods, I often found myself longing to find the next piece of metal. It's almost as if I was at my parents old house, and playing around with their metal detector. This game awakens feelings in me that I can not even BEGIN to explain. For me, this game has changed my life. I am a much more fulfilled and happy person now, and I can not stand a day without getting myself atleast a little bit of this fantastic piece of art.\n\nOverall, this game is truly on a whole other level than any other game to come, and any other game so far. I beg you to try this game. It will not dissapoint.
