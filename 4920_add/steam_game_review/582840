As Twine projects go, it's a little spiffier and more ambitious than most, though not exactly by a landslide.\n\n   It has no sound, only the occasional lovingly hand-drawn illustration, and opts for the bog-standard blue links to indicate where you can click next to progress/make choices (though in all fairness this may have been a well-thought-out aesthetic decision, rather than just default laziness). The story it tells is relatable if unexceptional, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with the author's command of the written word (always a nice thing in text adventures, I'm sure you'll agree). The font is perhaps a tad on the small side - especially if you have a small monitor - and almost entirely devoid of frills, but it gets the job done. There's a couple of minor spelling errors, but nothing you'd fail an essay over. And it has self-deprecating Morrissey and Joy Division references, which is certainly never a bad thing in my book.\n\n   One definite negative is that it doesn't appear to have a save function. I mean, yes, it's short - under thirty minutes kind of short - but a save would still be preferable. And there isn't a HUGE amount of agency, but perhaps enough to make it replayable, should your first run-through of the storyline prove sufficiently intriguing. I personally gave it a quick second spam-through, and it does have some decidedly divergent paths, should you find the possibilities compelling enough (I didn't, but then again, I'm no longer in my twenties, and largely lost interest in the perils of the \"dating world\" some time ago).\n\n   The biggest issue for many, I suspect, will be the price. Is it worth three dollars? Honestly, I think the dev was pretty brave to ask ANY price for what is on offer here, much less more than 99c. My advice were they a friend would have been to chuck this one up for free, solidify your \"audience\", and make the next one longer and as cheap as you can possibly make it on Steam (i.e. 99c)!\n\n   There's certainly nothing overtly incompetent or hate-worthy here...on the whole, a rather \"nice first effort\" indeed. \"Underwhelming\" is perhaps the nastiest insult you could throw its way. I certainly wouldn't recommend it at full price to anyone bar the most ferociously Twine-curious, and would advise even sale-hunters to keep their expectations low. (Unless you're recently single and feel like a touch of the straw which broke the camel's back: an optimistic view of relationships this sure-as-shit ain't, so if you're looking for that extra little push over the brink, this may well be the product to do it.)\n\nVerdict: 6.5/10.", "recommendationid": "29583000", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485774258, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485779534, "num_reviews": 429, "steamid": "76561198048974498", "num_games_owned": 1513, "playtime_forever": 56}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539415"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485696495, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "20something is a touching interative fiction game that cuts to heart of the world of dating and intimacy for a young man in his early twenties. Scenes are told through a highly relatable stream of consciousness, humorously interwoven with 'bad but good' action movies, 'bad but good' parties and 'bad but good' dates. Amongst the soul searching and eerily familiar romantic encounters, the story also touches on mental health issues and alcohol abuse, two topics young men often feel unable to talk about in healthy and productive ways, and are helpful to see represented in media. If you're are a fan of interactive fiction or indeed anyone who has navigated the perils of online dating, fumbling encounters or long awkward moments, then I highly recommend this game.", "recommendationid": "29564251", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485696495, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485695592, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198007140804", "num_games_owned": 398, "playtime_forever": 61}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514178"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487054819, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "An interesting game if a bit shallow.
