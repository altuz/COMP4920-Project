(had I used the KBD I prob. would have had something to say about not giving the option to rebind keys as it doesn't allow that so if that's what you'll be using check the trailer it shows the keybinding, is a major kudos to the dev. for showing that)", "recommendationid": "30084967", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487703761, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487703296, "num_reviews": 81, "steamid": "76561198138101163", "num_games_owned": 152, "playtime_forever": 13}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509961"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1488409009, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "LIT is one of those \"short and sweet\" variety of games. Its slew of levels is somewhat limited, considering how reasonably adept players can surpass all 16 levels with LITtle (lol pun) trouble, and especially with the $6 price tag in regard.\n\nWith hardly an iota of doubt, it is short. But that's when the 'sweet' comes in. The playable characters, menus, entities, and hazards are all fluidly animated to the high standards of WayForward. And not surprisingly, the small cast of characters are young and adorable, in spite of the game's dark and eerie tone.\n\nThe sound design is also worth noting. Windows, lamps, and other interactable instruments of puzzle solving sound as expected. The music, while not as memorable as the catchy soundtracks featured in the iconic Shantae franchise, fits the general mood of despair and darkness like a glove.\n\nConclusion: Fairly small for the proportionally high price tag, but manages to be consistently beautiful without compromise. Interested users who are on a budget may want to consider waiting for a sale.", "recommendationid": "30268811", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488409009, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497735736, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198294558453", "num_games_owned": 55, "playtime_forever": 256}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501609"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492994611, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The indie game is very interesting in using the tools to get to the exit with light and avoiding getting caught by the monsters. The animation is great and the characters are cure and adorable, but the genre was dark. Even in turning on televisions, install the light buld to the lamp, slingshot mirrors and of course, burning monsters to exit the room. This game would be better with achievements and probably multiplayer to co-op each other, but why it should be in-purchase because this game was free in mobile, not sure about it and turns out this game has the older version in Wii.
