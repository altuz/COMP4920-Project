Sadly, I don't know if it's a combination of aging poorly or technical issues with the port but I cannot recommend this version of the game. For starters I had some difficulty simply launching the game, with it getting caught in an endless crash loop if I wasn't launching from a fresh reboot. The controls for this shmup have always been more deliberate and slower moving, but here it goes beyond that. They just feel sticky, like there's a noticeable lag when changing directions. The soundtrack leaves much to be desired and I was frequently getting audio glitches where the audio would cut to an ear-splittingly high pitched shriek for several seconds during boss or midboss fights. After about an hour I'd had enough. I won't seek a refund since I really would like to see 2 and 3 get a port, but if you're not already invested in the series or aren't a diehard shmup player, or even a new shmup player looking for an entry into the genre avoid this title. There are far better shmups deserving of your time and money, some of them even from this publisher.\n\nEdit:\n\nBullet patterns: Very swingy, either exceptionally boring or control-bitingly frustrating. Some patterns are more solvable with different characters, but some come out so quickly with no telegraphing you'd have to know in advanced they're coming to avoid. Hitboxes feel a bit wonky, it's not always clear just how close your character actually is to a particular projectile or enemy, which is unfortunate since grazing is a key mechanic to the game.\n\nScoring mechanics: Straightforward enough, probably the best thing about the game. Distance from an enemy or projectile determines a multiplier from 1-8x, which multiplies the value of items collected in that state or multiplies the amount of items dropped from destroyed enemies.\n\nExtra modes: None as far as I can tell. Variety comes mainly from the different shot types and mechanics of the individual characters. Par for the course with this series but I tried each character several times and none of them really clicked.\n\nAs far as the technical issues. I've asked around and I'm pretty sure the ones I pointed out in my review aren't isolated to myself. The ear-destroying sound effects on bosses and boring soundtrack are infact part of the game.\n\nHaving played its sequels I'm glad that the series has improved from this point, but if this had been my introduction to the series or the genre even, I doubt I would have stuck with it.", "recommendationid": "32460808", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1497591897, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "5", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501897601, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561197997941036", "num_games_owned": 109, "playtime_forever": 231}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541637"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 14, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1497655648, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Disclaimer: I was the editor for the fan translation of the PC release, so I'm kind of obsessed with Shikigami.\n\nI'm probably the foremost authority on Shikigami's plot, so I'll focus on that. If you're familiar with the series, you know the games have a... questionable translation history. Shiki 1 was released as Mobile Light Force 2 on the PS2 with no story, Shikigami 2 basically had a google translate story, and Shiki 3... well, we lucked out, its translation was fantastic.\n\nSo let's talk the rerelease. The translation is accurate, and for the most part, well written, but there are a few typos and bits of bad grammar. The last part of the prologue in particular is bafflingly Engrish-like. \n\nIf you've never played Shikigami 1 and want to know what's going on, Degica and/or their translators did an admirable job. Not perfect, but solid.\n\n\nThe gameplay is dated, of course, but each of the six characters are wildly different from each other. Their stories are also completely unique. Where bosses are raving madmen in one story, they'll be calm and composed in another. You'll see what I mean when you play as Tagami(the '???' woman in character select). So for both gameplay and plot, you're encouraged to try everyone to get the most out of Shikigami.\n\nKohtaro is the series' de factor protagonist. He's the easiest to use, and has a homing Shikigami for his special attack, while Fumiko requires the player to actually aim her special attack, but it's far more powerful.\n\nKohtaro's personality is also brash and adventurous, while Fumiko is more solemn and dead set on murdering her adversaries. \n\nThe music is also a big factor. Shikigami 1 and 2 had the same composer, Yoichi Shimamura. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk38akRaBt8 (The ending theme, which I particular enjoy.) Shimamura uses simple but catchy melodies, and astute listeners will pick up on some leit motifs, too.\n\n\nThe art quality is a mixed bag. While the UI is crisp and HD shiny, the game itself is clearly the default resolution. In-game portraits are very blocky. Maybe this was unavoidable, but it's quite noticible. \n\n\nShikigami 1 is a solid shmup in every way, and deserves support so we can see the sequel on Steam, which is better in every way. (Except the PS2 translation, but let's not talk about that.)\n\n\nOne small disappointment for people who played the original PC version: this does not have the anime intro or the art gallery. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCer_fyV0AAyIRP.jpg", "recommendationid": "32488541", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1497655749, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504581676, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561197998392709", "num_games_owned": 131, "playtime_forever": 112}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528231"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1498070668, "votes_down": 0, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1498216932, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a positive review, with some reservations.\n\nI've played the arcade version, both English and Japanese PS2 versions, and the EX PC version.  In terms of playability, at least as of this writing, this version is at the bottom of the list.  That said, I am still happy and thankful that Deciga decided to release a Steam version (and hoping that they release the second one).  If you haven't played this game before and you like danmaku style shooters, or you just want a version with a translated story, then it is probably worth your time to check it out.  If you have already played it and own one of the other versions you might want to either skip it or wait and see if they patch it.  EDIT:  The devs are actively working on the game to smooth out the bugs.  If you were on the fence you might want to take that into account.\n\nThe positive is that the game is still a solid shooter, even if it is an older game.  I wish that they had translated the EX version, but beggars can't be choosers I suppose.  The fact that each character plays differently gives the game a good amount of replay value.  It does have some things that are a bit of a turn off though, such as the playable area not being as big as it looks.  This is also the only game in the series that has the coin-level up / level down on hit thing, so if that doesn't appeal to you finding a copy of the second or third game might be a better use of your time.\n\nAs for issues with this version, the game plays at a way faster rate than the original.  It's still playable, but newcomers who don't have the patterns memorized might get a tad frusterated.  5-2 had some really bad stuttering when I played it, and given that it is the hardest stage in the game it will probably frusterate anyone going for a 1CC.  The game also crashed at the Game Result screen after I beat the game, so good luck if you are trying to compete on the leaderboards.  I admit that some of these issues might be the fault of my computer, but considering my copy of EX still works just fine that is probably not the case.\n\nAnother thing is that there seems to be some Steam issues in regards to this game.  Either that or I really beat the game as Kuga in less than 5 minutes... which is impossible.  Steam stats don't effect the game itself though, so it's not anything to worry about.", "recommendationid": "32624575", "language": "english", "developer_response": "Sorry to hear about the crash on completing the game.
