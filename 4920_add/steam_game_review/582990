Space Fist is a 1vs1 beat'em up in the good and old way: many characters, many game modes including a story mode and lot of locked upgrades (Soul Calibur kind). It's not a simulator like for example Thrill of the Fight today (at launch it was VERY different) it uses low and high guard, low and high hits, energy bar and supercharge, everything is simplified and arcadey but effective.\n\nAll that stuff is yet enough to catch my attention, as I don't like much half made games with few or no goals and few contents (I'm waiting for Knockout League for this reason) where Space Fist is a full game than can be beated in 4-5 hours with a very decent replayability including a PvP only LAN at the moment. But another quite surprising side of the game is the overall polishing, with a good graphics with nice textures and filters. Characters are the most detailed I've seen in VR with a great scale, a skinny girl or an huge wrestler in front of you drive very different feelings. Good environments too, menus and on screen text are super polished and arcadey, decent oriental rock background music. It's not the Namco or Team Ninja kind of quality (I suppose the budget here is a microscopic fraction of those) but Space Fist is closer than any other fighting game I ever tried for VR.\n\nThe game is not perfect by any means: animations are not excellent and anyway in VR it's so hard to feel \"alive\" and not artificial, those looks like puppets with some Dead or Alive kind of oriental style. My english sucks and is cleary not my language, but the one in the game is not much better and the story is just ridicule/irrelevant. The game offers many modes, but I feel the missing of the classical coinop way to play, the Trial mode try to offer that but it's not the same. Your energy is written in your wrist, but it's very hard to read during combat.\n\nThose searching for a Street Fighter/Tekken/whatever clone for VR should seriously consider this one.", "recommendationid": "31199430", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492436010, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494188938, "num_reviews": 132, "steamid": "76561197969101080", "num_games_owned": 290, "playtime_forever": 126}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504177"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1494106518, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fun game.
