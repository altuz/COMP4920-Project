For example, I can say \"heal\" and it will recognize \"you'll\". The system uses the Speech Recogniztion that is built into Windows. I tried training it 3 times, but it still doesn't recognize most of the commands it couldn't recognize before. I tried manually added how I say certain commands into the Speech Dictionary, but it will still recognize the wrong words. I've tried articulating as best as I'm able. The best I can hope for at this point is to keep training it over the next few weeks or use different words that it can recognize reliably. \n\nI personally wish they would have used a different speech recognition engine.", "recommendationid": "35098843", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505976004, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505984700, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198033982672", "num_games_owned": 187, "playtime_forever": 243}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500660"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 37, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 35}}
