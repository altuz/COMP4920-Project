This really feels like it should have been early access as there is potential here and a good base for a great game, that I would have easily paid twice as much for. But far too much right now feels left out and unpolished to recomend this as a complete game.\n\nThe Good\n\nDriving feels solid, with cars having a nice solid yet zippy feel to them. You have the option of side bashing other cars at any time, and it never gets old side checking a car trying to pass you. The choice to do the vr with an overhead view instead of a cockpit view I can say was a wise decision. Tracks all feel a bit different and most of them were a joy to go through with some of the later ones providing a nice challenge. I never ran into any issues with performance although I'd be kinda worried if I had given my specs.\n\nThe Bad\n\nItem mode is a total wreck, with powerups feeling indistinct, hard to wield, and unbalanced. Half of the powerups basically amount to a forward facing ability that that auto homes in on racers in some way stuns or slows your oponent, and have no way of being guarded against aside from a shield that lasts a few seconds and shatters immediatly upon first provocation. Certain weapons like the upgraded turtle shot have no issues backfiring and taking you out along side your opponent, and aside from manually turning your head around, you have to blindly fire road hazards.   Expect to lose a number of races from getting surprised shot with 5 attacks at the last seond.\n\nProgress effectivly amounts to grinding rather than actually getting better with track unlocks and basic car unlocks tied to a license and money system  that can easily be broken by just spamming a stage in time mode, which unlike item mode you will always win by a mile as long as you drive decently.  While most other car unlocks are tied to repeatedly using weapons you mainly get when doing less than good. Half the cars amount to little more than recolors with changed stats, and there's no changing or customising your car or driver outside of a car selection.\n\nCertain tracks also have issues containing jumps without turbo pads, that I (And an AI driver) found ourselves in a position of being stuck in a loop of not having enough speed after getting attacked to make a jump only to be respawned right before the jump with no way of building speed before the jump.\n\nAnd while it's not a huge deal to me, this is a kart racer with no multiplayer, and while the vr looks good, it doesn't add anything to the game, unlike say VR Kart with it's look to aim system. The choice to make this a vr only seems to be crippling it's outreach potential which if it does get multiplayer, may become a big deal.\n\nRecomendations:\n\n-More fire and forget weapons that require precise aiming\n-More ways to defend against attacks (Many kart racers for example lets you use projectiles and hazards defensivly) \n-Easier way to look backwards\n-Tie more of the upgrades to a cup mode or something similar rather than a simple grind to win scenario.\n-More than two modes in general, Perhaps a true time trial that doesn't have you racing opponenets?\n-Online Multiplayer would be nice.\n-This game doesn't really need vr like most vr titles, it might make sense to have a non-vr version\n", "recommendationid": "29706706", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486254902, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486254796, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198000608698", "num_games_owned": 777, "playtime_forever": 235}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502240"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485541453, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This games is  a no brainer for the price.

This game is easily worth twice the price, and I got it on sale for 6$, practically a steal. There are some issues worth mentioning:\n\n1. I can't change my character to a boy, not sure if thats just me being a moron or if thats actually not an in game option\n\n2.
