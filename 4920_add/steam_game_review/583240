(Yalan Brand FTW)\n\nCoffence is a very fun concept that I feel has great potential as an indie brawler, following the \"legacy\" of games such as Lethal League. The Coffee concept is well thought out, with the Coffee Cup serving as your health bar, and the goal of the game is to deplete your opponent's coffee using various tricks.\n\nThe interesting thing is that in Coffence, health lost by Player A can mean health gained by Player B, if he can catch the coffee drop. This creates fun situations where you need to actually think about what drops are worth fighting for, and what drops are worth letting go. The theme of the game is pretty much \"fencing\", and as in fencing, the goal is to outthink your adversary and always think one step ahead.\n\nHowever, in its current iteration, Coffence is not without flaws. The lack of an Online component makes it so that you have to play live with someone in order to play the game the way it should be played : PLAYER vs PLAYER. I also think that currently, the \"fencing\", methodical theme/gameplay is overshadowed by an omni-present Dashing mechanic that causes the game to be much more fast-paced than I feel is wanted, leading to more stressful \"Button-mashing\" fights, as opposed to the mind-games.\n\nDespite this, the latest build shows that the guys are hard at work updating the game and that they are listening to critcism. While there is currently no Online component, there is now an AI Opponent \"lonely\" players like me can play against in order to practice. It's not hard to see Coffence's potential, especially if you like playing \"couch-gaming\" style with friends. There's even a 4-Player mode where you can fight for Coffee Supremacy!\n\nI suggest you try out Coffence, and then give feedback, especially since they already have a history adapting quickly and listening to comments!\n\n", "recommendationid": "32652438", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498166866, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498090267, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198006307569", "num_games_owned": 338, "playtime_forever": 95}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500190"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1498356803, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Really good game, need more work on it but we have playing it with my friend.
