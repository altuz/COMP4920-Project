No puzzle is extraneous, all of the over one-hundred of them each serve a clear purpose. The map allows you to finish the unlocked levels in whichever order you want, making the game very accessible and fair, and levels with multiple exits keep exploring the map exciting.\n\nSokobond was a bit too hard and complex for me. Snowman was great and had a cute aestethic, but is a bit short and easy. Cosmic Express hits the perfect balance, with the track-drawing mechanic being more accessible than block transportation games. So far I've beaten all normal puzzles, but there are still some extra challenges in the endgame, where the difficulty is really ramped up to eleven.\n\nThe aesthetic is very well done, and while I find the semi-isometric perspective to be a bother at times (you can't draw tracks with straight mouse strokes), it is functional and the little details and easter eggs really top it off. The music is soothing and undistractful.\n\nRecommended for fans of the genre, worth looking into for everyone else.", "recommendationid": "35381308", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506863819, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499284636, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198041390809", "num_games_owned": 241, "playtime_forever": 1579}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505670"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 30, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 28}}
