Isn't a hardcore platform fan! \n\nIn conclusion. \nThis is a game in the same spirit as Super Meat Boy! It's different enough to differentiate itself form Super Meat Boy but at the same times has the same feeling. So if you're a Edmund McMillen fan and loved Super Meat Boy this game is for you. \n\nI'd give it a solid 9/10.", "recommendationid": "34901940", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505305017, "votes_funny": 6, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 178, "last_played": 1506866997, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198025497973", "num_games_owned": 83, "playtime_forever": 1028}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580905"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 21, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506145960, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The End is Nigh. It's an insanely difficult platformer just like Super Meat Boy, but it has one key difference: You can't wall jump! This defines the game, and is more fun than it sounds. Because the game centers around hanging on ledges and boost-jumping off of them.\n\nJust like Super Meat Boy, precise controls aid you in your efforts to overcome ridiculous platforming challenges. However, it never overwhelms you with this absurd challenge at first. The game, for the most part, starts at a \"moderate\" difficulty then very slowly ramps up. Introducing you to harder and harder challenges that are perfectly doable. Even the most absurd platforming problems require subtle button presses and nuanced use of movement, in order to beat them.\n\nThe End is Nigh has more value than it seems. Not only does it have a ton of collectible and \"adorable\" tumors, which are more important than you think, the game has tons of other secrets to find. You'll spend quite a few hours searching for them, and you'll eventually get good enough to traverse the levels to find them all. The game really DOES have over 600 levels in total!\n\nThis game doesn't progress like a normal platforming game, such as Super Meat Boy, where you have to SELECT your individual levels. Each world can be selected from a map, but the individual levels within these worlds behave like one big long path. With forks in the road leading to goodies and secrets. You traverse between these worlds via teleporters. In fact, the entire game is one giant path that... almost looks like a pitchfork, due to 3 branching ways you can go.\n\nVisually, the game looks quite good! The signature artstyle is here, with beautiful effects that look rather impressive despite the relatively primitive artstyle. In a way, this game is charming with its morbid atmosphere and sense of humor. There's something almost whimsical about the dark and bleak world of The End is Nigh. Technically, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong, and you have all the options you could want at your disposal, including solid video options.\n\nWhat makes The End is Nigh so brilliant is that sheer satisfaction you get from beating tough segments. Just like in Edmund McMillen's amazing Super Meat Boy, beating the toughest challenges and secrets will give you a serious amount of \"gamer cred\". Whatever such a thing is even worth.\n\nThe only thing truly hampering this game is the difficulty. If you hate \"rage platformers', please for the love of black blobs everywhere, just stay way. But if you're a masochist who gets sick pleasure out of being satisfied from beating tough platformers, this game is highly reccomended!", "recommendationid": "35145047", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506145996, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 641, "last_played": 1506496892, "num_reviews": 50, "steamid": "76561197989611392", "num_games_owned": 494, "playtime_forever": 924}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536202"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 12, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506802469, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "For the average player who wants to complete the game, but doesn't quite understand what they're getting themselves into:\n\nI might think twice about buying this.\n\n\n\nFor those who plan on completing the game (maybe except for the ridiculous achievements) and want a great challenge:\n\nThis is right up your alley.\n\n\n\nFor those who like to hurt themselves, yearn for a masochistic challenge, and want to go for 100% achievements in a game with a simple enough concept that is unbelievably difficult to do so in:\n\nThis is one of the best, especially as far as platformers go.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: However I should note, if you're already into platformers, you have to give this a go.", "recommendationid": "35352784", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506909553, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2040, "last_played": 1507183663, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198035306491", "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 16725}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521494"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 29, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1506075628, "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "To appease the nit-pickers who'll complain about a review any more complex than a list of pros and cons, I'll keep this review short and simple.\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n-The game is definitely hard.\n-Rich Evans is a good voice actor.\n-Jumping on enemies/projectiles is fun.\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\n-The game has EXTREMELY basic physics; far less fun than what anyone would expect from a game made in 2017, let alone a game made by the same guy who made Super Meat Boy. Nothing makes it stand out aside from the fact that you can jump off of ledges, which isn't exactly anything worth writing home about.\n-The second half of the game has lives, and resets your progress once you run out. Lives in a game like this aren't fun, they're just a lazy, tedious way to pad out the game's length. It doesn't make the game any harder, it just makes it more annoying.\n-Said lives are based on the amount of tumors you've collected through the first half of the game, which is something you're never told, meaning that if you want more lives, you'll have to go back and play through any incomplete worlds all over again to collect them thanks to the lack of a level select system. Again, this doesn't add any difficulty, and merely pads out the game's length by forcing you to replay levels to reach the ones you missed.\n-No proper bosses. I'm aware that it's more of a personal thing, and that some people don't like bosses in platformer games, but still, a variety in gameplay would be nice.\n[i]Misc. Complaints[/i]\n-The game is ugly. Yes, I get it, the point is that the world is ugly because it's dead, but that doesn't really excuse the fact that every texture is just one solid color. It's boring to look at. Even Super Meat Boy's basic tile-based graphics were much, much better.\n-The soundtrack is just bland, generic remixes of public domain songs, with the rare inclusion of a unique song that still doesn't really manage to stand out from the drudge of generic remixes of In The Hall of the Mountain King and Flight of the Bumblebees.\n-No level editor. Not that it needed a level editor, I guess, but it's hard to not compare this game to Super Meat Boy and be disappointed by how much it's lacking.\n\nI can say without an ounce of hyperbole that this game feels like some quick flash game made for Newgrounds in the early 2000's. It just makes me wish I was playing Super Meat Boy; multiple characters, better level design, a level editor/in-game custom level prowser, actually fun gameplay, and so on.", "recommendationid": "35124562", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506818515, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 173, "last_played": 1506071480, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198040338707", "num_games_owned": 121, "playtime_forever": 630}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532289"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506986889, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "a suicidal mario game.
