You can tweak the colors and shapes of the squares so you're filling in little stars if you want.\n\nNow, these puzzles don't form pictures at the end of the puzzle, but in exchange you basically get an unlimited amount of decently tough puzzles. You set what kind of dimensions you want in your puzzle - 5x5, 5x10, whatever - and solve it. There are no difficulty sliders, just the size of the puzzle. Set your colors, pick your size, and go. The music is pleasant, and can be turned off when you've had enough.\n\nBasically, you can probably get better picross for free or in phone apps, but I'd still honestly reccommend this one for the sheer amount of puzzles here, and for the little star icons.

Can also adjust the appearance to your liking.\n\nHowever, this game has a few issues that mainly depend hardware, which in turn will effect achievement hunters.\n\nFor the 50x50 and 95x50 achievements, you need a resolution of, according to the dev, ~1600x900; which means a bigger monitor size is needed if it's not able to display at that resolution. A 1366x768 display will only allow a puzzle of maximum size 83x41 to be made.\n\nWhile I do recommend this game, achievement hunters beware that you may be short of 1 or 2 achievements to 100% on your end.\n\nThe UI could use some rennovation too, seems rather basic.\n\n-----\n\nCheck out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/BPUGL]BluePaw's Underrated Games List[/url]\nJoin and/or follow if you wish.", "recommendationid": "33119254", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499058693, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498980548, "num_reviews": 147, "steamid": "76561198020839656", "num_games_owned": 220, "playtime_forever": 144}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505928"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1498448267, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Just completed a 99x62 puzzle, took me almost 7 hours.
