I haven't played a lot of VR, but of the games I've played, this is quickly becoming my favorite. Its like the Lab's Xortex but I think that the few ships and enemies are a really nice addition. There might be similarities in the basic mechanics of this game, but I think that galaxis wars stands out from the lab.

I, however, enjoyed Xortex for a while but this game didn't entertain me. Why? Who knows. Maybe this type of game just bores me quickly.\nProblems:\n- Runs relatively poorly and looks bad. Had noticeable slowdowns at gr8 graphics setting with i7 @ 4,4GHz and OC'd GTX 1080. Considering how the game looks, this shouldn't happen.\n- There are different enemies but all you can really do against all of them is to point and shoot. You don't even prioritize certain types like in Xortex.\n- You have to twist your arm in weird positions to kill the enemies chasing you.\n- My highscore didn't update to the leaderboards (might have been due to windows firewall - after I stopped playing I noticed it was asking for permission). After restarting the game score was wiped (upgrades stayed).\n- The game is very easy after you buy the active repair skill. I didn't come even close to dying so I suicided at wave 34. Difficulty setting doesn't seem to make much of a difference, at least at start.\n- You have to press the trigger to fire. I found this unpleasant. Especially considering that you have no reason to stop firing.\n\nConclusion: Ugly and poorly balanced shooter that you might enjoy nonetheless.", "recommendationid": "32718408", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498295859, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498295081, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561197960498075", "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 98}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507963"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1497251436, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Excellent game, if you like zortex from labs then just buy it, its same principle but so much better.\n\nA must for any space invader fan!\n10/10", "recommendationid": "32359519", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1497251436, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502188523, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198017239589", "num_games_owned": 33, "playtime_forever": 190}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490196"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1496170508, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "hello.
