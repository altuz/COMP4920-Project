It takes a while to learn how to glide and especially with touch controllers, your arms will get tired.  However, it's very majestic to \"glide\" in the air and just experience the wonder of the terrain.  However, I keep crashing to the ground (but there are options to make flight easier).  The graphics are not the best, but they are good enough to give you that feeling of wonder.  With just a few tweaks this game could be perfection.\n\nI hope the dev keeps improving this game.  It's off to a great start and I hope it only gets better from here.  Given the price, I highly recommend this game.  I felt absolutely no nausea during the 30 minutes I played this game and can't wait to get back in the air.  Just need to nail down the gliding so I can experience more of the game.  But I needed to give kudos to the dev for the solid start to this early access game. \n\nRating 8/10 (could be 10 with future updates)\n\nsuggestions to dev, please work on the tutorial and the UI, it's not easy to follow; also please make a city landscape; also maybe some prey to hunt and maybe even a nest to get back to\n\nEDIT:\nSo I played around more, this time with a controller.  Flight is super easy with a controller.  I could never figure out how to get back from the ground using the motion controllers, but all you do on the controller is move the right stick.  However, I definitely do not recommend this game using contollers even though flight is much easier because you lose immersion.  Using motion controls, I felt like I was an eagle.  I didn't feel that with a Xbox gamepad.\n\nHowever, using the gamepad, I did notice a few things that should be updated/fixed if possible.  The terrain really needs to have higher textures.  Everything is static except the bird animations.  The terrain is photo-realistic, but with low resolution textures.  So it ends up looking like streaming 360 videos.  Also the draw distance is noticeable on my i7 1060 GTX so I imagine this would be the case for most rigs.  It would be great if the water flowed and wasn't a still photo, and in fact, your bird can walk on water LOL.  The night sky is amazing, but there are some distractions to its beauty.  The moon moves way too fast and for some reason, the direction you look causes a shadow to happen on the sky.  The day night cycle should be slowed and maybe some weather effects added.\n\nAlso would be nice if there were more sounds.  The sound of air as you fly around is great.  But that's the only sound besides the built-in music.  You should at least be able to make your Eagle screech when you want.  There should be other ambient sounds.  Also, I'd like to listen to my own music because the built-in music is not so great.  \n\nI definitely will practice flight with the touch controls and the 3 maps allow for decent flight time.  I enjoyed the Canada map the most, it is very beautiful.  I have felt no nasuea and it's just fun to fly like an Eagle.", "recommendationid": "34345700", "language": "english", "developer_response": "Fastlawyer;\n\nThank you ever so much for being my first review.  I'll try and put a few thoughts together.\n\nFirstly I hear you regarding the tutorial.  It's hard to convey what I'm trying to ask people to do with text and no video.  I'm thinking of ways I can better teach the technique for the flapping, as once you've got it then it's no problem.  The best thing I can think is go to the Community Hub, then Videos, and watch the one with the Motion Platform demonstration.  You can then see me flapping briefly.\n\nThe scenery is like it is as I went for satellite photography because of how authentic it looked from a distance.  As I've used my setup for show use, no one really got near the ground so the illusion worked.  Add the fact that I'm running everything on a vr laptop, then I had quite a few constraints on graphics to keep everything running smooth, and allowing the platform software to not glitch itself into oblivion.  I'm also running software controlled fans, so I couldn't go mad graphically.  With the satellite photography, if I went one step higher the download became unacceptably large.  If I double the resolution (it's currently 1 metre per pixel for Scotland), I quadruple the size.  The game is presently 2gb for three maps, so double the resolution means 8.4gb of jpgs.  Hopefully, with RTP and World Creator, I can up the detail of the current maps and make some new ones too.  There are many options, and I really want more stuff like trees, prey, nests, etc.  It can be done, and I have the means to do this.\n\nHowever I think the priority for now is the tutorial, and get people flying.  Once that is complete, I can then go back to the landscapes.  As for landing on the water, I'm guessing in the Canada map?  Well someone had to try it.  My sense of flight safety stopped me from doing so!  Satellite photography just has a height map and the photo.  Again when I tried to add the water, I lost the magic 90fps on the laptop, not to mention it didn't look good with the photography.  I think water will be a feature of any new maps.\n\nThe night sky moving too fast?  Believe it or not, the day/night cycle used to be about 45 minutes, then someone suggested it was too slow!  It's currently 24 minutes... one minute for an hour.  That'll have to be another customisable option.  Please can you elaborate on the shadow you see in the sky at night?  I do not experience this on my system, and I'm also using a GTX 1060 albeit in a laptop.\n\nThe music... well I've heard it a lot of course, but it's just meant to be there quietly in the background, and I thought it was better than silence.  I fully expect many people will turn it off on the menu, and play their own instead.  That option is saved on exit, so turn the music off and it'll should remember, certainly by the time you get to the main menu.  I'm usually playing some kind of Epicore on your streaming service of choice.\n\nAmbient sounds... that's a tough one.  I need to remove the short gap as the wind noise loops around.  I'm hoping for a new wing flap sound, but it's near to impossible to record, and I've worked with vultures and eagles for years.  There's always something to interfere with the sound, but the current one is very close.  Apart from perhaps your own bird calls, and others nearby, I'm uncertain what you'd hear in the air.  It's maybe more something for on the ground, but I can look into it when I deal with terrains.\n\nI'm glad you like the Canada terrain.  You know that's the one I like least!  I'm a big Scotland fan I guess.\n\nI hope that helps address some of what you say, and thank you for supporting the project.\n\nAll the best;\n\nGraeme", "timestamp_updated": 1503160869, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503261576, "num_reviews": 210, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 82}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527600"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
