Unique parkour style movement and climbing systems. Reminds me a little bit of Windlands. I can not recommend the game in its current state (early access) however. Teleportation is very bugged, the same goes for NPC dialog, The game has  a very unfinished feel overall with constant irritating bugs and limited content. The art style is colorful cartoonish, but the world feels lifeless. Might be worth playing in its finished state, but not as it is right now.", "recommendationid": "31185370", "language": "english", "developer_response": "Patch 1.1.0 Solves the NPC dialogue speed and removes teleportation, therefore we urge you to start a new game in the fresh build so that this review can remain accurate to the game's current state.", "timestamp_updated": 1492371479, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492291971, "num_reviews": 132, "steamid": "76561198001165810", "num_games_owned": 338, "playtime_forever": 44}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486380"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 0}}
