Hallways, for example, cannot go less than 81 cm. Also, I could not figure out how to (or simply cannot) adjust the grid parameters to better fit the measurements I'm desiring. I live in Japan where houses are measured by Jo and Tsubo, which both convert to very abstract metric measurements. Hopefully someone can instruct me how to do so...\n\nAnother thing; On 2D planning, when adjusting size of a room, the screen goes blank (white) and I have to wait a couple secs for it to come back before you can try to adjust the size again in hopes that it won't go blank again.
