So far it seems pretty solid. The multi-windows view mode works fine except for the fact when I want to view windows on my second desktop. When either selecting new desktop windows, or new desktop shard and click desktop 2 the application crashes. Everything does however work on desktop 2. I enjoyed using the note feature which allowed me to create a little sticky note where I could put anywhere I wanted. The camera passthrough mode is also a nice addition. Overall it seems that this application is very customizable from wallpapers to models. It also has this cool little feature in the settings tab where you can use your controller as a magnifying glass so when you're far away from the monitor it makes text and desktop a little bigger so you can read what's on the screen. There is also a feature to browse your filesystem. So far the app seems to work very fine. Other applications such as big screen, and a few others use on average more resouces then this program does. On average for me, it uses around 5% of my CPU. I7-4790k. Moving windows inside the virtual enviroment is intuitive. It also has various different default scenes you can pick from. Considering this application is free, I would at least recommend trying it out and see how it works for you.

If you have a multimontor setup and always felt handcuffed by other desktop applications, this one may be your bag.

Once you have a VRdesktop open in MultiVR.se you can switch real desktops in that one frame through the menu button.  You can also open a non-desktop browser window, create lighting sources, open a white or black board to take notes on, pop open a keyboard, glance at your camera, and teleport around your VR space all in the app - even in the same scene.

I also like the \"curve\" that we can apply to an desktop, because it is horizontal only, wich in my opinion is better than a \"sphere\". Also, it is great to be able to load objects directly.\n\nMy 2 cents:\n- It would be nice that the App support 24bit PNG with transparency. This would allow a lot of creativity in the setup of a space.\n- Thumbnails in the filemanager would be usefull\n- create a desktop by selecting and existing window... It would be easyier than cropping manually the main desktop.\n- draw on a transparent surface, on in the \"air\" as in tiltbrush\n", "recommendationid": "29608620", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485879094, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "8", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501978797, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198140470590", "num_games_owned": 65, "playtime_forever": 124}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503848"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485539446, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "It took a minute to adjust to some of the controls, and while it's not entirely intuitive yet, I can see this getting -really- awesome if the devs keep at it.
