Ultimate management? All I got to do was purchase fuel and change prices in the cafeteria etc. I wish I spent my money on something else. I spent 27 minutes \"playing\" this game, and nothing ever happened except that I could see from my finances that I sold snacks to passengers which I never saw anything of. Watching the terminal inside is so unecessary when it's premade and nothing happens! I never found out if I could speed up the game. The clock counts seconds in real-time. My first flight was departing at 9:35, and the time was 8:40. I could just not stay an hour watching just to see it depart. I respect that making games takes hours and hours, but this is just too narrow with uninteresting extras. Who want's to purchase fuel and run a power plant if you're interested in just managing a busy airport (which you made busy by playing)? The time everything takes reminds me of free iPhone games. I would recommend Airport Inc./Tycoon 1. It get's god gamn annoying after a couple of hours playing but it's entertaining for the first two hours at least.", "recommendationid": "34449066", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503532515, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503531524, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198275850064", "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_forever": 27}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504534"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1504346909, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Got a refund due to the conflict with the creators restrictive licensing.
