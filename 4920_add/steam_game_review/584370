It was fun casual gaming, and I am looking for some relaxed easy games to play late in the evening to switch off. The problem is after playing a couple of games I just haven't returned to the game (and looking at time spent by reviewers it seems half of the people that enjoyed the game have had similar experience).\nThe equipment you make wears down and then breaks. So no matter how far you progress you seem to be running in order to stand still. Your clothes wear and break over time, your axes break from use... So you'll need to play the game well in order to keep a decent set of equipment. But I don't want that pressure - I was hoping for a more relaxing style of game (which the initial levels were).\nPerhaps the developers could consider some sort of 'easy' mode for the very casual gamers among us who don't want to be racing against breaking clothes all the time.", "recommendationid": "35053194", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505769544, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503435795, "num_reviews": 25, "steamid": "76561198063064475", "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_forever": 284}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513529"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504718153, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Well, I would recomend this game but I think some things could have a bit of an improvement:\n- The constant need to change everything you have is reeaaaaalllllyyy tedious if there was a way to get undestructible clothes like in the mobile version (could be found at the flying shop at a high Chits price or from challenges) that would really ease the burden.\n\nAlso it seems there are some of the clothes that are not available in the game", "recommendationid": "34779547", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504718153, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504985609, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198057875575", "num_games_owned": 173, "playtime_forever": 519}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499845"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504679549, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not really worth the full $15 dollar price tag, but buy it 100% if it's on sale.
