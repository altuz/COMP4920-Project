Sonic Mania[/h1] \n\nLemme preface by saying I\u2019ve been playing Sonic games since almost day one. [i]Sonic The Hedgehog[/i] on the good \u2018ol Mega Drive was the first game lil\u2019 Chimp owned (threw faeces at anyone trying to get close). Played at all the 16-bit classics back in the day, including [i]Sonic CD[/i].\n\nBack to [i]Sonic Mania[/i], aka The Best of 16-bit Sonic, now with all-new bonus tracks and remixes! Eh, story? Fat pillock Eggman is up to shenanigans. Yadda yadda, Chaos Emeralds, bla bla, Sonikku stop him, and so on. Don\u2019t bloody care, how is it as a game? Well, [i]Mania[/i] was made by Christian Whitehead, PagodaWest Games and Headcannon, big fans known in the community for making romhacks and enhanced ports. Promising, but on to the pros and cons, cuz that\u2019s how we roll.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It absolutely nails the feel and look of 16-bit Sonic like no other since the OGs. The physics are spot on. Same for the colorful sprite work and snappy animation. It\u2019s above the Mega Drive\u2019s capabilities, but not Saturn level either.\n[*]No bloody gimmicks! No clumsy motion controls, God of War style combat or 50.000 (give or take) gameplay types in 1. Just Sonic, Tails and Knuckles running through loops, jumping and grabbing rings. Pure and simple.\n[*]A mix of classic Zones and all-new ones. The old ones got expanded and have new tricks up their sleeves. Familiar, yet different, like a good remix. The new blend in almost seamlessly and actually have some series-original themes.\n[*]Even crummy Sonic usually has good music and [i]Mania[/i] delivers. Old tracks are lovingly remastered and got 2nd Act remixes, S3&K style. Likewise, the newcomers bounce with Mega Drive funk. \n[*]Bosses get their fun twists too. Some are veterans with fresh tricks, others are entirely new. One even has you change genre. It\u2019s not all good tho (more in the negatives)[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It\u2019s a short game. Around 2-4 hours for a first playthrough. Multiple routes, time attack and 3 characters add replayability, but a social life-destroying epic it ain\u2019t. Shortness is pretty inherent to 2D Sonic, but still something to consider before deciding to purchase.\n[*]Maybe a little overly reliant on nostalgia. The level ratio leans heavily towards the old. A more even split between classics and newcomers would\u2019ve been nice.\n[*]While most bosses are novel and fun, some can be obtuse the first time. It can be stressy figuring them out while the time limit nags you because you went exploring earlier. Some are annoying even if you do know the trick.\n[*]It has Denuvo DRM. Sega shoved it in, then failed to mention it\u2019s there. Oopsie. Please don\u2019t blame the devs. They\u2019re not happy with it either.\n[*]Where\u2019s friggin Ice Cap Zone? Such a fan favorite. I\u2019d happily trade in Flying Battery and Metallic Madness. Yes, I know it\u2019s petty and nitpicky, but the music is just so BOSS!.[/list]\n\nI loved [i]Sonic Mania[/i]. It\u2019s the throwback to classic 16-bit Sonic fans have been clamoring for. The Advance series made a valiant attempt, but wasn\u2019t quite on the mark. Sonic 4? Yeah, sorry, make room for the true successor. If it was all-new content, it would\u2019ve earned an easy 5 bananas. Mania seems to be selling well tho, so next time? Still, not bad at all for a game made by a bunch of ascended fans. Turns out all you need for good Sonic is people who care. Who knew? \n\n[b]I rate [i]Sonic Mania[/i] 4 out of 5 bananas.[/b]\n\nWelcome back Blue Blur. What took you?\n\nWhat my ratings mean:\n1 bananas - Crap. Turn around & don\u2019t look back.\n2 bananas - Bad. Not really worth it.\n3 bananas - Average. For fans of the genre or a sale.\n4 bananas - Good. Won't waste your time.\n5 bananas - Superb.

I wanted to love this game, but I can't give it a thumbs up.\n\nThe levels are huge with loads to explore but you'll want to find the giant rings to get the emeralds. The 9:59 time limit still remains. There is no reason for this. I get it, Sonic is meant to be a fast game... but why punish the player for taking the time to explore as Knuckles or Tails? Because that's how the older games did it and Sega are like Pavlovs dog by this point. If they deviate from the Sonic 2/3/&K formula, they get hate, so they stuck rigid, even to things that don't work and never did.\n\nAlso, they chose to include the worst bonus levels from the franchise, specifically the one you need to do to get the Chaos Emeralds. If you never played Sonic CD they will feel even worse. Even if you did, it feels clunky and poorly designed. Some gaps in this mode can be jumped over, others have invisible walls which will bounce you backwards. They are nearly impossible to distinguish from one another because everything is rendered onto a flat plane. These levels feel like a chore every time and drag the whole game down with it. (Fail the bonus game and want to try again without having to spend minutes looking for another giant ring and risking a time over? Too bad, it autosaved that you used that giant ring even if you didn't finish the level so you can't soft/hard reset and try again). If this was to stop people spamming attempts then that is at odds with being able to use the level select and just repeat Emerald Hill over and over until that save file has all the Emeralds.\n\nFinally... gimmicks. Every level seems to be loaded with a gimmick. Some feel fine and make sense like bouncy goo on Chemical Plant, others are downright annoying like getting frozen solid every few seconds so the game can railroad you into sliding along a set path. You can unfreeze yourself to try and take a better path, but only after hammering the jump button for several seconds. When this happens five times in a minute, you just give up trying. I can only imagine this was their effort to make Sonic feel fresh... It doesn't work.\n\nWhat I'm not mentioning is all the good this game has in it. Music as usual is great, levels are very pretty, animation is solid. Level design, when not lifted wholesale from previous games, is so-so. But you know this already. It's like a Final Fantasy game. You don't have to mention the music is great to justify why you think story is batshit crazy or how linear it is. Some things are a given. \n\nIn summary, this feels like a very well built fan game. Appropriate given who made it. Maybe my standards were too high.\n\nI will gradually keep trying to work my way through this game, but I can't get through more than one level without finding something irritating enough to make me stop. (Most recently a bug that caused the music to stop playing). Hopefully one day I will remove this review or change it to a thumbs up... or better yet, Steam will add a 'meh' option.\n\n(Edit: I used this game as the subject of a critical analysis in game design and discovered that my student had never played any Sonic games before. Therefore he did not know about pressing down while running or spindashing. He reached a point where there as a destructible wall and had no way to get passed it. The game assumes you should have knowledge of it's mechanics before you play it.
