We are in the Russian Spetsnaz, that means we kick serious bum!\n\n2. I honestly like to start a freak show, I would just put my units at the door, pew pew then die.\n\n3. The guns are awesome.\n\nNow to the cons,:\n\n1. You can only buy one thing.\n\n2. The game doesnt get updated that often, thats why I actually have bugs.\n\n3. My computer lags to this game.
