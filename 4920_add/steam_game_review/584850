First of all, they have several different VR backgrounds and most of them are really well done.  So you get a nice scenic view.  There's 1 card draw or 3 card draw solitaire for solo play.  And there's Power Solitaire for multiplayer.  I didn't get to play power solitaire but the solo solitaire is exactly as I remember it, only in VR.  \n\nI can't say the game is better than the Windows Solitaire, but it just feels better because it's in VR and you actually get to use your motion controller to move cards around so it just feels more immersive.  My only complaint is that the in-game music could have more variety.  The game looks and runs perfectly though.   It even keeps up with your game history.\n\nI did have to hold on to change change position for the deck of cards to show up at the start.  Not sure if that was a bug.\n\nRating 9/10 Heck of a deal for sale price of $2.49 if you like Solitaire", "recommendationid": "35096427", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505963771, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505963439, "num_reviews": 210, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 75}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 5, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_positive": 5}}
