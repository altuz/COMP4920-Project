It certainly gives you a goal; clear the path for your train. This is a good objective except for the fact that it's so easily interchangable between other things (unlock the door, turn on the light, play the game, Etc.). Actually driving the train isn't fun, it's a lot of swinging your head around to grab coal and then throwing your headset off your face. It's basically a minigame that involves managing your fuel and heat, all while fighting drones. The drones are not well designed enemies. They're loud, attack with slow projectiles that must be dodged, and can only be killed by slowly moving them into the environment with a gravity gun rip off. There are bugs that completely break the game, puzzle element fall out of existence and from what I can tell, only some of them are set to respawn when leaving the map.\n\nIt's too short for too much money. The game ends abruptly with you learning your name is Harper before the credits just end. This game should be free, The Red Stare is free and it looks better, plays better, and actually has interesting puzzles in it! This should be a demo AT MOST. \n\ntl;dr\n\nPros: looks sort of nice in it's own way, puzzles suitable for kids, kind of scary in some bits\n\nCons: gimmicky train mechanic, buggy and broken, just feels bad in the way it plays, obnoxious enemies with no variations, too short, 10 DOLLARS.", "recommendationid": "35262785", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506607983, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 89, "last_played": 1506606549, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198044465976", "num_games_owned": 166, "playtime_forever": 89}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 55, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 50}}
