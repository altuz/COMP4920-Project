[/h1]\nI like the art style, although it is a bit inconsistent (different art styles for different characters). I like how characters grow, not only in description, but their sprites also reflects that [spoiler] Why Lair's though? Wasn't he like 70 already?[/spoiler] What I don't get are those panty shots and pin-ups. I'm more than fine with some teasing and even straight up adult content, but usually images like that fit to the context of the game. \"Amber's Magic Shop\" isn't too much focused on sex (although it seems to try). It's just a very plain romance story with fantasy setting, tiring alchemy sections and \"main plot\" going on in the background. \n\n[h1]Characters. [/h1]\nGood ideas, that came out wrong. You have prince with daddy issues, you have your best friend, who should marry said prince, you have vampire that wants to be human, mercenary, that has too high ambitions and gets more and more paranoid, you have two relatives in love and your mentor's son. All of that could be a start of a great story and interesting relationships. Sadly, characters are very one-dimensional and inconsistent. For example, Lair [spoiler] who, despite his age, blushes and stutters just because Amber decided to wear more revealing dress, has no issues whatsoever, to undress his fiance in the public library AND without her explicit consent[/spoiler]. Also, we don't have enough time to get to know these characters. You met each of them about ten times during the game and every one of those meetings is short and very rarely offers anything interesting.\n\n[h1]Story. [/h1]\nIt's nothing outstanding, but the core concept is fine. You're an alchemist. There's a blight. Find a cure for the blight. All of that would be good, if not for the cardinal sin of this game, which is...\n\n[h1]Terrible writing. [/h1]\nIt's shocking. I mean, this is a 20\u20ac visual novel form experienced studio, yet there were times, when I was just shaking my head, baffled by what I was reading. Dialogues are awful. Characters repeat each other way to often. For example (it's not quote from the game, but my take on character repeating themselves, which happens all the time):\nA: I like it.\nB: Okay. I was curious.\nA: I know. I just like it.\nThere are ton of situations like that. Not only that, most of conversations are just boring and lead to nothing, other than giving us, ultimately meaningless, choice. \n\n[h1]Sex scenes. [/h1]\nPart of the poor writing. They are literally the worst. I either felt highly uncomfortable [spoiler] Lynn and Lair's library scene[/spoiler] or confused [spoiler]Amber's night with Camosa and Reed[/spoiler]. Some of them came out of nowhere, other felt like they were written as a part of some terrible fanfiction. I expected Amber to have form some sort of bond with these characters. And I expected a choice. This game gives you neither.\n\n[h1]Break-up scenes. [/h1]\nI like the idea. I really do. Some of it was nicely done, especially when you chose to break up with someone later on (after, you know, you actually DID date them). But early on? I was so confused when Amber said to Daniel (who I had like one or two scenes in her adult life so far and it was mentioned that they haven't see each other very often), that they need to stop dating. And he seemed genuinely disappointed. I'm sorry, when exactly this whole \"dating\" thing happen? Why have I not seen it? Same goes for Bernard. God, guy just asked me to make him some stupid talisman, was pushy and unfriendly and somehow I find out that we were actually going out? It's extremely confusing.\n\n[h1]Endings.[/h1]\nNot only are they sudden, unsatisfying and without any real build-up. Not only \"main story\" endings are just few sentences of description, that do not link in any way with your romance ending. Not only you don't get any epilogue or nothing of that sort. No. Even romance endings are terrible. Bernard light plus endings, is not only extremely cliche, but done so badly, that I was surprised that's even possible [spoiler] Oh, so you tell me you suddenly found out that you're in love with me. And we just going to get it on, without discussing your behavior and growing paranoia. Great! It's nice to know, that all those conversations were really building up to something![/spoiler]. There are \"dark\" and \"light\" endings and, again, I like the core concept, but someone clearly didn't think this through. You can't have dramatic moments without relationship that you're invested in or characters that you care about.\n\n[h1]Protagonist.[/h1] \nAll I know about Amber is that she is dark elf, raised by a witch, that likes alchemy and is, apparently, dating half of the town. I have no idea what sort of personality she has and choices the game gave me didn't allow me to shape her in any meaningful way. \n\n[h1]Alchemy system. [/h1]\nThis is something that many people will have issues with, but for me, it was really the minor offence, compared with other faults that this game posses. You can turn it off, but I don't recommend it, since the whole balance of the story is off and the game finishes almost as quickly as it begun - especially if you disable some romance options. Again, that was a nice idea. I like mini games in visual novels, I like stat raising, I like all of that, when it's well done. Here, I was bored to death and annoyed. Instead of giving us option to try different ingredients and see what comes of it, instead of giving us some form of market and more clients and option to actually, you know, RUN our \"Magic Shop\" (it's in the tittle, God damn it!), you start by preparing for test and then have one client few other days with repeating, boring recipes that you've done dozens of times already.\n\n[b]In short: Really bad writing, tiring alchemy system, bland characters and lack of actual romance.

Not at it's current price, or any price. The game sells itself as a visual with an Alchemy crafting system, to help tell the story and to fill the space between the visual novel sections. However, what the game is in reality is 95% Alchemy and 5% visual novel. That's way to much filler if you ask me.\n\nBut thats not the end of it. The Alchemy system is a barebones as it can be, with the player simply choosing a recipe, selecting what items to use and then crafting the item, only to then sell whatever item they have made for money. That's it. The only reason the 'Alchemy' mechanic is in the game is to serve as filler to make the game seem longer than it is. It's not fleshed out, or interesting. It's purely there to make the game seem longer so that the developers can justify a higher price.\n\nThe visual novel side of things is also terrrible. The characters are bland. The interactions are lifeless. And the player made choices are so... bizare in how they affect the characters (Which they dont really do.) The game tries to sell the player an 'alignment' system to make the visual novel side of things more interesting. But again, similar to the Alchemy system, is purely there the pad out the game. It doesn't make the characters more interesting. It doesn't make the choices anymore meaningful. It is again, a mechanic that was only added to help justify a larger price tag. The developers care so little about this game that they didn't even add a proper ending. The game just... ends. No credits, no nothing. Not even an epilogue for the character you chose to romance. It's just a cash grab and you're not missing out on anything by avoiding it.
