As others have said, it's probably the most successfully implemented FMV game ever made, which isn't really that high of a mountain to climb. In fact, it's probably more successful as a movie than as a game. There's not much \"play\" in it, and what there is is fatally undermined by the design.\n\nThe theme of the game, spelled out by the protagonist in the opening narration, is that choices define who you are. And more specifically they define who you are internally - your reason for making a certain decision is, in many ways, more important than what the decision actually was. \n\nThis is made clear right from the start when the protagonist lets himself be the last person on the bus. The game asks you to decide if you are doing it A) selflessly (to politely let everyone board,) or B) selfishly (because you know that the last person on will be the first person off.) Your action doesn't change - only the internal reason for the choice changes. \n\nThis plays out across the larger plot of the game, and also in some of the smaller, encapsulated scenes within it - some choices can steer you away from some events, but there are certain beats of the story that you can't \"decide\" your way out of. They can change you internally, but they can't alter the course of your life. It's an interesting angle for a game to take, probably partially inspired by the limitations of the medium.\n\nThe directing and acting, and cinematography are all surprisingly good. This was obviously filmed by a team that knew what they were doing. The story is a little weak, in that there doesn't really seem to be an arc of any kind - if your character has changed as a result of the choices you've made on his behalf, the game doesn't articulate it in any way. I think it would have been more thematically impactful if the different endings were tied to some kind of character growth, or regression, not just who lives and dies or who gets money and doesn't. Instead it's kind of just a bunch of stuff that happens.\n\nAnd speaking of the alternate endings, that's my one serious criticism - it is a brutal slog to try and experience the alternate endings. I know they're proud of their work and don't want you to skip it, but they're asking a lot of the player to expect them to watch the same hour-long movie multiple times just to see a couple of new scenes each time.\n\nThey should add a feature that lets you skip any video clip that you've already seen. That way you'd still have to watch the movie (and I can understand why they'd feel that way) but you wouldn't have to watch the same 30 minutes of footage a half-dozen times. It's a nearly fatal flaw of game-design, because the replays are pretty much all this game has to offer. \n\nWithout any kind of reflection at the end to review what the consequences of the decisions were for the protagonist, the only way you have to measure the impact of what you decided is to play the game again and compare results. And the way they've designed the game, replaying is severely discouraged. \n\nSo even though I think it was a successful film, I wouldn't really recommend it to people looking for a game to play.", "recommendationid": "34778344", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504714350, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504659695, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561197970409875", "num_games_owned": 129, "playtime_forever": 578}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525045"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 10, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504604219, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Absolutely loved it!

It's not quite a game to be honest. It's FMV, how they call it, so I truly believe that you don't need any explanation on whataheck this is, if you are already here. So, to be honest, I played this game, cause I am a really big fan of 'choices matter' games and I want to make sure that I won't miss any titles in this genre. However, I am so unlucky in these games. For the some reason, every time I play it for the first time without any guides, I always get a shittiest ending among all possible endings. Then, if the game really hooked me up, I play it few more times to see other endings with a help of the guides. \n\nIn this case, I wasn't so impressed about this game. Everything looked dull to me, actors were mediocre, story was sooooo typical and so obvious, that I didn't even feel any sympathize to any of the characters. But I was still excited of being the one who can tail the whole story, so I was so mad at myself, when I got the worst ending from all the endings possible. Speaking of that, I got it doing everything right, you know like a true man with a big heart, thinking of other people and consequences - you should think about it, leason learned for me anyway :)\n\nSo, okay, to sum everything up, you should really grab this game if you really feel exhausted after work so you just wanna get home and sit relaxing in front of your monitor, watching a movie and clicking on some options, which seems legit for you. One complete walkthough/ending can take max 30-40 minutes and then you can start over to try something different yourself or help yourself with a guide.", "recommendationid": "35221901", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506432782, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 135, "last_played": 1506234458, "num_reviews": 27, "steamid": "76561198049379938", "num_games_owned": 1743, "playtime_forever": 940}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506220"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505374288, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "great everyone should take", "recommendationid": "34943944", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505374288, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505407339, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198256145859", "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_forever": 178}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505650"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505816094, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Why can't we have more games like this?", "recommendationid": "35061603", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505816094, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505131954, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561197985634335", "num_games_owned": 199, "playtime_forever": 486}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503162"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505349345, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is so exciting.
