So in this review i'm going to lay out what this app does, why i refunded it and why i believe tilt brush is better anyway. I used the oculus rift with touch controllers on Windows 10 64bit with a GTX 1070 gpu.\n\nThe app aims to fill a real need: It provides a whiteboard on which you can handwrite (with smooting options so that your writing is pleasantly legible), a few combinations of marker colour and thickness (it may state 750 combinations on the store page but i'll explain later why it's still \"few\") and the ability to insert pdf pages and pictures.\n\nPROS:\n[list]\n[*]The interface is beautiful. You have a movable whiteboard in front of you, a file inserting menu on your left and can bring up a quick inventory of markers/erasers by pressing the thumbstick (click again to bring up the full inventory of all markers).\n[*]You can quickly (note: see cons #2) insert a photo or pdf page. Just turn to your left and there's the corresponding menu, with a simple but beautiful interface of flipping through your files. Also, Tilt Brush doesn't support pdf files - you'll have to convert them into pictures first.\n[*]Infinite space to write on. \n[/list]\n\nCONS:\n[list]\n[*]Despite the beauty of the interface it isn't as fast as Tilt Brush. In order to move the Whiteboard you have to access a menu, while Tilt Brush allows you to do that on the spot by pressing both grip buttons. To change the colour and thickness of your marker you have to click twice and choose from a menu and while the selection of colours and thickness is adequate, it's still limiting compared to Tilt Brush, where you can literally use any colour and thickness imaginable. \n[*]The file insertion interface can easily become cluttered if you have a lot of pdf's and pictures. You can only place your files in the documents folder, as the app doesn't (yet?) see any subfolders you create. Even worse, each page in a pdf document is presented as a seperate picture in this interface, so it'd be extremely difficult for example to find a specific page amongst 10 100-page pdf document's.\n[*]Although the app offers infinite space to write on, you're still restricted to 2 dimensions. That means that the chief advantage of this app over a regular 2d pc app is the immersion that vr offers. With Tilt Brush you can create a 3-dimensional whiteboard, which is critical for huge projects (although more difficult to export).\n[*]Bugs and crashes. This is what originally made me give up on this app. The app usually didn't exit correctly for me, no matter if i used the exit button from within the app or closed it through the steam interface. Trying to restart the app (through steam or the oculus app) would sometimes work just fine, but other times it crashed steam or displayed a message that the app was already running. Also, the Inserted documents and marker thickness were never saved correctly between sessions. Pdf pages would change position and size, while my writings would get thinner (!) with every restart, to the point they were barely legible. Also, the app was usually (and randomly) unable to \"see\" the documents that i had placed in my documents folder.\n[*]One last minor con is that the developer, although somewhat active on others' discussion threads, didn't reply to any of my own. Granted, devs are busy people that are better off devoting their time to improving their apps, but in these early days of vr i've found most developers more communicative.\n[/list]\n\nTIP ON HOW TO USE TILT BRUSH INSTEAD:\n\nFirst of all select throught the menu the \"white\" environment/background, which will make black text very legible. On tilt brush there's a menu you can bring up that contains among others a cubical \"guide\". Once placed in space, you can select among many useful markers (that automatically smooth out your writings) or highlighters and write on this guide. You can have as many guides as you like (and toggle them on/off at will), which will keep things tidy even in 3d space and in huge projects. Be sure to keep all objects aligned horizontally and vertically (i believe by pressing the A button while moving them).", "recommendationid": "34141346", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502352903, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502208646, "num_reviews": 26, "steamid": "76561198081159072", "num_games_owned": 265, "playtime_forever": 51}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494900"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1501721071, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "video glitches every time I load this.

If you are in need of a whiteboard VR app that lets you focus free of distractions, this is the one for you.  I have used it already to create videos explaining complex topics I deal with professionally, and I see several hundreds/thousands of hours more.  I'm not going to get into the technical bits of the app itself (at least not too much).  Let's focus on how this helps someone like me who is easily distracted, a visual person, and someone who needs the proper environment to conceptualize and communicate complex abstract ideas.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I face in the workplace is constant distraction.  Be that ambient noise, the state of cleanliness, or just the mental attachment to the private office environment.  Most people can tune these out, but I don't have that luxury.  Having a headset that blocks my visual and auditory awareness of my environment helps, but the pure sanitariness of this application removes other distractions that would be present in VR apps that choose to model a simulated environment around a static whiteboard.\n\nNow, lets talk about the actual writing experience.  In short, it is about as realistic as you can get.  The haptic feedback and smoothness really go a long way to immersing me in the moment and therefore reduces that distraction.  I love that there are a plethora of colors and tip sizes.\n\nFor demonstration and recording, the secondary window giving you a head-on view of the whiteboard.  I find the general feel and approach optimal.  I have critiques here though (below).  I highly recommend you limit using your HMD as a camera source as it makes your viewers nauceous.  Instead, record the secondary whiteboard.\n\nCritiques/Wishlist\n=================\nThere are minor bugs (like some text not wanting to erase or undo).  Also, you really need to be careful about scaling your whiteboard.  When you are writing, what you will see will be constant, but on the scale of the secondary window it will cause some drawings to be illegible.  Try to avoid a large amout of scale, and you may want to find interim solutions until the developer creates some kind of reference/scale factor you can see/control in the app for keeping things consistent.\n\nThe primary buzzkill I hope to see resolved is the (seemingly) inability to control where you are on the secondary whiteboard in relation to where you are physically in real-space.  Also, you don't seem to have the ability to scale your hands/view to be bigger or smaller on the whiteboard.  This means that in my \"medium\" playspace (defined by Oculus), I can only realistically use 1/3 of the width and 1/2 of the height of the playspace the app is considering.  It also is on the lower right corner where I would prefer left-top corner (in most instances) or the middle-right (in a drawing linearly).  \n\nBasically, it would be nice to choose scaling and positioning of playspace of this secondary whiteboard window.  This is because I intend to make heavy use of it for pre-recorded content.  In my experience, the less I have to move the board around the better.  This is pronounced when you speed a recording up to (I do 10x speedup so the handwriting matches my narration speed).\n\nConclusion\n==========\nI kinda went hard on the secondary window thing, but that's because I see this application being invaluable as a tool in my workplace.
