Boy, was I wrong.  \n\nKind of a bummer its called a \"Simulator\" yet you have Predator vision on animals, you get Call of Duty style \"X\" when you land a hit and the graphics looks like it should be on the Xbox.  Not the 360, the original Xbox.  \n\nNormally I wouldnt be so harsh on developers since I understand games are art and they take time and peoples life to make.  But this is a crap cash grab simplying banking on the \"Simulator\" name.  \n\nShame on you, Devs.  Uninstalled, refunded and I wish I could have those precious 20 minutes of my life back.", "recommendationid": "33444068", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499732047, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499731709, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561197987044273", "num_games_owned": 218, "playtime_forever": 18}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503652"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 11, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1501815414, "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Despite the negative reviews I've seen on here; I havent' had any issues or bugs with the game so far. Might be due to the latest patch that came out. I like this game mainly because your not shooting hordes of animals in an arcade style setting. It's not really hunting if 20 animals are running toward you in every scenario. This game sort of reminds me of Cabela's earlier hunting games where you actually had to find and stalk animals. The visual quality of the game is pretty decent in my opinion. Sure beats Hunting Unlimited's graphics by a long shot. Most hunts seem easy once you figure out a certain routine of how to play it, (not gonna spoil it for ya). This is only with my experience of playing it on easy and medium difficulties thus far. But yeah I find it to be a pretty decent game so far and would recommend it.", "recommendationid": "34006743", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501815414, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505269353, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561197993832703", "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 3250}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491292"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 12, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1502129954, "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game is not so bad it may not look as good as the hunter but it still is pretty. You dont have to pay to hunt any of the animals simply just do the missions to progress. The overall gameplay could still use some work I will admit but, other than that the game is not so bad.
