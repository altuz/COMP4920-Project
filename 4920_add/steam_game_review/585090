I would just love to play this game and finish the main quest if it didn't crash-all-the-time. Accidentally pressing a button that doesn't have any assignment: crash. Press F12 for a screenshot in steam: restart the game. Look funny: crash.\n\nI would love to see this work, but it doesn't. Please fix these weird crashes and I will replay and recommend this game. :)", "recommendationid": "35380970", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506863165, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1506862812, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561197972132272", "num_games_owned": 592, "playtime_forever": 7}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 0}}
