I was swept up in the story, enjoying every turn of phrase, and losing my sense of time.  I really enjoyed the beauty of the whole experience.  I'm recommending it to all my friends.  I am thoroughly thrilled with Open Sorcery, and hope to see more games from this creator.  I don't want to say too much and give anything away.  Enjoy the plot.\n\n  Note: I played this game in offline mode, so the mere 0.5 hour logged at the time of the review does not reflect the many hours and multiple run throughs that I have done.  I'm not an \"achievement hunter\" or \"completionist replayer\" type, yet I was drawn in by hints of different endings, and found the prose so enjoyable that I wanted to see as many options as possible.  \n\nThere was a slight spot of frustration in one area that might have been from a small glitch - game side or user error unknown!  In this case I was glad that others had posted walkthroughs so I could just carry on, instead of continuing to waste efforts over a misconception.", "recommendationid": "34171084", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502467459, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502466108, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198129264669", "num_games_owned": 84, "playtime_forever": 31}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504499861, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Just finished my first playthrough.
