It is so much fun, the variety of maps are great and they all are unique. I would love to see this game have a plethora of maps with all the same uniqueness that they have right now. It's very satisfying to beat the crap out of the other jellies, which all have wonderful models. \n\nIf you like Gang Beasts, you'd love this - the developers actually care and are interested in making a game with promising updates thus far. \n\nMy only suggestions - \n\n* I would love to have a grab function, I really enjoy grabbing and dragging other players into traps! \n\n* Destructible environment: I think this will be something that has to be added eventually to keep the maps unique, but glass/boxes/other destructible objects would be so fun to smash other players through. \n\n* More prominent instructions on how the game works - there isn't really information in-game that tells you what the controls are, especially on maps that have interaction like the barn/tractor - I wasn't sure how to really move the tractor efficiently lol, kind of just moved back in forth in an inch space. I think a simple in-game background control scheme for the unique objects per map would be good (i.e. have buttons floating in the background of the barn map showing how to use the tractor) - this would make it very seamless. \n\n* I'm very hopeful for a multiplayer mode, and the developer has already let it be known that this is in the works. I could see this as a real seller once that is implemented. \n\nOtherwise, this game is incredible, especially for the price tag. It's UI is very well made, the models are incredibly fun and I love the cartoonish animation of everything. I've only played for about thirty minutes and I've had so many funny events happen already. \n\nGood job developers, count me as part of the community!", "recommendationid": "32226383", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1496778440, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498433933, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198036002101", "num_games_owned": 192, "playtime_forever": 403}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504711"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1498835846, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "cool and fun", "recommendationid": "33042758", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498835846, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499461994, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198399879773", "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 289}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1495499162, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is a great game!
