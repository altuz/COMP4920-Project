It's not a long game but you will be playing it more than once if you hope to get all of the achievements. Your time may vary depending on how good you are at puzzle games. I think the pricing is fair for what the game offers.\n\nThe English voice acting is kind of meh but it's obvious that the actors are not native English speakers so I forgive it. The accents can even be immersive at times given the subject matter.\n\nI recommend this game if you enjoy short-ish puzzle games with achievements, the study of alchemy, or both.", "recommendationid": "30038570", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487520696, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487518323, "num_reviews": 17, "steamid": "76561198085441094", "num_games_owned": 169, "playtime_forever": 287}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510894"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 9, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487450495, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I enjoyed this game so much, both the atmosphere and story are awesome!

I am not sure if they have an advanced version that I don't have or if they just never played an Adventure game that is true to form.  There is nothing special about the game play or puzzles. If you have played ANY puzzle game then you have seen all the puzzles before MANY MANY times. This game is really nothing more than watching a movie that you have seen a hundred times and expecting a different outcome. There is really NO originality at all. The quality from graphics to voicing is very mediocre to be generous. Unity 2 allows for amateurs to make games that really suffer in story, quality, creativeness and graphics. It is unfortunate for both the gamer and those who truly want to make a good challenging game. We all suffer except for those who make garbage like this.", "recommendationid": "30677939", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1490230342, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490228949, "num_reviews": 51, "steamid": "76561198013274120", "num_games_owned": 361, "playtime_forever": 235}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500516"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1488561498, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pros \n\n- Well thought puzzles\n- Good graphics for an indie game\n- Simple UI and simple controls\n\nCons\n\n- NPCs talk too slowly, it's very annoying\n- Game is too short for its price\n- A lot of typos and mispronunciations\n- Story is kinda disconnected and it doesn't have much to do with puzzles", "recommendationid": "30298229", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503170867, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488560578, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198024410069", "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_forever": 117}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499949"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_positive": 3}}
