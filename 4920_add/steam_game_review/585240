The future that never was.  The neat things are of course the digitized voice, and CD audio sound track.  It pushed 286 class machines & real mode MS-DOS to it's limits.  Back in the day, this game was a nightmare to configure as it needed quite a bit of real mode.  A DOS Extender would have gone a LONG LONG way in furthing it's acceptance, or perhaps a Windows port.  Sadly neither happened.\n\nSo what we have here is a rather poor CD-RIP, with ogg samples of the audio, and the bare minimum files needed to play the game.  Not that I really need the MechWarrior 2 demo, but it would have been cool.\n\nNow the bad.\n\nThis is the MS-DOS CD version, and has zero integration with steam.  It's simply the Sierra DOSBox launcher, DOSBox 0.74 and a simple launcher.  The default MIDI sound horrible on Windows 10, however you can edit dosboxRTZ_single.conf and run midiconfig to set a different output.  Since the game offers zero integration, no screen shots, no streams, no cards, no nothing.  I'm surprised they didn't use the SCUMMVM version that can play this, as it would offer a much nicer environment.  Otherwise, it's the GOG version, no changes, nothing.\n\nOtherwise, yeah it's great, take good care of your bonding plant!", "recommendationid": "33226475", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499167780, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "last_played": 1506571219, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561197995742296", "num_games_owned": 501, "playtime_forever": 349}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_positive": 7}}
