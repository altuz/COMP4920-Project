He lacks any real character and at best can be described as \"common\", \"annoying\", \"whiny\" and only occasionally \"witty\". I suppose it makes him relatable but it's only a matter of time until he annoys the hell out of you, especially if he keeps dying because of random choices.\n\nYes, the choices. This is the perfect example of bad and meaningless choices that all CYOA games should avoid. For every situation, there are only two choices, and 90% of the time the choice is whether to go \"left\" or \"right\". That's it. You'll spend hours telling the protagonist to go in one direction or the other without any meaningful interactions. The protagonist then continiously asks you whether you are absolutely sure you want him to go this way and continues to whine. If you ignore his whining, congratulations. Most of the time, he'll end up dead and you'll have to replay a large chunk of the game.\n\nLastly, the story. What starts as an interesting space horror/mystery rapidly devolves into some typical b-movie and ends. Without spoiling anything, I was both surprised and dissapointed by the ending, having wandered in space for many days before reaching a quick and unsatisfying conclusion.\n\nOh, and if you want a good CYOA game with similiar mechanics but better story, mystery and real choices, you should play \"Lost Crew\" instead.", "recommendationid": "33038940", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498829788, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498869916, "num_reviews": 18, "steamid": "76561197996101648", "num_games_owned": 545, "playtime_forever": 2602}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502873"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 10, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1498592759, "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game forces you to wait for a real long time (in real time) in order to advance... \nWTF!!!\nSo only buy this game if you like waiting.", "recommendationid": "32881961", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498592759, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498855699, "num_reviews": 35, "steamid": "76561198102180482", "num_games_owned": 4581, "playtime_forever": 184}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480478"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 9, "total_reviews": 22, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 13}}
