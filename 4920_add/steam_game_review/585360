I can't recommend it.  Now if you really want to play a mobile tower defence game on PC then then sure go ahead.\n\nCons:\n* Time gated mechanics.  Upgrades and rewards are delayed by real time like in mobile games.  Can skip time delay by spending crystal resource which would typically be the purchased resource on mobile but doesn't seem to be option to purchase here.\n* No options other than audio levels and fullscreen or windowed.  Can't change resolution or anything else.\n* Tutorial popup windows tend to block actual information on screen preventing you from really understanding what's happening.\n* Made for touch screen interface so incredibly simplistic and doesn't understand things like right clicking or other actions that are intuitive on PC for getting information or options.  Lots of drag and drop actions required.\n\nPros:\n* Nice art style\n* Seems to be a decent number of cards though haven't played enough to get a feel for how different or useful they all are.\n* Quick and easy to jump right into playing\n\nOverall I wouldn't recommend.  It's cheap but it's not really a game that's worth the time to me and I don't like games that disrespect my time by gating mechanics with timers.

I thought, huh, it has been while since I had tried a tower defense game, especially one with some form of meta customisation so I thought I would give it a go. At first? Solid enough, I loved the initial carddraw mechanics and gradual raise in power as you went and combined more and more cards. Every hour you even got an increasingly large card reward with some \"legendaries\" which certainly helped.\n\nBut then I hit it, that wall. Suddenly upon reaching the first survial match I went from getting all 3 stars to getting 1 star. Without getting three stars I had no more gem income, without gem income I couldn't \"buy\" the card packs. So I was basically farming the survival match getting one new random mech piece (and one random pointless area attack thing). I couldnt reach the gems level, so I couldnt farm cards. The game had slowed down to a crawl in more ways then one however. \n\n\n=== This section has now been fixed. Though, they should have included an additional way to earn when they removed the hourly rewards===\nThere is a combination system, which, at first seemed really good. Until you realise that each lvl 1 combine takes 1 min, then each level 2 combine takes 2 mins, and so on. It may not seem like much, but once you have a large number of cards from either booster packs or from the \"hourly gifts\" these add up. Dramatically. Add in the fact that the actual number of cards and towers is pitifully low- the game is definately a miss. \n\nHow could they fix it? For one, remove the combination time- this isn't a f2p mobile game anymore, the main use of gems should be purely pack pulls. Also add a \"combine all\" button so we can combine our whole inventory in one push. When I started to get cards it became stupidly tedious to combine. \n=====\n\nSecondly, the game gets stale rather quickly, I suggest adding new rarities to the towers. Everything else has four rarties but towers has none. They are all \"common\" and a single (useless) legendary factory that takes far FAR too long to repay itself. If there were different levels of rarity I could stack my favourite kinds of towers and hopefully get lucky with a better form as time goes on. In a similar vein, I would remove the gem reward for 3star, replace it with something else, and make a smaller repetitive gem reward for beating levels. This would open the door to further gem purchases such as metaupgrades and new booster pack varieites that would help the game stay fresher longer. \n\nThere are a lot of levels, a lot of broader playtime content, but the game far too quickly runs out of content on the tower front and it becomes more about combining and little more. Which is also the single most annoying part. If there were additional rarties of towers, then the choices would really start to matter. Do I want the legendary gattling tower that is stupidly OP and has a tiny number of upgrade slots right now, or the one that starts a little weaker but can be powered up. You could even add additional upgrades to rarer towers to make them more useful, but that isn't too important. In a similar vain, it would also be cool if max upgrades were not 100% decided based on level of tower- if I have a level 4 tower I may want to invest 4 points into one side of the upgrade tree and not touch the other- however the current system is simply linear and removes choice and even a lot of the value in upgrading cards.\n\nOverall, it has promise. The fact they did remove the timers does make the game more \"playable\", so I must praise them for that. Who knows, they introduce another patch I may be able to change my review.

Out of those cards you can pick towers, units, or quick use defenses. This was a unique feature that not many games use currently. You could then upgrade the towers played once you deployed them to preset places.\nWhile the game itself is somewhat enjoyable, the lack of information and lack of options during a map to place towers (your given preset placement options) that most tower defense and building games give is a deal breaker for me.\nThe further into the game i got the more I realized I was going to keep being limited by the maps forced placements, the RNG that is the ingame booster packs and the fact that I had to grind a few times to ugprade towers through their combining system is what makes me give this game do not recommend. \n\nAs for the lack of information. You could see how much damage a unit could do, you could upgrade units and towers to do more damage. What you could NOT do is see how much health was left on a minion going down the lanes. Yes they had a health bar but unless you counted each time a tower shot at them you could not tell how much HP was left on that unit. And when there is 10 units tightly packed sometimes the health bars overlapped or looked like they were merged so it was hard to tell where to bolster defenses.\n\nAudio issues was one of the other deal breakers for me. If multiple of the same sound was played at the same time it would not play them all at once but instead multiply the sound level by however many units shot at once. IE if 5 units fired their gun at the same time you would hear the gunshots at 5x the volume instead of 5 gunshot sounds being heard at once.\n\nFinal issue is the fact that you had to spend an ingame currency, that you earned by beating a level without getting hurt, to upgrade your tower cards and unit cards unless you waited out a timer that is ever increasing based on upgrade level. I am told that the newest patch removed the timer and currency putting said timer to 1 second yet I had already spent a good amount and the patch did not refund me after said patch. Meaning I would have to restart my profile in order to recoup what i had spent.

But also there are major additions to overall strategy and in every battle tactics:\n- we're allowed to chose wich towers or heroes we want on every location - we pick them as cards to fill a limitied deck. Yes, towers and heroes and other stuff - cards here\n- every hero, tower and robot part (see below) are subject to upgrades (simply by stacking cards of same level in separate interface we may craft a higher level card)\n- winning round rewards differently depending on how good you performed - additional cards or crystals and crystals are very useful. E.g. to revive hero on the battlefield or remove wait timer on cards crafting. Crystal can also be used as currency in ingame store (no real money microtransactions included) to buy sets of cards.\n- survival mode! It is very very praiseworthy mode to vary the game expierence.\n\n- we can defend our base entrance with huge steam-powered robot as our last defence line; and we may upgrade that robot's systems - weapons, armor, power sources\n- we can't sell towers that were once placed though\n\nAll that provides times more strategies to develope than usual wich is amazing.\n\nAlso, there is some sort of passive rewards for a time spent in game - cards with upgrades drops every hour and the longer you play the game the more rare cards you get. It is convinient for a strategy there we usually lose the count to hours, righ?\n\nBack to arts - there are some aminated cut scenes telling us the story behind our rebellion, but so far I just learnt the type of next round boss from these. Judging on a lo-o-ong road through the world map, there are many battles to win before we get to the final of this steampunk story which is exciting for such a humble price!\n\nInterfaces are nice and intuitive, tutorial is in place and it is both short and informative, so you won't be confused to learn how operate the game.
