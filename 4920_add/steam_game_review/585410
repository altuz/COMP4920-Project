I personally think it's better than the previous incarnation of Game Maker. Sure, there's a few features missing but they aren't software breaking issues. To any of those who linked their Steam account to YoYo Games, the discounted price ended towards the end of August, it will be full price again until it goes on sale. We also need to remember that this just came out of beta. Just like any other game engine, there will be bugs early on in it's life I'm sure they'll be hammered out sometime down the line.\n\nPros:\n- Brand new UI. Easier on the eyes.\n- Fairly robust workflow.\n- Brand new image editor with layers and the ability to animate while drawing.\n- Easier to understand GML with more powerful commands and features.\n- Runs a lot faster and is smoother than the last version.\n\nCons:\n- Trial is limited to Web Deployment. (I bought the full product before the discount ended, light con for me.)\n- Trial users have no access to Shaders. (Again, buying the full product made this a light con for me.)\n- Gradient tools seemed to have been removed.\n- Some coding functions are a slight bit different.\n- Interface can get a little tedious overtime.\n\nAll in all, with time, I'm sure people will learn to love GMS2.", "recommendationid": "34782493", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504729233, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504912812, "num_reviews": 20, "steamid": "76561197981693797", "num_games_owned": 235, "playtime_forever": 880}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497900"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1505103212, "votes_down": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I bought this thinking 'I like to make games, and each game maker interation was not to bad from the last', and I started with Game Maker 4.  Well, when I opened it up, I was met with something of horror, but I am getting ahead of myself, so let me talk about some of the pros and cons of this thing.\n\nPros:\n-Able to make animated sprites on the fly.\n-Tabs so if you want to hid some things out of the way, you can.\n-If you want to see how things connect, you can.\n-More professional UI\n\nCons: (This may get big)\n-Unable to make constants, well from what I can see. (I do those alot)\n-Redundant functions (Talking about Viewpoints, views for those used to them, and cameras)\n-You can either choose code or drag and drop. I learned GML via using both at one time.\n-Always connected.\n-Removal of Backgrounds.\n-Having to scroll with the middle mouse button. (More of a pet peve of mine)\n-Nothing is well organized.\n-No creation buttons or menu items. All left click. (As far as I can tell)\n-Probably many more I do not remember or haven't discovered.\n\nLet me talk about some of these points. First off, the redundant items in here. Last I checked, a view (or viewport in this thing) is the same as a camera. This could have easily been done by adding more views to the program.\n\nOrganization is well mucked. If I use this, it would take me a concidered longer time to make one object completely.  I like my stuff fast and easy so I can get to the main thing we do on these and that is to create games. This can go with creation buttons and code vs. Drag and Drop too. Sometimes it is easier and faster to just drop something in.\n\nYou can just go down and look at those who have negitive reviews and see other things that I agree with. I am not going to completely say again what they did. I wasted my money on it, and wish I could get a refund. I didn't like everything they did with studio 1, but I understand why they did. This here, I cannot see any reason why they would set things up like this at all.\n\nIf you want a gamemaker program, get gamemaker studio 1.4 instead.
