Just need to keep this review about as long as this game manages to hold one's attention/enthusiasm:  \n\nThis game is simply BORING.  Subterfuge is far too O.P and boring and ruins the game.  Poor game mechanics that are boring.  Lacklustre tutorial and UI and you dont really have any idea what you are doing or what is working/happening because the game does a terrible job of informing you.   The mostly negative reviews are justified unfortunately.  This game feels like an excellent, high potential concept executed poorly and lazily, exploiting the Thrones name for a quick cash grab.      \n\nRecommendation:\nSteer clear of this one even if you are a massive Thrones fan. Consider buying only on 80%+ discount and even then I wouldn't bother.  3/10"}, {"votes_down": 63, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504937199, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456692", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "34830104", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198030021399", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1441417692, "num_games_owned": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 24}, "timestamp_updated": 1504937199, "received_for_free": false, "review": "trash"}]}
