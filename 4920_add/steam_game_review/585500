Very solid experience that runs smooth and the variety in weapons, enemies, and areas makes the replay value on this game very high.  I just spent over an hour in my first sitting and time flew by.  The visuals combined with the sounds and music really add to the polished feel of this game.  A must-have for any VR gamer.", "recommendationid": "33753149", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1500844625, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504050386, "num_reviews": 20, "steamid": "76561197977889191", "num_games_owned": 164, "playtime_forever": 358}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 8, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_positive": 8}}
