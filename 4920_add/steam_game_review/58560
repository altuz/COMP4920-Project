They were definitely aware of how badly structured the 2nd one was lmao there were a bunch of jokes about how poor it was here and there. They definitely listened to their consumers. This instantly became my fav of the whole series, it's really well made for me. I'm super happy they fixed where the plot was going and steered it to a better direction.\n\nPros:\n> They cleaned up the character models and visual art---now it looks sleek, finished and it could very well contend with more current/modern point and click games\n>>> I just really love how the environments look now, it's so pleasing to the eyes and they definitely played with panning locations and rooms having more than one angle\n> Gina and Brian finally get the character writing they both deserve and they have lovelier voices AND dialogue to boot\n> In-game hint system and hotspot/location viewer! No more getting lost, not knowing where to click or not knowing what to do!\n> The story definitely has more backbone and adventure into it now, it feels more Broken Sword than Sam & Max now (I loved Sam & Max and silliness worked tons better for them than for Runaway)\n> Love the silly meta jokes when you hover over things\n\nCons:\n> The save system is still pretty adamant about having a slot for every save you make instead of opting to replace an older save\n> I still do kinda prefer first game's nerdy I-just-wanna-go-to-Berkley Brian"}, {"votes_down": 15, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501589105, "weighted_vote_score": "0.397042", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33947771", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198030784015", "num_reviews": 418, "last_played": 1501588534, "num_games_owned": 3324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1501589105, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is an interesting looking point and click adventure game, but the fixed resolution makes everything look fuzzy on displays above 1080p."}]}
