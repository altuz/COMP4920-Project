Not like those subscription based engines which can get pretty expensive.\n\nBasically has anything you need for making any 2D game. \n\nCons: \nApk build times are much longer compared to Unity. \n\nUI kind of sucks (it's pretty, but not practical), hard to use on computers with smaller screens. Too much stuff just floating around.\n\nCurrently has less support/tutorials compared to Game maker studio 1.4 or Unity, but it's probably because it's a newer engine.", "recommendationid": "34731531", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504529953, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504497440, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198283015452", "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_forever": 439}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1501769473, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Lack of documentation, you find that eventually Drag n Drop is useless, support will answer you with generic information that is not helpful.", "recommendationid": "33993588", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501769473, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502505075, "num_reviews": 15, "steamid": "76561198007032074", "num_games_owned": 220, "playtime_forever": 5320}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497366"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
