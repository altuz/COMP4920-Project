Pendulo Studios definitely learned a lot from their previous games. I enjoyed the story from Beginning to End, although a teency bit disappointed that although it says it's about all the Hollywood monsters, there were very few characters. There were more robots than monsters to be honest, and they (the robots) all look the same. I guess I can imagine making 3D models just for background could prove to be harrowing (but what about Eva Morte and the Grim Reaper).\n\nPROS:\n> Fun adventure story with a good sense of humor\n> Really likeable main characters, both of them had an ample amount of participation and screentime\n> Sensible puzzle logic, I hardly needed to use the hint system (except for that heiroglyphics one UGH!)\n> Easy to use interface\n>> It has a hotspot system, a hint button, and double clicking causes fast travel\n\nCONS:\n> I encountered a few bug crashes during scenes and kissed my progress goodbye since I often forgot to save (so tragic I saved in chapter 1 but I was already in chapter 4, I had to speedrun it all over again)\n> Some interaction spots (especially Professor Fly) are right at the top of the screen, which you can have a hard time clicking because hovering your pointer on top brings down the menu buttons. So honestly it's a poor choice of placement, the menu works much more effectively if it rested at the top right corner with smaller buttons instead\n> Has a bit of backtracking gripes since clicking on the next location doesn't instantly transport you (unlike in Runaway)\n> It's shorter than I hoped it'd be, as an adventure game 5 hours is satisfying but I was really pulled in by the characters and wish it was longer, Liz is so interesting especially her family\n> The tango puzzle is a pox on humanity and I hope Pendulo would step on a lego for it\n\nOverall, it's a great Point and Click adventure, I definitely have no regrets buying and playing it. It convinced me to look up the original game Hollywood Monsters (The Next BIG Thing is called Hollywood Monsters 2 in Europe, I think.) I was surprised that it's actually more of a remake than a sequel, a lot of the story and characters were reused."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504886620, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500694", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34817651", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197961967132", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1504891056, "num_games_owned": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 125}, "timestamp_updated": 1504886620, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I finally got the game working.  The Configuration tool didn't help me to get 1080p to work.  It just kept starting at a horrible resolution where I only got the the top half displayed, with the bottom half below my screen.  Went looking for support, and Steam's web link goes to a dead site.  Searching brought me to https://www.focus-home.com/games/the-next-big-thing but any search in their support forum returned nothing (once in a while it returned results about jerseys, WTF?).  Their displayed forum topics showed me that their search function is broken, as my search words were there.\nHorrible support all the way around.\nI finally simply changed the resolution in the Configuration tool to a lower resolution, and taadaa!  At least it's playable now.  My $2 wasn't a waste after all.\n\nAs for the game itself, so far, so good.  I'm only a little in, but it has an interesting sense of humor.\n\nI'm giving it a thumbs up, because it seems promising... especially at this minor price."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506385247, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35213007", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198032729607", "num_reviews": 29, "last_played": 1506385148, "num_games_owned": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 359, "playtime_forever": 359}, "timestamp_updated": 1506385247, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's a fun game to pass the time, it's not complicated compared to other games in the genre but the story is interesting enough to overlook that.\n\nside note: buy it on sale or included in some games package."}]}
