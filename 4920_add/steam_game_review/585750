This game requires a lot of meticulous coordination between both keyboard and mouse. Once I got used to the coordination and controls the levels become less intimidating and game's levels completion becomes exponentially satisfying. I recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenge! \n\nIn terms off game design: \n-Graphics has a fun and classical looking\n-Music is awesome!\n-Level design feels unique and experientially nice\n\n", "recommendationid": "31640254", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1494309122, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494483510, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198043913260", "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 120}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
