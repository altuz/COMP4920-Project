I'll start by saying that the graphics and art style of this game are dead set brilliant. This game is a visual feast especially in the forest and farm sections. \n\nAlso it's quite well optimized, I played through on the highest graphics settings at 4k resolution on my 1060 gtx and it ran a constant 50 - 60 fps in doors and about 40 - 60 out doors so hats off to the developer for that.\n\nThe negatives however, it took me just shy of 45 minutes to play through this from start to finish on my first play and that was reading everything, exploring all surroundings and stoping to take in the scenery because by god it looks fantastic. \n\nNow some may argue game length isn't a good indicator of how good a game is and that is true 100% agree, however in this case the story telling throughout was just not good and honestly it felt like massive chunks of the overall story were missing entirely.\n\nFor this game to hit it out of the park the following is what I would have loved to see (not these are my oppinions everyone is going to be different):\n\n1) I believe if they invested in voice acting it would have raised the immersion of the story and world considerably (and I mean pay for AAA voice actors).\n\n2) Utilized more cut scenes to dig further in to the overall story.\n\n3) Added more puzzles similar to the one on the farm with the doll that also assist with narating the story.\n\nBasically this game feels like a demo where you're playing a cut down version of the first level of a full game. Really unfortunate. Perhaps we'll see a more filled out game from these developers and with a much deeper story.", "recommendationid": "35358725", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506817814, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 36, "last_played": 1506817023, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561197969390805", "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_forever": 42}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505341044, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A very calm and beautiful small game.\nThere is a lot love for detailed scenes and atmosphere.\nThere characters look a bit strange, but since characters are probably the hardest thing to make in video games I can ignore that. :D\nAbsolute recommendation from me if you like this kind of games. :3", "recommendationid": "34928094", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505341044, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497269131, "num_reviews": 35, "steamid": "76561198010640985", "num_games_owned": 490, "playtime_forever": 164}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 27, "total_reviews": 139, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 112}}
