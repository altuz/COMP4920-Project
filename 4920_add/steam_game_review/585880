This may have been designed over a Game Jam weekend, but I am seriously impressed at how far ebi-hime took a simple concept. I have read a decent number of Visual Novels, including ebi-hime's \"The Way We All Go\", but this was something different. Starting with the classic, traveller gets lost and meets new people; I expected a few emotional moments with well-drawn characters. What I didn't expect was how powerful the payoff was with just 5 characters, 50 achievements, a lot of romantic undertones, and plenty of meta humour (jokes that play off the game design or break the 4th wall a lot). In other words, good in my book.\n\nPros: [list]\n    [*]Short narrative with plenty of replayability to aim for the hard to reach ending.\n    [*]Perfectly working skip function that helped in my achievement hunt.\n    [*]50 achievements I got in 5 hours. Well done.\n    [*]Lovely character art that was varied in design despite using only 5 characters and the same style.\n    [*]Writing is the author's forte and this was spot-on through all paths and endings (I checked). Sharp dialogue and some very funny humor spread thoughout. Worth looking through some of the joke options just to try.\n    [*]Emotional ressonance from the 3 story flashbacks told entirely through old text style. Surprisingly, the simplicity added to the emotional payoff and it took different characters lives and used a common theme to connect them all. Some of the most emotional series I've seen over the years have done just that. Use a common thread and link everything to it while keeping the different stories diverse and through multiple walks of life. That is the greatest strength of \"Once on a Windswept Night.\"\n    [*]The romantic undertones and female relationships are kept very chaste. I respect that more than any VN that focuses too much on extra content or revealing CGs. This is how you romance. This is how you tale. This is how you respect one form of love. No complaints here.\n    [*]The narrator's laugh beyond the true end. Well played you devilish narrator. Hahahaha.\n[/list]\nCons (or Meh Points): [list]\n    [*]Saving is a bit slow and doesn't work outside the story. Makes sense in context, but loosing the menu contol was a little jarring at time.\n    [*]I know the game markets unfair achievements, but some of them required me to delete my saves, since I rushed through the \"Character Name\" ones and repeatly closed the game. Other than that, no problems. Got all 50 achivements (20 were character names).\n    [*]The flashbacks were fine as they were, but if they were fully adapted in visual novel style like the rest of game, it would add a bit more content. I know this was a Game Jam project, but in post-development, that could have been an idea.\n[/list]\nSummary: \nA lovely short free VN, that reminds us of what we can accomplish over a weekend and a bit. Thanks for showing us another side of your writing talent and I look forward to catching up on your former works. As for what lies ahead, I'll let our devlish narrator guide the way.\n\nSimilar Game Recommendations (On Steam): [list]\n    [*]The Way We All Go: Judging from the final laugh and the minor dark elements in the game, I think it would be a great contrast to play ebi-hime's first Steam game. It is horror, a little unsettling and inspired by the like of Higurashi and Umineko, but it is an example of writing talent.\n    [*]Narcissu & Rain Marginal: More in line with this game. Sad emotional stories that connect via one core theme and manage to tug our heartstrings in more ways than we expect. Plus the originals are still free-to-play. 10th anniversary version with new content is wrapping up and 3rd chapter is on the horizon.\n    [*]Clannad: Another emotional example that uses a core theme to connect everything. And because family is so universal, it ressonates more than many others like it.\n   [*]A More Beautiful World: Similar medival or old england time period in the style of Spice and Wolf or Maoyuu Maou Yuusha. Plus it has equally witty writing. Scheduled for 2017, but the demo is brilliant. Highly recommended.\n[/list]\nThanks for Reading ~RB", "recommendationid": "30157756", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487997471, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487986638, "num_reviews": 22, "steamid": "76561198077101270", "num_games_owned": 334, "playtime_forever": 348}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513998"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487037948, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "For a free game, this is beyond my expectation, good story with quality CG. This is not your everyday NV games you familiarized with, its design is somewhat different. Upon starting the game, you are into story without the greeting of main menu. At First I feel a bit annoying by the lacking of interface and single save slot, and you can't save some times, but I found it's for immerse reason and worth it, you don't really need to save so much in this game.\n\nAlthough it's free, characters are well developed and plot is surprising, only 5 characters but all have their elaborated stories, and corresponding personality. The only dissatisfaction for me is lacking CG artworks, they are quality but few, however it's free game so I think it's ok.

While this is true in the case of this visual novel, it goes far beyond that. I'm not sure I've ever experienced anything quite like it. I do not write many reviews, but given the absence of any other reviews at this point, I felt the need to make sure people did not pass up this story for lack of feedback to gauge their interest. If you were unsure about whether or not to give this story a chance, heed my advice and purchase it immediately. The price is right, although it feels criminal to have this game without being asked to pay a dime. \n\nThere are many paths to take, and each adds to the overall story. Or rather, each path is a story within a story. What\u2019s stunning about this novel is that it is an interwoven story of stories, and each attempt to find new paths reveals more and more of that story. This probably sounds confusing, but it will make sense as you begin to progress through the novel.  \nAs I mentioned before, there are elements of this visual novel which I have never experienced before. There is no title screen, it is instant immersion. Certain choices made make it simply close. When you relaunch, it welcomes you back. There was even a choice made which caused the novel to refuse to let you back in unless you agreed to wipe the slate clean and start from nothing [no more skipping/sub paths seem to be locked again/save file is gone.]. \n\nThis has been a very deep and thought provoking visual novel. Do not let the label of \"Yuri\" convince you this is nothing but an erotic frolic between some shallow/ditzy female anime characters. Each character encountered has been complex, and more importantly, damaged. It\u2019s this damage which has served as an element to bring substance to the plotline. You empathize with them and wish to know more. The \"best\" ending is completely heart warming and you'll probably find yourself shedding a few tears.\n\nThere are some bugs which make it possible to get stuck if you do not pay attention [See Discussion tab for my thread], but this is a release day review, so I hope to see updates made in the future, as no release is ever bugfree on day one.  Some of the achievements are a bit strange as well. Some depend on knowledge of the developers other stories, while others are left to pure chance. Despite that, I still give this a 10/10 rating.

Let's help with that.  \n\nOnce on a Windswept Night (you can see how I'm annoyed by the lack of capitalisation) is a Visual Novel about girls' love, for other girls that is. It's free and small, first and foremost, so it's always going to be a good deal no matter which way you look at it. As with a traditional Visual Novel, there are a few categories to consider:\n\n*Writing: Not the best, though that's a tall bar to pass. Leans a lot on cute and characterisation. The plot itself has quite a few twists and turns in it, however, and greatly emphasises reading between the lines. Subtlety is always appreciated in a piece that appears deceptively straightforward as this. It's decent enough, as good writing is hard to come by. Everything is explained in the end though, so take that as it may. Despite the game's short length, the story is rather dense and not accompanied by much change of scenery, so it can feel tiresome at times to read.\n\n*Characters: A bit one-dimensional at first, but unlocking more endings really portrays the sort of effort which went in here. Everyone has something to hide, and that's good, even those bearing their hearts on their sleeves. There are [spoiler]5[/spoiler] characters in this game, and though they regrettably are not all adequately developed, they are at least fairly distinct and relatable in certain ways. That's good, because you wouldn't want to read what they have to say otherwise.\n\n*Art: Quite here and there, has the \"no difference but hairstyle\" effect. Overall serviceable, but I would've liked to see a lot more full screen art to accompany the non-true endings, especially some much needed love between [spoiler]Madeleine and Daffodil[/spoiler]. Bonus points for those being subtle too, if that's at all possible.\n\n*Music & Sound: Positive. Nothing too stand out, but fits well with what's happening on screen instead of being just filler.\n\n*Novelty: Quite a bit, especially if you're going through the achievement list (check with the guide if you're interested). There're some serious fourth wall rustling here that made me laugh out loud a few times (your genuine reactions are not guaranteed to be the same), especially as my computer puts itself in a deep sleep in protest.\n\nIt was overall not a bad hour of free entertainment, and is clearly made by someone with a real standard of quality in mind.

The whole experience is crafted in an unusual but compelling way, by telling a story within a story. You and your mysterious companion delve into a book to unravel all of its mysteries, which shifts your perspective to one of the characters inside the book. Multiple routes exist, and these are integrated in an immersive way with commentary from your companion after each route's completion, followed by the suggestion to start from the beginning or turn back the pages. Even quitting the game is charming - it's described as [i]taking a break[/i], and your companion welcomes you back once the game reloads.\n\nBesides the intriguing experimentation with the VN medium and extra immersion that adds, it's a fine story, with characters that have distinct personalities, a dramatic reveal, and a true ending that was uplifting after all of the sorrow and difficulties along the way. It's a testament to the power of love, but also the power of self-doubt and the inability to trust and take risks for your own happiness. Furthermore, Ebi-hime's writing is suited to dialogue, and she excels particularly at making character interactions sound natural and bringing those characters to life without resorting to needless exposition. Exploring the darker, more vulnerable parts of the human heart and mind is done quite well.\n\nI have two criticisms, but these are minor and do not detract much from the experience. Firstly, there are two characters that serve as substantial parts of the plot, but a conclusion for them isn't reached. They have their own dilemmas which could have been explored more thoroughly during the story, and so there is untapped potential. Secondly, advancing the plot past a certain point hinges on a very specific set of choices, which eluded me for longer than I expected and required too much backtracking.
