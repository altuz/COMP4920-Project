Whereas in many of them, mainly dating-sims, you see a new relationship blossoming, in this one you see a middle-aged man discontent with his love life and his work, and unable to connect with his daughter. Those are all pretty mature themes that may ring close to home for many people, but then he is being introduced to a young and seductive girl full of secrets, and things slowly get out of his hands, and OH GOD THAT AWFUL YET PERFECT TWIST. I did see it coming, but it's not that obvious, and I still was shocked when it was disclosed. \n\nHave a terrible yet great read!", "recommendationid": "34914796", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505287360, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499677123, "num_reviews": 119, "steamid": "76561198062301817", "num_games_owned": 212, "playtime_forever": 201}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512789"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 144, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 140}}
