Sure the interface and controls are a little wonky. Does it make sense that the GO button doesn't work until you hit \"enter\" on the keyboard, probably not. VR is still really new and trying to convey what you want people to do is all new.  This is still Early Access, so there is still time for small changes like this. It's a cool concept with a lot of potental though, really curious to see how this evolves and what other things will come flying at me.", "recommendationid": "29578944", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485750905, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485626237, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198008781111", "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_forever": 6}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504600"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1486591589, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "What a FUN and EASY but a deadly game!  Actually, not that easy but definately a FUN game for sure!  Easy and simple mechanics, wish I had thought of it :-)  I would recommend this game and price is right for a simple application.  My only request would be more lighting in the room and not having to retype player's name for every retry.  Overall its a great game!!!
