The narrative focuses on Sofya, who works as a prison guard that looks after a creepy vampire-like elf that acts like the typical \"THE END IS NEAR\" guy in a super creepy manner and a black elf (No...I don't mean \"Dark Elf\" like a Drow, I mean \"Black Elf\"...with dreadlocks) while talking with her *ss of a co-worker.  (Kinda' surprised she banged him...and every other officer in her region)   After a series of events, she goes from being a lazy guard to having some growth as a character.\n\nThe art style, animation, and voice acting is the most awkward part of the experience and could be better.  The voice-acting is sprinkled in at random points rather than the whole game.  Though the artstyle is rather displeasing, I can forgive it since it feels fitting later on.  The top of the walking animation could use some refinement as the top of the protagonist's head cuts off at times.\n\nThe music, backgrounds, and areas of exploration feel well done and fit the aesthetic of the game's narrative, which makes the game feel a bit pleasant, though while mixed with the negatives, it leads to an awkward feeling.\n\nThe narrative itself starts slow and dull, but picks up when the game hits its climax (a certain injury..not gonna spoil), where the main character shows some growth and evolves with the story.  There are a few options, but aside from the purpose of achievements, they don't really affect the ending or any other options...except for a bare few which may increase the time you spend playing this.  (Again, not gonna spoil)\n\nAlthough [i]Echoes of the Fey Episode 0: The immolation[/i] was an awkward experience, it can't be knocked for what it is by the end of the day...a demo AND a prequel.  With the goal of roping a potential group of consumers to purchase additional chapters of the story, it works quite well.  Though there are areas where it could be improved.  This free experience should take you about 2 hours if you're to read all routes...but then again, I'm a slow reader.\n\n6.5/10  The story of a sex-crazed drunk guard in need of a little polishing here and there.", "recommendationid": "29775479", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486531843, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486526267, "num_reviews": 374, "steamid": "76561198014926595", "num_games_owned": 423, "playtime_forever": 172}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493143"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_positive": 6}}
