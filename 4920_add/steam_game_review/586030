Problem is with the pacing. It feels janky, and dealing with rush tactics is problematic. Not to mention, games like Hearthstone sell themselves on personality, which is hard to do when 80% of your cards use placeholder art. I know, game's in Early Access, but as it stands I have no real desire to spend any more money on this game as-is.\n\nThen there's the matter of the community. If you look at the Steam discussion page, it's a bunch of edgelord 12 year olds who don't understand punctuation, and can't even provide feedback to the devs without crapping all over each other. Not that the Steam forums are typically a source of intelligent discourse, but this is one of the worst communities I've seen. Could you imagine what would happen if they implemented an in-game chat feature?\n\nI'll keep my eye on this, but it's got a long way to go if the devs really want in on that Twitch dosh. I will update this review should my opinion change.", "recommendationid": "33370509", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499511380, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499509803, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561197976858248", "num_games_owned": 345, "playtime_forever": 72}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499655"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 0}}
