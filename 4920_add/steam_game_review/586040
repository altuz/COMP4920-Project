You get to play as all 6 factions anytime compared to the Free-to-Play version. Buying the game gives you the ability to host multiplayer games on quite a good selection of maps, including community made maps. \n\n\n\nBad Stuff: There has been no new factions released at all, same 6 as always, and only 2 of the 6 factions are actually good: The Cranioids, and the Marines who both have very OP gathering systems and good units. Lastly, you have to play for the $15.00 version of the game in order to play by yourself, or singleplayer with bots I mean, and there arn't too many people playing this game, at most you will see 5 or 6 in a single lobby, most of the time just a few guys and bots.\n\nI would only buy this game like I did, to play with friends, and have a good amount of fun off of a cheap RTS game. If you are buying this in hopes to play with random people, and you want a good 50+ hours of enjoyment, you are wasting your time playing this game. As I said, only 2 factions worth playing, and I don't see anymore getting added anytime soon.", "recommendationid": "34428137", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503454807, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1506822011, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198143991255", "num_games_owned": 56, "playtime_forever": 1292}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499559"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504431344, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": " A fun game that keeps you never bored and It makes you want to keep coming back and not stop playing!\n\none of the best RTS games in my library. 10/10", "recommendationid": "34707071", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504431344, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504892593, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197990174134", "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 464}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1504236860, "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "no singleplayer were i can play alone with A.I BOT and the server is so empty :(", "recommendationid": "34650448", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504236860, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504236595, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198211711792", "num_games_owned": 26, "playtime_forever": 211}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493320"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 38, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 35}}
