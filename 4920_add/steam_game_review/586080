But before you do that, remember to pick up your chest of goodies, this is where you get an upgrade for your abilities.\n\nSingleplay was as expected, lower damage required to kill enemies and fairly easy to run through, until the third map, which I don't know if is possible to do without being either a mage, archer or a priest- because being a warlock was nearly impossible considering the fact that there are small flying enemies on the map, which is darned near impossible to hit with the basic ability the warlock is using. And the Golem summoned usually couldn't hit the flying enemies (or imps) as they were out of range. \n\nMultiplay was a long wait-time to meet other players, but I suppose that's normal if the game doesn't have many players, and I don't know how well this game has been represented through ads and what not, but that aside: \nYes it is more fun to play with other people.\n\nOne thing I had a little bit of problems with though was, I couldn't hear any of the other players. And I'm not sure if they could hear me. If they could, maybe they had no way to respond as they had no mic.. I don't know, but in either case; during the fight or at any other point in the game I couldn't communicate with these people.\n\nSo with a decent combination of classes I'm sure the game will be fairly easy and fun to barge through, just to upgrade your abilities as fast as possible.\n\nAlso.. Hitting your enemies in the head usually does more damage.\n\nClasses:\n\nYou have 4 classes with one still to come (possibly more thereafter) which is said in the description of the game:\nMage, Archer, Priest and Warlock.\n\nEach of the classes are rather fun to play each in their own respective environment, and can all be a nice part of a team combination. But as said, some feels stronger than others.\n\nWARLOCK: \nExactly what you'd expect.\n\nI started out with a warlock as I thought I'd start out with something I never usually go for in a game, and little did I know this was the class I do believe is the class stumbling across the most difficulties throughout the game.\n\n\nThe warlock has a 4 abilities (as far as I know):\nSiphon soul + Shadow Bolt and Summon Golem + Golem Explosion - Siphon Soul is exactly what you'd expect, you channel a spell at an single enemy, and it ticks damage. After a short period of time or a long; depending on how much damage you want to do with the Shadow Bolt, you can release it to fire an Bolt of Shadow that explodes at your target location. Summon golem is just like summoning any other pet in any other game (let's say WoW), and it attacks once enemies are near. Golem Explosion is an aoe you can use after your golem is supercharged and does aoe damage to every enemy on the map.\n\nSiphon Soul: is easy to aim, and it remains on the target as long as you hold the trigger (up to a certain point where it stops). \n\nShadow Bolt: on the other hand.. Not so easy to aim, as it spirals towards it's target, and if the enemy is small or far from (like on the third map where they may be BOTH), it's very hard to hit your target as it might spiral AROUND its target- leaving all the time you spent channeling nearly useless. Though, if you hit your target you can hit several targets as it has a blastradius where it lands, dealing a decent ammount of damage (depending on the siphoning time)\n\nAlso, if you upgrade it the enemies has a chance to get stunned for a short ammount of time.\n\nThe Golem: is easy. You summon it, and it attacks. \nThe golem itself has some abilties, both aoe and singletarget - both are fairly short range. \n\nGolem Explosion: After a while your golem goes from Green to Red, and this is when you know you can do the golem explosion, which I would say is the most powerful blow in the game as it wipes out the entire map (except boss), BUT it takes quite some time before you can use it.\n\nOverview - Warlock:\nA cool class to play, but I'd see this be better of in a multiplay scenario rather than singleplay, as the main ability itself takes a little too long to charge up to use in hasted situation. \nIt's flashy and cool to have a 7 feet Golem at your hand that can wipe out a nation of mobs, but it's not the strongest class. \n\nIf I could suggest a way to balance this class out it would be to make the Shadowbolt go in a straight line rather than spiraling towards its target.\n\n\nMAGE: \nYour badboy caster with the elements at it's hand.\n\nThe mage has 3 spells:\nFirebolt, Ice Beam and Thunderstorm.\n\nFirebolt is a charging spell just like the warlocks Shadowbolt, but it requires far less time to channel. \nBut it can also be charged 3 times to bump the damage further for each charge. So depending on the mob and situation you can do either. I'd say that for the most DPS charging it up charge number 2 to release and do the same thing again is the best choice (possibly, I'm not 100%).\n\nFirebolt arcs a little around but considering the casting time spent on it, it's fine.\n\nIcebeam: is by far the coolest looking ability in the game. It just looks incredible.\nIt does really slow DPS, but it slows down it's target. Icebeam fires in a straight line at wherever you target it and has quite the girth to it, so I'm pretty sure you can hit several targets with this one if your enemies are stacked closely.\n\nHowever, this ability is not great at all, and I'd suggest using Fireball and Thunderstorm over it.\n\nThunderstorm: may be the most practical ability in the game. As you channel your thunderstorm pretty much whenever you want (has a cooldown of course, but it's fairly low compared to the warloc's Golem Explosion), and it does ticking damage to all the enemies on the map. By far not the same ammount of damage as the Warlock's Golem Explosion, but is way easier to use:\n\nOverview - Mage:\nA good choice for your \"raids\" as they call it. \nIt would be no problem only having mages on the team in the current \"meta\". As you would easily be able to clear of all 3 levels with this group.\n\nIf I could suggest any changes to this class it would be making the Icebeam useful somehow.\n\n\nARCHER: (Sidenote: Your arms will get sore)\nYour everyday average aim and shoot bowman/lady. \n\nIf you've played any bowshooting game in VR before this is exactly like that, except you have a few flashy arrows.\n\nThe archer has 3 different arrowtypes:\nSingletarget (green), Explosive Arrow (fire effect) and Multishot (5 purple arrows)\n\nSingle (Green): Shoots a basic arrow dealing the biggest ammount of single target damage.\n\nExplosive Arrow: Shoots an explosive arrow able to deal damage to multiple foes if they are close enough. But is outweighed by singleshot and multishot.\n\nMultishot: Shoots 5 arrows which splits across the screen, meaning the further away the arrows shoot, the bigger the space is between them:\n\nOverview - Archer:\n\nIt's just as basic as it sounds.\nBut none the less, a good choice for damage and raiding. \nI wouldn't make a group of only archers as they have no Super Ability, like the other classes have to clear the map.\n\nI can't suggest any changes here because I think it would get too OP\nContinuing in replies>>", "recommendationid": "33689228", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1500618929, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "11", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500589909, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198012925633", "num_games_owned": 159, "playtime_forever": 257}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485392"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 9, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1500654502, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game has great potential.
