The ui is clunky. They are apparently that bad at ai development that a single player skrimish is essentially you with limited resources and units, vs ai that simply spams everything you could ever hope to reinforce in the skrimish in the first 5 minutes why need tactics on the ai end. you have to go into multiplayer and play vs ai then it is actually somewhat fair? I really wanted to love this game its concept and they way they the games can play out my favorite being conquest where you must capture and hold points, the way reinforcements are handled is really good but the ai you spend all your time babysitting they have zero retreat reflex ony panic where they sit in an open field? ive seen way too much ai right beside an enemy and sit there, chopper control is the worst of all, they will be out of missles and never land at the fob just sit and hove over it so when the next wave of ridiculaas ai comes there they sit with no rockets. i would hope that they can give the ai some very very basic intellegence im not even asking for arma ai just a reasonable or at worst functional ai. I also dont care for the obscurity that is the command stars, by the time you figure out how to set a deck you have already wasted alot of command stars on crap you really wouldnt ever want. alot of people who play have this belif that the infantry is a worth while tool, they are only even remotly usefull in dense forest and buildings for defense positions, offensive infantry is hilariusy ineffective unless they are facing choppers, 30 riflmen can charge an open field against the best cobra attak helo and lose like maybe half the men but take the chopper, lol really do tell mr ah1z how exactly did you get taken down \"o well as ai i decided that it was best that my gamey feeling cannon really is only useful against tanks..:$ and then i figured i would miss most of my shots even though i am fully combat leveled (which i have noticed no diference in a units combat level to performance yet) and i would just hold my ground once the infantry is within 400m of me and can shoot at me and eventually take me down\". same thing all day long, i feel like i fight my own units to just go somewhere more than i even click on the enemy. well there is my take its worth 2$ and change but if i would have paid 10$ i would be upset. their newar games loo great on paper but no im resistant to try them because i can only imagin how many jets are taken down by pistol packing infantry."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506166891, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35151229", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987304354", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1506865578, "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 997, "playtime_forever": 4103}, "timestamp_updated": 1506166891, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Wargame European Escalation is a solid game. \n\nWho should buy this?:\n+ You love RTS games \n+ You don't need base/unit building in your RTS\n+ You're quick enough to manage multiple fronts and don't loose oversight of the bigger picture (150km\u00b2 is a lot).\n+ You love WW3 setting. \n+ The boring looking countryside of Germany doesn't bother you.\n+ Ressource manager is your Nickname.\n+ You like realism in RTS (Appart from the fact that your infantry can run 30 km/h without loosing stamina)\n+ You love to studing units to plan for your strategy (350 units differen in the game)\n\nIf you agree with the most of the list above this game is for you.\n\nHints:\n\nIf you are undecisive whether you should buy the more expansive Wargame Red Dragon or this game. I recommend you buy this game first. Why? Because this way you can discover if this kind of game is something for you. And also there are \"only\" 350 different units to study in this game. In Wargame Red Dragon you have over 1500 units to study.\n\nUnfortunately the Multiplayer isn't as big as it's suppose to be. Wargame Red Dragon is the place for the multiplayer game experience. \n\nThis game doesn't have Planes. This is in my opinion a good thing compared to Red Dragon.
