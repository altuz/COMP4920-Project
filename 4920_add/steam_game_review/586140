This game completed the story in a way that I think most fans can appreciate. I started playing Blazblue at the beginning of July 2017 and since then have played through the story in the 4 games, and now I'm just trying to get better at facing other players! Definitely one of my favorite game series by far.\n\nBlazblue is far from new so it's honestly not that easy going against veterans while being relatively new myself, but it's so worth it to get better at this game. And if I can stand my ground against long-time players, anyone else can too! So don't be discouraged if you're new because that's how everyone starts. And if you want to get better fast, you just gotta play somewhat often and do some challenges and spend a little time in practice mode!\n\n\nEDIT: This game comes with a free soundtrack, so if you enjoy the music as much as I do, you'll enjoy having this on your phone/iPod/MP3\n\nEDIT2: Jubei is out, bringing the roster up to 36", "recommendationid": "34794482", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505400710, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "9", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "last_played": 1507135032, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561198091677219", "num_games_owned": 226, "playtime_forever": 2456}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525939"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505068799, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Tl;dr: YAS.  \n\nFirst off I would like to note if you care about the story, it's seriously worth grabbing the others for their story first.  BE WARNED IT IS KNOWN TO BE 'LONG' and 'CONVOLUTED' TO SOME PEOPLE.  To me it wasn't really all that hard to follow but there is a LOT of shit going on so if you are bad at keeping track of a ton of things you might have a bit of an issue following some things.  There are a lot of resources for filling in stuff you don't know, and you don't exactly have to buy the xblaze novels and stuff to fully understand the story as most of that again can be found online (but I would say it seems worth looking into!)\n\n30~hr or so of story if you're a quick reader (probably a lot longer if you take your time).  Gameplay is very well balanced between characters (yes some characters have bad matchups but welcome to any fighting game; overall the balance is very good and will be even better with the 2.0 patch coming soon!).\n\n40 or some shit playable characters; with a new one coming soon (Jubei of the Six Heroes: with a price tag of $7 at least on the console versions; kinda ludicrous if you ask me)\n\nMulitplayer online connection is very stable with (generally) no lag assuming your internet isn't bad (connection quality wise/ping, not necessarily speed).  Have played this fine on a mobile internet connection with people across the country.  Unfortunately as this is the PC version and not the console versions (where everyone plays apparently even though they should be here!  but I digress) the playerbase isn't very large but you can usually find a few games.  So hope you have a friend to play with (as you should because this is a great game to pick up with a friend; but this also brings me to another con.\n\nI have not figured out a way to get 2 playstation controllers (authentic sony dualshock 3 from back when I bought my ps3) to work as p1 and p2 respectively.  they both seem to want to work for p1.  Local Multiplayer is kind of a joke sadly, bad port in that regard.  The graphics are nothing terribly amazing compared to the previous installment but it's not to be said that they are bad, because they are decent.  This definitely feels like a rushed port but overall the quality of the game outweighs the bad.  \n\n7/10.", "recommendationid": "34868590", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505068799, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 346, "last_played": 1506248724, "num_reviews": 24, "steamid": "76561198006021292", "num_games_owned": 377, "playtime_forever": 4854}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507403"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506891217, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Lost over 40 rounds in a row, got the fastest move on Susanoo repeatedly parried.

everything, the game literally will not open. It shows the splash screen and then almost immediately closes. From the little i've interacted with the UI, though, I can already see that this game is a shitty port with no mouse functionality, and complete reliance on a controller or keyboard to use. The game is also 50GB (while only being 12GB on console), which is completely outrageous for a fighting game and shows signs of bad optimization. According to other players, the game also has resolution and framerate problems, and numerous other optimization problems. Maybe I could make a better review if the game would fucking open.\n\nTL;DR: Shit port and horrible optimization, get it on console or don't get it at all.", "recommendationid": "35041937", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505726892, "votes_funny": 3, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505727084, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198069748928", "num_games_owned": 109, "playtime_forever": 17}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473535"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 34, "total_reviews": 303, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 269}}
