Highest card wins.  That is it.\nIf they simply added a die roll for fighting it MIGHT be worth it but as it is... just... no.\nNo strategic depth whatsoever.\n\nToo boring, even playing with friends.\nIf I hadn't bought my buddy a copy I would refund it.", "recommendationid": "33857029", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501252269, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501202476, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198019862767", "num_games_owned": 503, "playtime_forever": 24}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512757"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
