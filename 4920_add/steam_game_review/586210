I would like to see an option to hide the settings that appear in the top corner and on the bottom of the windows you generate, though. I use this to display my phone via sidesync only, so I'd like to get rid of the little in-game menus to modify that window.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/p_uxUl9veKk?t=7 \n\nAnother cool thing would be if we could someday have a \"touch input\" option instead of \"laser input\" only. What I mean is using a virtual finger to touch the display as if it were a touchscreen, like you do with the watch in Rec Room, rather than trying to point a laser at the screen as a pointer. This would provide less precision, but far more stability.\n\nA couple other things on my wishlist:\n-Rendering in-game objects above the window (obviously)\n-Having input work in the steamvr menu\n-Having a \"steamvr menu\"-only option. So I could just press the menu button to see my phone or whatever, and control it from there.", "recommendationid": "35352276", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506801565, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 168, "last_played": 1506847791, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198042526831", "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 168}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505743635, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "PERFECT!
