On the one positive side, I believe that the story is rather interesting and I was compelled to keep reading it. The setting helps the claustrophobic and paranoid atmosphere, the characters, rather well fleshed out, the tension, conveniently growing until the end. On the negative side, I found that the role that is given to the player is too passive, that the narrative choices given to us are very similar and usually bland, creating a character (our own) that feels shallow. Our role is confined to being either 1) kind and encouraging 2. overly protective and presumptuous or 3. obnoxious. This does not create the feeling that we play an important role. Also, choices really only matter in the last chapter. I undertand the difficuly of having forking paths, I am fine with it, but still, the game felt very narrow.\nThe reference to Lovecraft is rather subtle and the story is not necessarily in line with lovecraftian lore. There is also no reference to Cthulhu, despite the title, but instead to another god.\n\nOverall, I still recommend it.", "recommendationid": "31325219", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492970354, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492969226, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561197998904301", "num_games_owned": 370, "playtime_forever": 133}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 5, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_positive": 5}}
