It has a [i]soul[/i]. Indie games like this do what AAA titles could never achieve - they poke at fundamental human questions and issues, and like real life, they often do not achieve a satisfying resolve. That's okay. That's life.\n\n[i]Essentially, [/i]Soul Searching[i] is a *very* lite survival sim where you are on a quest to 'find yourself'.[/i] Almost zen-like, if you ask me - there is no fighting, and it is hard to die (along with little-to-no punishment for death). You can finish the game in, oh, about 2 hours, but achievement hunting is fun and will double that. There is local multiplayer which I am eager to try because the wifey played single player and enjoyed that. That says something right there. Otherwise, there are several things that pleasantly surprised me. You will find a variaty of different rafts you can buy, and they have modular features such as oars, ladders, rudders, fishing gear, fresh water supply, etc. Really neat. There is currency and magic. The dialogue is well done, and asks meaningful questions for anyone who thinks critically about their life. There are small random 'events' that you will find out at sea, which is cool. [b]And dragons.[/b]\n\n[b]Where [i]Soul Searching[/i] really shines is in it's presentation.[/b] The music and game flow almost create a cinematic experience; it was touching at moments, for sure. I won't go into spoilers, but the story is good. Well, at least I can say that the first half had me super excited about it, but I felt it ended more with a whimper... Or perhaps I was hoping it would go another way - but that's okay because the overall experience is still great.\n\n[b]Well worth the asking price. You will get an afternoon filled with some great gaming and a thinkpiece story.[/b]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Great zen-like/lite survival game\n+Presentation and game flow are brilliant and really showcase how indie games can have soul\n+Interesting story\n+Controller support is great\n+It's fun\n+Dragons\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-If you value a dollar-to-hour ratio, you may be disapointed here - but the hours are certainly high quality\n-Be aware that the storyline is a bit dark (not a con per se, but just know this)\n\n[b]Glad I picked this up and played through it.[/b] I look forward to getting the local multiplayer achievement, too.

That unsupported purpose is that we as people have to tackle our problems, not run away from them. While the black-and-white cutscenes do have characters that reflect upon this concept, the main story diverts completely away from it. The main story is short and very uneventful. You seem to be soul searching only because your ancestors did so, not because you actually need to. What did soul searching have to do with mending the friendship between people and dragons again? The story is completely capable of completion WITHOUT awakening any souls and learning their ablities. When the dragon took me back to my home island and the game ended, I wondered if throughout the game I was either trying to save souls (from what?) or create peace with dragons and humans again. Would I reccomend this game for only seven dollars? Only if you're looking for something aesthetic and pleasing to the eye.
