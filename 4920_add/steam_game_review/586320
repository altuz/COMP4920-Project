Gameplay is simplistic; where you navigate around the planets, beam up civilians while shooting and avoiding enemy fire/natural obstacles. \n\nWhile not on a planet, you are treated to a cross-section view of your space ship, where you can churn up your human captives into upgrades for various ship systems.  You can upgrade your lasers/bombs, shields, health, carry capacity, range, etc.\n\nThere are three planets which you can visit to farm upgrades.  The first is fairly calm and reminiscent of earth, the second is a fiery planet with spews of lava columns, and the third is what looks like some kind of infected planet with wavy tentacle things and a tornado.  Each planet is more difficult than the last, but abductees are worth significantly more.\n\nGraphics are whimsical, simple, and enjoyable.  The audio and soundtrack are also pretty good, so no complaints there.  I only ran into one glitch, where my ship outran the scrolling action and my ship went off-screen for a few seconds.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the boss fight.  The issue is not so much perma-death if you die during the stage, but that you can sit in orbit and pummel the boss for literally several minutes with no effect.  The fight starts out fairly well, with destroying the shield generators, then the compounds on the ground.  But once he reveals himself, there seems to be no way to destroy him.  Also, There is a glitch where I believe turrets are spawning underground and shooting at you through the planet.  There is no way to destroy those, which is mildly irritating as well.\n\nBut all in all, this game is actually pretty fun.  I think it's worth it for about a buck and a half.", "recommendationid": "32164011", "language": "english", "developer_response": "Hi KyleKidd,\n\nThanks for the review!
