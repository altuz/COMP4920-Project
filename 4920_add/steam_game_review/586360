Some suggestions to the developer: \n\n1) Movement for something like this should be kept to a minimum.  Setting things up requires way too much movement.  Provide a menu and let us spawn the things we want instead of roaming around trying to find fireworks.  It gets too frustrating and doesnt add anything to the experience\n\n2) Once a design has been set up (and saved), lets add some music!\n\n3) Provide some kind of spectator system so that you can instantly go off a distance and watch the show.  Too  much looking straight up.\n\nCreating a fireworks display (especially to music) in of itself is a terrific concept.  Focus on that, and less on the pointless mechanics that just get tiresome.  Hoping to see this evolve more.  Good luck!  I recommend it because the dev has the foundation for a great product.", "recommendationid": "33112044", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498964713, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498964294, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198020552736", "num_games_owned": 73, "playtime_forever": 26}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510204"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 13, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 10}}
