You know, those contraptions where you need to guide a metal loop along a serpentine length of wire without actually touching the loop to the wire.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nIn [i]Vitatio 2[/i], your hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills are tested by having you navigate the mouse pointer through a very short maze while avoiding touching the edges. On your way to the exit, you can pick up three stars, which serve as some sort of score reflecting how well you performed.\n\nIt isn't much of a game, though. Everything depends on your mouse pointer speed. These days, most gamers have a gaming mouse that allows the mouse pointer to move at great speeds. And other people will often just increase the mouse pointer speed through Windows' configuration options. Well, at high mouse pointer speed, [i]Vitatio 2[/i] is near impossible to play. \n\nSo I lowered my mouse's DPI from 4000 to 400 and finished the game with little effort. If lowering your DPI and/or mouse pointer speed doesn't do the trick for you, you can temporarily enable mouse keys, meaning you can control the mouse pointer with the arrow keys of your keyboard. To enable mouse keys, press Left Alt + Left Shift + Num Lock on your keyboard at the same time. To disable mouse keys, repeat this process.\n\nIn the end, [i]Vitatio 2[/i] seems to be a test of your ability to reduce the mouse pointer speed rather than a test of your dexterity. There are a few more things to note that didn't sit well with me:\n[*] There are only 8 levels. I finished the whole game in 20 minutes (this includes the time I spent experimenting with DPI settings). Since [i]Vitatio 2[/i] isn't any fun I was glad it didn't last any longer, but it's still ridiculously short for a game that they dare charge money for.\n[*] Half of the mazes' corridors are completely superfluous. I mean, what's the point of the many dead ends where there's no star to pick up? None whatsoever.\n[*] The music consists of one bombastic classical tune played on piano and percussion, which doesn't really fit a game like this. A more light-hearted piece would have been more fitting.\n[*] The game is very basic. For example, if you hit one of the edges you're returned to the main menu one nanosecond later. No sound effect or message to let you know that you messed up, nothing.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]On Steam's extra features[/h1]\n\n[i]Vitatio 2[/i] has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game. \n\nThe Steam Achievements consist of two types: achievements granted for finishing each level with 1, 2 and 3 stars (so 24 total) and achievements for just starting each level up to five times (so 40 total). There are four more redundant achievements granted for finishing 2, 4, 6 and 8 levels, totalling 68 achievements.", "recommendationid": "34022754", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501876365, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501875163, "num_reviews": 92, "steamid": "76561198042646749", "num_games_owned": 700, "playtime_forever": 104}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518483"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
