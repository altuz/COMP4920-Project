This game is a 2D platformer that falls under a frustrating instadeath genre with lots of respawning. Although the difficulty was fair and the challenge goes up steadily over the course of the game. I glanced through some of the reviews which I think exaggerate the problems with this game. HikibYou2 incorporates a little bit of platforming, combat, and story into a small package. Sure the game is not amazing but in a price range of $1-2, it is above average quality.\n\nThe story has a high school drama feel to it which sounds awful. However, I personally found the dialogue interesting to read because it was snappy and somewhat silly on purpose. The game repeats the \"Key Fetch\" quest at least 10 times to a point where the characters start to play into it.  The plot twist was really enjoyable and it improved my overall impression of the story. The main character is a guy but the sprite looks like a female with a goth haircut ( I just enjoyed pretending that it was Faith from Mirror's Edge )\n\nCombat right now is built around one button. You can hold down or up to perform juggle combo or round-house.While jumping you can slow down your fall by attacking , it makes no sense but I love cheating physics. The fighting system and boss fights are pretty basic although a game like this one does need to be more complex. \n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ 3 to 5 hours of gameplay for a cheap price.\n+ good progression in difficulty. \n+ helpful checkpoints\n+ dynamic platforming elements\n+ enjoyable sound effects, music and pixel art.\n+ story ( I liked it but I might be alone on that one )\n\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- Excessive backtracking\n- Boss fights could be more interesting\n- Lack of variety when it comes to objectives\n- Combat felt like a time filler.  \n\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts 6.5/10  [/h1]\n\nConsidering the price of the game it did exactly what I wanted. I am usually not a fan of platformers with lots of instadeaths but I liked the laid back atmosphere in this one.I don't critique $2 game the same way I would a $15 game. If you want something very simple and cheap to waste couple hours I think HIKIBYOU2 can fill that need.", "recommendationid": "34050859", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502027377, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502154060, "num_reviews": 97, "steamid": "76561197995669628", "num_games_owned": 597, "playtime_forever": 328}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498327"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 3}}
