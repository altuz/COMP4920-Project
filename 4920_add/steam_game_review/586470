Has a few cons here and there but makes up for it with it's art style and fairly cool storyline.\n\nCons (Bad News first)\n- Some of the english translation is wrong or poorly structured, but that is probably the worst part.\n- In parts, the music is poorly looped and most of the music is pretty average.\n- The gameplay is pretty clunky I won't lie.\n\nPros\n- Interesting storyline.\n- Challenging puzzles (Most of them).\n- Unique art style.\n- Worth it for it's price (I got it on sale for 60 cents).\n- It is Noir themed, so it's going to be good.\n- Trading Cards!
