Grab it on sale and you'll not regret the couple hours it takes to finish.\n\nThere's only 13 levels, so its basically a single episode of Wolfenstein. They change up the formula a bit by adding a shotgun and a rifle to the normal Wolf armaments. Also, there's a great focus on melee enemies (the werewolves). They can be challenging due to their ability to sneak up on you and their irregular movement patterns.\n\nAll in all, not a bad game.
