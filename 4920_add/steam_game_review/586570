Running out of health or falling out of the level puts you back at the start of the current level, putting the player back to full health\\stamina but also restoring the defeated enemies.\n\nEach secret/challenge area allows to unlock an additional \"costume\" once completed. Costumes grant the protagonist-robot various passive and active abilities - for instance, one of them allows to wall-jump; one allows for limited flight; a number alters how player projectiles work. You can switch costumes whenever you want, allowing to chain effects of multiple of them. Mobility-related abilities can then be used to get to previously unreachable spots on current and previous levels (which you can revisit freely).\n\nUpgrades are orbs found at the ends of miniature obstacle courses within levels, commonly boosting player's health, stamina (used for abilities), or attack power. Taking time to backtrack and recover all of these paves a fairly safe road through most of the game. Skipping most of them allows to complete the levels faster, but at a cost of some trouble during boss fights.\n\nBosses are not particularly frustrating, most of fights requiring only to memorize several patterns that they switch between based on some rule. Some of these have interesting designs - for instance, at one point you fight a giant cactus, which is armed with large cannons, while riding on small train carts. So there's that I guess.\n\nOne thing that I've found to be of a minor annoyance is that the game follows the quite-so-common \"tap to shoot with an on-screen projectile count limit\" scheme. Most enemies can't take more than a few hits so this does not matter much, but does encourage some panicked button mashing after making a number of mistakes and falling to low health during a boss fight. The developer answered that they'll see about adding a slightly-slower auto-fire option in future (so that tapping is advantageous, but not a requirement), so perhaps this will be even less of a concern later on.\n\nOverall, while the game does not do anything exceptional, it accomplishes everything that it intends to, being an overall-pleasant experience.", "recommendationid": "29624214", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1485942738, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485863469, "num_reviews": 39, "steamid": "76561198025072099", "num_games_owned": 187, "playtime_forever": 199}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511469"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1485918615, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is a lot of fun.
