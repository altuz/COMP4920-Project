It requires you to stop and think, yet its not difficult to come up with answers. Also, if you just want to explore and not worry about high score then you can actually reuse old verbs when applicable. Otherwise there are multiple answers that are expected to interact with the environment. Overall it was a treat to see an old premise get revived in this way. In the end the game was very enjoyable to play through.\n\nWhen it comes to sound, it also was excellent and the ost essentially added to the atmosphere. I`ll definately check out the artist. The voice overs were meh, but they did not detract from the gameplay. It was a good choice to leave them in so you can use multiple senses while exploring.\n\nThe only cons that come to mind are slow movment speed for the first 3/4 quarters of the game and the fact that I enjoyed it so much that I wish it was longer with greater interactions.\n\nI`ll look forward to what the dev has to offer in the future.\n\n", "recommendationid": "35160009", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506189322, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 185, "last_played": 1506188132, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198135955496", "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_forever": 185}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506045214, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Part walking simulator, part text adventure.
