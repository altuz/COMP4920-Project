And the change of dialoug with the choices you do. They will provide different information about themself and a bit of the world too. Yet the world itself will remain a mystery to us... \n And there is a story of runnning .. and running from ones pursuers. But that is bascially just there to force the characters know each other from the events. And all the events are the same on each route, so you can skip the most of the text if you have played one route. Luckly the skip button is a very trustworthy companion due to it stops on the smallest change of text, so you wont worry about to miss anything.\nAnd the reason for their journey will not be told at all, it just ends .. No one will tell, why there were hunted to begin with ... ( But maybe .. one can figure it out anyway with all the information .. )\n\nThere are three different endigns with each of the love interests, ( Also there is an achievement for that too ).\nWhich is, different ending dialoug .. That is all. \nThe three love choices are enjoyable to get to know. Since I liked all of them, all containing their own charm and quirks. And how all of them bond togheter, and have their of growth of change within them. \nEspecially how the main character personality transpire is the most drastic one. From completely obsessed to more understanding. Since due to the beginning, a vision tells of happy marriage, and become blinded by the future. \n\nThe scenary is beautiful, with the sketchy lines full of life, yet still portrays clear image of a forest. \nTheir could been a bit more CG:s ..  \nThe proportion are okay, but still .. their hands could be way to small, that is something that kept bothering me ..\nThe colouring is splendid, the shading and lightning really brings out a solid form.\n\nThe background music is different piano pieces, each beffiting the various scenes. One more stressfull and another calmer etc.\n\nSo.. there is not much of a story in this game. It is mostly based on interaction with one character, and how they handle the idea of knowing the future. And I enjoyed it though, it was not as I expected.. Since it could be a bit boring with just being on the run. But the characters made up for that, since as I mentioned are the main center of the entire non-existing plot. \n\nThe reason I bought this game is because I liked January's design .. And I got what I wanted. So I am no disappointed. Heee. And his route was the best one <3.\nSo I liked the game overall, yaay.", "recommendationid": "33134441", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499032729, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499003569, "num_reviews": 18, "steamid": "76561198120498361", "num_games_owned": 167, "playtime_forever": 1013}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521305"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 3}}
