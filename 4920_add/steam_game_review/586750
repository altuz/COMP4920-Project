It had a better sequel, and then faded into history... until now! This is a turn-based RPG, where you play as a zombie named Sonny and some of his allies. There is a strong emphasis on strategy, and trying to just grind through will not get you very far very fast. It has a customizable skill tree, which is always nice.\n\nHowever...\n\nThe devs took a free flash game from something like ten years ago, removed a bunch of stuff from it, and are now selling it on steam. Most egregiously there are no longer any character animations! The characters pictures just sort of move forward when they attack and backward when they're done. Even the very first Final Fantasy did better than this... come on, guys, what are you trying to pull here?\n\nThere is also much less voice acting. This seems like an even weirder thing to remove, because decent voice acting is even easier than decent animations. I don't want to acuse the devs of a cash grab, because they put at least a little work into this, but an updated remake ten years after the original should be better, not worse.", "recommendationid": "35057642", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505794256, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "last_played": 1506371766, "num_reviews": 89, "steamid": "76561197982567490", "num_games_owned": 540, "playtime_forever": 200}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523585"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1506831906, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Having played the first two original flash games, I really wanted to like this reboot. And I did enjoy it very much. Most of the complaints about this game seem to involve the AI and design changes, but I was impressed by both. Allies follow-up on the main character's tactics logically with their skills, and they're dependable healers when their skills are on cooldown.\n\nVoice acting is partial but still great when it's there (I'm gonna knock you silly!) and animations/weapon and armor skins no longer exist. The palate swaps for Sonny's classes are cool though, and I think the improved art style is a worthy trade-off. \n\nHOWEVER, there are some dissapointments even if you welcome those changes.\nThere are technical issues, about as many as you might expect from a flash game, though the devs seem to be active trying to address them. I overwrite the same save slot with a new game and I think that caused it's corruption, so I had to start over. Sometimes exiting a screen makes it permanently dim out, justifying a force quit.\n\nI had fun until the end. Which is pretty much the story of the first two games combined, then it seems like he ran out of ideas so he just slapped on some villain that was a thinly veiled Trump parody. It's subtle at first, he seemed like a Lex Luthor type villain in design but it is revealed at the end he's a \"big bully\" like Trump. Then it's no longer subtle, and it seems like the creator is whining through the game. And it really sucks to have a bunch of political garbage shoehorned in and trying to be passed off as a climax. There's also nothing to do after beating the game except for playing it again, as far as I know.\n\nI hope this isn't the last game this person makes though.", "recommendationid": "35363317", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506832077, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2463, "last_played": 1506829749, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198412110452", "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_forever": 2463}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1507055003, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I desperately wanted to give this a thumbs up and tried so hard to like this game, but to no avail. I love the sonny series and was absolutely ecstatic when I found this remake. I instantly bought it regardless of my friends all begging me not to waste my money on it. I wanted to give one of my favorite game series a chance. Well, I was extremely disappointed and now i've gone past 2 hours and can't refund the game.\n\nPROS: \n - New engaging storyline\n - New playable characters\n - New abilities and Sonny forms\n - Tons of items and customization for RPG loadouts\n\nCONS:\n - Barely any voice acting. Even the original flashes had more voice acting than this game!\n - The visuals are horrid. They're immobile cardboard cutouts and it feels like you'd get a better experience from physically moving actual cardboard with your hands and using your imagination.\n - The ally AI is literally the worst in this series yet. The older versions allowed you to control them if you wanted to and use them better, but now all allies use AI and never do anything you want or need them to do. It's as useless as having a lvl 1 Smash Bros bot on your team while fighting tournament champions.\n - The Achievements are far too difficult for those who are new to the game. Even a veteran of this series like myself found them a bit harsh to even attempt. \n - Some enemy effects are absolute garbage. They ruin the gameplay and sap the fun right out of the game entirely. Sure, it might be fun to have them in a higher difficulty setting, but at least give people the option to either enjoy the game or torture themselves. \n\n\nOverall, I'd rate this game a solid 3 / 10   because of how buggy it is, how much it lacks QUALITY content, how cheap the battles are, and how much they definitely didn't put their heart and soul into this game like they did the original ones.", "recommendationid": "35453651", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1507055003, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498932911, "num_reviews": 22, "steamid": "76561198042709543", "num_games_owned": 490, "playtime_forever": 260}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506429754, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Sonny 2 was better.
