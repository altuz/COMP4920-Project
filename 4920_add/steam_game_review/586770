It's TOO FAST!!  Not so fast that I couldn't keep up, but too quick for me to really read the stock options I had, or to feel like I was doing much more than clikcing as fast as I could before my poor avatar died of old age.... which he did, dreams unrealized because I spent 4 minutes reading the menus.  lol, anyway that's my only complaint.  I hope the devs keep working on it and adding things... so if you see this, please add in an option to make the years last a little longer.  I want to be able to gloat as my fortunes begin to exceed everyone else's on the list.  Do I recommend this game?  Why yes I do... totally worth the asking price.", "recommendationid": "31411463", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493368527, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493559941, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198119481936", "num_games_owned": 55, "playtime_forever": 105}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510920"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1493253184, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A small but perfectly formed penis, I mean game.

The goal here is to monopolize literally everything that can be monopolized, by buying market shares from different industries. In this way the gameplay is quite similar to AdVenture Capitalist, only here you have a set time limit (your life expectancy), so you'll need a strategy if you want to own everything as quickly as possible (hint: start with media). Apart from that, there are various mini-games that can help you get more cash, or regain popularity that is lost by failing to address scandals and controversies (they arise as a result of buying market shares from marked industries). Overall, this game is preety fun, even if quite short, and also has some good satirical references sprinkled here and there to boot.", "recommendationid": "31396207", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493309100, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493306298, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198019997655", "num_games_owned": 183, "playtime_forever": 110}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495932"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1493331812, "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Get your solid gold suit out of the wardrobe and be ready to negotiate harder than Trump on steroids because this game is.... not worth \u00a34.
