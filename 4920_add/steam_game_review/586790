(Unfortunately no one comes forward because the developer knows all too well that as soon as he reveals his whereabouts castration from him developing any future products will be on the table).\n\nSo far 5 games that statue his developing career have been erected in this great Steam Country of ours and all of them need to be pulled down and trampled on by the cavalry of disgruntled gamers circling in computer chairs as they shout cries of Liberation and Freedom from the cruel oppression of bad game designers.\n\nHold your houses is basically a knock off Tom Clancy game demonstrating severe Down syndrome. The objective is to protect your house by shooting bad guys dressed up as a special counter terrorist squad who come knocking on your door and jumping through your windows. You have 5 maps which basically look exactly the same. You will be surrounded by enemies from every direction within the first minute or two and shot repeatedly in the head because they can shoot through walls, never miss and you only have enough arsenal to last a couple of rounds.\n\nThe tutorial is the only really playable part and this is where the abysmal concept of the game really shines. You see on this map the enemy cannot destroy the wooden planks you erect to barricade the doors and windows, meaning you can outlast the constant waves of spawning groups. However as the number of NPC's increases so does the lag and by wave 56 you will be down to 1 frame per second because there is like 10,000 at your window. All you can do to get out of this is throw a grenade and sit on it.\n\nIn conclusion 'Forget Hold your Houses and WhackAKey instead HOLD YOUR MONEY!'\n\nBelow is the game hopefully it settles your curiosity...\nhttps://youtu.be/zmnuW-C8PZE\n", "recommendationid": "34795854", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504795996, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504279409, "num_reviews": 183, "steamid": "76561198112866114", "num_games_owned": 2624, "playtime_forever": 158}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507049"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
