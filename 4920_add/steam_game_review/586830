Some parts are fun - eating soldiers never grows old. \n\nWhat does get old immediately is the inconsistent controls. Sometimes you grab a building and a hunk comes off in your hand, other times the same exact motion does nothing.

Your body will often clip through or get hung in buildings, which is a nausea inducing experience.", "recommendationid": "33754462", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1500849590, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500520176, "num_reviews": 24, "steamid": "76561197968547267", "num_games_owned": 660, "playtime_forever": 41}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 10, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 7}}
