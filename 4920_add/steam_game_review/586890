One controller is the racket, the other controller some device that doesn't do anything at all? I could never get it to work in any of the different game modes.\nAt the beach, I couldn't start any of the games.  In the other two locations it worked. I suspect this game is aimed at children, but the physics aren't so good (hitting a balloon doesn't feel real and sometimes the balloon goes through the racket). Balloons float down very slowly so there's no real excitement, maybe for 3-4 year olds? Balloons that fall on your head just pass through your body, which totally kills immersion. You play in a tiny, almost invisible glass cube and the balloons can't leave the cube, so you don't have to move at all.  I have a 6-year old daughter but this is not going to be able to hold her attention for longer than 60 seconds max, and then probably never again. Too bad, I wish there were more quality VR games for children.", "recommendationid": "30707046", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1490370806, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490370407, "num_reviews": 143, "steamid": "76561198258022771", "num_games_owned": 370, "playtime_forever": 7}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495086"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 0}}
