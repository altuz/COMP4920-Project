(A testament to my own illness, not the game's quality.) I think it probably took right around 3 hours of actual playtime.\n\nI like the game... but it's buggy. There were a couple times where I had to quit out to Windows and restart so the game would fix the state it was in. It was like the game was in two states at once, say Act 1 and Act 2 simultaneously. Quitting did resolve the issue, though, and I was able to progress. \n\nThe English translation of this game is so-so. It was missing articles and some words were mistranslated, and was a little rough around the edges. This made a couple of the HOG items difficult to find, but it almost added another layer of difficulty.\n\nI played on the highest difficulty setting, and I had the feeling something wasn't working as intended. There's an eyeball mouse state, that the in-game help says is for getting a more detailed view. But when I click, nothing happens. Having played a ton of games like this, I'd have expected VO or text describing what I was looking at, but nothing of the sort appeared. It really felt like a bug, as opposed to a strange design decision.\n\nIn the bonus episode, there's a train minigame that I found impossible to complete, because the train bugged trying to go around a curve and instead went on its own path, in no relation to what was possible or likely. This, too, felt like a bug. Fortunately I was able to skip past it so I could progress.\n\nI'd love to be able to recommend this game, because I found it more fun than most in its genre, but I can't do so in good conscience unless the issues I encountered are addressed. That said, if you don't mind a little buginess, dive in.", "recommendationid": "30934779", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1491274039, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491273304, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198034207510", "num_games_owned": 478, "playtime_forever": 554}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524879"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1490958183, "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great little game, !!!", "recommendationid": "30850919", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1490958183, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490977392, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198003208612", "num_games_owned": 127, "playtime_forever": 245}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.398016"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
