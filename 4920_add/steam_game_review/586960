There's no story or 'adventure', just 40 incredibly simple 'puzzles' (some of which you'll complete within 10 seconds, on the very first try) that get boring quickly.\n\nIf the gameplay concept (inverting gravity) sounds appealing to you, go buy VVVVV. It's much more exciting, challenging, charming, funny, and has much snappier controls and better music. If you've played VVVVV and enjoyed it, save your money; you'll hate this.", "recommendationid": "34561461", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503952061, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503951802, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198039627373", "num_games_owned": 145, "playtime_forever": 52}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1503471381, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "got boring after the 1st couple of levels but i could see some people enjoying it however since i didnt enjoy it i cant recommend it but overall i didnt see it being  a bad game", "recommendationid": "34431647", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503471381, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503471452, "num_reviews": 37, "steamid": "76561198092106437", "num_games_owned": 153, "playtime_forever": 13}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496034"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1500905553, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not bad platformer.
