You have to drag and drop direction keys instead of using your keyboard.\n- Less than 30 minutes of game time, even if you go for 100% like me\n- Annoying music and sounds. Also the mute button in the game does only mute the level music. You still get all the sounds and menu music\n\n\nThe only good thing about this game is the actual gameplay idea of having to navigate through a maze by planning ahead.

This is also the most annoying control system I've experienced in a puzzle game, and makes achieving three stars almost impossible since you only get sixty seconds per level and have to screw around with finding the right directional arrow at the bottom, drag and drop each to the top, hit the start button, and watch the mouse move.\n\nOn top of that, the game is pretty glitchy. Sometimes the arrows don't go in the right blocks on top and the mouse will move on its own, more often to it own death. If it happens, you're better off just restarting the level. But if you complete a level repeatedly, you unlock and beat the next stage automatically with a one star rating. Yep, if you want this for achievements, just beat stage 3 over and over and you've got them all, and the level select screen shows you completed all twenty levels.\n\nI do admit, it helped kill about an hour, but that's it. I didn't enjoy myself, I kept quitting and coming back, and just wished i was playing something else. There's no replay value given the control scheme vs. the time limit, so unless you want an easy 100% in the achievements department, just skip this one.", "recommendationid": "29683199", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486177486, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486059313, "num_reviews": 109, "steamid": "76561198025037510", "num_games_owned": 3292, "playtime_forever": 61}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515457"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 10, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1486052222, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Incredibly awkward controls made the game less fun than it could've been.\nForces players to drag and drop directional arrows, instead of just hitting keys on the keyboard.\n\nThe only difficulty is timing, trying to get through the levels in the time allotted, but this is only a factor because of the awkward controls.\n\nI suppose there may be potential here, but as it stands now it's not quite the caliber of a free flash game.\n\nNote: I 100%'d the game.
