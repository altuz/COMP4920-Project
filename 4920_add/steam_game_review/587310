The game presents the player with real moral dilemmas that they have to participate in and decide for themselves. There's never a clear winner; each decision comes with its pros and cons and makes the player consider what the consequences of their action will be. The overarching plot of joy and sorrow is a little difficult to grasp (I still don't understand what the value of sorrow is supposed to be), but the individual moments are good in isolation.\n\nUnfortunately, the creative limitations of RPG Maker show themselves when it comes to tieing the regular gameplay to the theme of moral dilemmas. While the game's narrative is about conflict resolution and creating peace, all you ever do to accomplish these goals is battle creatures with weapons and spells, which hardly feels appropriate. I hope in the future the creator is able to expand their toolbox to other game development software so that they can truly put their vision into every aspect of the game!\n\nThe turn-based battles aren't half-bad by themselves; the switching of power and support roles between worlds is neat and the various abilities give a decent amount of strategy to the fights. There were times when the battles felt more tedious than exciting, and there were times when the opposite was true.\n\nThe music and visuals aren't that great, but they're fun and get the job done.\n\nOverall, I was satisfied with the game and am glad that I played it. I'm excited to see what this developer will create next, because this game feels like an early manifestation of some great potential.", "recommendationid": "32097118", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1496360312, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493897810, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198027576023", "num_games_owned": 210, "playtime_forever": 596}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492349398, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "So far I've really been enjoying the game. It has a neat mechanic where one player character holds domain over the world you are in at a given time, being the primary fighter, while the other plays support. This spices battle up, especially when a certain foe takes advantage of that and shifts between worlds mid fight. The music has been wonderful, and the plot shows a branching storyline that you will be introduced to early. You'll know which world you are in at any given time by the music, and whether anything in the world (minus your player characters) are monochrome and sad, or colorful and happy.

The game takes example from the Mother series (Earthbound) in making a simple turn based rpg that focuses on personality and charm and expands on that concept the way only this specific developer could. Soma Spirit is a unique experience that takes inspiration from multiple greats. If classic Rareware made an rpg, I'm not even sure they could match the amount of quirkiness shown in this one. Ultimately the game is a satisfying experience that any JRPG or non JRPG fan can enjoy. It is a pleasant place to be where the player has the choice to shift the direction of the story via cruicial choices. I am proud to say that I highly recommend this one.\n\nIf you want a more throuogh review written by me, stop by here: https://rpgmaker.net/games/8582/reviews/5413/", "recommendationid": "31302013", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492882825, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492614561, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198007486481", "num_games_owned": 315, "playtime_forever": 320}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492280033, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game makes me smile, so much cute dialog and the dynamic of the two main characters is so fun.

With branching stories and a difficulty setting, this game ozzes replayability.\n\nHave I mentoined the charm? The charcters of this world are so interesting and fun to be around, and while the story isn't a shakespearean masterpiece, the characters and idea alone are certainly more and enough for an Indie Title.\n\nIt would be a crime to not mention the awesome soundtrack. Developer Torch 60 really served up one spicy soundtrack, with soothing, chraming beats in the light world, and fast, electric pieces in the dark world. It's a soundtrack so good, they even have a music player in game for you to listen to them all! Thanks Torch 60!\n\nOverall, this game is worthy of a look at by any RPG or Indie enthusiast. It's a great game to play on those long weekends, and I hope to see a sequel, or even a new game, from this dev team in the future.", "recommendationid": "31189628", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492388606, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492975941, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198121376530", "num_games_owned": 55, "playtime_forever": 703}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492703420, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Awesome game 10/10, especially for it's price.
