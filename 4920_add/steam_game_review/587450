I mean, as a baby dakotaraptor I was zipping in between the legs of a massive triceratops, just for fun--how cool is that! You'll be wandering around looking for food, only to encounter a t-rex doing the same thing...except for it, you're the food. \n\nPros: \n--Great graphics\n--Movement feels very natural, very fluid\n--Good fps; seems reasonably optimized (for my system, at least)\n--Very immersive, feels like you're really a dinosaur\n--Good survival experience--you never feel truly safe\n\nCons: \n--Right now, the combat is weird because every dino (no matter how large or small) seems able to kill you in 1-2 hits, whereas it takes you like 20. Not sure if it's a problem with hitboxes, or if it's intentional--but it gets annoying.\n--You can go a long time without encountering any food, especially when you're young. This can lead to being near starving to death. Again, not sure if it's intentional. \n--Occasional crashes. This doesn't really bother me that much, since it's still in development, and saving is easy.\n--No narrative; your goal is just to survive. It might be better to have another option than 'survival mode', one with a story to provide focus (like, an asteroid or ice age, for example). Otherwise, the game will eventually get boring unless you constantly add new, varied dinos. \n\nI think the main thing the game needs is an improvement to combat--no more instant deaths, but a bitter drawn-out battle of tooth and claw. That would make it an amazing experience. \n\nGenerally I don't invest in early access games--but the potential here is so incredible I feel it's worth the price.", "recommendationid": "35128855", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506089857, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 162, "last_played": 1506140063, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198003895984", "num_games_owned": 211, "playtime_forever": 162}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520906"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1505445993, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Game works and high attention and accuracy have been given into to the fauna of the late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) but that is where my praise ends and my quarrel begins.

I literally bought a laptop for this. Admittedly there isn't a whole lot to do yet, as once you've maxed out Dakota, there's nothing else left to do except muck around with whatever dinosaurs you can find but that isn't a complaint as this game is still basically brand new and in early access, so limited content and bugs are to be expected. I'm so eager for any update of new content we get, I don't regret my purchase at all. Remember that early access is going to be roughly 2 years so any new content will be slow to come out.

Saurian is a highly realistic dinosaur survival simulator that takes place in the hell creek formation during the late cretaceous. Unlike the community freakshow of a game called \"the isle\", Saurian has no shrinkwrapping, realistic creatures and enviroment, mostly good community(il explain why in a sec), and performs really well. (I have a GTX 1070 and i get no lag at all) while the isle has an incredibly toxic community, corrupt, rude developers, and is itself a poorly optimized game.Most of the dinosaurs have feathers also unlike the scaly bipedal lizards from the isle. Only one dinosaur is playable so far (Dakotaraptor) but there is more to come.So far as dakotaraptor its easy to hunt and kill certain prey aswell as still provide a challenge. If saurian's community doesnt decay like the isle's, then this game has a good future.\n\nThe community is good for the most part, but you do get the occasional furry and isle player in it (cringy ms paint and furry artwork is an example).\n\nNow here are the cons: The thing i dont like most about this game is that not everything will be playable in the full release ie crocodiles, pterosaurs, edmontosaurus (not fully sure why its called anatosaurus. i know its synonymous but whats wrong with calling it good ol edmontosaurus?) gallimimus, etc. I do understand that smaller creatures will mean that they will require higher textures (an easy fix for this is to zoom out the third person) and that pterosaurs but i dont really understand the others. Devs have explained that crocodiles have low metabolisms and edmontosaurus are migratory species, but in my perspective i just see that as they dont want to put in the extra work to make those playable.\nI think it would still be realistic if they ignored the crocodile's metabolisms(the day cycle is shorter than irl anyways) and the edmontosaurus's migrational pattern. I think they might just be going a little overboard with this realism.\n\nAnother big dissapointment in my opinion is that this game runs on Unity. This makes it hard for modders to modify stuff in the game for others to enjoy. so far a workshop isnt confirmed. I personally prefer Unreal Engine myself since its highly versatile compared to unity.\n\nThough the dinosaurs are really realistic, i do have an issue with the mouths of Dakotaraptor and tyrannosaurus. (Tyrannosaurus is getting a new model) There isnt really proof that theropods, let alone tyrannosaurus, had lips, infact theres more proof that tyrannosaurs had no lips or atleast partial lip covering. https://www.livescience.com/58474-new-tyrannosaur-had-no-lips.html\nTheropods would really need lips to protect their teeth if they are constantly replacing them. also the skin on the snouts dont look avian or dinosaurian at all. They look smooth and scaleless and always wet as if they are more mammal than dinosaur(most mammals like dogs have wet noses and thats what dakotaraptor's snout looks like all over, a wet dog nose).\n\nI have also had a bad experience with one developer/moderator (i dont remember x.x) in discord taking a joke image too seriously then banning me from the discord (i left before i got banned because i was tired of bringing myself down to an immature and rediculous level) but since the other developers and mods have been nice to me aswell as the community im going to let this one slide. Though I am a bit alienated by the Saurian developers because they seem to be friends with the developers of the isle(isle devs are notorious for being corrupt and mean to their playerbase)\n\nSo overall, I recommend this game. Devs are nice for the most part, game has alot of potential despite having certain flaws, and there will be multiplayer added. My own advice is to not get yourself involved in the forums or discord(especially if you have a dark sense of humor) since this is an early access game.", "recommendationid": "34828368", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504928796, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1506142729, "num_reviews": 16, "steamid": "76561197996441810", "num_games_owned": 123, "playtime_forever": 494}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501213"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504966589, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I reccomend this game.

The market needs a good open world, scientifically accurate, dinosaur survival game. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the concept, and I\u2019m glad that finally a serious project is underway to realize this long overlooked idea.\n\nThe title of the game, the store presentation, the desktop icon, and even the main menu all look professionally done. Beyond the main menu and into the main game, the early access state of the project hits you like a truck!\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single finished aspect of the game \u2013 and I mean this is a bare bones project that has just barely lifted off the ground. The art, sound, and graphic design all lack a general direction at this point. Everything is just thrown together to more-or-less demo the skills of its developers and to test the feasibility of this project. I\u2019ve been hyped for this title since its inception, but this has been a sobering reminder of what to expect from an indie title versus a full production.\n\nThat said I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that this is by far the most disappointing purchase I\u2019ve so far experienced on Steam in its current state.\n\nThe presentation suggests a game full of imagination, creativity, adventure, and survival. This is an ambitious project that nobody so far has been able to realize, but the product so far could not be further from what the store presentation suggests.\n\nThe cover art suggests an action packed, thrilling adventure 66 million years in the making. From hatchling to adult hood, you walk every step as one of your favorite dinosaurs in a scientifically accurate prehistoric open world. Interact with advanced A.I dinosaurs, marvel at their science derived dinosaur models, and be astounded by this rigorously researched world\u2026\n\n\u2026 Or not.\n\nThe A.I is literally on par with the failed Jurassic Park: Trespasser project. Within my 8 minutes of gameplay, I saw a T-Rex manically walking in circles in a knee high swamp. I saw a full grown raptor walking directly into a tree, determined to phase through it. I did eventually kill a fellow hatchling raptor, which most likely would have rolled over and died on its own if the coding was there. Long story short, I saw enough examples of the A.I. in the starting area to be disappointed. It was then I wished the game was an MMO.\n\nThe dinosaur models, while they may be accurate to the most recent scientific iteration, still simply lack imagination. So does the open world environment in general. There\u2019s no artistic flare to draw you in\u2026 the world as it exists today just lacks creativity. Just because something is \u201cscientific\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be awesome. I urge the developers to take SOME liberties with their art/sound design. As it is today, there is no direction here, and it makes for an awkward and disappointing experience.\n\nNow I\u2019m left wondering, because I\u2019ve seen no direction in the development thus far, will this project actually pan out? Or will it be added to the heap of indie titles that merely served as a cash grab? There\u2019s still much to be decided.", "recommendationid": "35402480", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506911811, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1506907618, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198068725551", "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 9}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497726"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1507056639, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "wow so i get super excited about a game like this but when i install it i cant even move my mouse without it taking about 6 years to follow, the lag on the game has really disapointed me, i was looking foward to a good game but the graphics are no where near as good as what it says on its trailer, i cant belive i payed for this game i want a refund.", "recommendationid": "35454183", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1507056639, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1507056059, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198331444206", "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 21}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498799"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 11, "total_negative": 58, "total_reviews": 225, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 167}}
