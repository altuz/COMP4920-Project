In the small bits of story you get at the beginning and end of the game theres just bits of english that does not make sense, as well as gramatical errors. I'm still not really sure what the story was outside of \"some guy is a bad guy\". Ontop of that the controls are a bit wonky. There were times where I could not even move backwards, the key to walk back just would not register, even after restarting the client, so I would have to kill myself to get the game to work again. There was a time where I DID kill myself to fix the issue and the bonfire + enemies just disappeared, forcing me to restart the client afterall. Sometimes the client would close itself out of nowhere. \n\nBoss fights were pretty one dimensional, in that a lot of the time in order to kill the boss you could resort to the simple strategy of just jumping back and forth around the boss, whittling down its health until it's dead. \n\nOn the subject of bosses, the art styles for each boss was so different from the game it felt like some of them were just ripped from RPG maker. I met one instance with a boss where they just simply glitched and did not move at all. Overall it was an interesting concept and you could tell where its inspiration came from, the pixel art for the stage itself, outside of enemies was fantastic but the game was definitely a miss for me. I really did not get any sense of achievement for beating this game.  Too many bugs and just too simple.

Tonight's game is Dark Throne, which looked great from the screenshots. I'm slowly starting to learn that visuals aren't everything but they're *usually* a good indicator. Maybe I've just been unlucky of late.\n\nAnyways, on to this game. I was all set for a great 2D Dark Souls experience but straight away something seemed a little off.. the way the character moved and the UI leaves something to be desired too.\n\nThe enemies (who look like The Bastard Of Bolton from Game of Thrones!) bizarrely bounce of your shield. The amount of endurance (green bar) you lose for each hit they do is basically nothing as you'll recover it all back before they even attack again.\n\nThe game is blatantly meant to be Dark Souls right, so why change the controls? I mean I can understand a little adjustment from 3D to 2D but why is right trigger block?! Why does the B button bring up the help menu instead of rolling? Why isn't there a roll button? Why can't you attack mid-air? \n\nAll of the animations are hilariously fast, yet the game play isn't so I'm pretty sure it's not because my computer's running the game mega-quick. Also why does my character, who is a knight in heavy armour, FLOAT when he jumps?!\n", "recommendationid": "31062956", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1491841967, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491135993, "num_reviews": 107, "steamid": "76561198067444037", "num_games_owned": 398, "playtime_forever": 21}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490989"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 11, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 6}}
