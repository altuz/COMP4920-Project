I agree with the others who ask why even have this game listed for sale. Its not my P.C. or drivers on my end, it is the programmers lack of skill... It is what it is man. To be fair though STEAM plays a large part in this because this past year has seen a swarm of developers selling crap that doesnt run or they actually have Trading Cards for a brief moment before there is no more business relationship with STEAM. Cards that people bought become worthless but what does STEAM care as they got their piece of the pie.
