But even if you do yearn for more of those games, it's doubtful whether 'a smidge of\u2026' will justify opening your Steam wallet for this extremely basic attempt at imitating an experience from bygone days.[/h1] \n\nIn the Steam Store page's description, the developer compares [i]The Artist[/i] to [i]Myst[/i] among other adventure games. Indeed, when playing [i]The Artist[/i], you immediately see where that comparison comes from but you also can't help but feel it's just a very shallow attempt at generally recreating a certain gaming experience from 25 years ago, adding nothing and taking away everything except for the very bare basics.\n\nFirst of all, I think it's fair to pose the question whether people are generally waiting for more games like Myst, Riven and the likes. We're talking about adventure games that were so difficult that 98% of the players could only finish them by repeatedly consulting a walkthrough or by writing down dozens of pages of possible clues they encountered and spending many hours on one puzzle, often eventually solving it by mere trial and error.\n\nThen, for people who are indeed looking for that and for people who didn't live through that era and aren't really sure, we need to pose the question whether [i]The Artist[/i] scratches the itch, as it were.\n\nThose old-school, near-impossible puzzle adventure games of the 1990s looked gorgeous back then, and they oozed atmosphere and mystery in the form of puzzles that you felt compelled to solve.\n\n[i]The Artist[/i] looks minimalistic at best and just awful when describing it more frankly. There's nothing to see here that's even remotely eye pleasing. \n\nThe puzzles, while being the core of a puzzle adventure game like this, seem to be thrown in for good measure somehow. All of the puzzles revolve around the principle of looking for objects that have part of a combination written in or on them, and eventually matching some of those symbols or glyphs to the correct puzzle. For example, you see a couple of doors that are protected by a combination lock, so you need to look around the whole game world for objects that have part of the combination written on them. And every puzzle is a variation on that principle, so you'll find a lot of objects that have glyphs or other symbols written on them and you'll see puzzles that require some of those symbols to solve, so the matchmaking can begin.\n\nYes, that is reminiscent of Myst, Riven and similar puzzle adventure games, but those games managed to [b]motivate[/b] the player to solve the puzzles by adding a compelling narrative or a mysterious setting, they managed to insert variety in their puzzles (or at least create the illusion of variety very well) and they managed to present their game in a form that was easy on the eye. \n\nAlso, [i]The Artist[/i]'s game world is tiny. You can walk around the whole island in less than one minute and that's only because there's no option to sprint.\n\nThe most annoying thing about [i]The Artist[/i] has to be its mouse pointer. It's a small black circle, so when trying to investigate a dark surface for spots to interact with, you don't see the mouse pointer. But worse than that, the mouse pointer only appears when it's right on top of an interactable part of an object. Even when you [b]know[/b] there to be an interactable spot, it can take a while to focus the invisible mouse pointer (i.e. the exact middle of your screen) on the 'sweet spot' to make the mouse pointer appear and finally be able to click to interact. And if you don't know there to be an interactable area on an object and you just want to investigate the object, you'll have a very hard time finding any interactable areas if there are any. \n\nAt one point, the mouse pointer even bugged out on me by disappearing for good, not even showing up in the game's menu anymore. So I had to Alt + F4 to quit the game and restart it to solve the problem.\n\nPlaying [i]The Artist[/i] feels like going from Lego to Duplo, like going from Windows 98 to Windows 3.1 or like going from cell phone to rotary dial telephone. It should therefore only be considered by people who sometimes miss the frustration of the difficult puzzle adventure games of 25 years ago and would settle for experiencing only that, and none of the things that those games did right so as to 'justify' frustrating the player.", "recommendationid": "35244447", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506528171, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 73, "last_played": 1506277049, "num_reviews": 92, "steamid": "76561198042646749", "num_games_owned": 700, "playtime_forever": 73}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512472"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
