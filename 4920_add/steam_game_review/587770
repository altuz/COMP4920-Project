Now, I got it because I have a 2 1/2 year old that likes car games and at $5, I kept my expectations low...  and graphis settings for that matter...  And... this does fit the defintion of a \"Car game\" and it kept his attention for just over a half hour that I enjoyed spending with him, not the game.  Afterwards, he wandered off and I was gleeful to turn it off.\nNow the game.  If you like driving on the \"preferred\" path, its pretty straightforward.  But, after a while, you realize that the arrow to guide you to the next gate is fairly accurate, and it is more rewarding to just drive off the cliff and land next to the desired gate, and save yourself the agony of trying to drive it, unless you hit anything like tree branches, or rocks or imaginary walls.  \nThe vehicles all pretty much drive the same, which is floaty, bouncy vehicles that accelerate like something out of a formula one game.  So, good luck staying on the trails if you hold down the \"w\" or forward arrow.  Though, it is laughable to do so to see if you truly can stay on the trail.  Damage to your vehicle does not degrade its performance and yeah.  I rate this between why my navel lint is blue, and why my son refuses to take a nap.
