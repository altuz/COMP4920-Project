I could write a better game on Unity in a 3 hour game jam. I actually wrote better games for university courses.\nTo be honest I do not remember purchasing this game from any source. But since it is in my Library, I thought of testing it, well, it's horrible. I am now just waiting for tha trading cards and uninstalling. It seems to be the developers first game, and a self published game for that matter, but come on guys, try some more before publishing.", "recommendationid": "34860439", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505667657, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1506250523, "num_reviews": 53, "steamid": "76561198191526625", "num_games_owned": 598, "playtime_forever": 126}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498737"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
