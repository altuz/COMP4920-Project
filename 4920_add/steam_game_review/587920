This is a pretty cool and fun gme that is a time killing roguelite where you choose a character and try to make it through a level alive avoiding traps and finding survivors.  You can contorl the survivors together with your main as a group, and switch control for lead between them. It could be alittle confusing at first but only for a moment, till you get the gist of it, like attacking effectively between lead and followers. The items are random, same with traps enemies and room layout. I've used the contorller, dunno how the  mouse and kb hold up, but it's pretty smooth with the controller. There is an ultrawide setting, but it cropped out the top/bottom portions of the UI which made it tough assigning items so I had to switch back to 16:9. It's in EA though so to be expected. While it's 5 dollars it's definitely a steal. Still worth it at 10 too imo.", "recommendationid": "35054244", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505774897, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505942903, "num_reviews": 29, "steamid": "76561198014114016", "num_games_owned": 614, "playtime_forever": 35}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509482"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505683668, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Ace artstyle and hilarious comedy horror gameplay.\nThe way it is designed is loads of fun, with lots of replayability from randomly created scenarios.\nHorror film references abound and oozes atmosphere.\n\nA great casual game.\nI would say that the overall gameplay while fun will need far more interaction for the full release, just searching things while exploring and using the weapons on enemies to complete a quest i feel isnt enough, but i realise it is Early Access.", "recommendationid": "35033549", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505693934, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505765945, "num_reviews": 169, "steamid": "76561197983301475", "num_games_owned": 444, "playtime_forever": 181}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503585"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506285986, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Played at EGX 2017 and loved it so I came home and brought the game for myself and really love it, one thing that could be improved is the sensitivity on controllers.", "recommendationid": "35190554", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506285986, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 232, "last_played": 1506613780, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198171298062", "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_forever": 232}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506443669, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great gameplay. Lots of suspense. The different \"missions\" that characters have are great fun.\n\nI can't seem to figure out how to do a few things though... The game really doesn't explain these things well:\nHow do you unlock the locked characters? Why isn't there a check-box or something next to the missions so you know which ones you have done? Why is there no description of what the characters specials are? The specials have names in the inventory menu, but it explains nothing, so you're left with having to try them out to see what they are, and not even then do you always understand what just happened....\n\n\nBut as a composer, the biggest downer from this game for me is that you can't seperate music and SFX. I don't think I've seen a game in recent time which doesn't have this option!", "recommendationid": "35225330", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506443669, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1506101404, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198381286198", "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 216}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1506642197, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I want to say yes. But I can't. I seriously can't.\n\nI played the game at EGX and I loved the concept, but found the execution to be flawed. Paying for it and only having done the Evil Dead 2 content (Ash), all the flaws become ever more excacerbated.\n\nThe options, at best, are good enough. For some reason FXAA is a slider and is constantly off leaving only SSAO. \n\nGameplay is simple - choose a character and objective, go achieve it. Each character has an ability which isn't shown until you're in game and look in the inventory. A neat little encyclopedia for each enemy detailing stats and their abilities would be nice, but I feel that the game shouldn't even go down that route.\n\nPhantom Halls feels like its trying to be an old timer, a classic horror and a modern horror at the same time. Simplistic sidescroller gameplay combined with multiple weapons and a basic 3D design do not combine well.\n\nI would recommend the following:\n1. Ditch the action-adventure component. Reduce ammo drops and eliminate weapons like the SMG. Introduce mechanics that make firearms a less reliable weapon and make melee weapons more fragile to emphasize a more horror-esque system. A simple stealth mechanic similar to a game I can't remember the name of (you have to make time move forward whilst avoiding enemies in a randomly generated house) would encourage the horror aspect.\n\n2. Take it on wholly. More enemies, more guns and ammo, quicker and longer lasting melee weapons. Ability to barricade doors as well as damage them. Healing items and potentially lengthen the gameplay to encourage more gameplay.\n\nFinaly, I have one main concern - long-term enjoyment for the player. There's currently 10 characters with another 3 locked off for a total of 13 characters with between 1 to 3 different objectives for each one. Gameplay lasts for around 10 - 15 minutes, and even at best going for 39 plays, that's only around 505 minutes - 9 hours of repetitive gameplay with no long-term goal. You don't EARN anything but 'congratulations, you won\". \n\nI truly want this to succeed, but I want the developers to know currently their game feels fairly empty right now and they'd ought to fill it with ways to improve gameplay and longevity before worrying about partnerships like Evil Dead 2 unless it benefits them in some way besides spreading the word.", "recommendationid": "35276611", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506642197, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1506642004, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198038499044", "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 13}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495031"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 21, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 16}}
