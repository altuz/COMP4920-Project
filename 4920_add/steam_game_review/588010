You play as Valerie a student that can see other peoples red strings of fate(red cord that's connects people that are destined to meet one another ). The story itself is great and well paced although some of the dialogue could be a little better. The characters are likable and interesting. There is four possible endings.\n\nThe art and music are well done. It fits well with a theme and tone of the game.\nInterface is also good(something you can't say for a lot of free VNs on steam).\n\nAnd at the end its free and small in download size. If I had to score it I would give it 7.5/10.\n\nPs.

Imagine my surprise when I found myself enjoying the game. Luke and Aaron are two very unique and interesting characters, I found myself actually entranced by the story and their personal character arcs. Luke is my favored of the two, but Aaron is not without charm. The premise is also interesting, and pretty unique, which is key to making a good visual novel. \nMy biggest complaint is the length. I found the stories to be sadly short and too few to justify their length. The pacing was also strange at times, but not terrible. I also wish there was a \"rewind\" function so if I acciendentally skipped a piece of text, I could just go back and see what I had missed instead of losing track of the conversation.\nOverall a good game, would definitely recomend, but has room for improvement and leaves little to no replay value.", "recommendationid": "30162214", "language": "english", "developer_response": "Hello! Thanks for playing our game and leaving a comment!\nJust want to quickly address one of your points -- you can indeed rewind in the game if you missed any text accidentally! With mouse, you can scroll up to roll back to previous dialogue, or if you're only using keyboard, it should be Page Up, I believe. There's a limit as to how much you can roll back to, but should be enough if you just missed text by accident if you clicked too fast. Sorry about not clearly stating the shortcut controls before; will definitely do so next time!\nThank you for the critique as well :D We will keep that in mind for our next game.", "timestamp_updated": 1488014943, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488347848, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198226211704", "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_forever": 398}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504782"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1488017684, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Red String of Fate, story wise its one of the more decent visual novels on Steam I would say.
