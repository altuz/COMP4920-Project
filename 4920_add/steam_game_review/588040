The gameplay is using choices to control the fate to the character or characters to lead to several ending.\n\nThe uniqueness of this one is the choice is to switch the sequence of two peoples' talks. And you can easily see their choices of talks will affect the fate of theirs and others from the tree diagram.\n\nSometimes S level choice might not always lead to the best results.\n\nThe story is interesting and the music is quite beautifully done to be in tune with the mood.\n\nI have always been a fan of such type of game. I have seen some examples in Japanese games. This one is Chinese. Well done.\n\nBut, there is always a but, some of the lines might not very much logical. It happens because the line will be switched between different situations. In order to get all the trophies and badges, it could be repetitious to a certain extent.\n\nStill I will recommend it.
