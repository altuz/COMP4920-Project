I wish that Steam had a neutral option on times like this, but since there\u2019s not, my answer is \u201cno\u201d. Also, like it says on the title, this is a kinetic novel meaning that there are no choices and you only read the text.\n\n[b]The story:[/b] Jacob is an ordinary man and lives with his wife, Lisa, in Singapore. Everything is pretty much chill until Jacob finds out he\u2019s really sick and will die in a few months. The stress that the couple goes through (especially Jacob) is intense, which makes Jacob act kinda like an a-s-s to his wife. Of course that his behavior is bad, but well, he\u2019s dying and people tend to lose it. I thought that his behavior was very \u201chuman\u201d, not the \u201ceverything will be alright\u201d kind of clich\u00e9 (at least at first). He\u2019s a guy who worries about the future of his wife, and he already accepted the fact that he won\u2019t be around for too long. I could feel his frustration of wanting to prepare for the worst, and Lisa acting hopeful bothered him. \n\n[b]Lisa:[/b] You know, at first I actually felt sorry for her. [spoiler]But after I found out that she stopped taking birth control pills on purpose and NEVER told Jacob about it\u2026 That was really s*hitty from that woman. Any sympathy I had for this character was instantly GONE when I found out that. I know it was supposed to be a dramatic part of the story, but really, it was just awful.[/spoiler] All she did to make Jacob fell better was flushed down through the toilet because of that crappy act she pulled.\n\nOverall, the story is interesting but I think that its execution wasn\u2019t good. There\u2019s several grammar mistakes (I\u2019m not a native English speaker tho, but they bothered me a little), the narration isn\u2019t that good, and there\u2019s the layout; there are no paragraphs on this novel, it\u2019s just a plain text wall without the proper space. It gets tiring to read, and the text even invades the bottom of the window, surpassing the text box:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=925747652\n\n4/10.
