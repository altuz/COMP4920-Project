So that's something to look forward to.\n\nWhile the core mechanic game works well & plays like a TF2 clone, there's alot of problems for this multiplayer only shooter to be worth your time.\n\nPros\n\nThere's lobby/server browser system\nCan easily self host to play with your local friends\nWell the network code works (Not great athough since I get 300ping from Russian servers)\nGreat artsyle for maps\n\nCons\n\nThe game looks abandoned from day 1 from the scope of things in the forums\nBarely anyone is playing with a few empty servers\n\nPoor jumping mechanic system. The game makes u wait a few seconds so you can double jump and there's many small platforms that makes you vulnerable to getting killed by others since you standing there waiting for the jump ability to recharge.\n\nNo spy abilities?\n\nGun sounds that sounds like they've been directly ripped from TF2/COD/CS\n\nThe heavy machine gun's animations looks & sounds incomplete.\n\nNo proper bots in game, just zombies that follow you.\n\nSome UI elements are left in Russian\n\nThe Steam storefront trailer has Advanced Warfare OST that is mostly likely used without permission \n\nWell from all of my points added up, it looks like a suspect of asset flipping in addition to f2p style rent shop & achievement grinding that makes very little sense since barely anyone is playing this game.\n\nToo bad this game goes into the bin on my PC. Such a wasted potential, this could have been a decent TF2 clone if it wasn't from lack of people playing this game or real bots.\n\nI actually like World War TF2 theme over it. Maybe making BrotherZ > F2P and having a real online community could save this game but for now it's not worth anyone's time.", "recommendationid": "32155497", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1496648799, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496500262, "num_reviews": 40, "steamid": "76561198012080668", "num_games_owned": 1511, "playtime_forever": 47}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520696"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 8, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1496501221, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "the artstyle is good enough i guess, but looks cant drag this game anywhere. the animations/camera feels wierd and wobbly, the guns are feeling wierd, all the zombie AI are in russian, hitboxes are all over the place and the gameplay is just really bad all in all.\nthe game gives a feeling mixed in between team fortress 2, battlefield heroes and left 4 dead, it just doesnt make a good mix.\nthere is noone else playing the game so all the servers are empty. this game could have been something good if it actually had experienced developers and a developer team.\n", "recommendationid": "32154187", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1496501221, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496500734, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198262804081", "num_games_owned": 83, "playtime_forever": 27}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515018"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1496550445, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game died on day one of realese every server is empty, do yourself a favor save the five dollars and play Team Fortress 2, Red Orchestra 2, or Day of Defeat(source or regular) those are good games that are not dead.
