I decided to buy this game since is cheap, costing  50 cents. and my first impressions of the trailer was good, seems fun. \n\nThen what I found of this game good, is being simple and good game mechanics. but the bads overtake the goods and makes this game not recommendable.\n\nThe first thing I like to adress is the fact that the game don't save the progress. there's no \"Continue\" button on menu, just select any of the 3 maps and that's it.\n\nThis makes the game bad because, I would like to continue when I got that expensive item. or I killed that kind of monster. Or worst case for some reason you obtain that item you always wanted and then the game close, crash or you computer shutdown. \n\nAND GUESS WHAT? YOU NEED TO START ALL OVER AGAIN.\n\nThat's why is bad. the fun part that the trailer promise to you is over 2 hours of grinding the game and I dont have time to wait that. so Steam refunds to the rescue.\n\n\nOVERALL. Not recommended 4/10. too much grinding and starting from the beginning with no possible replability of the game. \n\nDont but this game if more than 1$.", "recommendationid": "32658098", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498177955, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498177251, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198316721308", "num_games_owned": 56, "playtime_forever": 64}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523770"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492184159, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I just wish that there was an option to save after each round.
