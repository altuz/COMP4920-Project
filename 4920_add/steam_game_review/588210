Imho the projectis in alpha stage, maybe graphics is beta (it looks really great).\n\nIf you are brave enough, or want to support devs, go for it. Personally I don't regret buying this title.

But sooner or later you can get used to this.\nVessel Control.\nImagine Freelancer space ship controls and now add all pain from KSP orbital navigation, here is Hellion's vessel control.\nShip reacts with huge delay, you don't understand speed, you dont feel speed (usualy in games use some particles around to not disorient gamer), your speedoment is a tiny line wich doesnt' give enought info. RSC overpowered and not let you to do acurate manevours.\nI spoke about KSP so there is no Inertia dampers too. Well interface shows your side direction (up, down, lef, right) but you need to damp them by your self with is a chalenge since we dont have ED in game and you spend most time to align your ship as you want. Yes games has function \"speed synchronization with target\" but is glichy and work from time to time.\nLast but not least\nCameras.\nOnly first person - only hardcore. Wich would be good, if we didnt use Newton's physics that much, and be more ackade.\nBut in game it is pain, and most part of this it is a docking. I spend almost one hour trying to dock ship to station and i failed. Not because i cant see where im docking (i know how to use docking camera), but mostly i cant feel the controls of ship, delays between stop and acceleration is to huge, rcs overpowered and ship just cant align as you want.\nAnd all this might be good as a game if we are not talking about MMO type game. 1,5 hours just to make basic docking procedure, it could be good in ksp or any other Newton's based single player space simulators, but i don't think that fighting wit controls in the begining will attract players for online adventure.\nBut again visual is great! and i realye loved to press all this buttons and panels!", "recommendationid": "35234032", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506479316, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1395, "last_played": 1506970710, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561197987509362", "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 1395}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498431"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1505861242, "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is great if you already have a passing familiarity with newtonian physics, or games that utilize this like Kerbal Space Program, Microsoft Space, etc. It can be maddening at first but ultimately pays off. \n\nRight now the game is most certainly not worth its price tag.
