It is a lot of fun and it feels pretty real (I have played net a few times though I'm typically a forward).\n\nI'm assuming this is a WIP but with that said, I do have a few gripes that I hope get fixed:\n1. The pucks don't despawn, so even after you made the save, if you accidently hit a dead puck into the net, it counts against you\n\n2. The goalie stick clips through the ground so it makes it pretty hard to lay your stick flat on the ice in order to make a low sick save.\n\n3. Personally I think there should be some sort of torso that way they cant get you between the glove and blocker. It feels pretty unnatural to reach across with the glove to make a save\n\n4. The puck just clips through the glove and stick once you make a save. It makes it really hard to clear the crease and to have one of the great \"ring ten bells for that save\" moment\n\nThese are minor things, but I think fixing this will make the game better\n\nAlso, I think there are some features that should be added:\n\n1. It would be cool so see a \"heatmap\" of where you let in most goals (ie: if you look at the net after a game, it will show red for where you let in the most goals and like a yellow or green for where you protected the net the best)\n\n2. Shootout mode: It would be pretty cool if the skaters would start at center ice and you'd have a true 1v1 experience instead of just a shooting gallery.\n\n3. Skater mode: I don't know how well it would work, but I would love for there to be a way where you get to shoot against a goalie. Locomotion would be difficult so my idea is that you would see like an ice rink whiteboard where you could draw the path that you would skate. Then you confirm it, and that is the path that you follow. (It may make people sick but I would be willing to test that). This would allow for online matches where you get to test your skills against a real person\n\nOverall a good game, especially because it is free, but I would defnitely spend $30 dollars on the game if it had the fixes and features meantioned above!\n\n(The new minor fixes that came out really help the game out. The visible torso is fantastic and the despawning pucks prevent any accidental late goals. Puck handling seemed a bit better as well, I was able to clear the crease pretty effectively athough it isn't very necessary anymore, thanks for the update!)", "recommendationid": "29704554", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486428523, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491619770, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198055413897", "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_forever": 337}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525392"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1486270326, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Had a chance to download and play a few rounds of this game tonight.

So some easy handles just go straight in the net if not careful.\nPuck will clip through the glove if moved to fast. Same with goalie stick.\nNo center mass, so you're goalie might as well have the name Swiss Cheese on their Jersey ;P\n\nFun ideas:\nEndless mode - Infinite Lives and just shot after shot\nAdd an Offensive Sakter to screen goalie - Makes the goalie adjust to see puck *more realistic*\nCustomize glove, blocker and goalie stick\n\n9/10 ~ Love it so far.
