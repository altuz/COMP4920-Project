If the sword fighting were more sophisticated, it would be worth that if not more.  However, the sword play is basic.  I didn't see much of an advantage to properly block and then swing.  It seemed it was always advantageous to swing wildly about.   \n\nObviously, kills are easier with stealth.  But with teleportation being the main mechanism to move and no crouching behind objects or walking silently, is it really stealth?  It's more like ganking.  Find a dark spot.  Wait until they turn their back, then teleport behind them to gank.  And there's only 1 VR environment area.\n\nThis is a $2.49 game at most in its current state.  I cannot recommend this game until better sword play is added or more content.  More weapons, more enemies, shielded enemies, traps. etc.  More than 1 enviroment as well.  \n\nRate 4/10 needs updated content to be worthy", "recommendationid": "35038998", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505710200, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505707695, "num_reviews": 210, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 20}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 10, "total_reviews": 25, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 15}}
