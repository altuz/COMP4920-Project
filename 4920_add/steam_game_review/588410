After upgrading my PC, I was excited to finally play more than the table tennis practice area as everything else was too laggy to play.\n\nWith the purchase of a GTX 1070, the table tennis league mode was able to be played smoothly, but tennis is still too laggy that you can't hit the ball accurately: play the game. I don't know if the game is optimised well or not, but other games with better graphics could run smoothly before my PC upgrade. It's quite a shame because I was really looking foward to the other 50% of content this game has to offer.\n\nNote: Performance (prior to my upgrade) was better through Steam (purchased) than the Vive applcation (Viveport Subscription).", "recommendationid": "33622486", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1500352725, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "last_played": 1506149397, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198014725323", "num_games_owned": 236, "playtime_forever": 151}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 18, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 13}}
