The visuals are the same, but the developer has gone in a different direction with the gameplay. I was tentative, since I enjoyed the original so much and was...let down, to say the least, by Arcade, but watching just a few minutes of gameplay sold me on it.\n\nThe game is very open for taking unique routes and shourtcuts, many of which the devs have done by intention. Mixing the levels rather than having you jump from one theme to another is nice for keeping up the variety, though I wish they hadn't put all the Marsh levels right beside one another, since they were the weakest part of the game I thought.\n\nThe music is not as upbeat as Lovely Planet which wasn't something I really minded, though I was a lot more fond of the original soundtrack from the original compared to it. If you were not a fan of it in the first one, this will definitely be a positive change for you.\n\nThe difficulty didn't really scale, it just bounced around. It worked nicely where you would get a level to breathe after a hard one, with none too difficult where it was irritating.\n\nThe leaderboard did not make a return this game, but I'm of the mind that, if they're going to be implemented in a way where fake times are just going to be left on forever, I'd rather they not be there altogether.\n\nOverall, fairly short game, with a decent bit a replayability to find collectibles and optimize times. A step up from Arcade, but doesn't dethrone the original. Worth a play if you watch a bit of the gameplay and it seems like your type of game.", "recommendationid": "33886343", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501350843, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501508963, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198051078858", "num_games_owned": 258, "playtime_forever": 556}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515845"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1501288246, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A fast-paced platformer that's really fun to speedrun.", "recommendationid": "33869011", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501288246, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502035507, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198043409387", "num_games_owned": 448, "playtime_forever": 131}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508860"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1502177086, "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Super Lovely Planet is not a good game.\n\nIt sucks to have to say that, considering the original Lovely Planet is one of my favorite games ever, but I just did not find much to enjoy here. It's just... a mess of a game that never really figures out what it wants to be and doesn't feel nearly as polished as the previous two lovely planet games.\n\nThe biggest issue is that everything just feels slightly off. Some enemies shoot bullets slightly too fast or accurately. Enemies can still shoot from a range that feels just a bit too large. The controls feel just a bit too stiff. The levels feel just a bit too long.\n\nThe levels. These levels are... really sloppy in design, especially compared to the tightness of the previous games. There's no sense of flow, there's moments of waiting around pointlessly, a lot of obstacles feel less like a string of events to be performed in sequence and more discordant, arbitrary things going on that clash with each other and create a confusing mess. Mostly it often feels like there's no structure or organization to the levels and that playing the same way every time doesn't necessarily yield the same results like it would in the previous games.\n\nAnd the end result is that the game sucks as a casual game, really. Maybe not if you're just trying to clear levels or get A ranks, but getting S ranks is an exercise in frustrating and especially an exercise in luck, because damned if you can get anything in the game to behave consistently.\n\nI also think the autojump was a mistake here, in the original lovely planet there was a ton of time between your jumps - here, fractions of a second, meaning it's super easy to accidentally jump one time too many, or bounce forward off an enemy without meaning to. And it feels really twitchy but in a way that just doesn't work. Like you're punished severely for holding down a button two milliseconds longer than you should. And having health is pointless when every other hit is just going to lead to you getting comboed to death or knocked off the edge of a level.\n\nIt feels like it has a lot of the opposite problems of Arcade - that game was super, super tightly designed to the point where it was more of a puzzle game than an action game, and it kind of sucked as a speedrun game as a result, but casually it was still fairly fun and enjoyable. This game sucks casually but as a speedrun game there is a lot more potential there, mostly for how broken a lot of the game is and how easy it is to skip straight to the end of most levels. There's a gimmick in some stages where you can enter first person mode and look at a blue stick enemy and you'll teleport to him if you look long enough, but you can just look at him through walls and teleport from anywhere in the level, doesn't need to be a line of sight. And I've already personally seen some wacky physics glitches just in the time I've played the game, that can be exploited in ways the developer obviously never intended.\n\nI don't know if that's to be lauded though - you could do unintented things in the original lovely planet, sure, but aside from the civ bug none of it was really that broken or bending the rules of the game in any way. You could jump places the game didn't expect you to be, but it wasn't a glitch that let you do it, and obviously there was some degree of intention for player freedom in the design of a lot of those levels. Here the player is given almost too much freedom at the expense of a game that functions like it should, and at the expense of a game that's enjoyable to play in a setting other than glitchy speedrunning.\n\nAnd I can't really recommend it, when you can do so much better. It's especially disappointing coming from the developer who I know is capable of much, much better - I've seen it.", "recommendationid": "34097669", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502177086, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502351385, "num_reviews": 417, "steamid": "76561198076721797", "num_games_owned": 670, "playtime_forever": 781}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499130"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
