Kind of a bite off HordeZ. But I am going to say this is a buy to play once or twice or if you just want to blow off steam and kill some Zombies. This is good for showing off to those new to VR, those who easily scare and at parties. For $.99 you really can't complain a whole lot. The graphics look good, the attacks work, there were no bugs that I noticed, and instead of using guns you use magic attacks,i.e., the \"High Templar\" name. There are temporary items like a shield and hammer that can be used upon recharging. The rail play may still make some over sensitive to sickness a little queezy but it should be tolerable. The game play is slow. There is a video below to show the first and only level. If the developer can add more interesting levels and bosses than this could be a nice rail shooter like HordeZ. My rating for what is there is a 5/10. \n\nVideo here and in 4k after processing. Enjoy.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1138262732", "recommendationid": "35049444", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505755147, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505742847, "num_reviews": 221, "steamid": "76561197974765747", "num_games_owned": 477, "playtime_forever": 24}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480387"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
