I'll be changing and updating my review as Development continues. \n\nIn one hour of play time, I've unlocked 16/17 achievments and beat every city. I knew they are going to add more. But I can't help but feel this game is lacking in the customization department. I want to be able to choose my weapons, customize my robot to my liking. \n\nIt's fun, but not $15 for an hour fun. Early Access or not. \n\n*Ideas*\n-Local Co-op\n-Multiplayer Co-op\n-Better Building PHysics\n-Customizable weapons + Ammo limits\n-Customizable Robo arms. \n-A \"Fake\" body and legs that  move according to wher you walk. \n-Robot boxing. \n-Kill the Kaiju mode. MP vs?\n-Minigames built into the buildings themselves. (Toss the robot between two sky crapers for a field goal, ect)\n-\"Optic Beam\" style weapon. \nCrafting?\n-two player vs mode with \"base building.\"", "recommendationid": "34002445", "language": "english", "developer_response": "Hi, Blackfire1!\n\nThank you for such an extensive review.\n\nMany of your ideas are already in development or under consideration.\nFor example, you are talking about a big city \u2013 it\u2019s already in the game, it\u2019s New York, which is 4 times bigger than other cities. The first cities are an introductory part, in future, the cities will be bigger.\n\nAs for physics - this feature can be implemented; game\u2019s engine allows to make very realistic physics. But we\u2019re focusing on the performance so that players don\u2019t experience any discomfort. If to make very realistic physics, lots of devices will experience performance problems in the game.\nCustomization and ammo limitation \u2013 these are great ideas, and they\u2019re already in our plans. \n \nI agree about fake body as well, when playing you really want to involve not only hangs (for example, to kick harder some car ), but other VR projects have proved that it\u2019s really difficult to get involved the whole body. People are different by bodily constitution, so there will definitely be some discomfort when playing, for example, if you make a step of a certain width and your robot makes a step of a different width.\n\nOther of your suggestion will be considered as well, and perhaps even implemented in the further development of the project.\n\nPlease, don\u2019t forget that the project is in its early access, so the content is not final, and perhaps it might even seem to be too modest. \n\nThank you for evaluating our project! And if you have any other suggestions, questions, comments \u2013 please, feel free to contact us.", "timestamp_updated": 1502127119, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501631975, "num_reviews": 41, "steamid": "76561197962954977", "num_games_owned": 280, "playtime_forever": 70}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499588"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_positive": 5}}
