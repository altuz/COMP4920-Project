Simply beautiful.

Although not exactly. You basically progress each run, as there are items, blueprints and upgrades you unlock that can assist you in future runs, this makes the game extremely fun, because even when you lose in a run, you don't exactly lose it all, you progress.\n[b]+[/b] The choices you make in runs are of utmost importance.
