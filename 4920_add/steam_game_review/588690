In this game you play as a reaper who is new to the job. You judge whether people should go to heaven or hell (and later purgatory) based on their features. Are they clean? To heaven! Puddle of blood, horn, glowing red eyes? TO HELL! Progression is clear and the difficulty curve is very reasonable. The game takes place over the course of several weeks, and each work day a new feature is added, thereby increasing the difficulty. This part of the game was well explained. However, I did experience some confusion when I encountered the four horsemen and fate. If they were tutorialized at all, I missed it completely. From what I've been able to gather, there are four horsemen, though you only work for one: Death. He and the other horsemen, famine, war, and pestilence, will sometimes have offers for you where you can gain and lose favor with each of them. Until the very end of the game, I thought I had to keep all of their influence as balanced as possible. At the end however, I found out that your score is (partially) calculated by taking your favor score with Death, and subtracting your influence with the other horsemen. I feel that this could have been explained at the start of the game. Also, in my opinion these special deals should only appear after a few days so that a new player isn't confused by them.\nRegarding Fate: To this day I have absolutely no idea what the character Fate does. He showed up once. I picked one of the cards he presented to me, then he left never to appear again. Once again, a little explanation would be appreciated here.\n\nOverall I think this game is great, and I had a lot of fun playing it.\nI would give this game a 7.5 / 10", "recommendationid": "33441731", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499723734, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501258593, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198076486813", "num_games_owned": 167, "playtime_forever": 441}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1501225329, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is super fun and has a good learning curve.

Although it is somewhat difficult to get a grasp of it from the preview media of the game, it is about players clicking to send beings to Heaven, Hell and Purgatory. Players have a list of things that dictate who goes where, and various exceptions which change where they go based on certain factors. The game is centred on the player quickly inspecting each being and then making a decision about where they go, it all being about how consistent the player can be with keeping up the standard of accuracy without making too many mistakes.\n\nThe animations, artwork and music are all nice. There is a new rule added to the game every single level, and even minigames that occur during the levels. There even numerous different models for beings themselves.\n\nAt times, certain clothing articles and objects the player has to keep out for are somewhat vague. It is only vary specific models of certain sunglasses that look somewhat like eyes, or medieval alchohol bottles that don't blatantly look like alchohol bottles at first. Which causes some mistakes to be made, but over the course of the entire game this only happened maybe three times so it's not a persistent issue. The game also doesn't tell the player certain things which they really should know, like what the influence system for the Four Horsemen is even meant to be for. The grammar for the game in English seems to be, strange, but completely readable all the same.\n\nThe only places the game really has problems is in its at times cruel and offencive sense of humor, referencing blatantly popular Youtube Let's Players who are already extremely well known so seeing them idolized in games is just obnoxious and unprofessional at this point; and the lack of an outro cutscene was pretty disappointing since the game had an introductory one.\n\nAlthough the game has some really neat looking character models, and Reaper is one of the most adorable things ever.\n\n\n\nThe game itself is well worth the price for a couple hours of initial playing, although players that are more interested in this kind of gauntlet-of-not-making-mistakes challenge will likely get more out of it then some others.", "recommendationid": "33727510", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1500750088, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500768142, "num_reviews": 62, "steamid": "76561198171033130", "num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_forever": 220}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501332"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1499390452, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Alot of fun", "recommendationid": "33329465", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499390452, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499303607, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198202204256", "num_games_owned": 179, "playtime_forever": 106}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501053"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1500076718, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "'Peace, Death!' takes inspiration from Lukas Pope's excellent 'Papers, Please' but with a more cartoonish humor and much faster pace.

If 'Peace, Death!' were sold only for touch-based devices such as smartphones and tablets, this would be a plus. However, having to move the mouse frantically from the soul being inspected over to the psycho papers interferes with the otherwise fast and smooth pace of the game. Also, the other functions - Send to Heaven, Send to Hell, Send to Purgatory - have configurable keyboard mappings. Why isn't there at least a hotkey to display the psycho pages?
