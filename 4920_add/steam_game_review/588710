This is due to it being a not yet fully finished story, the game ends after one final decision that has two endings. You are either choosing to die, or to move the story onward which isn't yet part of the game. You get a To Be Continued ending.\n\nSo at this time, I wouldn't recommend it if you expect a complete CYOA adventure. Because it isn't a complete CYOA adventure, yet.\n\nThe translation is spotty at best, with some small mistakes here and there, *including a complete sentence in russian out of the blue which I don't think is supposed to be there.*\nSome words were either missing or perhaps the author missed them during the translation. The text and dialouge is translated to english from what I belive is russian and it shows when you read it.\n\nThe artstyle and what I would like to describe as assets aren't horrible to look at but it doesn't show life. I saw people set out in a 'scene' (for example a ship) with dialouge being the only thing that moved for most of the time. No gesture changes or changes to the character's stance did I see as I read through one scene where the characters could have been animated much better. Moved or made to show that they expressed what they said. Not being statues for so much of the time.\n\nI honestly would like to see more, but at this stage, with such little story it has I don't think it is worth buying. Unless they add more of the story which is what the game is about. Wait some time on this one!\n\nPlease note!\nAccording to the developer the next part is being worked on and will be released to the game as free DLC!\n*The untranslated text has been fixed by the developer!", "recommendationid": "31489970", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493727481, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498794266, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198012143497", "num_games_owned": 158, "playtime_forever": 117}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536164"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1496348373, "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I really liked this game, I did a review  here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRgSS2Tc3Oo", "recommendationid": "32114741", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1496348373, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496115059, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198235311456", "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 57}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489745"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
