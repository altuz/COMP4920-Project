These wishes range from getting Lariat to wash the dishes, to saving your career, to even become a princess! If they fail something bad would happen...or not in the case of one character.\n\nThis is a trivia game with narrative elements that add a little spice to the gameplay and the questions range primarily to contemporary audiovisual media that many people are mostly familiar with nowadays. The art style is quirky and adorable, and the outcomes of passing/failing the trivia rounds either heartwarming or hilarious. There's a trivia-only mode for people who like to answer questions, and the plots of some of the characters can branch greatly, as in the case of the first character (Ava).\n\nI recommend it, it's a good game for its type.", "recommendationid": "35252330", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506561029, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 127, "last_played": 1507200174, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198066081749", "num_games_owned": 29, "playtime_forever": 127}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500312"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505510293, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A fun little quiz game with great questions and a lot of funny stories to go along with it.
