Even with the right skill points allocation, right strategy, you will not win if you don't have a minimum of luck, which can be seriously frustrating at times.\n\nThe biggest changes I would like to see in the future are probably:\n_ Possibility to respec the skill points.\n_ Reducing the impact of luck in the battle, which currently makes things go very random, and that's just not fun.

It is not a bad game per se, but has some flaws which sucked the enjoyment out of it for me personally. \n\nMy biggest concern is that while the game seems to offer different choices when it comes to allocating your skillpoints, only one approach is feasible (i.e. investing points into your minions). Even the developer himself admits that successfully finishing the first area can already be a challenge if one skilled \"wrong\": \"unforturnaly, it will be a realy hard to defeat Master without creatures of level 5\". If you skilled \"wrong\" you are stuck with grinding exp to make up for that mistake, making the game very repetitive because you'll end up losing most fights and always have to fight a copy of yourself then, too. On the one hand this allows for quicker collection of EXP, on the other hand it becomes boring pretty fast. Moreover, the effect of chance (or RNG) seems just to powerful - even if you do great for 80% of the fight, lucky rolls from your opponent can turn the tides of battle extremely quickly. Due to these points, the combat, which is the focus of the game, is just not fun if you took the \"wrong\" approach to skilling. \n\nThe graphics are also a bit dull (they look quite nice in the preview on Steam, but scaled up they lose fidelity), which is unfortunate because the hand-drawn sequences are very nice. \n\nI cannot say much about the story because I was unable to progess very far due to the aforementioned imbalance, and the game was just not fun enough for me to start over or attempt to grind more EXP. What little I saw of it was nothing of out the ordinary, but the story is certainly not meant to be the focus of this game anyway.\n\nIt is also unfortunate that the information provided in the game is a bit lackluster, because the developer wrote a guide for Heroes of Arca which provides some information which could avoid frustrations such as mine if one read it before starting the game.\n\nBecause having a fun beginning is important for long-time motivation in a game and the factor of RNG seems to dominant for a tactical game I do not recommend the game in its current state.\n\nTL;DR: Game is okay if you know that you should spent all your points into your minions on the first island and don't mind losing battles due to unlucky RNG; otherwise it can be frustrating.", "recommendationid": "34011085", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501835452, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501446307, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198062595761", "num_games_owned": 640, "playtime_forever": 463}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502805"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 9, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_positive": 7}}
