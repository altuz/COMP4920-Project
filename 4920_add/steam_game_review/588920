I'll need to update this review as I make my way through a second time.\n\nNot for children or the easily offended, but a very interesting take on the 2D Turn-Based RPG's.\nI guess this is done in RPG MAKER, but it's one of the more well put together ones as far as the use of the mechanics, the assets and the layout of the game; at least in my opinion it is. \n(So take it with a grain of salt, but hopefully I can point out a few reasons of why I enjoyed it and why you might enjoy it.)\n\n- The story is tough, because I could easily see some traditional RPG fans being appauled by the nature of the game and some of the themes used. It's not to be taken too serious, but understand what you're getting here first and then decide if that's your sense of humor or not.\n- There are a couple of bright spots to the story and it becomes slightly more interesting later on in the game, but expect appauling masogonistic content throughout.\n\n- It's mostly casual in difficulty for anyone who has played enough RPG's.\n-I love the idea of non respawning enemies in the dungeons.(As long as you don't leave the dungeon.)\nSome key paths in the dungeons will be blocked off by respawning enemies, but without them you wouldn't be able grind and it would be too easy, plus this is an RPG after all.\n- There's a bit of puzzle solving in a way. The sewers are a bit tough, but looking back on it I wish I hadn't looked for help in the discussions, because now I'm upset the game is over.\n-You can save the game wherever you would like.\n-Each character in your party has a wide array of special skills and magic and each character compliments one another nicely.\n- Enemies are varied just enough in each area. \n- Party members can attack multiple times in a turn.\n- There is a nice variety of weapons and armors and potions.\n- Each area/dungeon you find an item to use in that area that will help you progress.(In one area you find the ability to jump over one space of water and progress to area's you couldn't before or in another area you find a shrub cutter to reach blocked off area's, chests, etc.)\n\n- There's controller support and the sound seems fine too.\n- If you hit F1 you can open up a toggle menu for the game and go fullscreen or edit controls.\n- The achievements themselves may give you a few laughs as well.\n- There are Cards and Badges and Emoticons and Backgrounds.", "recommendationid": "34474665", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1503642162, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503755859, "num_reviews": 24, "steamid": "76561198145298170", "num_games_owned": 1106, "playtime_forever": 776}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504791"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 10, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 4}}
