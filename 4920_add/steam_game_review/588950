This is a good game. A really good game.\n\nPart of the charm is that, like Windows 95, you're basically fighting against the interface as much as you are fighting against your enemies. It'll get cluttered, but that's a good thing. It allows you to easily monitor your stats, equipment, access healing items like potions and keep a log of everything that's happened in a run. Combat is pretty rewarding as well. Since you're fighting against the UI as much as you are enemies, keeping up with the battle and switching between attacking, blocking and healing at regular intervals without dying or losing track of your enemy's attack progress bar in the process feels like a huge accomplishment in of itself. As you gain levels, complete quests (which are given to you via email, by the way; there's even ones that mimic spam emails from 20 years ago!) and boost your stats and reputation as you progress through the game, it truly feels like you're growing from a newbie adventurer into a skilled knight or mage, ready to storm the king's castle.\n\nWhile the UI can be frustrating if you're a first-time player, the familiarity of an operating system also lets you adapt to Kingsway faster than most other games in this genre. It definitely is an interesting choice, but also probably the best, because by your 4th or 5th run you'll be familiar with how the game works, its quirks and how to make your way through the world.\n\nOh, and yes, this game can run on a toaster. A computer from 10 years ago, but if you want a computer from 20 years ago that can run it, look at the real Windows 95. Really, if you're still using a Pentium MMX for some reason, get a new computer. Unless you're a retro computing enthusiast like me, you have no excuse.\n\nOverall, I give it a Yes. If you're looking for a fresh take on the roguelike genre without spending too much and with a ton of charm to it, give Kingsway a go. It is the #1 operating system for daily tasks like skeleton smashing and loot organizing, after all, and unlike Windows, it doesn't cost $200 for a license!", "recommendationid": "34943571", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505379150, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505876239, "num_reviews": 37, "steamid": "76561198011796570", "num_games_owned": 260, "playtime_forever": 287}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504573"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505901631, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Worth the 10 bucks and I'm going to try explaining why through a bad review\n\n1) First of all, the aesthetic for anyone that likes the look of old PC-98(?) or ancient MAC-OS, as the game is a tiny mix of both. I'm stuck on windows 10 because of my specs so that's definitely refreshing.\n\n2) Probably not for everyone, but I got attached to the music after a while. The soundtrack is definitely gonna loop a few times during a full playthrough as that's probably gonna be around 3 hours and the playlist is about 30 minutes long or so. not a musical expert (read: a fuckin idiot) so I don't have much to say about it besides \"it's neat.\".\n\n3) The pacing of the game. After a few minutes you'll already get what you're going to do in battles for the rest of the game without it becoming too grating, as the different characters and the pop-up attacks from various enemies keep you on your toes. \nLest you wear the ring of pain, the shadow moves slowly enough for you to grind peacefully on the left-mid side of the map until you're actually ready to move towards the end of the game. Even then, the shadow isn't like in One Way Heroics. It just changes the enemy type from being biome-specific enemies to an ambiguous \"shadow\" that can be fought and still gives XP, but no items.\n\nComplaints:\nIf anything, I feel like the quests are lacking. I've seen the game streamed firsthand and I thought the game was going to be absolutely massive and a playthrough would take ages, but despite the map being randomized every playthrough, the quests you get are generally pretty static. There isn't exactly a ton of enemies either, you'll just encounter the Cultists in the mountains, the Clot in the catacombs, stronger variants of previously fought enemies as you go to the right side of the map (with a few original enemies here and there like the goatmen).\nAlso, a more detailed stats menu showing some of the more auxilary stats (like the magic power boost you get from Warded enchanted items) would be nice.\n\nOverall, trying to get the 5 different endings with a different character each time is how I recommend playing, as you'll probably get the most of your money's worth that way.\n(protip: do your first run with the beastman and invest into iron stomach)", "recommendationid": "35080975", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505901631, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 697, "last_played": 1507077359, "num_reviews": 64, "steamid": "76561198050191338", "num_games_owned": 202, "playtime_forever": 2139}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506393918, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Pros:\n\n- Extremelly original and fun design;\n- Good variety of skills/items;\n- Fun to play, absolutely;\n- 5 different endings.\n\nCons:\n\n- Gets repetitive after some iterations;\n- Some enemies are basically copy+pasted;\n- Achievements could be better.\n\nRating: 90/100 - Awesome game!

For those who do not know, Kingsway is an rogue-lite RPG with the UI of an old windows OS. It's neat. I would like to get this out of the way, I don't get the negative reviews with them expecting more out of the game because of the trailer. All the trailer states is customizable UI and nothing else. I can say the Trailer is a bit vague, but because of the vagueness of it, people projected what the game will be like and overhyped it for themselves. This, of course, disappointed those people. I guess I will start with the pros:\n\nPros:\n\nCool Aesthetic\n\nCombat is fun for the most part (Little windows pop up and the enemies move around the screen and you have to defend and attack at the right moments, use spells/abilities, or choose to escape)\n\nUnlockables that make starting the game again easier\n\nGreat Soundtrack\n\nUnlike some other people, I actually enjoy the different classes.\n\nVaried enemies as the game progress. Some are pretty interesting, like the Phantom (Who can close your UI windows) or Shadow Bandit (Minimizes his battle window so you have to manually click it open)\n\nVery few bugs\n\n\nNeutral:\n\nIt's fun to get a broken combo of legendary items that give skills that your class usually doesn't get and you are able to cheese your way through some bosses. This is could be seen in two areas.\n\nCons:\n\nCan get repetitive, however, it depends on the type of person, since I had fun for all the hours I played. The game lacks a lot of events, so events start to repeat. It takes about 2 or 3 playthroughs to see all the events in the game. Events range from quests, dungeon events, and overworld events that give items or buffs.\n\nSome enemies are purely attack and defend, which works for some and not for others. E.G. The sea serpents and goatmen.\n\nIn some ways the game is a bit too easy, I usually am able to complete an ending on my first or second try with any class. Once you get past level 10, and you aren't stupid, it pretty much guaranteed that the run is going to be successful. The only class I had to repeat 3 times was the beastkin was because a bug stopped me from getting the \"Complete the game as a beastkin\" so that was annoying, ending 5 \"Sacrifice\" is the bugged ending.\n\n\nOverall: I think it is a solid game and worth a buy. For achievement hunters, it's quite good and for someone who looks for a casual rogue-lite experience, it's also great. If I would give this game a number rating, I would give it either a 8/10 or 9/10. \n", "recommendationid": "35134132", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506103557, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505762757, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198050285365", "num_games_owned": 327, "playtime_forever": 1126}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506398007, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "What a fun and novel game!

The combat system is really interesting and creative. It's difficult to put in words, but there is something charming and fun about receiving emails from your guild with quests or having to open a minimized window to avoid the sneak attack from an assassin.\n\nThere will be a window for your world map, one for your inventory, one for your stats and so on... And then, to beyond your character, monsters will attack you with infection-like pop-up windows and loot will be collected from your enemies folders. The amount of windows opened may also have effect on gameplay: some monsters may open hidden windows behind all of them, with bombs and curses that you have to close before they damage you... But closing all windows is also risky, since some monsters will deal more damage after all windows are closed. In fact, some monsters attack by closing windows you have opened.\n\nThe game could really benefit from a little more variety, but for it's price and considering it's not something you are supposed to play for 100h or more, this is not a huge concern, and certainly not reason to dislike the game.

Beat it on the second try, not going to play again, even though there are other endings to get.\n\nI think what bothered me the most was the combat system. You pick your attack by clicking a button, then a little bar fills, and when it's full you attack. The enemy does the same (minus the button), and of course keeps attacking no matter if you act or not. You have to pick your attack quickly so you don't waste time, and while you are doing that the button actually moves around. I got used to that quickly, so after a while the moving wasn't challenging anymore, just annoying. Also occasionally enemies do special attacks that you can dodge by clicking some other suddenly appearing moving buttons. What it boils down to is that I had to put actual effort into controlling my character. The very opposite of tight controls. Getting your character to do what you want is part of the challenge, and constantly drains your awareness. I like turn based games, and I like action games, but in this weird mix the two components only took away from each other.\n\nOther than that I was mostly annoyed by having to use purely mouse controls for everything (you can actually unlock hotkeys later on, great...). And a bunch of things just felt clunky. For example the inventory. I spent a lot of time dragging little item icons from one window to another, either to loot them or to organize the items. It really does feel like organizing files on an old OS, and you have to do it purely with your mouse. And after every fight you have to click loot, take the loot, then click that you want to continue. It drags on a bit after a while.\n\nThe difficulty curve is as you would expect from a casual game with permadeath. If you survive the early game, there is very little risk of dying if you play a beefy character. I was pretty bored by the end.\n\nThere are much better roguelikes available that are just as easy to get into and are more fun. Some of them are even free.
