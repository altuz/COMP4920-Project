If you are familiar with this genre I strongly recommend playing on hard mode. I haven't enjoyed a FE this much since FE10. The whole game is very tightly designed and does not pull ANY punches, you will need to use all of your resources carefully and more often than not beating a map was such a close call that waiting one more turn would have meant losing or a character getting killed.\n\n+Most maps allow you to draft your whole army, making every unit important, even your measly thief\n+No permadeath, instead, a unit dying means they will be unable to fight on the next level. This is a great middle ground as losing a unit does not mean \"instant reset\" but instead a decision like \"can I afford not using this guy and not giving him any EXP for one map\"\n+Renewable weapons. Every unit's basic weapon's durability is restored to full at the beginning of each map, but not the rarer, more powerful weapons. Interesting addition that prevents the bronze or iron weapons from becoming the most valuable item like in Fire Emblem.\n+The trap gimmick makes your lord character unique in a way different from being overpowered in combat (in which he instead is thief-tier in this game), and encourages observing and exploiting the AI in creative ways\n+No unit is invincible. There is no Sety or Haar to carry you here. Every unit has clear weaknesses, and enemy diversity means that your units NEED to work together to cover them. Dodge-tanking everything is also impossible in this game, as the AVD stat always stays at reasonable levels : both yours and the enemy's precision is often in the 90s, and rarely lower than the 80s.\n+Good level design with varied objectives. I don't think I ever had to create so many walls and control so many choke points, as well as baiting invincible enemies. If you were afraid of the Black Knight in FE9, you're in for a treat in this game.\n+Characters and dialogue are adorable\n\n-As a result of the first positive, the playable cast is smaller than your typical Fire Emblem\n-No class change or branching promotions\n-Support bonuses are often useless (luck on healers, mag on fighters, offensive stats on dancers...) and the viable pairings become very few if you want them to be good in combat\n-The soundtrack is hit or miss, I loved most of it, but a couple tracks are kind of annoying to listen to, especially since maps can be hours-long\n-The final chapter is amazing, but the extra chapter is somewhat disappointing (where's my \"VS Desunoya\"?!)\n\nOverall a very fun game with a lot of charm, in which you can try your best at all times without being afraid of it becoming too easy or plowing through everything.", "recommendationid": "32267122", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1496929215, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497698934, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198076849921", "num_games_owned": 258, "playtime_forever": 2255}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554487"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 11, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492154382, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "While not a top-quality game by any means, this is still a decent followup to the legendary Fire Emblem series.\n\nYou can tell this game is build for FE veterans, but Fire Emblem isn't particularly complicated to begin with so newcomers should have no problem learning this. There are some minor chages here and there to fit what changes the devs wanted to the tried-and-true formula, including the stroke of genius of having basic-tier weapons repair themselves after each level so you don't have to redistribute 20 damaged iron swords after every battle. The levels themselves are competently designed if nothing spectacular.\n\nMy main complaint is oddly enough the plot. It is rather random and entirely too light-hearted for a game about battlefield tactics and should be just a shade darker. Where are the card carrying villians? Where are the pillaging bandits, the heartless tyrants, the constant plotting and scheming against the heroes? The Fire Emblem games have consistently managed above-average quality plots using these tropes. This just disappoints in that regard.\n\nEven so this is still a worthwhile SRPG even if is not the greatest and does not truly attempt to do anything new.", "recommendationid": "31130524", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492154382, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "7", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493023443, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198114710051", "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_forever": 789}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524962"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492556450, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "A cute Fire Emblem-esque strategy RPG, but with a few spins on familiar mechanics to be worth playing even if you're a big FE superfan.

It's what I expected going into it an it's what I got out of it. \nGameplay wise it feels quite a bit more balanced than Fire Emblem since you can't just beef up one or two units to kill everything.
