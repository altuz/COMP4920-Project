I'm guessing that the price turns people off. The goal is to break spheres. It may seem simple at first but the puzzles start getting harder and harder as your progress. They start adding glass panels you have to slide into position, lasers to dodge and more. I love the level design. It reminds me of the Portal series which I'm a huge fan of. Some of the levels felt quite big as well which surprised me. A couple of them had me taking a huge tram-like elevator to completely new areas. I unfortunately did not get to try the coop multiplayer but it seems like it could be fun.\n\nAlso, there is dialogue and a story as well and the translation to English is really good (It's a Japanese game). I sometimes avoid Asian games with fear that the English transaltion might be horrible. I've played a lot of them where that's the case. For this game, if no one told me I would not have been able to tell it was Japanese. Very good English.\n\nI think a lot of people overlooked this game, including myself, probably because of the price. I needed something new to try on my YouTube channel and I'm really glad I chose this game.", "recommendationid": "31123142", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492114013, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491858846, "num_reviews": 68, "steamid": "76561197970490589", "num_games_owned": 204, "playtime_forever": 44}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502300"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1494276871, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Starts off slow. was pretty easy to beat on normal.  Might be better to start with hard difficulty or Hell if you're up for a real challenge.  Took about 1.5 hours.  I'll probably play \nit again.  I want to beat it on Hell difficulty which is very hard.\n\nIt's not really much of a puzzle game. There's 20 levels and just when the puzzles get difficult the game ends.  The difficulty is in avoiding the enemy lasers while you take out the spheres.\n\nHas some replay value with challenge modes and multiplayer.  I'd give it a 6.5/10 as a normal game. Nothing earth shattering but decent to time killer.", "recommendationid": "31634289", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1494533838, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495034254, "num_reviews": 127, "steamid": "76561198063942102", "num_games_owned": 185, "playtime_forever": 151}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502944"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
