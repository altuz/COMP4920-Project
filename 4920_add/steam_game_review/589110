Despite that however, this game was extremely fun. Just finished playing through my first run-through with 3 minutes left to go... Yeah I suck lol. One thing that bothered me and slowed down my progress completely was the fact that the controls were a bit wonky with the environment. When carrying pictures over to a table in order to organize them, they would either slip out of my hands mid-teleporting or when the object collides with another in-game, static-rendered object. Other than that, the puzzles were in fact quite challenging and surely time consuming. I would like to see even more rooms expanded and not just 2 rooms to house 3-4 puzles. If this first level contained maybe 3 or even 4 rooms with the puzzles spread out, that would have been absolutely great! Another note would be to expand the variety of objects needed to solve said puzzles. Its obvious that keys open locks, puzzles are either number or word answers, and the only real objects that played a big role in this were framed portraits of victims and projector slides. There could be so so much more that could be included to make the a killer game. Overall, its worth the $1.00 purchase for a quick, fun, brain deceiving puzzle game. I greatly look forward to future levels and further updates!", "recommendationid": "30500668", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1489457915, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502479202, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198038341829", "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_forever": 63}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1489889497, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Nice little escape room.", "recommendationid": "30605254", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1489889497, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489889436, "num_reviews": 51, "steamid": "76561198027106070", "num_games_owned": 73, "playtime_forever": 23}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1489955407, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Wife and I played through the first room.

It can be avoided if you play carefully, but its something that should be fixed in the future. It is by the way the exact same problems we had with the other escape room game called Abode (also a cool game). \n\nBesides mentioned bugs, all I am left with is a feeling of wanting more, which is a good thing.\n\nAt 0.99\u20ac its worth it even for the one room.", "recommendationid": "30623786", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1489955407, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489946002, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561197964555192", "num_games_owned": 102, "playtime_forever": 81}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1489448726, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Constricted VR is a new entry into the Escape Room genre, and shows promise for being a pretty good one for a very attractive price.  At the time of this review, only one room (out of four planned \"main\" ones) is available to play.  The first room is on a 30-minute timer, and the puzzles within are primarily focused on decoding names and numbers, as opposed to physics or logic-based puzzles.  I'd like to see more variety in the future, but it was still a fun and satisfying to complete.  I actually ran out of time on my first go, all-in-all taking me about 45 minutes to finish. \n\nIn terms of polish, Constricted is a little rough in areas, with fairly basic visuals and very little in the way of sound design.  I'll preface this by saying that I'm using a Rift + Touch, but item interaction was pretty touchy (no pun intended) at times.  Interacting with the alphabet and number pads was difficult, with accidental button presses occurring frequently.  Picking up objects often took several attempts, where they either wouldn't pick up, or they'd get hung up on the surrounding geometry.  Locomotion-wise, Constricted uses teleportation, which is fine by me, though the option for traditional locomotion would be nice too.  I'd like to at least see the interaction controls polished up before leaving early access, but it's still playable as-is.\n\nDespite a few shortcomings, I still wholeheartedly recommend Contricted to anyone who is a fan of escape rooms, and wants to see more of them in the future.  Even if the current room was the only one ever released, it's an absolute no-brainer for only $1, and a fantastic value considering there's three more to come for no extra charge! \n\nWhile other escape room games might be more polished, I also consider them too pricey, with how short they are and how little replay value there is.  Constricted VR strikes the balance of offering the escape room gameplay a lot of us VR players crave, and does so at a price we can't refuse.  I'm excited to see how this game progresses, and to play the new content in the coming months!", "recommendationid": "30499145", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1489449997, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496347704, "num_reviews": 15, "steamid": "76561197986196908", "num_games_owned": 637, "playtime_forever": 118}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495730"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1489411860, "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "https://youtu.be/qwoeHr_ux70\n\nInnovative escape game in the room, since you live it in first person by being virtual reality.
