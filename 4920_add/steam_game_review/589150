The axes fly fairly weird, a slight rotation maxes them spin incredibly fast, the path is sometimes a little wobbly and so on. The momentum feels fairly on point though. Overall, it's not enough to keep up a good immersion in VR in my opinion. \n- optimisation sometimes lacking/bad choice of graphic effect; on my R9 390 the game runs smoothly, but transitioning between scenes/levels makes the game stutter a lot. Even though I'm not sensitive to VR sickness, it doesn't feel that good...\n- the gameplay itself feels fairly slow \n\nPersonally, I like the game except the most essential part - the way the gameplay was implemented. The VR controls simply feel off and that kills such a game for me. The game  simply doesn't keep me entertained for longer than that novelty effect created by the setting and the graphics. I can't really recommend it at the current price tag - and I actually managed to get it at a fair discount.", "recommendationid": "31916474", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1495541040, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495540408, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198001365368", "num_games_owned": 429, "playtime_forever": 13}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501336"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 43, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1493528806, "votes_down": 31, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Garbage, don't waste your time or money on this!!!!!

A game i will definitly show my friends when they come around to play VR! \nWhat i like the most is activating the rage mode with the bow. It is just satisfying to mow down the enemie hordes. \nAnd i found two secrets that i didn't expect but i don't want to spoil to much. ;) \n\nAnother great point is that everything matched in Viking Rage. The artstyle, the atmosphere, the music and so on. \n\nSo to sum up: Nice Graphics (personaly i like the style), a few minigames + the game itself(i read that there are a more then i found myself), makes a lot fun to play around with physics but i had to train a bit so that i can hit the enemie(especially with the axe but you get rewarded for that training cause they deal a lot more dmg). Another Ponit is that i got exhausted after playing 40min+ so maybe you should keep in mind that it is a very active game.\n\nEdit: I found a little point that bothers me a bit. You can not kill enemies with axes when they hit the ground first. So thats sometimes frustrating. :/", "recommendationid": "31440274", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493557342, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493744259, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198054526127", "num_games_owned": 69, "playtime_forever": 735}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503401"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1496811810, "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "You know what VR needs? Another wave defense game!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/trU3F19qetg\n\nOverall, Viking Rage isn't a bad game. I liked the attitude and the presentation. It's a solid wave defense title. Therein lies the problem though. I've always been quick to defend a good wave shooter/wave defense title, however even I'm getting tired of seeing them. \n\nI had expectations that didn't match what the game was. I try to intentionally go into these games blind without being colored by anyone else's opinion. I was expecting something a bit more adventure-ish. So needless to say I was a bit let down by the fact the game is a simple wave defense title.\n\nThat being said, it's a decent game if you're not as jaded as I am yet. \n\nCurrently there are 6 levels to work through. The visuals and audio are not bad but nothing to write home about. \n\nThere is a decent level of difficulty. Especially if you're as bad at sportsing as I am. My accuracy with the axes is shite. The balance of the weapons does seem to be well done though. Thrown axes are pretty much a one shot kill while the much easier to use bow and arrow that has a guide for the arrows path take several hits to kill.\n\nAs a wave defense game, it's pretty decent and as such it will get a thumbs up. I really want to seem more in depth games though. Something that's going to grab me and make me want to do a whole series of videos like Vertigo.\n", "recommendationid": "32232825", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1496811810, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504235293, "num_reviews": 92, "steamid": "76561197983689849", "num_games_owned": 334, "playtime_forever": 100}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500410"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 12, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1493464654, "votes_down": 26, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I just got my Vive new, but i played some different games on friends places or conventions and watched a lot of gameplay videos. so i have to say Viking Rage is really worth the money cus it brings way more features and things to explore with it than most of the other vive games i've tried. the physics are great and the graphics are cartoonish in a very good way. 3D Audio is also implemented so i would use headphones for playing this game, but it works just fine on speakers as well.\n\ni also like that there are minigames within the game, but u have to find them in the mainhall, and i think u have to unlock them first.\n\noverall a very worth trying out for everyone owning a HTC Vive.", "recommendationid": "31437538", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493464654, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494184993, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198365642238", "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_forever": 183}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495670"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1493463765, "votes_down": 24, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I love the beautiful and atmospheric polygon art style of the game.
