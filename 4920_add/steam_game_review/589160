There isnt many upgrades you can do to your base/weapons and it feels like it takes forever to get those there is. On the bright side, the graphics are good, the game looks nice and i didnt experience any big bugs.\n\nThis is my gameplay review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obdja13As3A", "recommendationid": "29942459", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487168647, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487165058, "num_reviews": 98, "steamid": "76561197972664624", "num_games_owned": 199, "playtime_forever": 118}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514448"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 10, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1487162355, "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game feels half finished.

Meaning you cant run side to side, jump, duck, or anything. Your only able to look around standing in the same spot. Immediately I think \"This games going to suck\" But i'll play one round. Got hooked. It's a very simple but fun shooter. So far there are 45 levels with each level adding something new, for example. A new zombie called the butcher was added that moves faster than the walking ones, then a hound, then one mission was just to kill 75 zombies. There are weapon upgrades, I saved up and got the AK47 which funny enough was semi-auto and only had a 5 round magazine! but i'm sure once I can afford the $12000 upgrade I can buy high capacity magazines and maybe eventually convert it to full auto. I only made it to level 6 but so far i'm really liking this game. Oh, and its free and only took a few minutes to download.\n\nMy only suggestions would be the ability to move around, even just on the small deck you start out standing on, The other thing would be the damage system. Right now when a zombie makes it to your wall it just deducts life from your character and the zombie disapears. I was thinking making it where your wall has a damage bar. The zombies don't just disappear when they walk into it like they do now. Instead they just constantly swing at it maybe taking of %5 durability from your barrier with each hit. Then if the barrier is destroyed it moves on to taking your health. Maybe an addon you could do is have durability for your weapons as well. Having to repair them the more you use them. If you don't there's a higher chance for your weapon to jam.
