Pretty fun even in single player mode.\nBots are decent and feel pretty alive.  I like how you can steer the tank with the Vive controller like a HOTAS.  Definitely a keeper to pick up and play occasionally.\nVery slight motion sickness but not as bad as some other games I've played.", "recommendationid": "32233017", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1496813230, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501085986, "num_reviews": 127, "steamid": "76561198063942102", "num_games_owned": 185, "playtime_forever": 27}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495491"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
