What makes one person wet their drawers elicits yawns from another. But this is definitely a game that I think most people will find genuinely scary. \n\nDespite having graphics that look like they were designed for a cellphone (they were), Dreadhalls utilizes several very clever tricks and design elements to create one of the scariest experiences I've ever played. I'm wary of overhyping the scare factor for anyone who might be interested in buying this but I honestly cannot remember the last time a game made me jump or scream and this game has made me do both several times. Best of all, it doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares like several AAA titles I can think of. \n\nThe minute-to-minute gameplay is reminiscent of old school dungeon crawlers only without combat. Instead, be prepared to run. Or sometimes to stand perfectly still. Or maybe avoid looking at the enemy. Oooor don't look away. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. \n\nI don't want to say any more for fear of giving away the surprises but the level of immersion and the feeling of presence this game achieves is top-notch and it deftly avoids the trap many horror games fall into of having the same enemy type repeat over and over. Horror games tend to lose their chill factor once you figure out all the rules that the AI abides by; I still haven't worked out how some of these enemies behave and I'm not itching to have enough encounters with them to do so. \n\n The levels are randomly generated each time you play so you never become too familiar with your surroundings. If you die, you have to go back to the start of the area you're currently in and the map resets. You also have the option of loading up a random map from the main menu, which gives the game a good amount of replayability. This is definitely one of the VR games you'll want to show your friends when they come over.", "recommendationid": "33870166", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501293103, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503267643, "num_reviews": 45, "steamid": "76561198027887433", "num_games_owned": 241, "playtime_forever": 476}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501289"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1499664807, "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game makes my friends and I incredibly nauseous.
