I've been wanting a cool superhero game to play in VR and with a little bit of work this could be great. The comic book visual style was a nice design choice and the power animations look awesome for the most part. I enjoy most of the 8 powers currently in the game, though they could use some polishing. The game is pretty bare-bones on the gameplay side at the moment, but thats expected for an EA title.  Here is some long-winded constructive criticism for the Dev:\n\n[u]General Critques[/u]: \n[list]\n     [*] [strike]Hand representation in the game seems slightly off.  Almost as if your real world hands are gripping the wrists of the avatar hands. Arms feel very long.[/strike] FIXED :)\n     [*] Seeing your hands make different gestures for different powers would be a cool touch.\n     [*] City feels a bit empty with no people/traffic (I'm sure more will be added later)\n     [*] Menu button has no function currently.\n[/list]\n\n[u]Powers[/u]:\n\n[b]Teleport[/b]:  A must have for VR games and a good power to give right off the bat.  While I don't use it as much as the other movement options (I have no VR sickness issues). [strike]I think it could use a bit more range, and the indicator should be a bit taller, as sometimes I couldn't see it if aiming up at a building ledge[/strike] FIXED :) .  A lot of places won't let you teleport onto them like slanted House roofs.\n\n[b]Alloy (Gattling Gun)[/b]:  A classic for damage dealing. Pretty standard, but I feel maybe it should have a few different firing modes like missiles and such for variety. Iron Man / War Machine style!\n\n[b]Fireball[/b]  Made me feel like the Human Torch. Cool charge animation and seemingly infinite range.  [strike]Ran into a small bug where the hitboxes on the fireball seemed too large and would explode right next to me as if it was hitting me/the ground instead of firing.[/strike] ALSO FIXED\n\n[b]Spells[/b] Nice job on the visuals with this one. Seems to be a knockback spell and a damage dealing spell, even though to sign says there is a \"disable\" spell? They could use a bit more range and maybe a few more spells added to cycle through.  Also please add an indicator on your hand telling you which spell is currently equipped!\n\n[b]Shield[/b] My least favorite because it doesnt allow you to move since it's in your left hand (movement hand).  Long cooldown on the short range knockback attack. [strike]The way you have to hold the shield makes it soo you can't see the cooldown meter on your hand too.[/strike] FIXED\n\n[b]Flying[/b]: Couldn't wait for this one. Flight direction is controlled by controller direction.  [strike]Feels good, but its wayyyyyyy too slow[/strike] Kinda fixed, could still be faster*.  Maybe the amount the trigger is pulled could control speed? Or maybe the menu button or full trigger click could enable super speed flight. You can also fly through the roofs of buildings currently.\n\n[b]Super Speed[/b]: Yes!!! My preferred movement option.  Effects on edge of screen while running are cool.  Running direction is controlled by where you are looking, but I think there should be an option to let you change it to controller direction like flying.  Sometimes you need to look where your going before you change direction. It would be cool if running into an enemy would hurt them or knock them back. Theres currently a bug if you run directly at an enemy, it will place you on top of their head and then you are stuck there until you change to flight/teleport.\n\n[b]Heatvision[/b]:  My Favorite damage dealing power.  It just feels good to use! A burn trail follows anywhere that u look.  I have no complaints on this one except maybe a little bit more damage and the [strike]looping sound effect while using it can be a little obnoxious[/strike] FIXED.\n\n\nGreat job so far, and can't wait to see whats in store for this game in the future!\n\nEDIT: Crossed out issues fixed with quick update.", "recommendationid": "29813668", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487097288, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501450002, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198359456865", "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_forever": 188}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512934"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1488296963, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Like everyone else has said, right now its just a proof of concept more than anything else. But also like everyone else has said, I see a lot of potential in this game, and I really like what I've heard about the developer of this game. He recently quit his day job to work on this full-time. That's what I like to hear when it comes to indie game developers. He knows it's a big financial risk, but he's taking it anyway to work on something he's clearly passionate about. That shows great dedication. This is early access done right. It's so often abused nowadays, but this is what it's really for. Buying a game early so that the developer can afford to keep working on it and improve it.\n\n\nAnd if the developer decides to read this, I've got a lot of ideas for things to add in future updates:\n\nSuperpowers:\n\nSuper Strength (kind of a given)\n\nMore elemental powers, like ice, water, earth, lightning, etc.\n\nAcid powers\n\nX-Ray vision\n\nTelekinesis (just point at an object to highlight it, and hold the trigger to move it around. Pretty simple)\n\nTechnomancy: Make robots fight each other! Or make cars drive on their own. Maybe have them crash into robots.\n\nSize-Changing abilities: Become as big as a building to crush enemies, or as small as an ant to access secret areas and hidden paths\n\nOther stuff:\n\nA story-based reason for the player's abilities: Maybe make it so that the player is a superhero with the ability to channel the powers of other super-people?\n\nCivilians: Civilians will naturally run from a fight. However, if one dies anyway, it lowers your score.\n\nMake flight faster (while you may think this would render super speed obsolete, I think the two are different enough for it to work)\n\nCombo powers: Using certain powers together creates something even better (maybe this is how faster flight can work? Have flight on one hand and speed on the other)\n\nHave robots explode if you run into them with super speed\n\nHave the lazer eyes come from closer inward. Right now it feels like the lazers are coming from my temples. Maybe have your vision go red when using the power, as well. Kind of like in King Kaiju. Now that I think about it, this game and its developer remind me a lot of King Kaiju. Maybe you two could collaborate on something?\n\n\nHave the power wheel mapped to the menu button, not the trackpad: I feel like this would feel more natural, and allow for the player to switch between attacks using the trackpad, as opposed to the grip buttons. You could still have a small game menu float above the power wheel when you press the menu button.", "recommendationid": "30242577", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488296963, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502422232, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198025033642", "num_games_owned": 179, "playtime_forever": 44}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507072"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1486637093, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Fun game but has low content atm.\nHopefully devs keep updating the game!", "recommendationid": "29798915", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1486637093, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501153167, "num_reviews": 129, "steamid": "76561198064178653", "num_games_owned": 549, "playtime_forever": 52}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499534"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1488731674, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Neet idea that shows great potential, the graphics fits perfectly the overall concept and environment.\nAt the moment there is not much content to play around with but hopefully will see more as the development continues.", "recommendationid": "30340876", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488731674, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494105244, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198076126936", "num_games_owned": 43, "playtime_forever": 135}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502523"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487115559, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game may be just a prototype, but the machanics are there.\nAnd oh are they fun to use!\nYou can combine a locomotion and weapon power together to create your own style.\nThe ones I liked to use were the flying and lasersigh, but also the speedster and minigun.\n\nIt makes you really feel powerful!\nNow they just have to develop a story and game around the mechanics and you will have a solid game!\n\nIt is worth its price, especially if you like to demo your VR headset.\n\n\n\nSome feedback to the dev: Please let the speedster run on walls and maybe add superstrength which can demolish buildings and throw cars.", "recommendationid": "29930912", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487115559, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487114795, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198138235296", "num_games_owned": 57, "playtime_forever": 21}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504525"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1486841847, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Really fun game with great potential!

The way text pops up when you start your mini-gun spinning up or the enemies blow up in a great big BAM cloud. It really feels like you've been dropped into a comic book.\n\nThe audio fit perfectly, from the BGM to the sound effects. Everything seemed appropriately super hero-y.\n\nThe 'gameplay' consisted of unlocking all the powers and using them against a few static enemies. This is where the price tag doesn't match the content. I don't think I particularly rushed the experience and managed to finish in about 10 minutes. That translates to just under $1 a minute.\n\nThere are better, more complete titles out there for that price. Titles that won't just be a sandbox, tech demo. It's a well done tech demo but it's still a tech demo.\n\nThis will be a pick up if you really want to support future VR super hero titles. The devs need to eat too.
