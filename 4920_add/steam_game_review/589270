Where the game does shine is the large range of puzzles that it offers.\n\nThe goal of the game is to complete each of the levels in a range of stages. You begin at the top level, working your way through each to the bottom of the stage. Your \"Yabbie\" is in a clear cube, that can be completely coloured a particular colour, matching the colour tile you move onto - or just have a single side coloured by the tile (small ones do a side, large ones do the whole cube). Along the way there is a range of obstacles, including landmines that will either explode when moved onto or (if they are coloured) not explode if you have the correct coloured side touching it - timed platforms that disappear - moving blocks that crush your character - and trapped Yabbies that must be moved onto their corresponding coloured exit tile. Each level varies in size and layout, but I have seen a bit of repetition on smaller levels as I have progressed through the game.\n\nEach stage is scored on time taken to complete, moves used to complete and number of Yabbies saved - with a score calculated on the combination of the 3. The score also gives you are grading in boxes, shown on the entrance to the stage. You need a number of boxes to open the next stage up, but I have been averaging around a score of 5 out of 9 with 15 stages completed and am yet to have the next stage not open up.\n\nTo add some replayability, there is a leader-board in each area (an area is made up of 5 zones) which compares your stage scores to that of any Steam friends who have the game and also a global ranking of other people who own it. It also appears that the game is about 25 stages long and at the rate I am playing through it, I would expect 3.5 to 4 hours of gameplay, depending on how easy you find the puzzles.\n\nOverall I have enjoyed my playthrough so far and am happy to recommend it.", "recommendationid": "32317361", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1497100182, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497096078, "num_reviews": 17, "steamid": "76561197960286303", "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 226}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508602"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 7, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1496751119, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Cleverly designed puzzle game, have been playing a couple of hours non-stop and it keeps getting more and more interesting!
