Fortunately the devs have now offered an option where this is no longer an issue and it has made the game so much more relaxing to play.\n\nIf you've ever flown real kites you will be impressed by how well this translates to VR and if you haven't flown before then here's an amazingly cheap way to try. I mean you couldn't even buy the kite string for the price of this game!!\n\nThe game itself offers 3 modes:\n\nThe first is a stunt kite variation of the classic 'snake' game. As you collect stars, the tail of your kite grows longer and you have to avoid hitting the tail as it gets longer and longer.\n\nThe second is a survival mode where you have to avoid RC planes for as long as you can. You can even take them down with your kite if you're careful and skillful enough!\n\nLastly there's a free flight mode where you can just fly and chill, and there's the added feature of being able to turn smoke on and off as you are flying, giving you the chance to produce some fancy sky patterns. You can even change the wind strength and their are several kite skins to unlock in the game.\n\nIf you have any interest in kites, just want a cheap casual game to play now and then, have kids, or just want to feel like a kid again yourself then I highly recommend this bargain title.", "recommendationid": "33389506", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499558730, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503850445, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198151931909", "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_forever": 427}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 10, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 10}}
