It is set in the perilous reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, a French Emperor who managed to bring nations to their knees before a mighty coalition repulsed the tyrant and restored order to Europe. History lesson over.\n\nIt is worth noting that despite the fact that I positively reviewed this game, it does have shortcomings, and unfortunately, they are quite critical to the feel of the game. I, personally, recommend it regardless...but if you were after a well-made game with relatively few flaws, this is not a title you should be looking at just yet. \n\nTo start off with, the first thing you'll notice in this game is that the graphics are amazing. Keeping in mind that it was made by three developers who self-funded the project, it puts modern titles made by bigger companies to shame. The developers did an excellent job with everything about the visuals of this game, from adding realistic lighting, appealing textures, realistic weathers to which the environment realistically reacts and so much more. The gun smoke looks incredible and really helps to make the battles feel just that bit more immersive. The detail in the game is also incredible. The uniforms are designed very well, and look authentic to the era and the faction under which they are used. Weapons are historically accurate, and designed both differently and extremely well, with the French using the Charleville muskets - noticeably different to the British Brown Bess, and the officer's pistols also being accurate in design to that of their respective nation. Nothing in this game looks out of place. \n\nAs well as looking, this game also feels very realistic. Aided immensely by the graphics and the detail that went into the authentic props and the battlefield carnage, the game also makes it surprisingly hard to identify friend from foe. This is not done in a game destroying way, but in that from a distance, you can see a soldier, but you cannot often make out his side. While the standard Red (British) and Blue (French) uniforms for line infantry are easy to understand, it is when you get Musicians, Sailors, and sharpshooters that you will find yourself firing at your own team. This is realistic, and such mistakes have happened in historical battles. The game also feels realistic with regards to how the weapons work. While reload times are not 30 seconds (because that would be boring) the sequence is accurate to that of the era, and how the weapons actually fire is too. You can be spread out in close quarter combat firing at each other with surprisingly few casualties - as it would have been like back in the day due the lack of reliability and accuracy of the weapons. This was the reason they used to fight in lines in the first place. \n\nAnd finally, the integration of Naval Battles and Coastal Siege etc was a very welcomed introduction. The cross over from land to Naval warfare all within one theatre of combat is wild, and extremely fun to take part in. The Naval battles do only feature small ships such as sloops, but they are well designed and take visible damage, as well as having many functional parts, and unlike Warband, the game can handle it. It is not glitchy and everything from the ship to the cannons to the muskets handle well. \n\nFor all of its good points, though, there are things that let this game down, and they should be addressed, so as both to inform the buyer, and hopefully aid the developers in refining this so-far amazing project which they have undertaken. \nIn no particular order, then, here are things about the game that I cannot praise:\n \n- The Melee. It uses a similar system to Warband in that there are 4 ways of block and attack (or two ways of attack for muskets) but the system is very badly made, and consequently, melee is unbelievably hard. Attack animations are slow, and not very responsive. Melee at the moment is a lot more down to luck than skill, unlike in Warband where skill was critical. This leads me on to responsiveness of controls in general. Switching from melee to shooting is slow, and sometimes does not work, which means that you cannot break your reload and will inevitably be killed as you can only walk while reloading a weapon. It would be nice to see this fixed, sooner rather than later. \n\n- No server filters. As of yet, you cannot filter out just the servers that you want, excluding those with high ping and no players, etc. For ease of use, this feature does need adding to the game, but while not convenient, it is not crippling to its quality. It is worth noting too, that sometimes the server player count is wrong, and will give the impression that there are a certain number of players on a server which is not true. It may be full, for example, or empty, and be showing 78 players in it. \n\n- No character customisation. This would be a much-appreciated feature to the game. I don't expect the choice of a female character if they are aiming for realism, but at least the option to do something with the appearance of your character would be welcomed by a lot of us. \n\n- Lack of nations and cavalry. The game has only got Navy and Infantry classes at the time of this review, and the only two nations available are France and the United Kingdom. The developers are working on adding more content to the game, though, so this isn't something that should put you off buying it.   \n\n- Lack of sub-classes in units, and descriptions of loadout etc. Finally, the only other disadvantage I can think of is that the spawn menu allows you to pick \u201cLine officer\u201d, \u201cLine Infantry\u201d, \u201cLight Infantry\u201d, \u201cRifles\u201d, \u201cGuards\u201d etc, but there are no sub-options like there was in Mount and Blade: Warband. There is no way to play as a \u201cGuard Captain\u201d for example, or a \u201cRifleman Bugler\u201d etc. This does feel quite limiting, and I hope that the developers will implement this feature soon. It would also be nice to see a description of each class\u2019 loadout so we can assess the advantages and disadvantages of playing as one of them. As an extra level of detail, it would be good to have the option to change the loadout slightly where possible, say from a pistol as a sailor to a musket, which they would also have used. \n\nOverall, though, this game has done really well. It is only early days, and with a lot of support and feedback from the community, I feel like the developers can do a very good job of this title. You can tell that a lot of time and hard work went into the creation of it, and I am keen to see it succeed both for the developers and for the community. I would give this game a strong 7/10, for what we have is largely well made. It would just be so much better were the faults to be fixed, but of course, we must give them time.

The graphic details especially  are really nice and show the devotion to the game by the developers.\n+ The game mechanics are, all in all, quite solid for an early access game compared to other early access games I have played so far. The game is playable and enjoyable, although you can clearly see that there is need for more updates, tuning and reworking things like the melee system.\n+ The different game modes are enjoyable and already have a high variation from 'Army Battle' - which is basically the Linebattle mode - over Siege, Coastal Siege or classic TDM to full Navy Battles where you fight ship against ship. Everybody who enjoys playing in the Napoleonic era can find a play style for himself.\n+ The great potential the game has to offer is also a positive argument for Holdfast in my opinion. Especially seeing the roadmap of the developers to include features like cavalry and more, I think that the game can become quite great. Although I am sure it is still a lot of work to include all the mentioned features and fixes, the current status of the game already shows the developers' devotion towards it.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n- The game mechanics still show a kind of roughness, especially the melee system. There needs to be a reworking of this so that for example the melee fights become enjoyable and smooth. The hit-box detection can be quite frustrating at the moment when you hit an enemy on your screen but the hit is not counted, so your opponent doesn't take damage. The same goes for the Naval Battles where the end status of the ships is not taken into consideration for the round result - also the handling of the ships is quite weird in the sense of manoeuvring and hit reactions on enemy ships. These things need to be fixed soon, but I am confident that this is not a feasible goal.\n- The problem with high server latency is something that is currently being worked on but at the current state of the game it is quite a huge problem, because it makes playing on a full server nearly impossible. But as I said, the developers are currently working on this.\n- Some animations are missing or need some reworking, like for example the hit reaction in melee, which is missing at the moment. I would appreciate some reworking of the sword fighting animations since they look quite unnatural. \n\n[b]Summary & Recommendation[/b]\n\nAll in all I can say Holdfast: Nations at War is a solid early access game in which you can learn the basic game mechanics and enjoy different game modes already with nice graphics. It is a great opportunity to get an impression of battles in the Napoleonic era although some things are tarnishing the game experience. The melee system needs reworking and attentive updates so it becomes smoother and more reactive towards the players mouse input, for example in blocking. Warband shows a very good example of how a smooth and quick melee system can work and I am sure the developers have this topic on their to-do-list. Still the very basic game mechanics are working and the game is not \"unplayable\" as some other reviews might suggest. \nFor people like me, that enjoy the Napoleonic era in general, playing as a  Napoleonic soldier and fighting in melee or with a gunpowder weapon, may it be on land or on sea, it is an enjoyable experience already. Especially as soon as the high latency issue is fixed. But keep in mind that the game is still early access and some people might get frustrated by the weird hit-box detection or the very slow and unresponsive melee game play. If you expect to be frustrated by those current issues I would suggest you wait for further updates and development before you actually buy Holdfast.\n\nFor everyone else I can recommend the game. As future updates release I will update the review.", "recommendationid": "35179331", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506354208, "votes_funny": 4, "comment_count": "5", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 441, "last_played": 1506795470, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197999240413", "num_games_owned": 233, "playtime_forever": 441}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585355"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 42, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506519599, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This video pretty sums up my experience with Holdfast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCe4NXhxlfo\n\nFirst of all, this game has tons of protential and a lot of people are expecting way too much to be completed considering this is an alpha with its' first week of being released, and already the devs have done a lot. \nPeople need to understand that we pay for early access so devs recieve money to fund their game- that is the entire point of early access. It's good to know that they're using the money well, and I hope to see their dev team expand.\n\nOn to the review. This game is pretty much the same as NW-Warband with the addition of enjoyable naval battles, naval sieges, better graphics and character animations. That isn't a bad thing, as Napoleonic Wars was perfect in its' own way, it's great to see a game that was left barren by the community be revived in Holdfast. I rejoined a regiment I left almost 3 years ago, and have been addicted to it since release. \n\nThe problem is; this game will not survive under nostalgia. I seriously do hope that they can add far more than their planned tornuments, maybe in the far future, a coop campaign to play in all of Napoleons battles with your regiment and to fight against large AI armies could be a promising change of pace for those who don't always want a loose multiplayer experience and might want a fun campaign in their with characters. And should Holdfast be stuck in the Napoleonic wars? I don't think so, why not move this into multiple eras and fronts. The War of 1812, the American Revolution, the American Civil War, the 7 years war and so on. I'm sure once mods are enabled, people will attempt these anyway- but why not include them into the base game? Of course, this is all far out of the minds of the devs who are just trying to build upon the base game. Though I hope they read this and consider the massive possibilities of creating a huge game that people will come back to for years. I would not want to see this game fade like NW.\n\nAnyway, this is just my first review. Once the devs move this into beta, I'll make a final opinion on it. I recommend this ONLY IF you are willing to push through expected bugs from an early access game. These guys aren't AAA, they are a small team and have done a great job so far and are already active in fixing bugs. Buy at your own risk.

Upon release I am pretty disappointed with the melee combat system, at its current stage it's very barebones and basic.\n\nObviously the devs have said that melee combat is a major aspect of the game that they want to improve, however as of now it is aab (average at best). Some of my issues with the melee I've listed below;[list]\n[*] - Delayed controls\n[*] - Inaccurate hitboxes\n[*] - Overly long animations\n[*] - Lack of visual hit registration\n[*] - Lack of Keyboard Direction options\n[*] - Clunky/awkward turning and movement\n[*] - Hard to identify and basic melee animations[/list]\nBear in mind I don't have too much time spent ingame, and Holdfast: NaW is still in Early Access. I have however played a multitude of games based on directional blocking/attacking, and in my opinion this definately does not stand out from the disapointments we've had before.\n\nAside from the melee, I have some minor gripes that can be expected with every EA game, these can be considered suggestions for future improvement;[list]\n[*] - Mini-Map gives away your position to everyone on the server\n[*] - Chat text is tiny af\n[*] - Ping on serverlist often doesn't appear\n[*] - Lack of serverlist filters\n[*] - Lack of character customization\n[*] - No explaination of class or its equipment[/list]\nI definately don't hate this game or want it to fail, I do however expect a functional melee system for $20usd. I have faith that the devs will update and improve their game through EA. Once the melee recieves attention I will return and edit this review.

I was hesitant to purchase because its early access but it was worth the 20 dollars. If you're not familar with Warband then I recommend doing some research before purchasing the game. \n\nThere are only two playerable factions which are France, and Britain. Both factions use the same class list. Theres an array of voice commands to use and they're spoken in native languages. There is currently no cavalry. There are unique units for the naval maps in marines, sailors, etc... \n\nEach class has a set loadout but the games arsenal is limited. Weapons include muskets, musketoons, rifles, pistols, swords, pikes. There are also cannons that anyone can load and fire with ammo that lies in boxs. You can play drummers, fifers, etc... or a flag bearer to boost the reloading and accuracy of the men around you. The mucisians have an array of songs they can play. If you stand next to a fellow mucisian when you go to the song list and choose the highlighted song to play in sequence.\n\nShooting mechanics are pretty good. I hit targets easily up to 20m and struggle beyond 50m. Though I did see one player get a shot from 200m away! Cannons fairly easy to use. Theres round ball shot and also chain shot on naval maps that rips their sails apart.

And the melee is pretty awful (although it is fun to watch people battle for 5 minutes trying to hit each other just once) However, when the servers are running well and there are 125 people in your server, it is the absolute most fun I've had. This game isn't lacking in content either, it has so many maps, classes, voice commands, music, ships, game modes, and uniforms. \n\nMy first game was 50 of my team mates lining up at spawn with one guy standing in front of us poorly paraphrasing the Aragorn speech from Return of the King then shouting \"For Kek\" then charging into battle while blasting the Lord of the Rings theme song. We all died literally instantly from cannons and everyone was shouting nonsense through the microphone, but it was one of the fun things I have experienced in a video game in a long time, and those weird scenarios happen in every full server, the community is incredible.\n\nThe shooting mechanics require patience and skill which gives it depth, but will take some getting used to for some.\n\nFor an early access game this has blown me away and I don't think I'll get bored of it anytime soon.\n\n\ni'm a flute main hmu", "recommendationid": "35229485", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506456839, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1304, "last_played": 1507154068, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197996006846", "num_games_owned": 147, "playtime_forever": 1304}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522639"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 17, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506044008, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Anvil Game Studios with a three man team from Malta have produced an excellent early access game for their budget and team size.  AGS released Holdfast: Nations at War as it's first standalone game and project without any assisntnce from Kickstarter or the Community via donations. They set out to create a game and they did, a good early access for a start.\n\nHoldfast: Nations at War some will say is the succesor to the Mount & Blade: Napoleonic Wars DLC, which i believe is true. Everything in Holdfast has been improved on except for melee. \n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n1. Extremely active and caring developers. The devs actually care and will speak to you regarding a number of topics, they take critism with stride and will personally try and make your experience the best possible. After speeaking with Refleax and his team, AGS are some really down to earth group of guys.\n\n2. Great gameplay concept. No pay-to-win and no grind-to-win. Units and regiments don't cost any REAL money. The PvP can be thrilling and definitely fun to play with your mates.\n\n3. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can't just spawn in and recklessly run around the map no-scoping blokes with your musket. You have to plan out your movement very carefully and quickly since time is of the essence. Difficult decisions comes up often, especially in line battles (e.g. risk your mens life to capture the cannon or run like hell to safety etc.) An enjoyable learning curve definitely exists - not too steep and not too lean.\n\n4. A shooting game that applies semi-realistic bullet travel time, and bullet drop is always appreciated. They've added a really cool balisitc and projecticle system so it takes skill to shoot and kill.\n\n5. Awesome Maps & Weather. Real time weather effects take place including transition from day to night! Sometimes I can't see shit because it's snowing or it's dark but it adds to the games realism level.\n\n6. Naval Combat is fairly decent for now! The ships are very very frustrating to move however.\n\n7. Sieges are done right. Sieges are a whole lot of fun, you actually feel the obligation to protect your territory from the invaders.\n\n8. Performance. Performance is pretty bloody good, I'm playing on high with a GTX 750 and i5 4460 and am getting around 35-40 FPS\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nOf course with all games and especially Early Access there are negatives.\n\n1. Gameplay can be Monotonous. It really depends what events and game modes you play/attend. The unique experience really relies on encounters with other regiments and your leaders decision making.\n\n2. Melee is awful, probably some of the worse I've seen in any game. I'm being honest and blunt but truthful. I do know however that the devs are working extremely hard to imrpove it. It's current issues are the feeling of clunkiness, lacking 'fluidness', it's damage, hit box connecting and slowness to react.\n\n3. Joining Servers is a pain in the ass sometimes. It can take you to random servers you didn't select for moving your mouse off or swiping it over the wrong area, Very common when submitting passwords.\n\n4. Naval Sailing is very sluggish and feels like you're combating the controls to go a direction.\n\n5. Little bit of a Toxic Community filled with politics and 'beef' between regiments and players. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nDon't lose all hopes because of my cons list - remember that this is an early access game. I know some of the cons can be too much to handle and disturbs the gameplay, but devs are very active in updating the game. Holdfast: Nations at War is almost the best FPS Musket Game, but some key issues need attention. The current state of the game is more than playable. Definitely worth purchasing.\n\nWell that's all I have to say about Holdfast.

The game itself is very loud and you cannot hear your teammates in game.

And the pieces you can play are of great quality too.\n\nVoice chat - has acceptable quality and adds to the atmosphere.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow on to the bad things:\n\nJust to say it, I do not mind factions or classes (like cavalry) missing at this early stage of development, however I do very much mind core mechanics of the game just lacking in quality.\n\nLet's face it, the melee and melee animations are horrible.
