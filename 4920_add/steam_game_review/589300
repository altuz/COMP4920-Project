Sadly, the latter goes unfulfilled.\n\nI am a big fan of games like Ittle Dew, Escape Goat and Mystery Castle, and hoped this would scratch the same itch. But what is here doesn't really even qualify as puzzles. It's not a puzzle if there's a switch on the ground, and a short, unobstructed distance away there's a statue you can push around. That is a tutorial-level introduction to the game's mechanics at best and busywork at worst. Unfortunately, that's more or less the level of puzzle challenges for the whole duration of the game. Which is about three hours. There were only one or two instances where I had to give any real thought to what I was doing, and even then similar cases are only entry-level puzzles in other games.\n\nOn the other side of the coin the game tries to be an action-adventure game in the vein something like Legend of Zelda, but it's unsatisfactory there as well. The combat is simple and the enemies aren't much of a threat.\n\nI also discovered some bugs and/or design problems. It's possible to skip small portions of some stages completely, and once I even got stuck when I managed to hook my way into a location from which I could no longer hook my way out of, since I hadn't opened a specific gate beforehand. I also came across a bug where I had just moved to another area in a level, so the camera followed me there, but then the camera swung back to the earlier area because it wanted to show how a timed gate there closed down again. The camera got stuck in that area, and I could no longer control the character, forcing me to restart the level. Luckily the levels are short (couple of minutes a piece) so it wasn't a huge loss of time.\n\nUnless you're buying the game for a child, I really can't recommend this, as there are considerably better options available for about the same price or even cheaper.", "recommendationid": "30242472", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488296639, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488294982, "num_reviews": 15, "steamid": "76561198000680704", "num_games_owned": 567, "playtime_forever": 175}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525743"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1487956542, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Great little game; about 3-5 hours of gameplay depending on how quickly your brain works 3 stages each with 15 levels.

I think PC is really better for this game than touchscreen.\n\nStory wise, you play as a girl who gets separated from her little brother when the Skyfish declares war on humanity.  You are accompanied by the Moon Whale and a small fairy like fish as you make your way to battle the Skyfish and rescue your little brother.  \n\nMechanic wise, I would add \u201cPuzzle\u201d to the genre listing for this game.  The gameplay is a mixture of adventure and light puzzle solving to get through each level without dying.\n\n[u]What I like about this game[/u]\n[list]\n[*]The puzzle element is challenging enough to get you thinking while not getting frustrating.  All of the gameplay elements and obstacles are clearly identifiable and displayed.  The game isn\u2019t trying to trick you as much as it's trying to teach you about its obstacles and make you think a little about how to get around them.  Overall it's very fun and satisfying when you make the \u201cah ha\u201d moment and learn the mechanics of new obstacles and enemies.\n[*]The theme, graphics, music and the sound design (sound design being the weakest of the four) is awesome.  It runs super smooth on PC and the resolution scales very nicely at 1440P.  The music, although mainly one song, blends light hearted, relaxing, and adventure tones really well.  It's the kind of music that fits the mood of the gameplay so well that you won\u2019t mind (and actually appreciate) that it's the same song throughout most of your gameplay.  Sound design is charming.  It sounds like one person made most of the sound effects in the game with his mouth.  It may sound cheap to some, but I found it funny and matched the game's overall aesthetics.\n[*]The gameplay is really fun.  Aside from moving your character, you can perform two actions.  The first is Swinging your fishing rod as a close combat attack.  The second is using your hook and reel to either \u201cjump\u201d across obstacles or draw enemies in closer.  Its really cool to see how much the developer has done with just these two moves, and it's really fun when you get good at the controls and try to complete the levels as fast as you can.\n[*]The story is simple but intriguing and helps build up the world you play in.  This is the type of story that really suits a casual indie game.  It give you that extra bit of curiosity and reason for grinding through the levels.\n[*]The controls are very intuitive on Keyboard/Mouse and Full controller support is a real plus. \n[/list]\n\n[u]What I don't like about this game[/u]\n[list]\n[*]The difficulty level is just a little low for my taste.  This game is a port from mobile devices and intended more for the very casual gamer to play once.  Passing the controller to/from a friend really helps the experience on PC.\n[*]This game would benefit from a \u201cSpeed Run\u201d mode.  When you get good at the controls it's truly cool to see your character zipping through the level.  Sadly, some incentive to go through the levels at a faster pace is missing from this game.  This would be an awesome addition.\n[*]The price is just a little bit too high for me at $7.99\n[/list]\n\n[u]Conclusions[/u]\nI had a ton of fun playing for the first 1.5 hours.  The game is a bit pricey at $7.99 on Steam; an indie game at that price point needs to give me another 8 or so hours (10 Hours total) of continued fun for me to say this is a good value.  Having said that, I believe I'll get that from this game and what the game does, it does very well.  I recommend this game becuase the attention to small details in this mobile to PC port pays off.", "recommendationid": "30385895", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488954683, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488636881, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198020403944", "num_games_owned": 153, "playtime_forever": 91}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 8, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_positive": 3}}
