Falling through floors and ceilings, floaty and horrible jump physics, and worst of all, the cannons and death \"animations\"\n\nI bought this game on sale for around $3 and it wasn't even worth that.  Until the devs fix this up, it certainly isn't worth any money.\n\nHopefully they make a sequel or something that's more refined and actually worth paying for and spending time on.", "recommendationid": "33918617", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501467357, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501467120, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198052247733", "num_games_owned": 181, "playtime_forever": 482}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527041"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 19, "total_reviews": 26, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_positive": 7}}
