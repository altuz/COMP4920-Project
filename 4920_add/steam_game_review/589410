There are several grammar issues (tough instead of though, poor wording in sentences, etc) that make me feel this wasn't originally made in English.\n\nHowever, the branching is neat...but it is the kind of game that almost NEEDS Achievements to really warrant trying to explore each and every branching path.\n\n+Cute little pixel game with easy mechanics\n+Good price point\n+Each level shows how many branching paths, so you aren't spending forever trying to figure out how many you have left\n+While poorly written at times (grammar) it's a neat little story that is playing out\n\n-Seems Short. I've played for only 15 minutes and not only have a feel for the game, but have unlocked about 10 levels and done all their subsequent branches to completion (save the ones moving the story forward)\n-The Grammar and word choice is really, really bad sometimes. Either ESL, or someone who didn't have a proofreader. It's not a full deal breaker for me, but it can be for others\n-No Achievements. While I know this may not matter to some, for the type of game this is, they would almost enhance it ten-fold; a reason to go back and find the branches, which may not be all that interesting on their own.\n-Repetitive. You have to go back to the levels and replay them, but there's no way to skip past text so it can be a bit of a slough.\n\nTLDR: Decent game, good price, not the best grammar.", "recommendationid": "30041055", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487527750, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487662255, "num_reviews": 78, "steamid": "76561198003479630", "num_games_owned": 2157, "playtime_forever": 85}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518202"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1488310698, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is an odd duck. It is cute, fun, simple, and reminds me of an 8-bit rendering of text adventures. Which I suppose is what it is. It is a bit clunky both in English translation and mechanics, but it is fun and worth .99. It does smack of a rushed release and enthusiatic devs with minimal game planning experience. But hey, it was less than $1 and it was cute as a button. I think the music is what kept me playing. Like old-timey text adventures the way to unlock different endings is sometimes not at all obvious. Frustratingly so. But, it seems to work meaning you can unlock the various endings if you can figure out what the heck you're supposed to do next. \n\nI want to give it a sideways thumb.
