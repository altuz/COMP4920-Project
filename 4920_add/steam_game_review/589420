Looks so simple yet gets difficult later on. You're always moving the moment you press a button. It is possible to find a spot to park on some levels, but since you'll still be using battery can't stop for long either.\n\nControls are simple: arrow keys or WASD along with any other controls you'll get as you play further.\n\nThe music that plays keeps the game fun for me. They're not annoying loops or generic music, instead feel made for the game and helps it grasp your attention while mowing the lawn while avoiding grass monsters. I find myself dancing to the beat of the music too!\n\nMy only complaints are that on some levels it's hard to tell where you are horitzontally, the recharge might spawn across the entire level and have to waste time to go, find, and maneuver to it, and the game is only in full screen.\n\n-----\n\nCheck out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/BPUGL]BluePaw's Underrated Games List[/url]\nJoin and/or follow if you wish.", "recommendationid": "32846854", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498552299, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498802145, "num_reviews": 147, "steamid": "76561198020839656", "num_games_owned": 220, "playtime_forever": 914}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552872"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 23, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1497449162, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Not really pleasant to play after the first levels because you die a lot and each death means restarting the level and the levels are long.
