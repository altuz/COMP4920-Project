Characters have their own life, and aren't your typical run-of-the mill VN sort. But perhaps what I love most about this game is the strong female protagonist who can stand her ground no matter the situation.\n\nPros:\n- Compelling story\n- Amazing artwork\n- Sound design\n- Believeable Characters (and fun too. I <3 me some Biddy)\n- Refreshing setting\n\nCons:\n- A bit on the shorter side. About 3 hours for one playthrough.\n- Limited replayability. Only three endings.\n\n\nOverall, I recommend this for people who enjoy well-written stories with a strong protagonist and beautiful artwork. Worth the money hands down.\n", "recommendationid": "31269741", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492756161, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492755318, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198047161451", "num_games_owned": 371, "playtime_forever": 193}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549490"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 17, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492811422, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "First of all: the directing is excellent, and for me it's the standout quality of this VN. Heavy use of 3D camera work and animations make the game feel dynamic and alive in a way VNs usually don't. Every shot is constructed with cinematic intent, which also gives the game visual variety and great mileage out of its art assets. There are some parts in the middle that are less polished than the beginning and the end, but overall I think the effort put into the presentation makes it worth its price point even if it's fairly short for a VN (took me around three hours to complete it).\n\nThe story itself is enjoyable. The beginning is slow, but once it hits its stride about 1/3 of the way in, it picks up a lot. The plot is well paced with strong progression of developments and a good balance of action and investigation. My biggest complaint is that I found the prose writing very overwrought in places, but the dialogue is quite good, and all the characters are distinct and well written with interesting backstories and motivations. Some of the themes are heavy-handed, but overall it's an entertaining story that effectively carries your interest to its conclusion. If you're looking for romance, there are hints of it here, but only hints.\n\nSound design and music do an effective job of setting the atmosphere without being intrusive, and some of the tracks are pretty catchy, although the majority of them are fairly forgettable. The art overall is strong as well, although I think the anime proportions + realistic shading looks kinda strange on some of the characters' faces.\n\nOverall, this is easily one of the best English VNs I've played. The good story paired with the great directing makes for a tense monster-hunting action romp, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes VNs, westerns, or supernatural action stories. The main caveat is that it's a little shorter than some people expect VNs to be, but I personally prefer short games and don't find that to be a problem.", "recommendationid": "31283987", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492836467, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492835356, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198050684884", "num_games_owned": 87, "playtime_forever": 180}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533360"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 14, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1497150759, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The game has choices, true, but sadly except of the occasional alteration of the text they are 100% meaningless. What I could perhaps even forgive if only the game wouldn't make the impression of a decent detective story where the player's job is to identify the culprit from the clues he gets. Alas, I even managed to do so correctly but the game never asked for my opinion and the protagonist made the 'wrong choice' anyway. At this point I pretty much lost the interest and quick-clicked through the rest, confirming myself I indeed didn't miss anything. The only choice which actually matters is the one at the very end offering the usual most boring binary choice between two endings, ignoring everything what happened before. Disappointing to the core, unless you like basically 'kinetic novels' and want to just read a (mediocre) book with pictures on a PC. There is also no alteration of the character based on the choices and whether you act as a bully or a cunning detective, your behavior is hard-coded thruout the whole game save for those 1-2 sentences following each of such choices.", "recommendationid": "32332943", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1497150956, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497191054, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198019964935", "num_games_owned": 149, "playtime_forever": 254}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533225"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 10, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1492907885, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Shout-out for Bionic Penguin. I recommend this one and suprised more folks haven't reviewed it yet.\n\nThis has to be one of the best English VN-releases so far this year. If anything, get it to support a developer who has a lot of potential for even more great future projects. I sincerely hope they continue producing good work. \n\nPositives:\n+ Strong woman lead\n+ strong special effects-- from the little things like gun shots, to moving the camera for a more cinematic feel.\n+ good music main theme\n+ Nice backgrounds\n+ well-done art\n+ Great location/ world building\n+ Pretty good story/plot  ( even though its short)   Think action plus mystery\n\nNeutral \n* No romance  (but that's okay with me)\n* many moments without music, but did have atmosphere sounds \n* No voice overs  (again, that's fine with me.  Voice overs aren't mandatory for the visual novel genre). \n\nNegatives\n- was shorter  (but I don't mind shorter vns) \n\n\nWhat I appreciated was that despite the moving effects, the movement stopped mostly when it was time to read. It is a pet-peeve of mine when backgrounds/characters are heavily moving when you are supposed to be reading.

Our protagonist is freshly solo and eager to prove her competence, riding into town to solve a crime. By your choice, she can be warm and trusting - the better to coax information from soft hearts - or tough and professional, more convincing to those who respect a show of force. This is her first independent mission as a Falconer, and it's a doozy.\n\n[i]The Falconers: Moonlight[/i] showcases both lovely artwork and tasteful use of animation, embellishing what is a solidly compact, suspenseful story. It took me roughly 3 hours (with skipping) to see all 3 endings and get the achievements, so it's worth being thorough and exploring all the options.\n\nAs for world building, the game provides just enough detail to immerse the reader - considering its brevity, there's not room to go overboard with superfluous descriptions. Overall it felt an appropriate amount for the length, though I found myself wanting to learn more about the Falconers and their trade secrets (Farlan's remedy, anyone?), as well as their targets, the Cullers. The unconventional setting and the characters were all interesting enough to merit revisting, perhaps in another game.\n\nAll in all, I'd say it's definitely worth the money. Well-told and nicely illustrated, with solid fleshed-out characters.
