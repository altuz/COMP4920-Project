I'm gonna come right out and say this: Perhaps this isn't worth buying if you've already bought the game before, which, all things considered, is incredibly likely. It could be if you're interested in the new routes, but prepare to spend an incredibly short amount of time alone with whoever it is you're targeting as this is only the first half of the game, ending right at the route split. I don't think this is clarified anywhere and I was totally baffled by the \"mixed\" score when I first blindly bought this because I rush into things like an idiot and was focused entirely on SANAN ROUTE, but now I know! This is some MGS: Ground Zeroes shit right here, my dude. I'm still going to recommend this as it goes down way smoother than the original, but be warned that. Like. The rest of the story is very obviously missing. It ends abruptly right before things are getting interesting. EXTREMELY abruptly.\n\nIf you want the short version of my review, it's this: \"Okay, cool! Nice. Where's the rest of it?\"\n\nNow for the long.\n\nMy memory is trash so please forgive me if my comparisons aren't right on the money, but I'm going to hold this up against my blearly, fragmented snapshots of my first encounter with this game.\n\nFirstly, it's visually stunning at any resolution and the new soundtrack is great. (I particularly had a problem with the old title theme because it was the absolute most generic jidai-geki instrumental theme you could imagine. It makes sense, but gave me flashbacks to my grandma hogging our TV to watch samurai dramas.) It's slick and easier to listen to. I do have a problem with it, but this has more to do with audio mixing which I'll get to later.\n\nGraphically, as I said, it's beautiful. The lip flaps can be distracting (and look a little off to me) but it's forgivable. The new text box is fantastic, the menus are fantastic, and if I had any complaint about them it'd be that the \"warrior record\" has such an insane amount of negative space that it's a little difficult to figure out what it even is at first glance. I get that the blossoming cherry-blossom tree in the background is an affection meter and can applaud the creativity, but... I feel like it could have been executed a little better.\n\nThe text seems like it's been heavily streamlined. The first time I played this game I had to stop every so often because it felt [i]incredibly[/i] dense for a VN, but this feels far lighter. It's still heavy on history, but there really is no way to take that out of the story. If you've already played you know what to expect. If you're a new player, to put it shortly, \"you gon' learn.\" Literally. This could be a huge problem if you're mainly looking for fluff. Hakuoki is already notoriously light on fluffy moments--which are increased here--but this is still mainly a historical fantasy.\n\nI'm going to be an oddball here and say that I like the new routes better than the original ones. I loved the original, but I wasn't really interested in any of the guys... except for inaccessable Sanan. Which is why I bought this to begin with! His focus here has just the right amount of cold, subdued menace I was expecting. Sanan, out of all of the new suitors, has the least amount of fluff which is interesting considering the global fluff increase this game underwent. (This is great for me, but if you're wanting to go in and melt Sanan's bitter heart then. Well... Sorry.)  Iba is your typical smiley caring childhood friend type who would never hurt a fly. IMO, the most interesting part of his route was the presence of Kanryusai Takeda, who is a shamelessly messy bitch who lives for drama. He's so monumentally jealous and scheming that it accidentally made him charming in my eyes. Souma is your very own kouhai who SCREAMS CONSTANTLY and was pretty forgettable to me aside from that. He's cute and REALLY LOUD, but... that's really it. The strongest of the new routes for me was Ryouma Sakamoto's, he's really fun and a welcome departure from all the heavy \"HONOR\" stuff constantly happening, so I went ahead and played his route again instead of finishing Yamazaki's so I could form an appropriate opinion on it. (Uh...)\n\nAnyhow: Now for my biggest problem with this game aside from the second half being conspicuously missing. THE AUDIO MIXING. The mixing is all over the place, usually the voices in a VN are normalized, but here they're... not. They are OBVIOUSLY not. Shinpachi in particular is so incredibly, ear-bleedingly loud for no reason that I had to turn his voice down a whole lot and he was STILL loud. Other voices, like Iba's and Kazama's, are very soft, so they have to be turned all the way up. But when they raise their voices, it's still too much! (Souma in particular is a ride from hell since he has both of these problems bad: Being very soft and very loud at the same time. His shouts in particular are so loud that they have obvious artifacting. It's... not great.) The music was drowning out a lot of the softer voices, so I turned it down as far as I could while still hearing it, but it was still too loud. I turned it down a little more then it was nearly inaudible! I spent a huge amount of time fiddling with the mixing of various voices, sound effects, and the music. I got to near comfortable levels with the voices and effects, but the music is just doomed to being a faint whisper. I can't get it to play at a reasonable volume. \n\nAll in all: If you're new to Hakuoki, don't want to buy a vita and don't mind waiting indefinitely for the second part to be localized, knock yourself out. This is a great rerelease in spite of all of its issues, but you definitely need to take them into account and carefully decide whether or not you're okay with them.

Though I watched the anime version a long time ago so I already have the idea. So far I have played 3 routes ( Hijikata, Kazama and Nagakura ) so I know now how the story goes. I suggetst you choose your FIRST ROUTE carefully cause thats the only time you get the feeling of playing the route for the first time, because some scenes are the same so choose your most favorite guy as your first route. ( btw, Hijikata is not my fave, I regret it so am telling you now. ) As for the time play, yes I think its an 80-hour game IF you play the game the same way in every route, but no ones gonna play the same scenes for 12 times so ofcourse you just have to skip it, and that will decrease the timeplay. So thats the reason why others are saying this is not an 80-hour game. I will not give my full review of this game cause this is just the first half of Hakuoki, so the things I think what this game is lacking, am not gonna try to find it for now, I'll wait for the other half version of this game.\nAnd I think its unfair for this amazing work to have \"mixed\" reviews, cause this is a masterpiece, so if its your first time playing Hakuoki please don't hesitate on buying this just because of the reviews, but as I and others have said, its only the first half of the game so for me knowing that before playing will avoid the \" so.. thats it? \" kind of feeling.\nThis is my review for now I'll edit this after playing the whole game.
