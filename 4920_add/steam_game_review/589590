The animation is good and acts as a kind of good juxtaposition to the tone that the game has. At times it was a little bit frustrating trying to work out exactly what needed to be done but overall I did enjoy the element to it. It's a game to be enjoyed as something rather quirky and different because you don't expect kids (and the staff) to be acting the way that they do. The story isn't really anything major but luckily that isn't a game that depends heavily on its story to sell it. Instead it's the diffferent zany personalities of the characters that makes it so interesting to play through (and who doesn't love watching them all die in different ways haha). \nBut yeah it's a good definitely especially considering that it costs less than \u00a35", "recommendationid": "34875852", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505099879, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503419475, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198169233394", "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 356}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501669"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505566469, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "i really enjoyed this game and was very satisfied with the ending, i am also hoping that what nugget said at the end is true 10/10 would recommend", "recommendationid": "34996238", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505566469, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496687203, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198323647769", "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_forever": 971}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506756134, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "*You'll probably like this game if you have a good sense of humor and don't care about much else*\n*My sense of humor is awful though so yeah*\n\nSO, this bitch named Cindy!\n\nShe was the first person who I wanted to talk to and try to complete the quest. I mean who wouldn't want to date the cute slutty kindergartner? And on the hint section it said that I didn't need any special items or anything to complete her missions. So I was like sweet! Go for it!\n\nSo I managed to do everything to the best of my knowledge. I was able to do her damn playhouse stuff and follow her dang plans, and I managed to do the super cool rat out the janitor thing for killing her dog and she straight up murders the dude. I think that's the morally better thing to do because the other option involves pouring blood over the depressed chick and her killing herself and the nugget kid killing himself too, but if she kills the janitor then she's all bloody and nasty and I'm afraid if I complete the quest that way she'll make out with me with blood face and I don't want that.\n\nBUT I DIDN'T COMPLETE THE QUEST\n\nTHAT DUMB FAT KID KEEPS BEATING THE SHIT OUT OF ME DURING SHOW AND TELL WTF\n\nSo I was like fine, I gotta find a way to get rid of dumb fat kid.
