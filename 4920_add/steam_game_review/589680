Instead, it rarely happened and I felt challenged because of the game mechanics simplicity, yet it was difficult. \n\nIt took me some time to understand various mechanics, but all the mechanics I've met, I've understood so far in my short playthrough here. \n\nThe concept definitely has promise and was a lot more interesting than I initially thought. It's a very different VR game from the standing still shooters, various point and click adventures, sports games etc. But I really liked the difference!\n\nI'll be heading back to see if it's possible to gain that top 10 spot. - Of course global leaderboards provides an extra incentive to getting higher scores. ;)", "recommendationid": "31291756", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492849119, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492962435, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198006437454", "num_games_owned": 590, "playtime_forever": 40}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503083"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1493662196, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Best VR game EU 10/10", "recommendationid": "31492183", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1493662214, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493662204, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198011106723", "num_games_owned": 159, "playtime_forever": 25}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495213"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
