I still don\u2019t understand why Brave Giant (the developer team) insists on keep making sequels for Queen\u2019s Quest if it\u2019s all about alchemists now trying to save the world. Oh well. \n\nThe story is clich\u00e9. Very, very clich\u00e9. The HO/puzzles are way too simple, and everything is so predictable that it can become annoying to the player (at least it happened to me). The art style is gorgeous tho, I think it\u2019s maybe the only good point here. But the art itself isn\u2019t enough to make this game fun.\n\n3/10.

The third instalment, The End of Dawn not only lacks any kind of royalty, but even the second game\u2019s fairy tale detective premise was dropped to replace it with a generic formula: we play as a young alchemy student, who finds out that she plays a central role in a prophecy about an evil dragon.\n\nThis plot feels thin from the start, and this is just the first warning sign of the many issues. The story is bland. The voice actors were so bored out of their minds that they did not even try. The animations, especially the facial ones, are terrifyingly horrendous. The hidden object scenes are full of similar-looking tiny objects, making them tiresome and tedious.\nThe list could go on, but I think the point is clear: Queen\u2019s Quest 3 is simply not a good hidden object game.
