A story driven sea and pirates game. \nWITHOUT the usual survival mechanics. \nThere is a health bar you can refill with food. And that's it. No hunger, no thirst no heat or cold... I like that.  And with that, there aren't much alternative games.\n\nGraphics are ok, not more. Sound as well. \nSo are the controls, except swimming feels weird.\n\nSo while looking a bit like stranded deep, it's quite different. While that feels kinda similar at first and looks a bit better i think,Stranded Deep is (just) the usual procedural Survival/Crafting blueprint. \n\n\nIt's not early access, it's a  full game. \nIt's still fixed and extended by active devs so that's a plus. And problems are reliably fixed. As were my issues with the game. They patched a game breaking UI (in 21:9) bug within 1 day. Probably my first personal patch It works now ( as far as i am into it) ok in 21:9. There is something below the horizon in the main menu but nothing vital it seems.\n\nIt's the same asking price as Subnautica, Empyrion, Rebel Galaxy and others. But i think it's rather unique and worth a go.", "recommendationid": "35010659", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505820645, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "5", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505819398, "num_reviews": 60, "steamid": "76561198041863115", "num_games_owned": 650, "playtime_forever": 149}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1504737959, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "20fps with 960.\nI can wait for bugfixes and better performance patches, but the game now isn't good.", "recommendationid": "34784482", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504737959, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1506639418, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561198023663345", "num_games_owned": 170, "playtime_forever": 255}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503834"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 7, "total_reviews": 14, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 7}}
