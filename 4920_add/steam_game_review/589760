It's fun, runs great and the car building keeps me comming back.\n\nThis game could be perfect if...\n\n1. The controls were tweaked a bit.  The cars handel like slippery turds.  Building the cars is fun.  Racing them is a pain in the ass.\n\n2. I wish there were more cars in the game.  The seven cars in the game are cool, I just wish there were more to buy and hack into racing machines. More cars.  More Parts.\n\nTHE GAME WOULD BE GREAT WITH SOME HOT KEYS.  F for fix, S for sell when you click on a spesific part.  Would make the game 100% easier to play.\n\nThe game isn't bad by any means.  I really enjoy playing Revhead.  I would recomend the game to anyone who likes indepth car building and mechanics in video games.", "recommendationid": "34941578", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506157510, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 132, "last_played": 1506856092, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198126358720", "num_games_owned": 83, "playtime_forever": 637}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505370"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1504912643, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The Mechanic part is great, but would be good to see how much you spent on the car with fixing and new parts to see if it is still profitable or not.  \n\nThe racing piece, well that's something where even Street Rod on C64 was better, guys  fix the car controling behaviour since it doesn't matter if you use a Keyboard or a Joystick or whatever analogue controller it's just terrible and this is killing the 50% of the game completely.", "recommendationid": "34825058", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504912643, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504912390, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198160036613", "num_games_owned": 57, "playtime_forever": 178}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500428"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1505078897, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "i want to PRAISE this game because its amazing, but lets get one thing clear:\n\n\nYou will be HARD PRESSED to find a game that controls worse a car, even with a keyboard.\n\nBeamNG has better keyboard controls.
