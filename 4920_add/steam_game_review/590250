You have to touch the top of the track pad and then swing your arms to move. Might not sound so bad, however, shooting and moving are out of the question and it feels like you are ice skating.

Well, it is alpha. Not worth any money at all right now. It is fast paced and intense in a sense but the arm swing sliding around motion will make a lot of people sick and it is not intuative enough to be what I call comfortable locomotion in any sense. You feel like you have no sense of being able to steer well. There are no sound options, very few graphic options, weapon switching is non-existing. I like my gun in my right hand and the saber in my left. Switching the MCs is not how I am suppose to do that. The Ai is stupid and the enemies are just piled up in groups and lines shooting at you so it is dumb like that. The flashes blind you, getting hurt blinds you to the point you can't see to shoot so you might as well be dead. I hate to give this a negative but it really is not worth any money right now. EA is not for kickstarting. Indie devs have to start saving money before making games and putting out something worth playing when EA starts. I can't except junk anymore or skeletal games. Wait to get this after they add A LOT more to it.
