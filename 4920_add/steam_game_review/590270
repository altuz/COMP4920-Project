It seems like the game is trying to be tongue-in-cheek, cheesy anime style, even attempting poorly to be a Metroidvania - and it is just bad.\n\nThe game has a map and you explore, moving to different screens, much like Metroidvania. You fight some enemies, grab some collectibles, and unlock abilities - and with new abilities, you can go back to older areas and access new places. Again, like Metroidvania.\n\nBut the game falls flat on its face. While the graphics and sound are trying well to be retro, everything else is bad. The biggest flaw is easily how bad of a Metroidvania game it tries to be. I had only been to about 15-20 screens in the game so far, but I had unlocked 2 abilities already. And out of those 15-20 screens, I'd say more than half of them had places where you needed to use 1 of those 2 abilities to leave somewhere else. And I had already seen other objects in them that looked like they needed a 3rd ability.\n\nSo the game has way more backtracking than any other style of this game and it is not even done well. It is annoying to be forced to run through a bunch of rooms in a row using the same abilities, instead of actually exploring and finding things out.\n\nNow, right away, I figured a controller were be more useful, but you cannot change the controls! Further, for an Xbox controller, they put Jump at B and Attack at A. Since when is that ever normal? It makes you move your thumb way more than if they had Jump at A and Attack at X, which is what 99.9% of games do. It's almost like they would've put Jump at Y and Attack at A on a SNES controller. This may sound nitpicky but it is really bad to play in that layout.\n\nThen the controls themselves are not very good. For jumping, the game seems to be awkward in that it sometimes registers sensitivity of the jump button, and sometimes doesn't. Even worse is when you jump up through a room into another, where half of the time the game assumes you're not actually jumping, and it leaves you at the bottom edge of the next screen, causing you to fall back down immediately. I had this happen easily over 10 times in less than 1 hour, which really annoyed me.\n\nAnd in many rooms, you do not even have to get to the edge of the screen before the game assumes you are leaving. I had multiple times where I was more than 20% of my monitor screen away from the screen's edge, and the game just went \"We will now load the next room!\"\n\nFor attacking, the game tries to make you be \"perfect\" just so it can be \"difficult\" (better word: painful). I encountered 3 weapons so far. The bomb is the easiest but does not hit everything because it only rolls on the ground. The other 2 weapons are melee - boxing gloves and a sword. Both of the melee weapons essentially require you to be almost 1 or 2 pixels away from the enemy, essentially right next to them, before the weapons land hits. And forcing you so close means you yourself are easily hit by the enemy and lose 1/3 of your health.\n\nI already fought 2 mini-bosses, and both of them moved back and forth, running away from me and running back at me, to make those bad melee controls even worse. You have to chase after them to hit them, and half of the time, they slow down when you get close, forcing you to run into them as you are already trying to get close enough for the attack.\n\nThere are other details about the game, but it is just not worth any more time.", "recommendationid": "34185555", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1502523376, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502521413, "num_reviews": 127, "steamid": "76561198104392527", "num_games_owned": 330, "playtime_forever": 52}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504374"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
