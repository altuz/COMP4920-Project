It's kind of a standard top down shooter. Except where you'd normally have something like a space ship or a tank, you have a cockroach with a laser strapped to it.  The laser can be upgraded using your score - which resets each level. The upgrades are also only temporary.  \n\nThe overall gameplay is pretty basic - shoot everything you can.  Utilize the binoculars to help see enemies further out that may kill you quickly if you come upon them too quickly.  Find a few healthpacks here and there if necessary.  And don't fall off stuff - you'll die.  However, I will say it at least runs relatively smoothly.  It's not the prettiest game but it's quick and everything seems pretty snappy to me. Be warned that if you move your crosshairs to the edge of the screen (in fullscreen), your mouse may go off screen and you'll lose control of the crosshairs.  Simply moving your mouse back in screen will fix this - but it's still a minor annoyance.  \n\nWhile the game isn't necessarily bad, has it's quirks such as the mouse issue or overly loud music (or option of completely muting everything), it's still just too much for me.  This game feels more like something worth a dollar or two, if that. Not seven.  \n\nI did record a bit of it - it plays just like advertised at least! - https://youtu.be/WjJopg46Sc8", "recommendationid": "30695775", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1490316584, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490315274, "num_reviews": 42, "steamid": "76561198025227359", "num_games_owned": 169, "playtime_forever": 17}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516235"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 0}}
