A World Builder. It's still buggy at the moment though. The controls are not easy to use and my computer system keeps on crashing using it at this time -  GTX 980, 6700mhz processor, 32gb RAM. I'm using the latest Nvidia 378.92 drivers. Also tried it with previous drivers and it still crashes at seemingly random times.\n\nI could not actually get the tutorial to work. There were some instructions from the floating robot at the beginning however when the world started to begin creation there were no instructions on how to proceed. Could not figure out how to make myself huge by holding down the trigger buttons and swipe outwards. I saw that the field of view was reduced doing this but nothing changed in the world view.\n\nI decided to just play around with it at this point. Still could not figure out how to spawn things so I just kept on clicking in the menu and found I could actually rez objects without actually knowing how they rezzed. Seems like at the moment you need to keep on clicking and hold down for it to work. I still can't figure it out at the moment regarding the controls. Looks very similar to Tilt Brush and how they have done it. If it can work like Tilt Brush this will be a winner.\n\nI managed to rez a building, grass, water, some trees, change the sky environment, add some rain, then an old boat and I was really happy at this point then it crashed. I needed to restart Steam and all the stuff I was adding was gone. I was very sad at this point. I know it's only about 30 mins of work but I created it and and it was lost forever.\n\nThis is truly an excellent idea for anyone to create worlds within their own imagination. OMG I'm going back to \"Second Life\" where the ability to do this started and this looks like the perfect solution in VR.\n\nMaking it easy for anyone without technical skills opens up a whole new dimension. \n\nI'm not sure on the engine used, images in world have that outer outline causing a strobing, flashing effect outlining objects in scene.\n\nIt is definitely  a cool new project and with it's bugs during testing I'm still giving this 10/10 for imagination.\n\n", "recommendationid": "30644602", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1490058671, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500161966, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198201890795", "num_games_owned": 19, "playtime_forever": 158}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513320"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1491108818, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "If you watch the video and are expecting the gameplay to be the same you will be disappointed.

World Builder is perfect for those that have a scene or setting in mind. Like me, maybe you have a fantasy world in mind that you want to experience in VR.

Great and helpful tutorial; mostly intuitive controls. Lots of fun to instantaly morph the landscape. And I loved the light/weather stuff, tons of . Really awesome possibilities.  Negatives- biggest one for me is the lack of a scale indicator. There needs to be a constant reference to scale. As it is now, houses will be huuuuge, like comically big, compared to some trees I spawned earlier. That's not intuitive and right now makes creating scenes too clumsy and frustrating to fuss with, but I assumet that will be soon corrected. And somebody with more patience could probably make it work as it is now.  A bit too much use of the grip buttons, but that's a very subjective thing..
