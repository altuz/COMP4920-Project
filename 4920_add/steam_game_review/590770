There are no bots available to face off against if you don't happen to have a 2nd (3rd, or 4th.. it supports up to 4 players local) controller or someone around to play, and there is also no online mode. I still enjoyed what I experienced of the game, but that just consisted of floating around in an empty room by myself and enjoying the visuals and the soundtrack, which features some really good tunes. It's unfortunate there weren't some bots to just goof off with, as I bet the game can have a fun pace as you speed boost and jump along the geometric terrain, however at 5 bucks this is quite a steep price for a local multiplayer only game, as those people who will have numerous people around to play and enjoy such a niche title is probably pretty slim. I look at the game more as having purchased an EP / track sampler of funky disco/electronic/dance tracks with a visualizer to go along with them, and I still find the experience enjoyable, however, I can't recommend the game as-is beyond if you're just seeking to hear some good music.", "recommendationid": "32714402", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1498287435, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500517663, "num_reviews": 148, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "num_games_owned": 798, "playtime_forever": 26}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495495"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 0}}
