However once I loaded up the game I started to really enjoy it. The game is early access so we must keep that in mind when writing a review. I would say that the game has alot of potential. The graphics look good, you can pick from a few different charecters that each have a specific weapon. Handguns, MiniGun, Sniper rifle are just to name a few. I would say the downfall is I havent really seen anyone hosting any matches so you should beware right now if you do not want to play single player or in co op mode with your friends then I would hold off. If you are fine with single player/co op then this is a game for you.\n\nI do have one complaint and it rather small compared to issues I have seen with other games. When the crazy bunny demons come runing out it never fails that at least one gets just on a crate or on a wall. When this happens you generally just have to go hunt it down to finish....
