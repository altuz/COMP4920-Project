(build 1.30)\nheres my feedback so far (other than being totally adicted!\nI have recommended this game to a number of my friends (which i normally dont do)\nI work out my value for money type of game to be if: game cost/hours played = less than $1 per hour this game is amazing. and it has already exceded that expectation\n\nim really excited to see what the future holds for this game and what updates and DLC/Mod packs become available for this game.\n\nthings i love:\n- the management of the production to make it profitable is difficult ( but not too difficult)\n- the interface for placing parts of the production line is in order of how they need to be placed and you can collapse sub menuse to make it easier to find  what you are after\n- each section of the production proccess is colour coded when you zoom out so you can easily identify the different  sections\n- runs surprisingly well on even older systems and laptops\n- mod what kind of things go into each car\n- needs of the customers and what is considered common or rare change througout the dame with \"competitors\" constantly upgrading their wares as well\n- very quick to pick up game play ( small learning curve) with easy to use interfacesz that are very responsive\ncharts and graphs to help you visualise how your company is going\n- save games load super quickly!\n\nthings i would love to be added in the future:\n- more lines of production.. like different things... eg motorbikes, race cars/trackcars, transport vehicles like buses and trains.. maybe even planes with a huge map? could even do other industries.. eg like modular homes, or furnatures or electronics like computers, tablets and  phones... \n- the abilitythat when yo u place a new production station that you can choose to upgrade it before placing it ( auto maxed out to what you have researched ) or the option to click/drag to select and upgrade in bulk\n- the ability to pre plan a layout ( like a ghost copy) so you can plan your production line for when you expand  and then have the option to install piece by piece or lump sum payment to place it all at once\n- have a storage section for when yuou remove devices instead of binning the station.. i have moved mine arround alot since start of game and maybe a lesser fee to \"store\" the production station instead would be great.\n- have a re-arrange mode where you have the game basicallly paused and can move everything arround without it ccosting.. maybe like a blue print... if you like the change it would come up with the movment price and charge according... but if it didnt work out the way you planned you could scrap the idea and it wouldnt cost you anything.  \n- assign a difficulty level to each of trhe premade starting maps based on how hard it would be to get up and running - this way new users dont get frustrated if they start off on something super hard\n- make the tuturial a speerate senario based play through game which is optional but shows the application of all the different things you can do in the game\n-  mode where you can specifically delete just the overhead distribution lines instead of having to delete all underneith them first\n- a way to click and drag or select multiple things to delete  at once\n- a way to repair/fix/discount cars that went through production with missing parts (why didnt the quality check pick this up and do somthing?) \n- to have this windowed/moveable between screens much easier would be nice.. and to have the ability to have it running while you are in another window. ( im often setting out my Tafe assignments while playing games) and it is a little annoying that everytime i click out of my game window that it pauses the game\n\nMy issues....\n- sometimes if i go to save it crashes instead.. \n(does not happen if you create a new save file... only when you try to overwrite another one)\n- being unable to delete save files that have been copied from another computer \n(they wont delete from in the interface even though they do show up) \n\nthis game works great on my computer (which i think is in dire neeed of upgrade) \nMy comp:\n- windows 10 pro\n- intel i7 3.40GHZZ\n- 8gb ram\n- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650\n", "recommendationid": "34772664", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1504692287, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1506830453, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198141001364", "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_forever": 2082}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502370"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506343304, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "After having a lot of fun with the Car Mechanic Simulator games I always wondered why there was no strategy game where you have to build up cars on an assembly line from scratch and well I know I may be a bit late but yup this is it!
