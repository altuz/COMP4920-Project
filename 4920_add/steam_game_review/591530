First off: do I like this game? Yes. Will I recommend this game? As a game? Yes. As an investment? No. Wait for the game to become F2P as it's hard to actually play with people currently.\n\nI've been waiting for this game to be localized for quite some time and pulled out of closed beta, and learn of the whole censorship thing. \n\nRegardless I buy the game. I'm not gonna spout the same wall of text about the art changes because, yeah, by principle it's pretty bonkers to do it and pThat alone's a pretty big red flag but whatever, I still felt like playing.\n\nAs for actual gameplay: it's fast, frantic, and pretty fun. It aesthetically and technically feels as hype as its name suggests, at least at first impression. Playing Sapitelbub feels like playing Elsword with 1000% more MOBA and 203.7% less P2W grind, but apparently melee assassins aren't meta.\n\nThough, I wouldn't know that because this game caps out at like 150 or so people a day as of right now. Finding an actual PvP game is either a test of patience or nigh impossible. \n\nI understand that this game is under the usual post-beta Founder deal, but usually inherently F2P games release ***as*** F2P and include founder separately for those who choose to pay early, instead of closing the game off to only founders. \n\nYou're trying to increase your playerbase early right? You're trying to maximize feedback now that you're out of beta and can start significantly catching up with the korean version, right? Causing a controversy and having a confirmed-to-be free product hidden behind a paywall shatters early hopes for the community size. I checked the forums; the exclusive group of pre-launch users are leaving too, and they take pretty nicely to the fact that apparently this followed up immediately after beta, with little to no recognition of those that came before it. Nice.***\n\nI CANNOT form a final opinion of this game as of yet as there's legitmiately not enough people ingame at a time to allow me to do so. Makes me tempted to just go get PUBG or something in the meantime but I'm pretty sure I'd be banned for stream sniping some irrelevant person I've never heard of before this game gets a population. \n\nWhat needs to happen ASAP:\n-This game HAS to release S T A T if you want a community to grow. You made a long term, controversial decision that has had very immediate effects on the potential of this game to grow. Unless you open this game up for everyone to at least try, it will not get much better. Let me restate: ONE-HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLAYERS AT A TIME. \"We're aware of this.\" I know you are. It needs to be addressed quickly. You can maintain the founders' pack as an optional thing, but you NEED players or the few you have risk getting sick of it.\n\n-I WOULD say do something about the censorship but it's apparently a permanent \"said and done\" sweeping change, so there's literally nothing we could do about it. So I hope you've assessed the consequences of that thoroughly and have other plans, if not going F2P before I finish this wall of text, to increase the currently incredibly limited population.\n\nDespite the extremely questionable decisions so far, and being under Nexon, I really want this *game* to do well.\n\n***EDIT: A bit of research shows that Alpha/Beta testers transitioned and got Founders' status for free. My bad on not reading up for that better. As I've said, I don't have a verdict, yet, and I really want this to work out. Realizing the mistake on my end lightens my mood quite a bit, but it'll take a while for the whole censorship taste to get out of my mouth. I'm personally staying to see things through as an optimist, but currently, I will not tell you to get this game. ( But I won't stop you if you want it. )\n\n>>>EDIT2:It pains me to say but I actually feel as though this game is in severe danger of dying. Let me change my last opinion in the review: Do not buy it. I am explicitly stopping you here.  \n\nSudden Attack, Ghost in the Shell, and Dirty Bomb/Extraction all were under Nexon at one point and were either killed, or shifted to a different publisher (Dirty Bomb lives on!) The common thread was that the games didn't see that much play. And in the case of HU, we're seeing 25-40 people on average at a time, capping out at 100.\n\nThat's a terrible population number. You'd think the peak 100 people that play this game would have more of a direct, immediate influence on it, and yet the first course of action was brought about by people who ***AREN'T*** a part of that exclusive group. \n\nRegardless of how slight the censorship was, thinking back on that alone means that they did indeed exclude their own audience from early on, amplifying all of the potential factors that can lead to an early death for this game.\n\nLook, I want to be optimistic, too (and was). This is a fun game when I find people, and the aesthetic is nice. However, realistically, this has been a series of unfortunate events that will likely continue. Be realistic, too.\n\nIf this game gets the lucky end of the stick and gets taken under someone else's wing, then I'll be all for it again. If, miraculously, the marketing and community management for this game, under current circumstances, increases significantly, I'll also be in there. However, the factors are too much to ignore right now. I'm making what I feel is the safest decision now in this scenario.\n\nI've requested a refund.

If you post or give any opinion on the game that is less than favorable they'll either delete your comment or ban you off discord lmao.

If you get a beta key, you might as well sell it and get a decent buck cause this game won't last 2 months of full release. it'll end up like another MxM. It's sad since the game has potential, however with the staff on board and the blind eye from Nexon from their abusive staff, I fear the game will never get far because of the ban on criticism. \n\nThe game is also full of bugs that has been around since alpha. Ladder bug, last hit bug, boss kill bug (where even when you kill the boss theres a chance the perks of siege tanks go to the other team even when none of them were around the boss when it was killed), theres also a bug where the game randomly ends and the winning team is random. The servers are also really bad and people are currently getting disconnected. There was also a bug where if you picked Turner, Yuna or Tooth/Tops you'll get disconnected (however this was fixed last week/ finally) All these problems arent worth the $16. Wait for F2P and then try it out but I fear by then the game would already be dead. Take this review as you want it.

It currently has a few problems that neither the developer nor the publisher care to fix. \n\nOne of these issues is the very long queue times. They basically render the game unplayable. It can take anywhere from 20-30 minutes to get a match, and when you do, its almost always versus the same players from your previous round.To put this in perspective, back in closed beta when the game was free, I could get a match in 5 minutes or less. Obviously, the problem is a lack of players. One might ask where all the players have gone, well I\u2019ll tell you.\n\nIts story time, gather round. In the beginning of the Hyper Universe there was a closed beta and all was good. Despite having a limited selection of characters (no Sasha? Camilla? Michelle??) everything was fine, queue times were bearable and it was generally a fun time for all players involved. And then early access came along and it was obvious that Nexon had changed the game from what the players played in closed beta: the game had been censored. So players took to questioning, inquiring why this happened. Eventually the developer responded and instead of listening to the flurry of negative feedback they had basically said: \u201cDeal with it\u201d in so many words. This started the exodus of the disgruntled Hyper Universe players. People refunded, or just dropped the game entirely and stopped playing altogether. \n\nDespite not even launching yet Nexon and CWAVE have basically set a bad tone for launch.

This game may try to sell itself to us by claiming to be of MOBAs but none of it's content distinct itself from game like Elsword with is just a regular pvp hack and slash button mashing game with absolutely no competitive aspect of a MOBA and I have played the likes of LoL, Smite, Paragon etc. I wasted my money, so hopefully you guys will learn from me and wait until it's free because as it stands it not worth it, just because you add tower defense like system does not make this in anyway shape or form a MOBA game.", "recommendationid": "34909991", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505622803, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505566099, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198075450149", "num_games_owned": 39, "playtime_forever": 3482}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499510"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 45, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1505047661, "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "localization team are cucks \ngame is censored for whiny oversenstive cunts who wont even play it\n\n'nuff said", "recommendationid": "34861111", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505047661, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504075325, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561197986987837", "num_games_owned": 319, "playtime_forever": 454}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503623"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 37, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1505040898, "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Character portraits and physics have been censored because clearly jiggle physics and skimpy outfits are too much for a wholesome publisher such as Nexon.  \n\nThe controller support is really awkward, eventually I was able to get it to work by toggling big picture mode but initially it would take input from my flight pedals or HOTAS over the Xbox controller.

Basically, the only people asking for the censorship was Nexon themselves.\n\nIn response to all the complaints of censorship, Nexon has pressured the developers in Korea to censor their version to match the western release. This was done on the basis of making all versions equal because if people can't point out regional differences then nothing was censored. Yes, they are that stupid.\n\nWhy is Censorship Important?\n\nLet's rewind back to the 90's where we had a game called Mortal Kombat, which had blood removed from some versions. Sure, without the blood it was still the same fighting game, and yet at the same time lost its soul. Anything artistic can be cut from a game without compromising gameplay, the entire thing could be reduced to stick figures and it would still have the same gameplay, so where do you draw the line?\n\nBlood isn't needed in games so we can cut that out, sexual content and nudity isn't needed so we can cut that, references to homosexuality isn't needed so it can be cut, religious references and symbols aren't needed so they can be cut too, and it never ends. If you gamed in the 90's then you saw it all, all of those things have been censored in one game or another on the basis it might offend someone or limit the audience. In the end, you either give a damn about the future of gaming or ignorantly think censorship will only be used in ways you approve. \n\n[quote=Rawrzor;1474222595303158430]Or you can actually judge the censorship that has been done on a case to case basis and see that this one actually isn't so bad. \n\nIf they change more they will loose more customers. Remove a complete char on the bases of censorship and i'm out. We pretty much all have our own standards when it comes to censorship. This level is not enough for me to take the stance of boycotting the game. \n\nI'll say it again though respect towards everybody their opinion on the matter, but the discussion is pretty much over. Any and all conversation about censorship should be talked about on a forum thats against censorship in games in general. It's time to stop beating the dead horse. [/quote]\n\nA year or two ago, gamers were trying to fight censorship when things like the Miku butt slap was being removed from Street Fighter V and costumes were being cut from Bravely Default and Fatal Frame. Sliders, costumes, and religious references were removed from Xenoblade Chronicles X, and DOA Extreme 3 wasn't even getting a western release. People were defending and rationalizing these things, and then Steven Universe had a kissing scene between two girls removed. The people who had been defending censorship threw a fit. I wish I could say the people who had been fighting censorship joined their enemies on the issue, but very few did. They relished the poetic justice of seeing the people who defended censorship get a taste of it.\n\nIt's like ice cream. We all have flavors we like and don't like. If you don't like rocky road, then you probably won't care if it gets taken off the shelf. If you're allergic to mint, you might want mint chocolate chip removed. When someone speaks up saying \"that's my favorite, please don't take it away\", people who don't care will tell them they are being childish, that there are plenty of other flavors to choose from, that they don't need that flavor specifically, until it's their favorite that's on the chopping block. If an ice cream manufacturer is only making one flavor of ice cream and they want the broadest group of potential customers, they will go with vanilla, the blandest flavor. No one likes it, no one hates it, it doesn't appeal to any specific preferences but everyone is a potential customer. The difference between games and ice cream is that games have a well documented and recent history of this crap. If gamers don't band together to put a stop to it on a matter of principle, it will only get worse.\n\nhttps://img.fireden.net/v/image/1456/79/1456798347118.png\n\n\"The more examples of this that the industry provides -- the more options we give management types to use for filling the blanks in statements like, \"Well, ____ did it!\" or, \"Well, ____ had worse censorship than that!\" -- the harder it will be to convince anyone to leave games intact in the future.\"\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3socra/censorship_bust_slider_removed_from_character/\n\nFun fact, the group that butchered fire emblem fates not only got to keep their jobs, but now they will be going to Japan once or twice a month so they can tell developers what they can and can't put in their games to avoid inconsistencies and accusations of censorship.
