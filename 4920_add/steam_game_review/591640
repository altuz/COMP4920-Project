I recommend this game on the presumption the the dev(s) will fix the partially functional button remapping feature. Please, please, please let me rebind the bumpers to the triggers!\n\nPros\n- GREAT atmosphere\n- Simple and immersive art style\n- Simple, challenging gameplay mechanics and a fair amount of content for an ~$8 game\n\nCons\n- Fiddly controls (opening doors, movement with dpad, constant use of the left bumper [CRAMPS!]) which are not all rebindable at the moment\n- Occasionally inconsistent AI and game mechanics leading to many level restarts from un-winnable situations\n\nCheck out some gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiGc4LBP5iY&feature=youtu.be\n\n\n", "recommendationid": "30890355", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1491097202, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491304906, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198030287064", "num_games_owned": 110, "playtime_forever": 119}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511865"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
