I love the game. This game has the protental to be that! The Developer is working closely with his community and listening to what they've got to say about the game. \n\nWhether you want to go in with C4, or just sledge hammer you way through. The simple yet effective controls are easy to learn. The guns are easy to use and communication between your team is easy. \n\nCreate kill holes to flank your enemies, or just go in guns blazing with a riot shield! \n\nTo those who are worried about if there are players or not. JOIN THE DISCORD. The Developer has scheduled game nights for us all to enjoy a game or 2 with the dev and other players. \n\nIt's still early on but since the first time I've played, it had changed a lot. \n\nNOTE. I've only played 2 hours, this is because I'm not used to this type of locomotion and I get motion sick really easily. So I play 2/3 games everytime I play. \n\nSometimes Games can be quick, or they can be long. Depends on how tactical you are really.\n\nAnyway, if you're a VR player this is a must buy game.

One is a defuse the bomb and the other is kill the enemy team before the time runs out.\nDefuse mode is played more tactical and you need to be more careful when entering, and the map helps with that. It has some places where you can hide and abush the enemy team. The map is really easy to learn and i feel its well balanced.\nKill the enemy gamemode is a more intense way of playing this game. All of the walls are can be destroyed so you have to use your reinforcements to create a room where they cant just suddenly kill you from behind. The map is smaller so you can check all of the rooms easier but there is still good ways to ambush it.\n\nThis game is awesome but needs more players.
