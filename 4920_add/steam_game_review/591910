I didn't mind the bugs and flaws because if the game was further developed, something great would happen.\n\n14 years later, I cannot mind the bugs and flaws. Not when the game has been reskinned and reselled multiple times in the past.\n\nFirst of all, expect a little level of realism and immersion from the game. You cannot set your own tactics (and as we know, basketball has A LOT of tactics involved), you cannot interact with the players or the media, there are no trades, the AI keeps changing defensive tactics every two minutes (no real coach does that for 40 or 48 minutes), there is no scouting (as in discover players with potential, as a matter of fact there is no potential ability), you can bring any player you want as long as you have the money (Lebron James to Euroleague? Why not?) and the game doesn't do a good job distinguishing tiers of players, as the stats scale from 1 to 20, there are no mental stats and no signature moves. For example, If a player has 17 in 3pt shots, he can play exactly the same in NBA or in a local low tier league.\n\nThe game has no depth.\n\nWhat you can expect is a lot of bugs. The game crashes randomly and some options simply don't work. I can't get to play in Windowed mode, for example, there is an option but does nothing. If you transfer list a player there is no way to make him unavailable for sale again. If you try to change offensive options when the game is on, it will mess your other settings. Clearly, there is a lot of work to be done for the game to become stable and usable 100%.\n\nFrom 2003 until today, basketball has changed a lot. Unfortunately WBM hasn't. The only thing that is better is the speed of processing between days, it was much worse back then.\n\nI don't expect a full fledged manager game like FM for football. But 14 years is a lot of time to change something in the match engine, nothing has been done.\n\nI wish the best for the devs and the game, we need a good basketball manager sim. But right now, I cannot recommend it.", "recommendationid": "33670969", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1500552530, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500551422, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198063536376", "num_games_owned": 485, "playtime_forever": 85}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508053"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_positive": 5}}
