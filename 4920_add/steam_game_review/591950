I love the concept of the game, but it feels badly implemented.  The range of the different soldiers are not thought through.  the first soldier is not able to reach the \"track\" in some places.  No upgrade path for the different soldiers, wich makes the game pretty boring after 3 levels.  Hope it's not really finnished, as I like the concept, and would love to continue playing the final release.  As is, this should not be for sale right now", "recommendationid": "30011505", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1487431894, "votes_funny": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487431477, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197970409959", "num_games_owned": 97, "playtime_forever": 52}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510130"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1491201197, "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Meeds a LOT of work.
