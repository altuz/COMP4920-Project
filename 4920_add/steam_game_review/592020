The environment is just beautiful. There is a rain effect that will sometimes appear that is gorgeous. I struggle with the handling of the hovercraft, this isn't because the controls are bad or I think there is a flaw with the game. I actually think that it is very thematic to the universe. Your starting ship is fast but with very bad handling. As you continue to upgrade your ship it becomes easier and easier to get your craft to do what you want it to do. I am also generally very bad with real time games, almost all of my favorite games are turn or puzzle based.", "recommendationid": "31930473", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1495637240, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503699101, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198226052176", "num_games_owned": 48, "playtime_forever": 1867}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534623"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_positive": 2}}
