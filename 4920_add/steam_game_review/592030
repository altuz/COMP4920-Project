The total absence of music. I get it, its a blocky world, but the game feels so barren and empty when the only thing you can hear is ambient wind and gunshots. This really detracts from the advertised \"hilarious\" game for me, I honestly feel even just the music from the trailer would liven up the environment a lot.\n\n2. What you can and cannot interact with can be very unclear at times. This could just be me personally failing, but I found a lack of clarity could get in the way of me enjoying a puzzle.\n\nThe game isn't terrible by any means, but I feel it could be a lot better. I hope the game gets a bit of love and polish in these regards, most particularly in the music department, because then I'd like to give it another shot.\n\nUpdate: since this review the devs have added music.

Some levels also appear to have randomisation implemented, so where you feel as though you'd like to learn how the level develops and the order which things need to be done, on occasion you simply don't have a choice. Enemies will spawn in different locations each play through, so if you don't keep your head on a constant swivel, you will lose.\n\nI also experienced what I consider a bug, in which I caught a bullet just before it hit someone I was meant to save, but they still died. Seriously, I had it in my hand, but they still died. I also failed a mission because someone I was trying to protect tripped over a wooden board... ducking a knife that was heading for him. Found that a bit odd.\n\nThe graphics are cute and simplistic, and the physics appear to be pretty fun.\n\nI honestly can't recall any music being played, so if it was, it was instantly forgetable, but the majority of the sound effects were pretty cool. The only problem, I had, was the main robot that talked to you throughout the game. For some reason, the developers felt having Microsoft Sam speak to you in an obvious synthesised voice was acceptable. For me, it just lowered the level of polish of the game. It gave the only speaker in the game ZERO personality. Sure, they're a robot, the voice is synthesised, but it had no character what so ever. I hope they actually pay the small amount of money it'd cost to get someone to redo that voice, but it made the game feel cheap. The robot looks like a robot, make him sound like a robot.\n\nCatching bullets and reuniting them with their sender is a lot of fun, and catching a rocket and sending that back was just amazing! I actually steadied my stance and braced myself the first time that happened.\n\nWhen I came up against my first enemy, I simply took his gun away from him and moved over to his friend. After realising I couldn't fire the gun, I simply threw it at his head, knocking him over. I noted a grenade at his hip and plucked that from him before his body hit the floor. I glanced over my shoulder to the guy I took the gun from to see that he had now pulled out a knife. While impressed with that, I tossed the grenade his way. Killed us both, but was still pretty cool.\n\nHOWEVER, while I do think this game has something to lend the gaming community, and is therefore recommended, it's simply not a game for me.\n\nSo, if you don't like trial and error, and watching and hearing the same things again and again and again, I'd skip this one.", "recommendationid": "33837459", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501176548, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501174030, "num_reviews": 27, "steamid": "76561197968761535", "num_games_owned": 549, "playtime_forever": 44}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512682"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1501610571, "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This game is far too short to charge $18. \n\nMost of the levels are really straighforward and require no problem solving or quick reactions like they do on the better levels.\n\n", "recommendationid": "33954260", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501610571, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501610416, "num_reviews": 35, "steamid": "76561198041628378", "num_games_owned": 299, "playtime_forever": 38}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501013"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1502483557, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "The entire game, plus it's bonus levels can be beaten in less then an hour.

Some of the scenarios in the game are creative and I enjoyed reading the flavor text for each one. The premise behind the game is fresh and unique and that was the primary factor for me purchasing it, but unfortunately the game did not hold up to my initial expectation.\n\nWhile the levels themselves are colorful and bright, actually playing them was boring. One major failing of the game is the sound design. As others have stated, there isn't any music when playing the puzzles which causes the game to lose all the charm it has in the trailer. The lack of music means that majority of the game is you listening to the occasional gunshot or smack from you throwing something at an enemy. A majority of the puzzles were incredibly simple and all of them have pretty much only one way to solve them, which meant that I knew exactly what I needed to do when I started and just had to go through to motions to execute. The game is short, but in these early days of VR I'm willing to have short games if they are a polished and entertaining experience (e.g. I paid the $30 for Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality and do not regret that purchase at all).\n\nI feel what would really help this game would be to expand the ways that you could prevent someone from dying. For example, the level where you are preventing an old man from getting run over could theoretically be solved by popping the tires of the truck causing it to veer off the road, or possibly building a ramp for the truck to jump over the person you're trying to protect. You could even add achievements for each possible way to solve the level to encourage experimentation when trying to solve.\n\nOverall, I'd say keep this game on your radar if you're interested but wait to see if the developers update and add more content before buying.", "recommendationid": "33993275", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1501768597, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503105173, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197986601787", "num_games_owned": 471, "playtime_forever": 61}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 4, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "timestamp_created": 1501828822, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Way way way way way way excetera too short.\n\nRefunding because I have limited funds and want to spend them on something that doesn't take 20 minutes to complete (I replayed all the missions again and failed on purpose.

The concept of moving through the world as if everything had been slowed down is a great concept. The mechanics are interesting, and they make great use of the slow motion in several puzzles.

Your client could be in a war zone, being fired upon by enemy soldiers. One way you could save them would be to grab the enemy soldier's gun, and beat him over the head with it. You could also grab the fired shots mid flight, and redirect them into the enemy's face, killing him and thus saving your client.\n\nIt took me 89 minutes to beat every level.
