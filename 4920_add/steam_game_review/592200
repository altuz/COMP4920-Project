Once you get started you'll get sucked into the story and the characters. The writing is well done, the story development is amazing so far. I still have a lot to play but I had to stop to write this. This is a underrated game which should see more light. A game that doesn't take itself seriously is hands down awesome. Granted there is a lot of reading involved but it's worth the buy for the content, the characters and the art. The backgrounds are beautiful, the sprite work lovely.

I think one of the things that it really has going for it is its sense of humor; be it the snarky wit of the main protagonist, the wacky array of supporting characters, or just the self-aware exposition, this is an objectively funny game.  It's a tongue-in-cheek parody game filled with nerdy references, and the game rewards you for recognizing them.  Not to mention, the story is quite absorbing -- after playing for awhile it became hard to stop -- despite the fact that the game certainly does not take itself too seriously, it's difficult not to get wrapped up in the world building and story arch.\n\nThat being said, this game is a whole lot of story, a whole lot of jokes, and a whole lot of amusing exposition.  That is to say, it's really, really talky.  This isn't inherently a bad thing -- but one of my main criticisms is with the way that the frankly epic amounts of written information was handled.  It would have benefitted greatly from voice actors, and considering the 1st game was very nicely voice acted, I found the sudden change jarring (despite the fact that even that was a in-joke about sequels).  \nVoicing the cast would have made me feel less like I was reading an interactive sci-fi/fantasy picture book, and more like I was playing a video game.  However, if it was impossible to have gotten voice actors for the sequel for whatever reason, then this game very much needed some other way of breaking up all the talking into easy-to-follow chunks.  Just having the character's name there above the dialogue box wasn't enough for a smooth gaming experience.  Something such as a logo for each character next to their name, a change in font color for each character, or a musical theme (when applicable) associated with each character to indicate when they are speaking would have been helpful.\n\nAll in all, this is a funny, absorbing game -- depite what seem like budgetary issues with the voice cast not returning, I would very much recommend this game to anyone who likes an engaging parody story.", "recommendationid": "33411234", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1499624671, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499622900, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198165933558", "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 68}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502270"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_positive": 3}}
