This software is very buggy, let's just start with that.  The more things you put into the map, the more tools start not working properly, and at times textures or effect filters just stop showing up.  I haven't lost anything important like that, and it will restore pretty close to before it crashes, but that is something you need to know.  A few of the controls are a bit hard to get used to such as scroll wheel sometimes not zooming out but flipping through object textures or grouping, but really I'd expect some amount of learning curve with any mapmaking program worthwhile. \n\nI get putting a negative review to anything with this many bugs, but despite all that it's still the most powerful mapmaking tool I have.  I would rather save frequently and use this by such a wide margin and for one very simple reason - availibility of mapping packs.  There's a few megapacks that round this out nicely, and just creating my own packs is simple.  I've gone through 2 or 3 \"free\" tools that have some complicated packmaking process and that killed them for me.  This one is just making a couple folders and dumping in stuff.  No size restrictions, no fancy list files, no bullshit hoops.  There's a few other things in its favor like the effects filter for changing tint, putting on shadows, bevels, and probably other stuff I havent explored.  That's nice for creatively repurposing assets.  The texture rotation, x and y offset, and zoom are pretty nice as well, along with decent size and rotation for objects.  There's probably more I just haven't needed to dig into yet.  There hasn't yet been a thing I wanted to map out and not had a way to do it. \n\nIf you're a DM who's very picky about your maps, I'd say this is worth it in its current state.  You'll have to work around some frustrations, but I have not yet found a mapmaking tool that isn't drowning in frustrations.  Pyro, I like where this is going.  Please don't stop with the fixes.  Expand and polish this right and you could have the defining mapmaking tool.", "recommendationid": "35038704", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1505708544, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "last_played": 1506058075, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198033602993", "num_games_owned": 204, "playtime_forever": 14852}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1506294185, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "THIS IS EARLY ACCESS. \n\nSo far, I've made one building. There seems to be a small amount of decorations or whatnot available, but with the workshop, theres more to come and some already in there that looks great. I'm totally happy with the price. 15 bucks in a world where things like Dundjinni and campaign cartogropher are $40. This is perfect. Since this is EA, it's not complete, which means bugs. As of right now, it has crashed on me every time I've used it, all at different times (I did complete the building remember) so just save often. As long as you tap ctrl+s periodically, you'll be perefectly fine. It's not even an inconvenience. You can import random maps from donjon, which speeds the tool up incredibly. Don't want to make your own personal Buildings or Dungons, just download some or hit up donjon. I'm incredibly happy I don't have to slog away at photoshop to create maps anymore.\n\nFinal thought:\nIf you're going to be playing any kind of tabletop roleplaying and you want nice maps, this is the best program for the job.", "recommendationid": "35192483", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506294185, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 274, "last_played": 1506812094, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561197985194760", "num_games_owned": 253, "playtime_forever": 274}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}, {"written_during_early_access": true, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1505921060, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "This is an amazing software that is very powerful once you learn how to use it.
