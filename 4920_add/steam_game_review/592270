After selecting one of three available kitties with varying movement speeds and weapons (plus a couple more to unlock), you're off on a brisk seven-stage journey to rack up as many points as you can.\n\nYou'll quickly notice that blasting baddies releases blue cat icons, which charge up your single-stock \"bomb\" weapon when picked up; unleashing said bomb not only damages enemies and grants a few moments of invincibility, but changes unfriendly bullets and defeated targets into gold pickups, which serve as your primary source of points - and extra lives. You'll likely soon figure out that downing an enemy from right up close flashes a [i]\"brave!\"[/i] message, and grants extra points and cat items; as such, you'll want to be almost constantly on the move, getting in adversaries' faces during fleeting instances of safety, charging up the bomb, letting it rip where it'll reap the best rewards, and already be working on readying the next one.\n\nIt's not the most groundbreaking feature set or gameplay style, especially for anyone with some prior knowledge of the shoot-em-up genre at large, but it is a lot of fun, and solidly put together: three difficulty levels are available to cater to a wide range of challengers, and while things can sometimes come across as a bit too chaotic to keep track of, especially when you're first getting used to the style, your character's hit area is forgiving and openly displayed, and handy visual and sound cues make it easier to focus on the moment-to-moment action instead of whether or not your bomb meter is quite filled yet. On the superficial side, there's a more-than-respectable amount of enemy and background variety (and weirdness) packed into the game's brief running time, while the soundtrack (which, as the description notes, is included gratis) has more than enough quirky energy to keep the journey lively; controller support (both analog and digital, thank heavens) also works well, and the game has no trouble humming (er, purring) right along even on not-so-impressive hardware like mine.\n\nI actually bought and enjoyed the original Japanese version of this several months before it came to Steam, but have no problem double-dipping to support both the developer and publisher for making it available to a wider audience. If you have any inclination towards scrolling shooters, bizarre cat humor, or both, at the very least track down the Japanese demo for this online and see how it strikes you; I'm willing to bet that most who do will find it a most entertaining (ball of) yarn.", "recommendationid": "32518912", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1497736127, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497715014, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198109626876", "num_games_owned": 1625, "playtime_forever": 30}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514712"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1498147396, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "Adorable, fun.
