If not,  something, somewhere, must have gone seriously wrong, because it sure feels and plays like that.  I don't even know where to begin, but I'll start with the most important thing :  this game is not worth the price they are asking! Not even close.\n\nOk, here we go:\n-  It's a wave shooter, a bad wave shooter, it's probably even a really aweful wave shooter\n- There's no real positional tracking, you just shoot from your position without moving. I'm not talking about locomotion or teleport :  I'm talking about the feeling that there's only limited positional tracking, I don't know why it feels like that\n-  You change location automatically by short cinematic cut scenes during which you are half-way in the ground, floating above a jeep, or standing just outside of your own body,etc...\n-  Weapon mechanics are terrible and buggy\n-  Everytime you load your weapon, there's a short lag which is very annoying\n-  Accuracy of shooting is non-existing, no skills involved, just aim somewhere in the direction of the enemy and hope you hit him\n-  Animation of the enemies is terrible\n-  Graphics are blurry and there are no in-game options for graphics\n-  No options to set the sound (f.e. to lower the volume of the music)\n-  The music pretty much sucks\n-  The tutorial is aweful\n-  Some things are going on outside of the gamespace so prepare to hit walls\n-  Voice acting is not good\n-  The gameplay is not logical in any way.  For example, sometimes you are asked to change weapon and after a while, you are asked to change back to the original weapon you started with. This happens while you are shooting!\n-  What I understood from the story didn't make much sense\n-  Throwing grenades to a target is nearly impossible.  Most of the times, the grenade drops a few metres from you or even closer.\n-  Last but not least,  nobody will buy this game without refunding.  Maybe if they drop the price to 5 EUR?

But the problem is that the developers needs to do LOTS OF work and improve the overall VR experience. Take a look at my first-look gameplay of Real BX VR and I will tell you all about it:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5IaVnf8RkA\nMy thoughts in text form? Well OK, I will try to sum it up:\n\nGraphics:\nFirst of all, I was really excited to play this game, watching all those screenshots and the trailer video. They looked fantastic. And graphically it actually DOES look very good in-game as well. The environment looks nice, the textures may not be outstanding but for a VR game I dont think we should complain. Due to the game engine (Unreal) it gets a bit blurry on distance, but you can probably fix that with SuperSampling if your computer is a beast and can handle it (more about it later).\n\nSounds:\nWell sounds are OK, the weapons sounds like they use to I guess. The intense music in the background is OK, but I wish I could decrease the music volume a bit.\n\nWeapons:\nThe range of available weapons is nice, all from pistol and bow to several machine guns and RPG as well as different kinds of grenades. Nothing to complain about, well except for the weapon handling system (more about it below)\n\nStoryline:\nThis game is story-driven and the story feels kind of well-made, together with the cutscenes that provides some \"depth\" in a really plain and quite so simple VR shooter. Story-driven games are always welcome in VR, so even thou I have my thoughts about the cutscenes, I wont whine about it. The only problem is how the cutscenes are presented, more about this further below in this review)\n\nControl system:\nHere comes the big issues... Well, first of all the controls in-game are not aligned with your real-life Vive controllers, so you kind of lose some immersion from the start. They just feels \"off\", and not synced. The movements of your hands doesnt feel realistic at all, probably because of the misalignment. \n\nThen we have a bigger problem: The weapon handling. Oh gosh the aiming is impossible to master. You simply cannot aim right whatever you do. Every shot feels like a hit-and-miss game, and I struggled a lot to even kill an enemy 2 meters ahead of me. Then the reloading-system for the weapons. It says its \"manual reloading\". Oh well, somehow it is because you need to click a button to reload, but your left hand (that you are supposed to control with your left Vive controller) is doing the reloading automatically, so you totally lose control of your hand. Maybe it looks cool while watching a gameplay, but being the one playing its just soo frustrating. \n\nAnd then there is a lag while reloading, so it can take several seconds before your weapon is fully loaded - and during that time your weapon is like \"frozen\" in the air, whenever you move away or not. This is just not acceptable in VR. Check my video and I explain all about it. Weapon handling is so-so, and the grenades have ZERO physics. It doesnt matter how you do, the grenade will always fly waaay yo short or waaay to long - it really doesnt make any sense. \n\nCutscenes:\nIn-game cutscenes is a good idea - IF they are performed right. In VR, making you \"float\" and move without any control during cut scenes, will only cause trouble. This is really gonna give you motion-sickness after a few seconds if you are a sensitive person (Im not though). Sometimes you end up totally misaligned to the cutscene, and that could make you feel even more uncomfortable. Also, in many cut scenes, you only have a 360-degree vision without roomscale. Jumping between room-scale head tracking gameplay and non-room scale cutscenes is just a immersion-breaker and will probably give you nausea as well if you look around too much. Why not just stick to 2D video in front of you during cut scenes? \n\nDifficulty:\nThere is no difficulty option, and thats a real shame, because personally I feel this game is WAAAY to difficult. You will have to fight big waves of soldiers coming from all 360 degrees around you, all shooting at you at the same time as well. I know, this could work on a PC-screen playing with keyboard and mouse, but in VR you have to work so much harder, and its almost impossible to play this game a few levels in. Why throw 10-15 or even 20 soldiers at you at the same time, from all directions? Its just ridiculous. Or at least give us some Easy/Normal gameplay option.\n\nOptions/settings:\nWell, there are none. No graphical settings, no sound settings, nothing at all. Not yet at least.\n\nPrice/worth:\nWaay to pricy. I would say 15 USD is enough for a game in this unfinished stage. But if money is not a problem for you, its of course up to you to decide whenever its worth it or not.\n\nPerformance:\nOh well, another big issue. This game is not really optimized so far. Im running a i7 4790k @4.6Ghz together with GTX 980Ti watercooled and highly overclocked, and thats not even close to be enough for Real BX VR. Im getting stuttering, lost frames even in the tutorial area, and during all gameplay - and it gets worse the further in you play. Its so painful!\n\nIm afraid this game needs at least a GTX 1080 or even GTX 1080 Ti to run smoothly. I tried Asynchronus Reprojection in Steam VR settings, and it didnt help much. I tried Always-on Reprojection and it was even worse. So, if you are sitting on a GTX 980Ti or worse, you will get performance problems, unfortunately. At least in this first release and version (25th march 2017).\n\nOverall:\nWell, Im a little bit dissapointed but at the same time, I still have big hopes that the developers can fix all the issues and make this game much better in future updates. The game has good potential, and it could have been so much better, and still CAN be, if the devs just gives it some patches and fixes and maybe also a totally different control system for HTC Vive - like the one most others Vive games use. \n\nI WONT give this game a negative review, because I still think most of the issues can be fixed, and the developers deserves a chance to make it all right. I will wait for new updates until I play this game again, and I really hope its a better VR experience next time I start up Real BX VR again.", "recommendationid": "30722184", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1490432863, "votes_funny": 3, "comment_count": "10", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490381140, "num_reviews": 70, "steamid": "76561198164837178", "num_games_owned": 213, "playtime_forever": 75}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512774"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1490747587, "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I'm Changing the review status to recommended....only if you like intense real action war type games...shooter style rooom scale... at first it was poor bugs and having to start all over from the beginning after completing stages... but im competitive so i fought thru the game and i can say its impressive if they release episode 2 shortly with a good story plot like this one turned out to be....", "recommendationid": "30804204", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1491773499, "votes_funny": 2, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494711389, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198344454608", "num_games_owned": 100, "playtime_forever": 544}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1491040323, "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "When I first got this game and played this game, as I saw in the reviews, aiming was hard, hard to throw grenaes and etc. So, after beating two rounds, I gave up on this game.\n\nHowever, after the update, the aiming got better, moving got better, and more.

What am I being too hard on it well I don't care this game is a bad VR game. I've played better military games then this one. Games like Onward or Cyber Threat heck even Oscar Mike is better then RealBX VR. \n\nThe graphics are low quality. Everything is a blur buck you can't even see how much ammo you have left unless you bring the gun up to your face. The grapics feel like it was the very first PS3 game being ported over with a few VR motions to it. \n\nThe aiming is just aweful. Aiming down sights don't due crap. You can aim a few inches away from an enemy and still hit them. Its more like aim in their direction and open fire and pray you hit the enemy.\n\nThe enemies are freaking pathetic. The A.I. seems to be just move back and forth, standing  and shooting that is it. No pattern, no surprises just useless dumb broken A.I.\n\nRelaoding is bucking stupid, when you reload your gun is held out in front of you and it reloads the magazine for you. You can't move the gun while its in the reload animation. You can swing the controllers around all you want and the guns stays out in front of you.\n\nMoving...there is no moving at all. This game is just a rail-shooter game. Frick I would rather play Rambo: The Game then RealBX VR. You are pretty much exposed and have really no cover other then a few creats but that is useless since it feels like the enemy bullets go straight threw.\n\nCutscenes are broken as heck. You are a spectator watching the character your going to play do a few things beore you play. During the cutscenes you will be low to the graound if not in it. What was up with the story, a desease has spread or a chemical terrorist attack or what I was lost on the story.\n\nThere are no checkpoints or if there are then mine were broken. If you die you restart all the way to the first chapter.\n\nThe title I feel is misleading here is why. The full title is on the review fourm says RealBX VR (Apocalypse begins...) but the store page and your library will say RealBX VR. The in-game shows that BX stands for Battle Experiance. When you hear the words Real Battle Experiance, what comes to your imagination? Following orders, being shot at, adrenaline pumping, saving wounded soliders, using actual military arsonal, deploying from a chopper. Well cast all that away because this game doesn't have any of that.\n\nThis game gets 0/10 score. Yes a 0, just god aweful and all this is my opinan of the game. It was the ecperiance I had with it. I also can't recommend this game escpecially since its $29.99.

However, I wouldn't recommend this game if it was only $1. I'm not exaggerating... It's that bad.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice in this game is that the in-game hands do not line up with yours. Instead, it feels like the in-game hands are aligned with the ring on the top of the Vive wands. This is most disturbing at the main menu, when the in-game hands are holding Vive wands. \n\nThe reloading is horrendous. You fire until you're out of ammo, bring your left hand near the weapon, and let the animations do the rest. You do not have ANY control over the hands while a weapon is being reloaded. The same goes for pulling a pin on a grenade. Bring your left hand close to the grenade and let the animation do the rest.\n\nThe game opens with you inside of a vehicle (maybe a chopper, I don't remember). You're standing up though, so the floor of the vehicle is right at waist level. Once the vehicle scene ends, you move toward the starting point. You're not walking or teleporting; the game is just moving you toward the starting point. It doesn't feel like you're walking, but more like you are hovering forward. The worst part is, your movement during this portion doesn't line up with the shape of the ground that you are moving on. The ground goes up, but you just go straight through it (roughly at waist level again). There are a few times that your body will go up and down, but even then, it doesn't match up with the terrain. It's like the devs kind of cared, but didn't really.\n\nAfter this, you take on the first wave of enemies. I didn't have any trouble seeing them, or aiming down the sites (which I have seen complaints of), but I just couldn't get over the stupid reloading mechanics and the fact that the hands didn't line up with my own. So I shot at enemies for about two or three minutes and turned the game off. Now I'm going to refund it. \n\nThis game does everything wrong.
