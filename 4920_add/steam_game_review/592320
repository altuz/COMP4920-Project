The prior game, 'Cabin' was excellent, but this title returns to the lower quality of the first game 'Gleam'. There is very poor coordination of the game area to the playspace, with the floor several inches higher than you need it, even after floor fix. The engine configuration resulted in that pixelated UE4 crap fog over everything -- a phenomenon I can't stop complaining about, sorry devs. The verticality of the game was new and interesting, but the triggers to change sections (climb up the ladder, slide through wall crack, etc) were finicky and prone to errant activation. The puzzle was the same thing repeated a few times (collect the gems), which is fine with me, but more effort should have been put into the puzzles or the game, instead of being spend on the story scenes. Regardless of whether or not you care about story in a VR demo, nobody cares about it when they just put the headset on and have to wait to start the game, and they certainly no longer care when the game has concluded. Embed the plot into the escape room, and let us absorb it at the same time as we puzzle. The penultimate scene where the floor moves truly did catch me off guard, and I don't think I've ever experienced that strong sense of movement in VR before, I really [i]felt[/i] the floor move. I fiqured the game would get good at the point, but then it ends.

Honestly too rudamentry for room escape fans to enjoy.\n-There are some gamebreaking bugs. For example, moving from some rooms to other rooms will land you in a wall, leaving you really confused as you either get kicked out or see nothing. It happens multiple times and is very confusing. \n-This one is really bad. There is one sound effect that is set so loud it will blow your eardrums. Make sure you have your volume low or just... do your ears a favor and avoid the game. Makes me think the devs are trolling the players with this. [spoiler]Also, why would there be drum sounds when pressing the wall buttons? We're in  an abandoned ancient spooky castle, not a rock concert.[/spoiler]\n-There is a story which should be a good thing, but it really falls short. There is a point in the game where a choice needs to be made, but there was no hints at what the concequences are for making the obvious choice. This just leaves you dumbfounded when the outcome is unfolded, [spoiler] as you are left thinking \"well if someone had told me that was going to happen, maybe I would have thought about it some more\".[/spoiler] Some proper foreshadowing is required for this choice to be properly implemented.\n-A fair amount of text at the beginning. Not terrible but it still deserves a mention, as currently reading text in VR is not ideal due to the screen door effect.\n-It's really short, even for $6.
