Because that is exactly what it is.  Geez, I only played 8 minutes and I'm already all sweaty and tired.  You have to move quickly either to the left, right or middle.  And you have to constantly squat down to avoid the obstacles (basically move to the opening in the wall, the rest of the wall being the obstacle).  You're supposed to be collecting balls while doing the above.  \n\nThe coaster is just a big room scale area (get as much roomscale as you can) and that'll be where you can move to quickly avoid the obstacles.  There's easy, normal, and hard levels.  However, the only difference that I noticed was that you could press trigger more often to activate the slow motion (\"bullet time\") mode, where time slows down and you can more easily get to the correct spot.  There's also a comfortable option and it just made your view smaller and things blurrier (IMO).  Good thing I don't ever suffer from VR nausea.\n\nHowever, even on easy this game is quite the workout.  So I don't recommend this game unless you're willing to play 2 minutes a a time or you are in good shape.  And just forget about it you're completely out of shape.  \n\nRating 7/10 game should be called [b]Extreme Workout VR or you'll hit the wall (roomscale edition)[/b]", "recommendationid": "35142384", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506134698, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1506133823, "num_reviews": 210, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 8}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_positive": 4}}
