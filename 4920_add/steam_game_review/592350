I feel that there's still SOME need for a small footprint, customizable SDS modeler in this crowded market. Nvil is exactly that. \n\nOn the other hand, one has to wonder if Blender's very existence makes Nvil more of an artifact of a bygone era of 3D. Nvil is the sort of app that would have been the top dog for indie art some 10-15 years ago. It's not 2002 anymore though. Why spend $119 for a SDS modeler when you can get a far more complete and robust suite in the form of Blender for $0 instead? That's the real question.\n\nIf you're looking for a Silo replacement and are willing to pay Silo prices then Nvil is your guy. If, however, you want to go beyond poly modeling then opt for the Blender instead. Blender is every bit the pro-level app as something like Maya or 3dsmax. Nvil is more of a niche product, designed to fill an ever shrinking hole in the market. \n\nAnd that's the problem. Nvil isn't a complete app unto itself. You can't animate, render, sculpt, or do any of the other big picture things that you might expect of a modern 3D app. Don't spend $119 on Nvil expecting it to replace the $300 MODO Indie. You'll be disappointed. Nvil exists for one reason and one reason only, as a replacement for Silo. \n\nThat said, here are a few basic pros and cons.\n\nPRO:\n- Customizable\n- More stable than Silo v2.x ever was\n- Easy to learn\n- Small footprint\n- Pure poly modeling\n\nCON:\n- Overpriced at $119. \n- Customizable GUI suffers from slightly laggy button/element redraw\n- The odd clipped button text in the latest April 14, 2017 build\n- Default radial menu is a little twitchy and too quick to move from one level to the next\n- Dated overall design. Very 2001.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: \n\nIt won't replace, Blender or any other general purpose suite app. Then again, it's not supposed to. If all you need is a pure poly/SDS modeling solution then you could do worse tha Nvil. Nvil is what Silo v2 probably should have been. If, however, you already have a more robust app available to you then Nvil doesn't bring anything new to the table. \n\nNvil is good for what it is. Just wait for a sale. \n\n\n\nNOTE: I tested this on Win10 (ver. 1703) with a Core i7-6700K @ 4GHz, 32GB RAM, and a GeForce GTX 970 4GB.", "recommendationid": "31212876", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1492494673, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502801344, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198047377318", "num_games_owned": 297, "playtime_forever": 120}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555363"}, {"written_during_early_access": false, "votes_up": 6, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "timestamp_created": 1494782124, "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "review": "I am not one for writing reviews but feel the need to do so for Nvil.\nI am a professional ArchVIZ artist/designer moving into the world of game engines.\n\nI am only a few hours in with Nvil and it has become my goto subd modeller.
