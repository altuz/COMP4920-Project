It is very informative and has some very nice views of the planets from space and a nice up close look at our moon.  A lot of the focus is on the terrain of each planet along with their moons.  Space satellites are also mentioned when applicable.  \n\nI think it's strange they didn't include the Sun.  Also, the controls were clunky.  I get that they are going for immersion with holding the grips when launching off to another planet or opening the doors of the shuttle.  However, it gets annoying after a few space hops.  And you can't easily go where you want, you have to literally find the planet and then point towards it.  It took me a whlie to find Venus.  And you have to open the tabs on the machine and then open more tabs to get more information on the planet or moons.\n\nStill, I enjoyed the VR tour of our galaxy.  It took me exactly 42 minutes with trying to make sure I looked at everything the tour had to offer (game doesn't tell you).  \n\nRate 6/10 sale price recommendation", "recommendationid": "35117774", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1506044176, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "last_played": 1506043760, "num_reviews": 210, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 42}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 7, "total_reviews": 20, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 13}}
