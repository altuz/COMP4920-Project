Its not a large area, but it is fully modelled which gives you much more detailed objects than photogrammetry would do. \nI was particularly impressed with the TV screen - it looked 'real'. I thought it was the best use of an 'in game' screen Ive seen. I hope you add audio controls in the future. Likewise, the rest of the environment was well designed. I can imagine that the real life area looks just like this.\nI hope you get to expand on this. I can imagine that such a virtual landscape would be a useful aid to schools and univeristies in the future. \n", "recommendationid": "30169160", "language": "english", "timestamp_updated": 1488034384, "votes_funny": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488033411, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197964889904", "num_games_owned": 101, "playtime_forever": 6}, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_positive": 1}}
