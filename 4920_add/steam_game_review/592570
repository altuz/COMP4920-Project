However it can be extremely frustrating having to start over from the beginning several times.  It would be a bit nice if there were checkpoints you could restart from if you miss something or unintentionally end the game.\n\n\nIve made a walkthru for the first part of the game (first part meaning the only part ive gotten pass) https://youtu.be/xx27aEg21Mc\n\nEDIT: After playing a bit longer, im pretty sure thats it.  just different ways to exit the game after you take the phone call from Renee.

Once I took the time to understand its premise, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe most common critique of the game was the inability to save the game. This game is meant to be replayed, repeatedly to use the try new options, explore new paths, and further discover the story and details hiding in the dark corners. The different endings provide different bits of information, and some interestingly pleasantly experiences, should you take the time to see them through.\n\nI know it's hard to come to terms with, but you are not losing anything by the absence absence of a save feature. Each run is a new complete (and brief) experience. Once the map is familiar, speed runs take about 6 minutes (timed), and the world is not terribly large. It may have taken you a couple of hours to make it through the first to your first (non-suicide) ending, but future attempts do not take long at all, once you know the answers.\n\nThis game does not follow the format you're used to. Give it some time, expore the many ways to see the story through, and you will likely find this game a delightfully unique experience.", "votes_up": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_forever": 582, "last_played": 1497589715, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197977397371"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502516913, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34184206"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
