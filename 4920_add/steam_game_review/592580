The difficulty is great, smart, it adapts mid game depending on how you play. I was a FIFA player since 2010 (before I always played PES). Last year I bought the PC version of PES 2017 and I loved the gameplay, even though the graphics were a lesser version of the PS4... But now, we received the same product and they gave us the best football experience so far. \n\nSo please, wait a little longer before giving a bad review to say \"online won't work\"...\"it's not a finished product\"... \"Refunded, no online\"..

Servers are the best they have been, no lag at all in any game's I've played. They slipped up Day One and people were understandably a bit annoyed like I was but they got them sorted.\n\nThe first PES game I have pre-ordered and played from Day One, the only other PES game I played properly was 2016 and 2017 but I gave Fifa a chance with the pre-order purchase and 2017 was the last straw so 2018 had to be PES's year and it defiintely is.\n\n[Gameplay]\nThe game is fast paced and Fun, you have a lot of control of how your team plays by messing with the tactics and of course Advanced Tactics which allow for more indepth play. E.g. Hate your defence leaving you exposed on the counter? Pull your defensive line back or use Deep Defensive line or even just tell 2 of your defenders to always stay back. Hate your striker getting tired from tracking back? Make him stay up. There is so much you can do.\n\n[MyClub]\nI missed last year of any Clubs mode because I just got bored of Fifa's handicap and I got PES 2017 too late in the year that there was no point. 2018 Is great fun however, the servers are impeccable and I have had no issues (1 minute is the longest I've waited but no lag at all).\n\nThe best thing about MyClub is the Rewards and Challenges that get you Club Coins and GP that you can spend on Ball's without having to waste money or unreal amounts of time. They also do bonus's every now and then with special Ball's and extra login bonus's. The fact it doesn't feel like the game is forcing you to grind is what makes MyClub perfect.\n\n[Master League]\nI haven't played much of it yet (Only while the servers were offline) but it's what you expect but with a very nice UI and added features like Interviews, Locker Room scenes for big matches, Pre-Season and better transfer system. A great improvement over 2017 and I can't wait to get into it.\n\n[Other Modes]\nI don't really enjoy the COM cup's, find them pointless but if you want to play in the Champions League or Europa League then feel free to play against the AI in them.\n\n[Licenses]\nThere's already a save file you can import to change team's and leagues and I expect modders to add in the Scoreboards and Presentation if you want it in the near future.\n\n[Referee's]\nMy biggest complaint of 2017 was the awful decisions by ref's (Probably caused by being a 360/PS3 port) but there's none of that anymore, they have all been spot on so far.\n\n[Graphics]\nProper PC Version with proper PC settings. 10/10\n\n\n[Conclusion]\nThe best Football game this year by far, fluid, fun and just does everything right. 10/10\n", "votes_up": 11, "author": {"num_games_owned": 886, "playtime_forever": 1072, "last_played": 1506181888, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 80, "steamid": "76561198017563282"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505504494, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.512467", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34979785"}, {"timestamp_created": 1505564962, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game.
