{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1498285733, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The game has a very promising setting and description, but it fell short of my expectations. I found myself consistently frustrated while attempting to complete the missions given to me by the terminal. In one mission I was supposed to find a mop, but couldn't locate it anywhere. In another, I was supposed to pick up cargo with a drone. I spent 15 minutes bumping it through space trying to push it into a box, and when I did, nothing seemed to happen. The instructions and controls were unclear, and I didn't have the patience to figure out what I was supposed to do, because of my next point:\n\nI am not a person that tends to get motion sick or suffer from eye strain, but as soon as I got into the game, my eyes begin to hurt - a dull, throbbing pain. I believe that this was caused by either the very high degree of motion blur, or something else about the graphics. I checked the options menu for a motion blur setting (there was none) and tried decreasing the graphics quality, but it didn't help. The only other time I've felt pain like this was when viewing the 3D setting of the Nintendo 3DS.\n\nI played through the pain for 40 minutes hoping that the apparent eye strain would go away, but it didn't. This, combined with the frustrating gameplay elements, made forced to request a refund.\n\nHowever, despite these complaints, I am still voting that I recommend this game. Why? Because the developer clearly put time and effort into it, and I've seen far worse things on Steam. I don't think it's worth the sale price of $10, but if it's on sale, give it a try if you're into space games. The concept of being an inmate on a space station was fun, and the game would have been fun if I wasn't in too much pain to play it.", "votes_up": 2, "author": {"num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 42, "last_played": 1498274277, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198047845894"}, "comment_count": "2", "timestamp_updated": 1498285733, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503817", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32713688"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
