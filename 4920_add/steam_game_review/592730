Casual means, I take some game, play a bit, not long, and then go on other things in life. I decided to take this game, even if reviews were mixed. And, after first start of game, I played whole hour, two full missions. 60 minutes, straight. For a casual gamer like me - that is a compliment to game, a big one. For a price of sandwitch you got pretty polished arcade heli shooter. Control mechanics, that was critized before - probably was about older version. For arcade shooter movement feels just right. What is not good - controls can not be rebind for now. I hope for that in future, so maybe I can even try to fly with flightstick. But, current mouse+keybaord works well, if you have no \"mental lock\" to other layout from some other game. There is even humour part in game, enemy vehicles pushes wrecked ones, flips over but continue shooting, get stuck to each other - developers, don't try to fix it! :) Really, don't! It is fun. And games are supposed to be fun, not some serious hard work. \nSo, for current price / fun given, as this game is right now, I definetely recomment it for casual aerial shooter fans. Game is stable, pleasant to eye, no serious glitches encountered yet.\nP.S.: I played from 1st person inside cockpit perspective - I always do so.", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_forever": 60, "last_played": 1492194169, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198212321289"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492195105, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501534", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31141077"}, {"timestamp_created": 1495361642, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I GIVE THIS GAME A THUMBS DOWN!\nFor Preference Reasons.\n \nPRO: \nBasic Fly And Shoot'Em Up Game. \nGreat for some Quick Aerial Chopper Flying Fun. \nLeveling Up and Equipment Upgrade Options available. \nSteam Achievment Badges. \nMany Graphics and Game Options.\n@ $3.47 = 13% off, the game is a good bargain.\n \nCON: \nControls are VERY Basic and you CANNOT ReMap the Keyboard! \nI DO NOT USE WASD!!!, which breaks the game for me. \n\nSUMMARY: \nI am a Flight Sim enthusiast and have played many Flight Sim games and Flight Roles with a gaming clan and The Game Dev has provided a decent game with many good features. \nWASD is the standard keyboard map for Most modern games, but the REAL Mark of a Quality Game for me is Game Options to include whether you can ReMap the Keyboard to your liking. \nIf you can get used to the control scheme then you might enjoy this game, but I cannot recommend it if I cannot play it. \n\nFINAL: \nI will revise and update my review to Thumbs Up when I can ReMap The Keyboard to my liking.", "developer_response": "Hi and sorry for the lack of menu to remap controls.
