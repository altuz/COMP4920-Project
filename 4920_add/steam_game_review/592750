{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1505976921, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[u]A brief note[/u]: I just finished the game with a good ending, reading nearly all of the PDAs and collecting all of the masks on my first time through. I decided to make a review of this game since there aren't many reviews of it and I feel that it can be a difficult choice whether to buy it or not based on the store page. I felt that I had enough experience with the game to review it. \n\n[h1]The Positives[/h1]\n\n+ [b]The characters[/b]. Oh my gosh, the characters. The developer did a great job of making the enemies, demons of all things, somehow relatable. They are sometimes cute, sometimes funny, sometimes sexy, a lot of times scary, and everything in between. I adored the way that the characters communicated through the \"social media\" of this game, for it was a very creative and interesting way to build the characters. Not only that, but they look very unique and bizarre. Undoubtedly my favorite part of this game.\n\n+ [b]The imagery[/b]. Some of the things you see in this game, both on the PDAs and in person, are very grotesque. It's the perfect blend of sweet and strange. Very much a \"wtf\" sort of game, but in a positive way.\n\n+ [b]The collectables[/b]. Though vast in number, they do not dissapoint. Unlike other games, this one actually has some more than just an alternate ending going for it's collectables. You feel compelled to pick up the PDAs to be entertained by the many demons in this game, reading their odd conversations with each other. It truly isn't just another needless collectathon, I like that a lot.\n\n[h1]The Neutral[/h1]\n\n+/- [b]The story[/b], though unpresent at first, gradually got a bit interesting. Not too interesting mind you, but I commend the developer for trying to take a generally untouched idea and attempting to make something of it. Still, it felt a bit last second. Without spoiling anything, I can say that the story doesn't really fit in with the gameplay at all, and you only really recognize it through the PDAs, which are so blunt about telling you that they leave nothing to the imagination. The whole story just seemed out of place to me. I liked the concept, but I feel like it could've done a better job at weaving itself in with the game.\n\n+/- [b]The gameplay[/b]. It leaves something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, it gets the job done. A typical run and hide from the monsters game, no more, no less. The camera is a weird, tilted top-down which can get a bit irritating sometimes (getting stuck on walls simply because you can't see them clearly behind your character). The enemy AI is rather stupid and get stuck on many collisions while bigger enemies will often get stuck in smaller doorways. To counter the lack of AI intellegence, the developer seemed to go happy-go-lucky with the enemies, instead opting for quantity over quality. In some areas there are over 15 enemies and your chances of survival seem to be based more on chance. Even with all of these complaints, though, the gameplay is still quite average. Not good, not bad.\n\n[h1]The Negatives[/h1]\n\n[b]The setting[/b]. Oh lord, talk about repetitive. Running down the same dark corriders, confined and quiet. Only two music tracks in the entire game, one only playing when you're in danger. The other only plays on one level. Else than that, the game is DEATHLY QUIET. This is not a good thing. It doesn't help to create an atmosphere or raise fear, it's just... boring. There are like, two interesting areas in the game, both towards the end of it. \n\n[b]The grammatical errors[/b]. This isn't a big one, mind you, because I am not exactly sure if it was intentional or not. The game is riddled with grammatical errors. 'An' where it should be 'a', 'allot' where it should be 'a lot', etc. Small things like this. It's not a biggy, just a small concern. If it is intentional that's fine. I suppose it would add to the reality of these demons making spelling errors on social media.\n\n[u]Overall it's admittedly an average game[/u]. I like it a lot for the characters, they are all so charming and intriguing, and in my opinion they are the beef or \"saving grace\" that makes me adore this game. Yet, I can still see why people can be turned off by it. Gameplay is rather boring, and if you look at the achievement percentages nearly 49% of players who own this game quit after completing the first sector. I like the game a lot, adore it even, but it's just so average. I'd love to see the developer learn from some of these reviews and critiques and improve for his next game. I see he is very social with this game's customers, so I am sure that he will improve the weak points. That is a positive in it's own right. I like the work, and I eagerly await your next game!\n\n5/10", "votes_up": 4, "author": {"num_games_owned": 298, "playtime_forever": 294, "last_played": 1505872480, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057423428"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506152687, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506242", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35098979"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 7, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
