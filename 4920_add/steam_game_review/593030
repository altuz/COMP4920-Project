{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1499842128, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Ibe played this game for 73 hours only 19 days after i bought it (the wife is NOT happy).\nThats how much i like it.\n\nI admit that i was hessitant to buy it at first as its kinda pricey, but man, after 73 hours (and counting) i can say its worth every penny. \nYou see, this game doesnt concentrate its efford in shinny graphics and cool animations, instead it focuses on whats important for a grand strategy game: its gameplay mechanics, enemy AI, and overall desing, and it is brilliant in these aspects. \n\nI love that it manages to be complex, challenging and \"complete\", but with [b] none [/b] of the micromanaging required in other grand strategy games. \nSomehow all the concepts of the game \"make sense\" and are very easy to understand. You dont need to spend 50 hours watching videos and reading some incomplete, outdated \"wiki\" to learn how to play it.\n\nDont get me wrong, the game is simple to understand, but there isnt a simplistic bone in its body. If you expect to win, you [b] have [/b] to consider your military production, diplomacy,  your technological research level, the supply level of your troops, the terrain you are attacking on, their morale, weather, combat readiness, your fighting tactics like encirclement, cutting enemy supply, reinforcing your units, etc. Its all there! But yet somehow the game manages to present all these aspects in a way that is intuitive and easy to understand.\n\nAnother aspect of the game i quite like, is that you can control all the countries on either side, not just their main powers. For example, if playing as Germany, you can control Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, etc. I havent seen other games that allow you to do this.\n\nIf you were to ask me what i dont like about the game? well there aint much. I would like to see more flexibility in the diplomacy department, not to do idiotic stuff like conquering all the world via \"influence\" in a ridiculous matter like \"some\" games allow you to do (e.g. \"influence the ussr to become fasist in one year\" lol yeah right), but to for example keep other countries neutral. Yes i know the game has options to disable/enable each and every scripted event, but i would have prefered it if it had a simple option at start to keep other countries random or neutral. Like previous strategic command titles had.\n\nOverall, i can say that of all the Grand Strategy games i own, this is my favorite so far. If you like WWII Strategy games, i strongly advice you to give it a shot. Also, the support provided by the developers, is simply the best ibe seen in years.

About half the way in I only played on to have something to show for my frustration and to beat the game in spite of its large shortcomings. This game looks like a more in-depth version of the more casual classic \"Clash of Steel\" (CoS), except CoS was much better in the end... \n\nI'm not a grognard but I played my way through games like \"High Command\" or \"Hearts of Iron\" (1 and 2) or Gary Grigsby's original Pacific War/War in the East, etc. I appreciate a good grand strategy game and I know at some point you have to abstract somewhat or even a lot but this game makes all the wrong compromises.\n\nPros:\n* Simple yet fun research system\n* Diplomacy system works (pretty much like CoS except no instant results)\n* Units are upgradeable as technology advances\n* Clean and uncluttered interface\n* Resource management makes nice mix between research, buying new units, shifting units between fronts and overseas\n* You can switch off a lot of scripted events\n* Air cover, interception, and escorts work\n\nCons:\n* Bad performance - AI turns take very long, even saving a game gives you two waits\n* It's scripted - free units for the British when Axis reaches Egypt, no need to attack Norway or Denmark, just click a button \n* Varying turn lengths - instead of properly implemented weather effects turns in winter take longer... yes, it takes longer to build units during the winter...\n* Hot-diggity infantry - entrenchment happens fast and is the biggest obstacle in the game. Dominating factor.\n* No stacking - the biggest limit for support units for the attacker is that each unit takes up one huge hex \n* No coordinated attacks - instead of issuing a common order for all attacking units you have to attack one by one, have the first units absorb lots of losses. also: I hate the unit swapping rule\n* Fog of war off + spotting rule = broken submarines - moving next to a sub results in spotting it\n* Crazy Zone of Control - units with ZoC impede movement around them. Infantry can prevent armor from breaking through gap a because it projects ZoC even \"behind itself.\" (It can even make moving next to it so expensive you can't finish your move next to it.) Makes armored warfare pointless, mostly minor encirclements also because in most places on the map there's no space to maneuver either. In this game armor is mostly useful for striking twice and its high attack value, not so much for bold moves behind enemy lines.\n* Navy has no impact on amphibic assaults - you can evade entire Royal Navy by only moving port-to-port every turn. Only way for RN to prevent: line up in the channel blocking every hex.\n* UK surrender conditions -  You control Egypt. You push through Palestine. You have to push from London all the way up to Scotland to make UK even retreat to Canada. What gives? \n* Don't invade the UK! Any success in Egypt or the UK just gets both the US and the USSR into the war.\n* Game-y AI: Some say the AI is good. I think it's just built to exploit the game's broken entrenchment and ZoC rules.\n* Super-huge support units - Artillery, anti-tank, and air-defense units so big they can fill huge hexes - and nowhere to fit them in any front line. Cannot attach artillery or anti-tank directly to infantry to give it more punch, but can add better \"infantry weapons\" and air defense. \n* Silly scale - Just like the casual CoS infantry armies and corps share the same scale - and only occupy one hex. Also: Infantry corps super expensive\n* Silly air units - you can have four dedicated fully upgraded naval bomber fleets (Germany's max) and they can barely, without enemy fighter cover, sink one battleship without taking moderate losses. Bombers take losses from attacking entrenched infantry with no anti-air of any sort. Bombers can eradicate land units completely from the air - not organization loss, but complete obliteration.\n\nMy list goes on and on, and I might add to it, but the point is: If you don't take it for historic, it might be a game of limited fun. As a \"what if?\" game it lacks appeal because it's so heavily scripted and even turning events off can only do so much. Even more casual games than this have the ability to stack units or do coordinated attacks, or to have some kind of flanking attack. A game that does not support stacking units or has a good flanking rule is pretty much a lost cause to me.\n\nI bought this in spite of the high asking price because my PC can't handle HoI 3 or EU 4 for that matter. Even at half price I would have felt some buyer's remorse. I played a lot of actual strategy titles before and felt kind of misled by other reviews heaping praise on this one.", "votes_up": 16, "author": {"num_games_owned": 108, "playtime_forever": 2026, "last_played": 1501263359, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198033524097"}, "comment_count": "22", "timestamp_updated": 1501278730, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.528271", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33865619"}, {"timestamp_created": 1499840885, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I used to play grand strategy board games back in the day, one of my favorites was Third Reich by Avalon Hill. Ever since I have been searching for a computer game version that captures the same interesting decision making. Most of what is out there right now is pretty bad, and I have tried many. Hearts of Iron was probably the best, but suffered from poor AI, as nearly all of them do. After purchasing one of these games I would immediately test the AI by playing the Allies, because playing Axis at the start of the war requires a very aggressive strategy, which is always the weak point for the AI in these games.\n\nI have to say that the AI in this game performed extremely well. Poland was conquered by October 1939, and France by June 1940, despite my best efforts. After the invasion of the Soviet Union, it went on to capture Leningrad and I finally stopped it just outside the gates of Moscow and Stalingrad. After that I was able to turn the tide and conquer Germany by December 1944. Contrast this with the same experiment I did with Hearts of Iron IV, which took four months to conquer Poland and failed completely to conquer France.\n\nI would definitely say this is the best WWII grand strategy game on Steam right now.
