You play as Fei, a student of criminal investigation.\nThe game has 2 chapters/cases so far. The 1st one is short and basically an introduction to the mainly characters and the game style. The 2nd is longer and very interesting. You have a few puzzles/deductions plus you get to choose how to conduct some conversations based on questions/topics you can talk about.\nLoved the characters in general. There wasn't even one that I disliked. And the art style is awesome too. It's very well made and the characters are beautiful and pleasant to look at.\nThe menu is clean and beautiful as well [loved the color choices]. The PDA function is easy and add a nice touch to the game.\nGlad it was translated to English and the few grammar/spelling errors didn't bother me at all. I got so caught up in the game that I didn't even care.\nMore chapters will be released according to the dev [as DLC apparently]. I will buy them for sure. Eager to see what's gonna happen and hoping for a romance between my 2 favorite characters. ^^\nEven though it's only 2 chapters, the game is worth it's full price. It's not expensive and for the amount of content and entertainment you get, it's definitely fair.\n\n*9.5/10*\n\nNote: You can only save the game when the PDA function becomes available and even then, it's only when experiencing the story as Fei.", "votes_up": 24, "author": {"num_games_owned": 3854, "playtime_forever": 1054, "last_played": 1499651517, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198136969425"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499676137, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.548774", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33420635"}, {"timestamp_created": 1503215682, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Pretty good novel that's quite quick.\nThe puzzles are not always very easy. The inquiry section is also not all that easy (the first time). There are only a few such puzzles and \"action\" segments in this game though.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere and the plot/myster/characters are excellent. Especially true-to-life is the way the main character's friends speak to him and to each other - dialogue filled with friendly mockery and good-natured teasing. It's very rare to see a game portray friendship so effectively in this manner. This game basically makes everyone pretty likeable.\n\nI do wish it was a little longer, but the dev does mention that there is more in the works.", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 310, "playtime_forever": 382, "last_played": 1502833051, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995993650"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1503215682, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503546", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34367814"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 15, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
