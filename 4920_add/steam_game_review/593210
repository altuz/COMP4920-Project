Probably one of the better 'minigame' experiences out there currently imo.\n\nDoesn't have too much variety which makes replayability questionable. However, it is very fun for what it is, so if you just play it once in a while trying to beat your score, it's pretty great.\n\nThere is an endless mode and a 5 minute mode. Both have their own global ranking leaderboards.\n\nMusic is basically what you hear in the trailer. It's a perfect pace for the game, but it's also the only track I think. (It's alright though, given that this game is really only played in short bursts)\n\nGame is easy to learn once you look at all the recipes once. There are like maybe 6 or 7 different dishes to learn.\n\nPROTIP: There are no food/safety inspectors in this game, so ditch the chopsticks and use your hands unless you need precision.", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 467, "playtime_forever": 108, "last_played": 1503172083, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961796167"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502783756, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34251258"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
