{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1504892352, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great and simple mechanics for an action RPG game. Cute, good graphics and music. Very smooth control. Not very grindy, but the side quests are somewhat repetitive. The game is relatively short. You can finish up the main quest in 4 hours. Main + side quests will take about 6 to 7 hours. 100% the game (clearing all dungeons and getting all equipments plus all magic) probably takes about 10 to 12 hours. Appropriate for its price. Highly recommended.\n\n", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1462, "playtime_forever": 634, "last_played": 1504902945, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198114001712"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504892352, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504337", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34819450"}, {"timestamp_created": 1504768772, "received_for_free": false, "review": "So simple yet so addicting!
