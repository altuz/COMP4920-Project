While most programmers these days almost never have to deal with the layered memory constraints this game presents, we often deal with constraints that cause our minds to work in similar ways to how they must here.\n\nI applaud this game and would suggest it to anyone interested in a difficult puzzle, though I do worry about how non-programmers may find some of the problems this game presents: Some are truly tricky. And yet, the things I obtain later on may be the solutions to them; I really can't know yet.\n\nThis game is worth your money.", "votes_up": 17, "author": {"num_games_owned": 345, "playtime_forever": 720, "last_played": 1492298909, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000670266"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1491974966, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.533406", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31091480"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
