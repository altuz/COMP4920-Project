{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1506456788, "received_for_free": false, "review": "For the price I would recommend the game. It's a little bit frustrating more than enjoyable at the moment though. Getting used to the power meter and direction is tricky to start off with. It's hard to stop Gabe going out of bounds as the meter disappears so you can't drag the power back. I think it would probably be better to drag the power in the direction you are going rather than backwards. \nI would like to be able to move the map around to see where soldiers and notes are or have a mini guide on the screen marking things out. Sometimes you waste a few moves trying to find objects. \nIt would also be nice to have your goals indicated on the game screen. When you reach 1 star, 2 star and 3 stars it should indicate this on the game screen rather than you having to guess whether you have reached 3 stars or not. It could also show you how many guards you have lleft to kill.\nI found it very confusing as to what you are allowed to land on and what you pass through. On numerous occassions I left poor Gabe to tumble to his peril because I thought he was going to land on a piece of earth only to watch him go straight through it. If you can't land on it then it shouldn't be there. \nThe game is reasonably fun however and looks like it gets more difficult as you progress. \nI would try before you buy.", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 6276, "playtime_forever": 34, "last_played": 1506456969, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "steamid": "76561198017076824"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506456788, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35229472"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 7, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
