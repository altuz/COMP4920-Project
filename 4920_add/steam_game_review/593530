Trying to manage moving your tank, selecting weapons, and angling the gun barrel all using the keyboard sucks. It's really hard to accurately use artillery because you can't smoothly select an angle for the gun by using keys. \n\nOf course the AI doesn't have this issue and can accurately track you and continue peppering you with projectiles while you struggle to lob a close shot from far away.\n\nThis game really needs mouse support or something to refine the gun angle...", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_forever": 28, "last_played": 1501173458, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197981871713"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501173786, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.495146", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33836552"}, {"timestamp_created": 1502906797, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It broken to the point of not being playable on many machines. oh and if you do get it to run it sucks. bad controls, no way to tell were aiming or how much power behind shell, bad not functinal AI, broken physics, gets stuck driving across flat land or small bumbs, physics engine decides its time for you die and while nothing touches you or anything you explode. Then lets no forget it originally had a low over rating on here then a bunch of obvious spam accounts started spamming reddit with posts about it. brand new accounts, ones clearly set up for advertising, etc. then so many of those genertic. lame and totally not sponsored reviews showed up on steam. Its gotten bad on r/gaming now because these devs are pushing a bad game hard. r/gaming has it well documented now as to whats wrong with all of this. oh go check out steamcharts and see how this game rarely ever has more then one person at a time playing its because it suchs and the reviews are fake", "votes_up": 2, "author": {"num_games_owned": 256, "playtime_forever": 24, "last_played": 1502905599, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030786878"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502906958, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500187", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34281193"}, {"timestamp_created": 1502086967, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This was a waste of money there is no way for me to move the camera.
