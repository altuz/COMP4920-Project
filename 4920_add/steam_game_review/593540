On the easiest difficulty, it's not timed, which makes it great for kids, beginners, or those of us who just needs something relaxing to play at the end of the day. Runs great on Linux and it's hard to beat the price. \n\nThe only con is that the English (at least) localization is *terrible*. I mean, some of the dialogue borders on  All Your Base territory. Fortunately, the story isn't all that important to enjoying the game and I just choose to be amused by it. Guess you could also use it to show the kids the importance of good grammar if you don't want to look/sound silly. :)", "votes_up": 6, "author": {"num_games_owned": 167, "playtime_forever": 717, "last_played": 1497278341, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197991391480"}, "comment_count": "2", "timestamp_updated": 1494865458, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.510737", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "31771826"}, {"timestamp_created": 1498682708, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Elven Legend 2: The Bewitched Tree isn't as good as the first Elven Legend. Why did you change from the cute graphics of the first game? The graphics in this game are a step backwards, imo. The gameplay is way too easy! There is no challenge, except to go back and replay if you want grind for acheivements. The voice acting is cheesey and the story is well, not good. The music is sleep inducing and as boring as the gameplay is, I found myself dosing off several times. I'm very disappointed with this game.

This one . . . is somehow creepy. If there was a neutral option I would hit that, but I feel that people should know what they are buying and this game just doesn't gel somehow - maybe just too rushed to finish. Don't know. \n\nCons:\n*The text/story is really terrible with very very bad English. \n\n*The voice acting is overboard. \n\n* The story doesn't hold together and at each stage it feels as if someone was working really hard to get to all 40 levels. \n\n*The cute little worker who used to say \"I just love my work\" doesn't anymore. \n\nI got to lvl 29, all 3 stars but just feel that I would rather waste my time doing something, anything else.", "votes_up": 4, "author": {"num_games_owned": 278, "playtime_forever": 382, "last_played": 1497784645, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198033102868"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498649925, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.509286", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32929409"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
