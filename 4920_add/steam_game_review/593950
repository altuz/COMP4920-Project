This. \"Game.\"\n\nIf I tried to make a shitty ass game like this in what looks like RPG maker 2003 I'd have to at least fucking try to make it this bad. The voice acting, I will say, is spot on, and I truly love what sounds like you making rasberry noices in your armpit to simulate the sound of lightning. I regret playing every god damn second of this game, as at least I could have been playing Bloody Boobs, a game that looks like a new fucking AAA battlefield game compared to this steaming pile of horse shit that you put though a meat grinder. I spent more time writing this review than the deveoper did when deciding what would be a good topic for a fucking video game. Every copy of this game should be buried deep in the Gobi Desert along with every single god damn copy of ET for Atari.\n\nTL;DR: Fuck you, fuck this, and I hope I'll be able to ask Satan what he thinks of this game because I hope he's the only other person who will have to fucking play it.\n\nThank you for making my eyeballs experice a worse strain than when I went to the the Emoji Movie.
