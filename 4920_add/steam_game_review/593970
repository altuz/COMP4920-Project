Pretty decent graphics for what it is and the sound effects are realistic.\n\nA bit more of an indication that you've destroyed an enemy ship would be cool, fireballs or something in the distance, could be an optional setting to allow people to put them end to end.\n\nThe upcoming multiplayer should be awesome as would local multiplayer utilising both the VR and none VR worlds (not sure if this is on the roadmap?).\n\n[spoiler]Ohhh and is missing that all important line ...\"You sunk my battleship\"[/spoiler]\n\n(edit) Please add support so it can be repositioned to a seating position rather standing only... or did I miss an option somewhere?", "votes_up": 4, "author": {"num_games_owned": 561, "playtime_forever": 18, "last_played": 1489770443, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197963747273"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1489770579, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505905", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30572408"}, {"timestamp_created": 1489795841, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I saw this game when it was in Greenlight. It is good to see that it came through. Since then there is a huge improvement in graphics which was the primary concern back then. It is certain that the developers had considered the feedback that is given there.\n\nModels of the ships and the water reflection is stunning. Most VR games do not use water like that so that's a first for me.\nAnimations are also nice but I wished that ships kept burning after sinking (the parts above the water at least).\n\nThere is need for improvement nonetheless. Terrain looks a little dull and empty but I personally don't care then again some people might.\nAlso I cannot wait to see the multiplayer of this. There is a comment on moving the board around and I totally agree. The area in which you play must be movable somehow. Timing between the turns may be a little shorter but it is a minor thing.\n\nAs a battleship enthusiast I played VR Battle Grid as well but I can tell you that this one is way better considering the graphics, interaction with the ships and implementation. That's why I cannot understand people who didn't try the game but say that it is a cheap copy. To those people I wanna say try it out first. It is a good game and obviously a lot of thought and effort was put into the game. \n\nI specifically liked how you can place your ships as you wish unlike the random case in VR Battle Grid. I believe anyone who likes to play battleship knows that you shouldn't know which ship or which part of the ship you hit. That is where the logic and the fun of the game is. This game implements these aspects as well.\n\nPeople may not like the battleship game itself but as far as the implementation and the effort goes this game does a good job. I will try and update my review in case of an update.\n\nSo first play the game fellas. It definitely worths the price. Highly recommended.\n", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_games_owned": 97, "playtime_forever": 28, "last_played": 1489857279, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025684900"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1489795841, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503493", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30579879"}, {"timestamp_created": 1489784184, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Overall it is a decent game which worths its price. Considering the difficulties of game design, this game is pretty good and meets the expectations.\n\nPros: \n- Ship and water graphics are very realistic. I liked how ships are hit and sunk.\n- Sound effects are also satisfactory.\n- Immersive gameplay, the feeling of being in the environment is well thought.\n- Aiming and missiles are quite enjoyable actually.\n\nCons:\n- Developers can work on the terrain to make it look better.\n- There should be an option to support seated play as well.\n- There is only one background music which gets to you after a while but it is not a big minus which can be arranged I believe.\n\nSuggestions:\n- Multiplayer option could bring the game to another level.\n- Difficulty levels against a computer opponent may be introduced.\n- Some achievements and rewards may be nice as well.\n\nAll in all it is a fun game which has VR fundementals.
