{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1502088239, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Before saying what I'm about to I want to mention that I did enjoy Crazy Fishing, albeit for a short time. It's a good arcade fishing game and the fish design, progression and mechanics are solid and unique. There aren't many bugs, visuals are pretty and clear, it runs well and overall it's a well made game.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with it, though, is content and replayability. Money is incredibly easy to come by and you end up affording the highest tier gear and bait within about an hour and a half. The rest of the gameplay is managing which bait you store, trying to unlock the rest of the fish and exploring. Exploring everything takes maybe another half hour. In about 3 hours I experienced pretty much everything there is to experience. There is treasure around the map as well as chests you can open with keys but in my experience they're entirely worthless after about an hour of playing.\n\nIn the end it is a good game with promising concepts but suffers from a lack of content and replayability which left me unsatisfied with spending $20 on it. I personally wouldn't pay more than $10. If you're okay with only getting a few hours out of it or just really find fishing relaxing and enjoyable then it's probably worth it, otherwise I recommend you wait for a sale or pass.", "developer_response": "Appreicate the time you took for the review. The adventure was something we had to tweak fair amount. The game started with a very heavy progress pathway (took a while to grind and it took ages to progress) but we learned what was most enjoyable for the players and testers was the ability to travel the world and find all the fish. We considered making the game harder, but in the end, we felt players didn't like 'grinding' in VR as much as we had hoped, and I understand your sentiment about the difficulty.", "votes_up": 4, "author": {"num_games_owned": 660, "playtime_forever": 199, "last_played": 1500693746, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198029390738"}, "comment_count": "1", "timestamp_updated": 1502709644, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502065", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1502601848, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34075918"}, {"timestamp_created": 1502758410, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I cant put anything on the hook smh", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 131, "last_played": 1502591950, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198157295535"}, "comment_count": "1", "timestamp_updated": 1502758410, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34246551"}, {"timestamp_created": 1499790105, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I will Change this review to \"Recommended\" if the bait hook bug is ever fixed.\n\nSomehow during the tutorial it's possible to bug the game so you cannot bait the hook.
