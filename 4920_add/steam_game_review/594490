When multiplayer is implemented all the other archery games will have nothing on this!  The aim feels really good and has some variation for different preferences however the arrow physics are a little on the arcade side and don\u2019t feel as good as long bow.  That's just a design choice though.  It is wave based but you're allowed to move around the maps freely.  Don't buy this if you don\u2019t want to move around much because the fast pace combined with a constant bombardment of spears you have to doge will have you tuckered out in a few minutes.  Traps add a bit of a strategy element to the game that's fun to play around with!  You can even upgrade them!  If you can't get head shots you're certainly going to die!", "votes_up": 5, "author": {"num_games_owned": 305, "playtime_forever": 238, "last_played": 1494791825, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019046685"}, "comment_count": "1", "timestamp_updated": 1493577251, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499693", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31469963"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
