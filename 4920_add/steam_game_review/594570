As a kid in the mid 90's the amazing world of Warhammer Fantasy was simply out of my reach financially. I had about 20 pewter models and they were not even painted, but boy did I cherish them. I would stare at the big Games Workshop catalog in awe, dreaming of commanding armies in lush battlefields.\n\nIn Total War: Warhammer I got to play out my childhood dreams of this.\n\nThe world map is massive, and as a 40k fan at heart I admit to my ignorance of the New World locales. The launch playable races are the Lizardmen,Dark Elves,High Elves, and the Skaven. Each of these four factions has two different leaders to choose from as of today on September 28, 2017.\n\nThe large amount of quests,missions, and side story content (Some of which is voice acted) is very nice albit a little confusing at times. Currently only Vortex mode is out but I believe a sandbox style map will be available in the future.\n\nUnit animations are clearly a step up from the previous title and is quite pleasant to look at during the Chaos of battle. My only gripe so far is the strange AA effect on the trees in the world map regardless of the setting. (Which is FXAA, MSAA 2x/4x)\n\nSiege battles, which were nortoriously laggy on Warhammer 1 seem to be much improved and considerably better looking than the first. I even saw some background pillars and arches fall down during the melee fighting underneath them in an Elven city.\n\nMy GPU is a 1080, and my CPU is a mid-range 4690k@4.6Ghz and I pull around 100fps on the world map, and about a solid 80 in battles. Of course this is with everything on Ultra and 4x MSAA @ 1080p.\n\nI really enjoyed the first title, and so far I'm really enjoying this followup.", "votes_up": 623, "author": {"num_games_owned": 39, "playtime_forever": 1502, "last_played": 1507190893, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1502, "steamid": "76561197971196625"}, "comment_count": "8", "timestamp_updated": 1506640361, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.793878", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 131, "votes_funny": 15, "recommendationid": "35258037"}, {"timestamp_created": 1506660516, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I really wish there was a better ranking system than Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down from these.  The game is a great expansion on the original TWW.  However, all the new and bright shiny things don't take away from the core problems with the series as a whole and introduces a few new ones.   The long list of grievances will be in bullet point format.\n\n*  Building an empire with an ally is still very limited.  Let them grow with you and they will never confederate despite you being over 200 rating with them and being 10+ ranks lower than you.\n\n*  The new mechanic added is absolute nightmare if you want to do more than sit in a small territory playing spread sheet simulator (aka Romance of the 3 Kingdoms).  The first couple rituals are not bad but, after the third they spawn massive 20 stack armies in random spots all over your empire and go on a rampage attacking the most obscure outposts that have nothing to do with the channeling event.  The worst part is you can see how the factions that need to do the hiring are losing out and are definitely not sitting on a stockpile of gold (10K to be able to summon such twinked out armies).\n\n*  There still is no way to broker territory exchanges between allies.  Leaving both people with half completed regions.\n\n*  The game is too massive in map size (hard time calling it a con as it feels great exploring it). Though it will leave you infighting amongst your own race more than you will even encounter any of the others.  Minus some small incursions here and there.  Except during the channeling ritual.\n\n*  Garrisons in cities cannot defend lands they are protecting.  Despite them now being 20 stack armies when a chain is fully walled and upgraded.\n\n*  Allied AI bee lines for objectives you need for campaign when they can not even participate. The resources for the channeling ritual are not shared between allies, which I can't wait for a \nmod to fix.\n\n*  The worst by far.  20 Stack to win.  There really needs to be a pacing mechanic in which everyone (player and AI) cannot field 20 stack armies until later in the game.  Until perhaps they conquered enough territories to support a massive military complex.  As it stands its whoever has the most 20 stacks is rank one and can auto resolve to victory.  Even adding a mechanic of supply and replacement lines would greatly counter this.  Assigning these routes could allow  for local recruitment bonuses at the front and allow weaker nations to contribute to war efforts by disrupting them with smaller armies in skirmish based scenarios.\n\nTLDR - Mods are needed to make this a great game.  As it stands CA did a great job expanding on the TWW universe.  While mods will be needed to make the game truly enjoyable as a game about waging war (much like all their titles).  While drifting further into spreadsheet simulator in some enjoyable ways yet, they unfortunately don't add to the war experience.

Oh, really?[/h1]\nThis is the second installment of the trilogy that envelops the world of Warhammer to Total War franchise. And CA is doing a marvellous job so far. The game learned from the past mistakes and remedy things that were wierd, wrong or just uncovinient but there are also matters that are still the same pain and anguish like in previous titles. \nOverall, the game feels already like an improvement, valued datadisc of old times (where datadiscs were distributed on CD's and had been worked on for years, promised a lot of content) and proper DLC rather than a separate new game. This is exactly it, a big addition to concept from Warhammer 1. Warhammer II is a just more enjoyable to play, offers a new big map and overall portrays a much better characterization than the earlier title. The in-game cinematics are just bliss for a fan of Warhammer. The promise of the combined campaign (Mortal Empires) and/or a more like sandbox mode is most intriguing  and I sincerely hope it will be implemented in full.\nSome of the issues remained, as mentioned before: the long loading times, the DLC policy (so damn MANY times cried about in the forum section), somewhat clueless AI if you come with some cheesy or un-standart strategy, early release optimalization issues, siege battles (personally I don't really complain that loud about sieges, HERETIC I know)\n\nIn conclusion, the game is solid and if you liked previous game, this one is for you with an extra sauce. Also, all three parts of the trilogy should be combined to some degree. This naturally goes with more troubles - game engine must remain the same as well the optimalization must go insane (to work with so many data even on mediocre rig)\n\n[b]Dissclaimer:[/b]You don't like fantasy or price tag on this Total War game? Don't buy it then, wait for the next historic title (already work in progress) or wait for sale. Easy. Abolition of this theme would make your money related \"game\" review less dumb ;) Also considering amount of content, licensing of GW (damn pricy) and not copy-paste factions than in historic ones,  I can fairly understand they want to make some dime out of it. Quality is there people! I got my worth of AAA title in literally hundreds hours of gameplay. Which other franchise can offer me that? Which other can make Warhammer world live?\n\n+ Storyline. New and original game win objective as well the cinematics, that goes with it.\n+ General gameplay. Smooth action, newbie friendly with proper step-by-step tutorial.\n+ Great graphic. Early release could use more optimalization though.\n+ Campaign and enviroments. More shipping action and treasures in the sea!\n+ New races. Playable lizardmen, skavens, high elves and dark elves - for two faction lords each + races from WH1 (as minor AI factions and hopefully fully implemented on combined map). Also new races have all some twist th\n+ New lores of magic. \n+ A lot of changes - thankfuly to more good than worse (level 40 cap, more unique skill trees for legendary lords, you don't deploy your heroes to get passive bonuses etc. etc.)\n+ CA listened to community and modders - plenty of stuff obviously tweaked by community or inspired by popular mods\n+ Battle maps. More variety of features in enviroment when you fight\n+ FLC. Free updates and content to come.\n+- DLC policy. New content - addition, extra things. You don't really have to own them to enjoy it (your game, AI will have new faction/lords/units etc. anyway) but its expected for game to have fair amount of these!\n+- Same game engine but more polished. Its obvious though that this is needed for compability of trilogy\n- Early release version of game optimalization\n- Siege battles (yeah, yeaht, this old rant again)\n\n9,5/10 [i]\"Queek is the best!

Content is certainly more than in launch of the prequel already, but if 4 playable races aren't enough for you, wait for a GOTY.\n\n", "votes_up": 26, "author": {"num_games_owned": 286, "playtime_forever": 1662, "last_played": 1506850642, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1662, "steamid": "76561197971725642"}, "comment_count": "5", "timestamp_updated": 1506789827, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.532204", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35345686"}, {"timestamp_created": 1506682011, "received_for_free": false, "review": "You can have dinosaurs.\n\nYou can have dinosaurs that ride bigger dinosaurs.\n\nThose dinosaurs can cast magic\n\n11/10 Possibly the best Total War game", "votes_up": 94, "author": {"num_games_owned": 6443, "playtime_forever": 4059, "last_played": 1507112424, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4059, "steamid": "76561198126110464"}, "comment_count": "1", "timestamp_updated": 1506682011, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.564496", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 52, "votes_funny": 100, "recommendationid": "35289244"}, {"timestamp_created": 1506811756, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A returning total war fan and this game is perfect. 10/10", "votes_up": 58, "author": {"num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_forever": 1373, "last_played": 1507176432, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1373, "steamid": "76561198252240464"}, "comment_count": "4", "timestamp_updated": 1506811756, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.536079", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 27, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "35356733"}, {"timestamp_created": 1507107865, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Improvement over TW:Warhammer in every way.  Campaign is really satisfying to progress through keeps you playing endlessly in the 'just one more turn' kind of way. The new vortex win mechanic is a blast. Puts pressure on you to not only complete missions but to expand, capture key locations, forge alliances and intervene in other races progress. That being said you can't just abandon your homelands either or you might end up paying the chaos price. Makes for some interesting decisions. \n\nPlayed through as dark elfs and fufilled my game of thrones fantasy of having 3 dragons in one army. I'd like to see more races come in and probably could have done with 2 more in the base game but still a great time. \n\nThe map itself feels absolutely massive, just kept on giving. The layout was clearly inspired by earth but thats not a bad thing. I also enjoy the weather/habitable mechanic because it makes you stop and consider other options then just purely brute forcing & capturing everything in sight.", "votes_up": 25, "author": {"num_games_owned": 178, "playtime_forever": 2506, "last_played": 1507187048, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2506, "steamid": "76561197970016526"}, "comment_count": "1", "timestamp_updated": 1507108151, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.532936", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35466747"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 1761, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 193, "total_positive": 1568, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
