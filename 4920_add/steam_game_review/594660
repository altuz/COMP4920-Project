It's fairly decent in terms of a choose your own adventure for the most part, on par with the rest, but it suffers from a couple big flaws;\n\n1. Some choices might instant kill you anti-climatically, and if you're not a fan of that, this game might piss you off. I died on my first playthrough, and I felt all my hard work had been wasted.\n2. The author refers to any character that doesn't have an pre-mentioned gender as zhe/zheir. While I applaud being progressive about non-binary gender identity, it feels forced and irritating at some points, especially considering they/them/their works just fine, and it seems the author goes out of the way to not assign gender to characters, ranging from important characters that you see a lot of, to guards that you might see once or twice. Instead of feeling like a smooth and refreshing vacation from gender norms, it feels like it's trying to push the message down your throat far harder than it needs to and just becomes jarring and awkward.\n\nIf the two above things don't bother you, then go ahead and try this out. However, if either of those sound like they'd ruin the experience for you, I wouldn't waste my money.", "votes_up": 5, "author": {"num_games_owned": 188, "playtime_forever": 87, "last_played": 1488850813, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198078492068"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498290769, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.490845", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32715886"}, {"timestamp_created": 1498675494, "received_for_free": false, "review": "*Before starting the game.(To myself)  This looks like a fun game, i get to raise my own little gryphon.\n(10Minutes into the game)  I want to kill all these Fledglings.\n(After getting an egg)   This is mine, there is many like it but this is mine!\n(After hatching)   Omg Omg Omg Omg.

They posted a link and blurb on IFDB.tads.org: \"Steal and raise a baby war gryphon!\"\n\nThat was all I needed to read. I couldn't hit \"BUY\" fast enough. I was that Fry meme, incarnate. SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY.\n\nBut unlike CoG's \"SLAMMED!\", which sucked me into the story to the point where I *lived through it, mannnn!* (and you should really buy SLAMMED! immediately), I just couldn't get my head into this game (and I really wanted to, see para. 2). I had a really hard time keeping track of who was who and what everybody's different griffin looked like (which is, I think, kind of important when visualizing the story). tl;dr The writing just didn't generate strong enough mental pictures for me and I couldn't stay engaged.\n\nThen I died before (I think) any real adventure started. So I hung it up, meaning to try another day and...I just haven't.\nSo it is with heavy heart I say that I can't recommend this game even though you get to raise a baby griffin.

The story was enjoyable and the characters were interesting enough but it doesn't go farther than that. Read it in about 2 hours which is a respectable time.\n\nIt just felt like it could have used more description of the world around your character if that makes sense. I wanted to know more about the world as I read, about the war between the gryphon riders and wrym riders, why they were fighting and such but it just doesn't seem to come (It may be in a different route than the one I had to be fair). It's no sin that it doesn't describe every single detail in every scene as COG games tend to be less descriptive and not novel-length but a few more details to the world could have really spiced up the world a bit.\n\nTo talk about a positive, all the characters have a good amount of personality. They acted as friends and foes when applicable and had their own personalities which was really nice since I've seen some COG games have characters as nothing but boards to bounce exposition off or things for your character to bang but this was certainty not one of those. The dialogue was all well written too.\n\nSomething that's a unique problem I'd like to talk about just because it's unique, this was the first COG game I've read (to my memory) that uses the gender neutral terms ze, zer, and such. I have no initial problem with that, diversity is fine and all but the problem lies in that I know what a he looks like, a her too so when my character meets a characters and they're mentioned as one of those, I can conjure a picture of them in my head. Unfortunately, I don't know what a ze/zer looks like and in a game that's really light on the details as mentioned before, I can't picture this ze/zer character in my head. Not describing every detail of a character is usually fine because I feel you're meant to imagine them as you want but there's usually some details to at least give you some feel for them, like hair length or something but there's no details like that in this game for any character, boy, girl, or other. It was just odd to me, I didn't have any idea what these few characters should look like in my head so I pictured them as featureless, bald people. Maybe these is just a problem exclusive to me, I'm not sure but I felt like it was an interesting thing to mention. \n\nOverall, the game is fine and if you're a fan of other COG games I'd say give it a try if the setting seems interesting but if this is your first COG game I wouldn't say it's a good jumping in point, probably would want to try some more well regarded ones first.

Why is there tumblrisms in this game? I would have really preferred to stick to real genders unless there was a game/alternate reality reason as to why there is a third gender instead of it just being thrown in. It was a bit immersion breaking, and I found myself quickly skimming each of those sections because it was just so strange to see in a real game.
