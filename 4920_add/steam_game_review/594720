Played the frist game in 80 minutes, no bugs, no glitches and I rule the galaxy.  A story line with a narrative about the planets and what they produce and consume would be nice.  The comodities traded are almost tongue in cheek ..... ( Ties ??? ,.... must be the GQ of Galaxies) ......But for the price ( $3.29 ) the cost of a late' ....... It is fun,  Simple, random fun.
