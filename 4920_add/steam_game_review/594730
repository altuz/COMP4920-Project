That is ok.\nThere is some cringy voice acting and the game feels sluggish and slow. That is ok.\nOnly one of the choices presented is right, all others are instant death for you. That is ok.\nThe game is one dimensiona and the shooter segemnts are way to long. that is ok.\n\nWhat is not ok, is the way that VR is implemented. The \"Look at things\" control style is not very satisfying and the complet lack of usage for the controlers is pretty bad. Also if you get motion sick easly: Let this be a warning! There are some crazy scenes in this game that might make you very sick!\n\nThe game is only couple of bucks, and if you enjoy these kind of games or are a fan of \"so bad, it's good\" material, then by any means, get it. I would not recomend it.", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_forever": 29, "last_played": 1496493432, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198015528525"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505723579, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503214", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35041326"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 71, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 23, "total_positive": 48, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
