You have to move giant orb (Super Amazeball?) around with your hands and will the small ball to where you want it to go.  Obviously, I wish there were more tracks.  But the tracks are well crafted and I haven't even tried hardcore mode and definitely didn't get close to the top of leadboards on any of them.  Wish I could listen to my own music, but the in-game music is decently good.\n\nRate 7/10 (at $9.99 normal price, would be 5/10)", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 15, "last_played": 1504501150, "num_reviews": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504501552, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500511", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34727855"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 8, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
