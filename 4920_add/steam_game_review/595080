This game is absolutely amazing. This game came right out of nowhere for me and blew each and every one of my expectations away. This game is a masterpiece on all fronts. The controls feel so tight and the environments are beautiful. The characters have personality and even the music does too. Exploration and success is rewarding, and the story is intriguing. The level design is so well put together and all of the little helpful tools in a platformer that didn't NEED to be in the game are in the game to generally improve the player's experience and reduce backtracking & visibility errors (graphical and level design-al). There are so many cool mechanics that are introduced using a nice difficulty curve. Was totally worth my $15. 9.5/10", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_games_owned": 379, "playtime_forever": 619, "last_played": 1504838682, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079476296"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504579411, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502172", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34748402"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 9, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
