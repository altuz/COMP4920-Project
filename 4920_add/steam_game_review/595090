{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1506800607, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I am only now playing this on September 30, 2017 and my review reflects the game's current status.  I paid $5.99 on steam sale for this game.  I am rating the game at that price.  I played this on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers.  The only setting I changed was to enable the right controller joystick to allow for turning (I think by default it's for strafing only).  [b]No teleporting for me.[/b]  I played solo and normal difficulty.\n\nAll I have to say is that the reviews are wrong about this game.  They may have been correct before, but I did not experience any crashes or bugs at all.  The interface I didn't find to be difficult at all.  Could it have been better?  Sure, but it didn't take much time to get used to it and didn't take away from my fun factor.  The graphics are not PS2 era, please stop with the exaggerations.  Could the graphics be more modern?  Sure, but I don't know of a procedurally generated VR dungeon crawler that looks significantly better.  Could the dungeons be more imaginative?  Yes, but again then I doubt it could be done procedurally generated (maybe that amazing game we all want will come out soon, but it hasn't in VR yet).  Each dungeon that I visited did have enough differences that it didn't feel like I was just visiting the same places over and over again.  Each weapon gave combat a different feel. \n\nI think the game can be a little too easy on normal.  I definitely suggest a higher difficulty if you have any gaming experiences with dungeon crawlers.  I do agree that the combat can be a little too simple.  You definitely get a huge combination of weapons and magic to fight enemies.  The weapons have different attacks.  However, you can mow most enemies down with normal attacks (at least on normal difficulty).  The enemies are either melee and they rush towards you or ranged and they stay in one spot and shoot at you.  Bosses seem to be just bigger versions with more health and more damaging attacks.  Enemy types do vary widely (rats, birds, bats, orcs, etc.) More tactics are needed (maybe this happens later on or at higher difficulties).  The good news is that you do level up and get new skills and abilities and access to new weapons as you do.  Leveling happened at a pretty brisk rate.\n\nThere is loot all over the place.  That's one thing the game definitely got right.  Definitely gets you motivated to go on to the next dungeon for more loot.  All the weapons I played with had different gesture based attacks on top of the normal one.  I definitely think this game is more fun if you go for the alternate attacks versus using the cheap normal ones.  The animations of these special gesture based attacks are well done.  Most of the weapons also looked very nice.  The quests didn't seem varied (get X, collect X amount, Kill X).  However, I liked how there was no grinding, it was basically clear this area out then [b] hold on to menu button for 3 seconds to get back to the bar for a new quest [/b].  Rinse and repeat.\n\nIn the end, I had a lot of fun. This is a good VR dungeon crawler.  I could definitely see improvements that could be made, but it's definitely worth the current price and even better at its sale price.  Don't listen to the haters.\n\nSale price rating: 7/10", "votes_up": 2, "author": {"num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 83, "last_played": 1506803761, "num_reviews": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 83, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506803868, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502609", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35351849"}, {"timestamp_created": 1504746918, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The Developer is very active and puts out a lot of patches and updates.
