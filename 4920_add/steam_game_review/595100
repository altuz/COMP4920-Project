The overall feel and look of the game is fine, but the game design is a bit prohibitive to have too much fun.\n\nThe 'customization' is severely throttled by the fact that your entire progression is gated by pick-ups.  If you find plenty of goodies and upgrades in a level, chances are you either won't be able to pick them up, from lack of storage space, or can't equip them, due to lack of power.  The only way to upgrade your inventory space and Power Capacity (used for equipping boosts that do things like increase damage, ROF, max Health, etc) is to either find them sparsely scattered on the floor, or hoping that a vending machines spawns to buy them.  \n\nYou can sell power ups for Nanites (cash), but this becomes a chore thanks to upgrades not being marked on the map and the inability to mark the map.  Even so, muling items back to a vending machine to sell is a bore since you're often required to do this 1 piece at a time, which creates a slog that shouldn't otherwise be present in an old school shooter.  \n\nKilling enemies feels unrewarding, since they don't seem to drop ammo, health, or money, and you can't just run past many of them due to their speed.  I know that games like Doom and Quake didn't have lootpinatas for enemies, but they sometimes drop supplies here and there...and besides, those games didn't have an upgrade system anyways.\n\nYOu have 3, and only 3, weapons to look forwards to. The cannon, the launcher, and your blade.  The cannon and launcher do the same amount of damage, I believe, though the grenade can splash.  The melee weapon seems too dangerous to use as a lot of enemies can kill you rather quickly if you want to go toe to toe.  The small selection of the weapons wouldn't be a problem, given that they are highly tweakable with various power-ups...but then, slotting power-ups are a pain in the ass, so the selection gets tired really quickly.  Found a couple of damage upgrades, ROF, and spred for your cannon?  Choose 1 and maybe you can salvage the rest.  Maybe you can equip another one if you find a Power upgrade, chances are you wont.\n\nThe control scheme for weapons is highly suspect, with your left mouse assigned to your cannon and cannon only.  Middle mouse selects your melee weapon, nad middle mouse fires.  The same is true for the launcher, which is bound to right button.  A simple binding to 1,2,3, would've sufficed and I'm not particularly found of the control scheme, here. \n\nThis game's design theory would work fantasically, in my opinion, if one of the following changes were made:\n\n-Increase starting inventory size to maybe a full row?  Or at least greater than 2\n-Increase starting power to 3, this feels like it would be a nice happy point where you have some room to try things out wihout having to leave 4-6 upgrades lying around a stage that you have no idea when you might be able to use them.\n\nOR\n\n-Since it already has a rogue-lite/rpg feel, enemies rewarding something like XP would fit in fine. WIth levels up awarding a pick of a Power slot, Inventory Slot, or some sort of potluck pick like refilling HP/Ammo, or dropping a random upgrade.  The player would only get to pick 1 from this short list per level up, and would provide another way of upgrading your character in conjunction with drops found around the game.\n\nMaybe you'll fun with it, though, and for 5 bucks you won't be out that much.  For now, though, I can't recommend giving it a spin until some changes are made.", "votes_up": 23, "author": {"num_games_owned": 310, "playtime_forever": 34, "last_played": 1491975582, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972227301"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1491976447, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.546160", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31091699"}, {"timestamp_created": 1492447383, "received_for_free": false, "review": "CTHON is a roguelike Wolfenstein 3D-esque FPS with excellent presentation, featuring a very creepy and ambient soundtrack and strong sprite work, and even some good writing: A rarity in the genre. It features an inventory-based progression system that allows you to increase things like health, weapon damage and movement speed via finding or purchasing upgrades. I am especially fond of how equipping some upgrades alters the appearance of your weapons and hud. The creator did alot with what I imagine to be limited resources. The atomsphere combined with your low starting health made the game feel genuinely tense- although maybe more then I'd like.\n\nHowever, I can't say this game is finished, and I mean that in a nice way. As it stands the low price is very reasonable, but with some more work this could easily be a ten dollar game. Aside from a nasty crash that ended my couple of runs that was fixed right after I asked about it, I think some changes to the mechanics are in order. In particular, the highly restrictive nature of the progression system means you are limited not only by inventory space but by power consumption, ensuring you will not be able to pick up every upgrade you come across, and of the ones you do, you will not be able to use them all. Getting the most of your items necessitates finding secret areas, and despite a hint from the dev to check dead ends, I found only one secret out of seven. Some kind of visual tell, like the cracked walls in Ziggurat or the slight discolorations you would see in Doom would be nice. Overall, the inventory system makes the game feel harder then it actually should be- otherwise, the combat feels pretty good. I see the reasoning behind a three-weapon system with three corresponding classes, but given the sheer variety of weapons sprite-shooters typically had, some more guns might be in order. \n\nCTHON is faithful to its roots and worth the five bucks if you like 90s FPSes and wish to invest in the future of a promising entry in the genre.", "votes_up": 2, "author": {"num_games_owned": 391, "playtime_forever": 497, "last_played": 1507130755, "num_reviews": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 52, "steamid": "76561197970739339"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492537575, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504183", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31202866"}, {"timestamp_created": 1491672388, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you're like me, and you were weened on the Wolf3d, Blake Stone, Corridor 7, and Doom (or a nasty Mac user who liked Marathon!), then this is right up your alley!\n\nIt has procedural generation of levels, unique audio cues for enemy types, an interesting (almost System Shock) style vibe to it, and all of the corridor-strafing fun of those other classic games.\n\nThe levels are not overly huge, can be tackled in about 10-20 minutes each, and have that simple, old-style charm that I think today's games lack for all their graphical and gimmicky ways.\n\nSo, if you enjoy the classic style FPS, pick this one up and take a stroll down new, but familiar, halls with you ears cocked for the idle sounds of lurking enemies and your eyes peeled for that ever-precious ammo.", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 384, "playtime_forever": 318, "last_played": 1496531969, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197962721376"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1491672388, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31022249"}, {"timestamp_created": 1495595117, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I'm a huge fan of the artwork here.
