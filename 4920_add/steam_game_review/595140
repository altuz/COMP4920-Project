{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1505741057, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you look at the market for Rogue-like/lite FPS games there isn\u2019t really a lot going on. There are classics like Ziggurat, Tower of Guns, Heavy Bullets and more recent attempts like Strafe. Overall this genre feels pretty niche though and that\u2019s really a shame, because it can be so good if done right. And this is where Immortal Redneck comes in. It takes a lot of ideas of other games in the genre and manages to improve on them.\n\nAfter an incident, our protagonist from Kansas finds himself in the ancient Egypt. Luckily, he brought some guns with him to fight the enemies that wait there. At the beginning of a run you start at the bottom of a pyramid and fight your way through 7 floors until you reach the top. There are bosses, chest rooms, challenge rooms, everything you would expect a Rogue-like to have. In total there are 3 pyramids, each with their own unique design, rooms and enemies. They can also be seen as some sort of difficulty selection, since the pyramids get progressively harder. I love how each pyramid got its own unique feel. There was clearly a lot of work put into the interior design of each pyramid and they all look fantastic. \n\nA good Rogue-like also needs variety, would get boring if every run feels the same, right? To provide that, there are 9 characters to choose from, each with different abilities and stats, aswell as numerous weapons and scrolls you can find in the pyramid. The scrolls are the only pickup, next to weapons, that alter your gameplay. They can improve movement, change up your weapon stats or take your weapons away. It\u2019s sort of a risk reward system. Should I take the scroll and maybe get an advantage? It could also be one that makes the run a lot more difficult.\n\nNow to another point why I love this game so much. The movement. Its fast paced (and by fast I mean really fast), tight and exactly how it should be. The fast movement speed combined with the ability to jump multiple times gives you a freedom of movement I only remember from older FPS games. For some reason jumping around rooms in sonic speed with some funky music in the background is insanely fun to me and that\u2019s probably what makes this game so good.\n\nSo, what do you get with Immortal Redneck after all? A polished game, with fantastic movement, beautiful artstyle and a bunch of replayability. At this time it\u2019s by far my favorite contender in the genre and I would recommend it to anyone that likes some good, fast-paced FPS action.\n", "votes_up": 17, "author": {"num_games_owned": 2261, "playtime_forever": 4015, "last_played": 1506381164, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1006, "steamid": "76561198113366106"}, "comment_count": "1", "timestamp_updated": 1505741057, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.532544", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35045169"}, {"timestamp_created": 1506910419, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This isn't a bad game, decent graphics, no bugs so far, but the name is misleading.
