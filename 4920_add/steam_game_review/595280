Almost (if not all) roles seem to have more than 1 skill you can use. For example, Medium is pretty useless in ToS, but in ToL the Priest can talk to the dead AND ressurect a person so its basically Medium+Retri combined. There are also a LOT of skills that some roles can use during the daytime as well.\n* It doesn't tell you which faction killed someone during the night, and theres no role list, so its harder to figure out the roles in your particular game.\n* The evil faction can convert people to their side. Someone who was good one night can be evil the next. This also makes it much more difficult for the good side.\n* Less trolls/throwerss. Since it's not free you aren't going to see people do this stuff since they will just get banned and have to pay another $9.\n* It's 3D! Cool animations, and detailed room backgrounds during the night\n* The developers are active and really seem to care! (No micro transactions yet)\n\nCons: \n* it just came out so it can take a few mins to get a game going sometimes (especially at night) but I am hoping in a few weeks this will be less of an issue as more people buy it.  I'll update my review and remove this comment if this ever changes.\n* Can't really think of anything else. I definitely prefer it over ToS.", "votes_up": 11, "author": {"num_games_owned": 124, "playtime_forever": 1970, "last_played": 1507175255, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1970, "steamid": "76561198005397535"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506985423, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.522449", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35430328"}, {"timestamp_created": 1507142863, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is a convoluted social deduction game where you have to make daring leaps of logic to figure out who to execute or pardon.

Coming from a person who has hundreds of hours on Town of Salem I gotta say that this game is actually really good and a bit of an improvement over ToS in many ways. \n\nPros\n- Every single role feels meaningful and has an impact on the game because most have not only multiple night time skills, but day time skills as well\n- Lots of roles, we are talking about 41 roles in the game currently, which is impressive since they all have purpose and meaning\n- The Conversion system is unique and interesting, every Blue Dragon role has an evil version to it essentially and they can be converted over the Unseen faction, while still having the same abilities\n- It is 3D! Sure the graphics aren't great, but hey its still nicer than a still unmoving 2D screen\n- For me the fantasy theme is a big plus, I have an addiction to everything fantasy\n- When someone dies, you are not told which faction the murderer belonged to which makes you think a bit more on your toes as you really cannot tell who did it\n- You can draw deathnotes!!!\n- Since the game is not free and has a pricetag, plus it is new, there are not as many trolls in game\n- Extremely active devs who have made a discord to communicate with their players and so players can meet other players and find games, or chat and hangout\n\nCons\n- Small population of players currently, but I expect to see the number of players rise dramatically over the next little while\n- Of course since the game is in its early stages you should expect bugs, glitches, and whatnot. If you come across those just report them in the bug report part of their Discord!\n\n\nSuggestions\n- Steam Achievements would be awesome\n- Trading Cards, I love crafting badges of games I play a lot and like to play\n- More customization options for my character\n\n\nAll in all, its a fun game that just needs a bigger playerbase to gain some traction and really start moving along.
