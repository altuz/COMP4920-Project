{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1494189698, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Turn Around is a game about a guy who has spent the last 20 years of his life living in the forest. One day, when coming home from his most recent hunt, the guy finds a note in his house that says \"turn around\". That's the entire plot behind Turn Around, and it's only from reading the description on the store page that this much is known. There's no dialogue, written or spoken, actually within the game, and the entire experience lasts 10, maybe 20 minutes if you're slow, at best.\n\nThe first couple of minutes is spent following a linear path to the house in the woods, but thereafter everything turns dark and you're tasked with finding 13 items scattered around a rather large map; once you've found all of the items, it's game over. There are no jumpscares, or any scary elements at all really, save for the two appearances of a rather cute looking monster; you don't get chased, you don't get scared, you can't die. The store page promises a \"scary atmosphere\", which is untrue, \"high complexity for fans of hardcore\" which is also untrue unless you think that finding 13 items is difficult, \"good soundtracks\" when the entire soundtrack is missing, and \"nice graphics\" when the bright graphics are blurry and the rest of the game is almost pitch black.\n\nGiven that the tagline for Turn Around is \"survive at any cost\", one would think that there would be some type of survival element to the title. Alas, that is not the case, and the graphics look a lot different in the actual game than how they appear in the screenshots on the storepage. This game is definitely not worth the $2.19 CAD when not on sale, nor the $1.09 I paid for it at a half-off discount. There's one comment from the developer in the forums stating that this title is for \"high-end PCs\", other than that they have gone silent; even in regard to the multiple people who were promised free keys. Another game by another scummy developer, shamelessly shoveling garbage onto Steam with no intent on bettering their skills.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]1.0/5.0[/b] - It's bad.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork#curation]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "votes_up": 19, "author": {"num_games_owned": 2338, "playtime_forever": 9, "last_played": 1494187938, "num_reviews": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049701098"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495961787, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.538433", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "31612866"}, {"timestamp_created": 1495973451, "received_for_free": false, "review": "this game is a peace of shit it took me 9 min to complete, happy i didn't have to play full $2 but with 99% off\nDON'T BUY, IT'S TRASH", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 96, "playtime_forever": 9, "last_played": 1495973184, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198153062417"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495973451, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500192", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "32018481"}, {"timestamp_created": 1494008065, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Basically another Slender clone but that is giving it too much credit. This format could work but this is a shell of a game with nothing to offer.\n\nAll you have to do it is walk to a house and then collect some items around the forest. Unlike most games in this genre, there are no other structures so you exploring the boring forest with nothing else in it.\n\nI beat the game in 10 minutes on my first try. Not sure if you can even die because I tried to do it on purpose. There is  no story or conclusion of any kind. After you collect all items you just get to start over .\n\nGraphics are unpleasant to look at. I like the color choices but it is way too blurry. The Monster is a bit creepy but it seems to just flash at certain spots so you might as well get chased by 2D image.The only positive thing I can say is that sound was used well which created an unsettling atmosphere.\n\nOne person should be well capable of creating decent game in this format (3D map and one monster chasing a player is very basic) This is not a bad game because of funding .
