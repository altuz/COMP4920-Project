Need to spend some time getting into the controls but once you do it plays a lot like starfox with a more serious adult arcade vibe. \n\nTechnically it's a great indie product. Runs well and is very well crafted with constant update. I also think their price point is perfect and I look forward to continuing to give feedback as it develops. \n\nVery cool !\n", "votes_up": 6, "author": {"num_games_owned": 95, "playtime_forever": 97, "last_played": 1503342080, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013561063"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502984683, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.511155", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34309740"}, {"timestamp_created": 1503511108, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Fantastic game! Rogue Wings reminds me of classics like of Star Wars: Rogue Squadron and Star Fox. The levels are fun and have great variation, and the game looks beautiful. This game looks nicely polished, especially for an Early Access title, and the developer is constantly pushing updates and making the game better. My favourite recent addition is the new space level. That was a lot of fun to beat, and I can't wait for more levels!

The things I would like to see the devs put in right now to make it more playable is sensitivity setting for the mouse and controller because right now it's eather to high for controller, or to low for mouse.
