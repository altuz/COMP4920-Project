The game itself is quite difficult though, so if you are expecting to get all the achievements, be ready to die a lot.  For such a simple looking game, I was hoping for a less chaotic experience, at least in the earlier stages.

It is a type of \"shoot-em-up\" style of games that are a great way to spend time if you're bored or something to do while you're waiting for your friends.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\nYou run around using WASD and shoot using LMB. There is no support for multiplayer, sadly, because the game would be more fun to play if you could play with friends. It does have achievements, but not insane easter egg achievements, just basic achievements like beating level 1 or 7 and killing 300 CPU Invaders. When you play it, it has a transparent background, allowing you to see behind the game, which is cool.\n\n[b] Remote Compatibility [/b]\nSadly, the game does not support remote compatibility. I attempted to play it with my wired XBOX 1 controller, and nothing happened while I was moving the joystick or smashing A or B. \n\n[b] Running On Your PC [/b]\nThe game, for the size it is, runs pretty well on my computer. It can handle it because it isn't that big of a game, to begin with.\n\n[i] My PC Specs [/i]\nOS - Windows 10\nCPU - AMD A8-550\nRAM - 8 GB\nMOBA - MSI 2AE0\n\nSince my PC is on the older side, it has a slight effect when there are a bunch of enemies. Your CPU might raise if you have an older PC as well, but not that much that it affects the game so much.\n\n[b] Graphics [/b]\nThe game looks pretty nice for a cheap game it is. There is no way to change the graphic settings to lower them, but you really won't need that feature because it is a very light and CPU friendly game. \n\n[b] Soundtrack [/b]\nThe soundtrack is one of my favorites just because I love techno music to games like these. If you stay on the menu, it loops one techno song over, so if you listen for too long it might get repetitive. While playing the game, it plays a new techno song that I feel fits the game.\n\n[b] Bugs And Glitches [/b]\nI couldn't really notice any bugs and/or glitches because the game is such a simple concept.\n\n[h1] Overall Rating [/h1]\nI would recommend this game, and I would give it an 8/10.", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_forever": 91, "last_played": 1488934662, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198165453672"}, "comment_count": "2", "timestamp_updated": 1488391089, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502238", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30254084"}, {"timestamp_created": 1488368987, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good as game as you can play it in class and no one will notice :) This is also amazing as it can run on nearly any computer thank you.
