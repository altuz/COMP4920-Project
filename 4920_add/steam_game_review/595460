You play through five episodes of (awkward) dates and through a choice-based system you try to find the right answer/action, to not look like an idiot at the end of your date. Almost like real life, haha. \n\nThe mini games were kinda annoying, same for the loud level of what should be background music, but overall its style and writing is quite good and competently made. Especially if you consider that this game just cost you ONE lousy buck. It is definitely a steal for that price.", "votes_up": 9, "author": {"num_games_owned": 2452, "playtime_forever": 155, "last_played": 1502127732, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035843501"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502128708, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.513384", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34086476"}, {"timestamp_created": 1503672578, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It has many interesting endings that depend on your choice of dialogues, but it could use more dialogue choices.
