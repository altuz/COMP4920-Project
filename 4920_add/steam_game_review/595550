Character designs are cool, as are the monsters..\nThe gameplay on the other side is awful , the  jumping mechanic  is very bad and sometimes i even fail to do some simple jumps because you have to be pixel perfect every time .\nAlso at every stage you have to collect some useless \"coins\" \nYou cant attack your enemies , only when the player picks some pick ups and they are temporary , mostly you run from the enemies...\nThe game was cheap and had a good vibe but the gameplay is very bad", "votes_up": 7, "author": {"num_games_owned": 421, "playtime_forever": 16, "last_played": 1505847995, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198147232364"}, "comment_count": "1", "timestamp_updated": 1505847796, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.511729", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35070518"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 4, "total_positive": 9, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
