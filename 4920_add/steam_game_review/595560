A really fantastic and original concept.\nI feel like playing a martial arts comic from the 60s or 70s.\nThe mixture of a classic point and click adventure game and a little bit of a rpg-styled beat-em up (the fighting is similiar to jrpgs) got me hooked. \nYes, the puzzles are not too difficult, they are not difficult at all, as far as I have played - I've just finished the first island and now I'm taking a break. (At the moment I've just finished island two and have been looking around a bit on the third one: the difficutly is increasing and so is the fund and complexity of the story and puzzles!)\nI love the story and the mood, the game gets you in.\nIt all fits together just perfectly. So, give it a try, if you like the style and humor of the trailer - the game is even better!", "votes_up": 6, "author": {"num_games_owned": 407, "playtime_forever": 495, "last_played": 1507199788, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 495, "steamid": "76561198143030878"}, "comment_count": "1", "timestamp_updated": 1506625879, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.513423", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35257652"}, {"timestamp_created": 1507145216, "received_for_free": false, "review": "  I agree with the previous review, this game is delightfully oddball and unpredictable.  The world is filled with weird and interesting characters along with equally intruiging subplots.  I have a few minor gripes with a few puzzles and one of the minigames, but again they are minor quibbles and could be retweaked by the time you playthrough.  So many times I was grinning, or eager to see where a character or storyline is going to take me, and a handful of times I laughed out loud (one of the achievements and how I earned it destroyed me).  Overall, I had a blast with Legend of Hand!\n\n  This one is a steal for any price in the single digits.  If you like quirky adventure games and/or 70s martial arts movies, Legend of Hand is a must buy.", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_games_owned": 234, "playtime_forever": 780, "last_played": 1507129204, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 780, "steamid": "76561197970774933"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1507145216, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.507707", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35478927"}, {"timestamp_created": 1506687464, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Utterly unique, occasionally funny, incredibly intriguing, and definitely recommended.", "votes_up": 4, "author": {"num_games_owned": 1183, "playtime_forever": 184, "last_played": 1506687910, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 184, "steamid": "76561197990132828"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506687464, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.497190", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35291569"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
