And I have to say this is the best Samurai Warriors and possibly the best Warriors game I have played. In Spirit of the Sanada they focus specifically on the Sanada Clan making their way through the Warring States Period. This game is much more story focused than previous installments, filled with tons of dialogue, characters and events. The main story took me around 35hrs to complete so it's not just some short spin off. The battles are very fun despite being a bit repetitive. They also have added in a day/night cycle which switches thing up a bit but makes battle time limits shorter. Furthermore, they've also included a stratagem system into this which can give you an advantage in a battle or make a task much easier to complete. While using them isn't necessary, it can make life so much easier in battle because some of them get pretty rough at times if you're not overpowered. The only downside is it takes forever to charge it up after complete objectives once before. I'm going to close by saying this, I've played through this series 5 times now (SW - SW4-II) and I've read up on the actual history featured in this series. I went into this game knowing exactly how things were going to play out and what the ultimate fate of everyone would be. But despite this I could not help tearing up. The way they executed the ending of this grand story was excellent. It left me so sad but very satisified. I just cannot praise this game enough. I highly recommend this to any Warriors fan and to anyone who is looking to get into the series.\n\nPros:\n- An immersive, emotional rollercoaster of a story\n- A huge cast of unique characters\n- Great gameplay (Same as SW 4-II)\n- Amazing music (A lot of reused tracks from SW 4 with some new ones that really kick it)\n- Graphics are not bad, especially on the best settings.\n- Much more historically accurate than past entries\n\nCons:\n- Exploration missions are kind of boring but thankfully fairly short (But that's my personal opinion)\n- After you initially complete the objectives, it gets a lot more difficult to charge up your strategems (Unless I'm missing something)\n- I've heard that a lot people have had some trouble running the game smoothly (I didn't have this problem myself)", "votes_up": 2, "author": {"num_games_owned": 85, "playtime_forever": 3628, "last_played": 1505060889, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198142319825"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505065290, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34867428"}, {"timestamp_created": 1506617756, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is pretty good.
