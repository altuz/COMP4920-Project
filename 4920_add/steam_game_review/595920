I hope there will be some DLC's in the future.\n\n- Not able to save inside a mission! Sometimes you'll play 10 times the same 15 minutes to get to the point you were failing.\n\n- Known BUG: You can't continue a game in the \"engineering level\" - The game freezes... Theres no workaround except the continue from a all ready finished mission (from scratch)\n\nI stopped playing and wait for the patch (and may be revise my review).\n\nCheers", "votes_up": 4, "author": {"num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_forever": 1645, "last_played": 1507139750, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 546, "steamid": "76561198028226061"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505058594, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506984", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34865083"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
