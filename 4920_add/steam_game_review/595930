The whole Interface makes this game feel like you are playing an early alpha of something. Sometimes it is very confusing why the game behaves in a certain way and you have to repeat steps that are not allowed just to be able to read the tooltips.\nWe played it in Multiplayer and the fact that you cannot even change the volume of ingame sounds made it even harder to play. You cannot add AI to the multiplayer and if you are just 2 players there not many maps you can play on.\n\nFrom what I see in the game news it does not seem there are new patches coming that make this game enjoyable. Very sad.
