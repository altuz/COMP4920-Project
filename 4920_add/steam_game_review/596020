I'm not gonna lie, survival with nothing but 6 shots in a revolver, a radio and a monocular is a pretty big rush, though the monocoluar can eat a dick since it never centers on what I'm looking at.\n\nThe sound design, visuals and even just the homicide intro were perfectly fine, and if the dev finds a way to tighten up (or better yet, drop) the whole backstory thing, unkink some of the other issues and maybe use something not Unity powered, this game could stand to benefit from it.", "votes_up": 2, "author": {"num_games_owned": 405, "playtime_forever": 49, "last_played": 1506886313, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 49, "steamid": "76561197970762927"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506888091, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503722", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35394730"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 14, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 3, "review_score_desc": "Negative"}, "success": 1}
