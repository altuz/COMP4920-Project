Like Frank, I won't let my fandom impact my review. So let's dive in. \n\nWhat I like\n\n+ The splitting mechanic is interesting and different. \n+ The few songs there are on the soundtrack are pretty good\n+ Game runs like a dream for me (no problems so far)\n+ Controls work fairly well\n\nWhat I didn't like\n\n- Game feels short (Having finished it in around 3 hours, I can safely say it is)\n- Environments are pretty bland and there is no real reason for exploration\n- Story is meh (characters don't emote really at all)\n- Playing for a long period of time can make hands cramp (have to hold down triggers and use both joysticks a lot)\n- $$$, game seems slightly overpriced, especially given alternative options like Hollow Knight, Owlboy, Ori, Rayman, etc. \n- Camera: At times the camera moves to fit everything on screen which can make seeing your character tough. \n- The last 3rd of the game is pretty badly designed. \n\nOverall, pick up this game if you've already hit all the staples of platformers out there. There's enough here to have some fun with, but the game features a ton of drawbacks. Overall I wasn't  blown away. \n\n5.5/10", "votes_up": 15, "author": {"num_games_owned": 369, "playtime_forever": 205, "last_played": 1499736670, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198083510586"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495595170, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.527931", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31925973"}, {"timestamp_created": 1495728037, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I've been craving a linear platformer and this really scratched the itch.  While I enjoy metroidvanias, I feel like I 've been inundated with them of late and I wanted something a little simpler and straightforward, like the NES platformers of yesteryear.\n\nEmbers of Mirrim is a very polished puzzle platformer with heavy emphasis on platforming and navigating between sections and light emphasis on puzzle elements.  The splitting mechanic adds variety, and the game continues to introduce other small elements to keep the game fresh throughout.\n\nThe graphics are very gorgeous; the game's aesthetic is a little like Ori and the Blind Forest (but again, whereas that is a metroid clone, this is a linear platformer).  Definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a solid platforming experience with some unique elements.", "votes_up": 6, "author": {"num_games_owned": 778, "playtime_forever": 382, "last_played": 1496122852, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043269872"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1495728037, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504366", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31954348"}, {"timestamp_created": 1495669934, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Platforming is not usually my favorite form of gaming but I have to admit I got hooked playing this.
