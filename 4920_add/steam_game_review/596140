{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1489348791, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I've been using this product since it was introduced to me as a freebie back when the company was owned by Corel Corporation. Xara has been my go-to for many, many graphics in the years since. It looks deceptively simple from the user interface but you can go as deep as you like, and as exact as you like. You don't hear of it often in the US as it was created in England and is now owned by Magix, which I think is a German company (?). \n\nIt is primarily a vector program that they've tossed a lot of photo handling capabilities and effects into over the last handful of versions, some of which are amazing. For the budget minded designer, it's a must have at this price. It can open Adobe Illustrator files from the native format. Zoom levels are beyond just about anything I've ever seen until very recently. Effects like blends, drop shadows, etc, are *startlingly* fast. You really have to push it very hard to slow it down. Go to their web site and check out the galleries there.\n\nI've created medical illustrations, architectural \"what-if\"s, military operational concepts, web gif animations, posters, banners, and ads with this program. This gets an extremely high recommendation from a professional graphic designer of over 25 years experience, who uses everything from FOSS, to CorelDraw to Adobe CC full suite. It just simply works and works well. I typically browse Steam for games, but now I can upgrade one of my go-tos at a price that's almost criminal.

This isn't really a competitor to Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro, it is a mixed bag of features in a sometimes questionable user interface. Instead of using the traditional menu bar which has always been in Photoshop/Paint Shop Pro (and other photo editing software such as Corel Draw) they have put some of these menus into tools. At first I was a bit shocked by this as it looked like there were hardly any features at all. However, I have later discovered that some of these features like the effects section (which seemed to be absent at first) hidden away in an effects tool. I can see how this makes the UI neater but really it's a bit disconcerting to start with. \n\nTo be quite fair some of the features are quite good, such as the panorama tool which puts up to 8 pictures together in a bigger panorama. I have been finding this quite useful and most of the panoramas I have made are completely seamless. The shadow and 3d tools are also quite nice because they can be used very neatly on text. \n\nThey have included an online content catalogue which is nice to have and has some great ideas (such as editable charts and logo designs). However, they have put the filter presets in this catalogue which is a bit too difficult to use as it doesn't let you see previews of your picture with the different presets. Instead, it shows you pictures of a woman\u2019s face with the different filters and you have to guess from that which one will suit your picture. There also doesn't seem to be any control of the filters once you have applied them. It would have been a lot easier to have a separate tool with previews/controls as I am still using the filters in the windows photo viewer and this is something that is now included on most other apps/programs.\n\nOverall, I'd probably give it around 50%. It's good for the discount price I paid (\u00a329.99) and very useful to have something on Steam (as I will be able to install it without having to look for a cd somewhere next time I get a new computer) but for the full price of \u00a349.99 I'd consider looking at paying a bit extra for Photoshop Elements or Paint Shop Pro.", "votes_up": 7, "author": {"num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_forever": 428, "last_played": 1501709411, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197977730438"}, "comment_count": "1", "timestamp_updated": 1489320733, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.511951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "30469130"}, {"timestamp_created": 1489338840, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Finaly Xara Photo & Graphic Designer has arrived on steam.\nI have been using xara version 5 for a long time.\nWhat i like about it the clean and easy way it works.
