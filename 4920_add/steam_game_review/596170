Like, seriously awful.\n\nI should preface this by saying that I bought this game for 10 cents because of a coupon I earned from crafting badges, but it's not even worth 10 cents of your money, so don't bother.\n\nFirst of all, the game's name is 'Magazime Editor'. Seriously? How little of a shit did the creators give? Baffling.\n\nWhen you start playing, it doesn't tell you what to do. It doesn't explain which button does what, it doesn't tell you what each icon represents (though it is pretty easy to figure out, it will likely take you a few mistakes to understand which means which, especially since random ones you haven't encountered yet will pop up out of nowhere to ruin your life.) This would be forgivable except for the fact that everything else about this game is terrible.\n\nThe gameplay is just straight-up boring. I've played countless free mobile games infinitely more fun and complex than this. The music is fine, I gues. The art style is FINE, I guess. There's nothing visually interesting about it. There is nothing for you to look at other than your journalists leaving their spots, that stack of papers piling up as you accept or reject, and the guy at the desk violently vibrating on occasion....\nYou hit a button to either accept or reject articles. That's it, seriously. As you progress through the levels, you get more journalists, and you need to accept or reject the articles more quickly. That is the extent of the gameplay here, although I may be wrong since LEVEL 6 IS BROKEN AND YOU *CANNOT* COMPLETE IT.\n\nI slogged through accepting/rejecting over 100 articles respectively on Level 6, annnnd guess what? Nothing! The piles on the floor in front of the desk covered up part of the number counts eventually, so I didn't even have THAT to keep track of. There's not even any point in buying this trash for the achievements, since you literally cannot complete them past Level 6 due to this game-breaking bug. Apparently this has been going on for a long time and has yet to be fixed, so I doubt that it ever will be. Not to mention that once you fail a level, you have to start over from the very beginning.\n\nAdditionally, the whole thing is poorly translated, which I'm sure you could see just from the video. ('CHECK YOU REACTION'. Nice.)\n\nIt's not like I was expecting some sort of hidden gem or masterpiece of a game from this, but I at least wanted to complete it for its achievements. Now I can't even do that, and this is just a stain on my account for the rest of eternity.\n\nAt least it has trading cards so I can earn my 10 cents back!
