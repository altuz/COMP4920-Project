But I am giving it a thumbs up because the idea for what the gameplay should be like is great. Build a kingdom, protect your kingdom as one of your own units, and well, that's all I could see there is to it. Assuming this is the intended gameplay loop I'd love to see this game developed further.\n\nNow at the time of writing the game is pretty unplayable due to numerous gameplay/UI issues and that should stop you from buying it at $5.99 as that'd be an utter waste of money.
