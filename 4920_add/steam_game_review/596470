With poor graphics, no resolution options to speak of, and also lacking volume sliders, this game did everything to get off on a bad footing with me. It then took that negative expectation I had built up and then smacked me square in the face with the fact that it is in fact a solid title!\n\nWith varied and unique puzzle designs and ranging levels of difficulty and options, this game was far more than one could ever hope to expect from a free title. As stated in my first Impressions video, my only regret is that I was not able to compensate the Developers for this little gem. If you are a fan of puzzle games, this game is absolutely worth your time.\n\nAnd a note to the Devs, if you produce a 2nd game of this level of quality gameplay, please do charge some money for it. You will have earned it if it is anything like Cartesian.\n\n9/10", "votes_up": 20, "author": {"num_games_owned": 427, "playtime_forever": 34, "last_played": 1487658357, "num_reviews": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030863487"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487666682, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.538284", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30074755"}, {"timestamp_created": 1487687578, "received_for_free": false, "review": "+ Just the right among of puzzle difficulty\n+ Frequent save points help if you die\n+ Who doesn't like lasers?\n+ Good in-game tutorial\n+ Music is OK (but nothing special)\n- Initially, gameplay time wasn't reported to Steam\n\nMake up your own mind with this gameplay: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUz-rCLhlEo[/url]", "votes_up": 4, "author": {"num_games_owned": 114, "playtime_forever": 8, "last_played": 1487687282, "num_reviews": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198137240226"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1487687578, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501158", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30079901"}, {"timestamp_created": 1487652091, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Cartesian, it looks terrible but under that rough surface is a really decent puzzle/ adventure indie game that I would recommend to any free to play \"nomad\" or anyone looking for another free game to try.
