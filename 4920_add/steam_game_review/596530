I'm not quite finished but I think I'm almost there at 25 hours played. \n\nReminds me of snes era rpgs, with combat similar to FF6 but enhanced with a limit break type resource that accumulates as you either take or deal damage.\n\nFull of little secrets, side quests and mini games.\n\nFairly open with how you \"build\" each character with a stat enhancing system for leveling up. Some characters are clearly suited to certain roles but you can always hybrid them, like making a tanky sword wielding healer.\n\n\nFinal thought: This game is suprisingly well made, it feels 'complete' if that makes sense. Lots of effort went into this game, worth the low price.", "votes_up": 6, "author": {"num_games_owned": 93, "playtime_forever": 1587, "last_played": 1492013000, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198032160640"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1492049428, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.512767", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31097991"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
