{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1500247899, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The series as a whole before the individual game\n\nThe series is great. However, their is a warning, the set of games, especially the last one, are harder than most of these type of games. The writing is great, the stats carry over between games, different events can happen based on the stats you have or what classes you choose. However, for your first run, expect to fail. However, there is a lot of replay value in these games and they are very enjoyable.\n\nThis last game is the climactic conclusion to the story. Your character will learn about the demons and search for an artifact to fight them before the big final battle. Once again, more classes, bringing the total amount of classes your character can be to a whopping 35 classes. The mechanic of managing the ship, which helps bring you to the artifact, is not as fun or as extensive as managing the army in the previous game. There is however, a major plot thing that can be fun at the end. [spoiler] After you find the artifact, your character has to turn himself into a demon so he/she can perminantly kill other demons. Failing checks in this part can cause your character to become more demonic, giving bonuses but also getting you closer to bad endings.\t[/spoiler] There are several endings in this game, of which there are (I think) 2 good endings and 6 bad ones. That said, I really like the game. It does some interesting things that many of these games don't try, and still offers a lot of choice for playstyle.", "votes_up": 2, "author": {"num_games_owned": 202, "playtime_forever": 1330, "last_played": 1506131444, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "steamid": "76561198037101281"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500247899, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503188", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33596581"}, {"timestamp_created": 1500492913, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Had alot of fun with the first two games. The ability to reach the desired outcomes through wildly differing means was this series greatest strength. It meant you could build your character how you wanted and still have a shot at victory if you prepared well enough. This game broke all of that with the finale. Almost nothing I choose seems to have a meaningful impact on how the final encounters play out.

In Part 3 you go to interesting new places and meet interesting new allies and enemies. My first playthrough was 4.4 hrs, so it's about 1.5 hrs longer then the first two games. However this game has one major problem, as well as a few minors ones. \n\nThe major problem: You need your stats at lv5 or 95-100 to win alot of the rolls. Some of these are just stupid, \"failure, needed 100 strength to open window\" really! WTF! I was especially pissed when I was so badly injured, from the constant dying, i got \"Your wounds will take a long time to heal -10 to various physical stats\". It doesn't feel like a choose your own adventure when you're so limited by your stats. It feels like you're following a straight line and unless you stayed on that line for the entire 3 parts, you'll fail most of the time.   \n\nI would have also like'd to see more interaction between the core characters and romance options. What's the point of even having the relationship stat in the game if you're not going to use it. \n\nFinal Verdict:\nI would only recommend this game on sale. It's longer than parts 1+2, but also more expensive. The problems just don't make it worth paying more for.", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 262, "last_played": 1501367742, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198103497349"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1501370098, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502157", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33892323"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 19, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 8, "total_positive": 11, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
