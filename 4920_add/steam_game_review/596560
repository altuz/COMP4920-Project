It was fun for like 3 seconds but then it got annoying. After 1-2 minutes that scene was over and another completely random scene popped up where I had to fly on hover-skateboards with a premade route through some tunnels while being chased by flying drones, which also were really ugly. In the end I was standing on an elevator and had to defend myself against aliens that didn\u00b4t even match the other 3D Assets in the game and were completely random and full of bugs. That was it. The whole game of really bad looking enemies, blurry scenes, crappy special effects and an environment that even my 4 year old smartphone would be capable to render took me nearly 5 minutes to finish.\n\nLook Devs, I paid actual money for this game. It wasn\u00b4t much after all, but I would have gotten a nice cup of coffee for that money so the next time I think about buying one of your games I will certainly go with a Caf\u00e9 Crema.", "votes_up": 8, "author": {"num_games_owned": 148, "playtime_forever": 18, "last_played": 1493820408, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197973215112"}, "comment_count": "2", "timestamp_updated": 1491829007, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.511851", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31059392"}, {"timestamp_created": 1491692280, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The graphics and gameplay are awesome.

I am honestly not a big fan of web shooters, preferring to be able to use locomotion to move across environments. But I can make an exception for this one, and I hope they develop it into a full-fledged experience soon. If they can add locomotion of course, that would be just too cool.  \n", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_forever": 22, "last_played": 1504565393, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198016299604"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1491692280, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31028250"}, {"timestamp_created": 1492178624, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Very short but I loved it.

For now this is something great to buy to show off your VR to people. If you are looking for a full experience then pass this. It is a very short game preview. It has tons of potential and looks and feels great to play. It ends right when you were hoping for more. But the game does look stunning. A number rating would be 5/10 simply because it is not a game but a demo of some kind. It crashes often but after a few tries I made it to the end with no issues. I really hope the dev makes this a full game.\n\nThe last video in my medley is Mars VR. Fats forward to it or watch all th eotehrs if interested.
