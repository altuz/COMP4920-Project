{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1502307988, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[I]Linked[/i] is a minimalistic puzzle game. Each puzzle shows you a number of blocks and a caption to let you know exactly which combinations of blocks you need to make, for example:\n[list]\n[*] 3 times 2 blocks\n[*] 4 times 3 blocks\n[*] 2 times 5 blocks\n[/list]\nYou then need to drag the mouse pointer in a straight line across 2, 3 or 5 blocks to make those blocks disappear. Do this twice with a row of 5 blocks, 4 times with a row of 3 blocks and 3 times with a row of 2 blocks to make all of the blocks disappear, meaning you solved the puzzle.\n\n[I]Linked[/i] offers 12 'groups' of puzzles, each consisting of 12 puzzles, so that's 144 puzzles overall. It took me a little more than two hours to solve them all.\n\nMost of the puzzles are easy, either because there are just so many possible correct solutions or because the solution is fairly obvious if you analyse the puzzle for two seconds. There are a few brain-teasers, though, especially in the last group. \n\nIn puzzle games, I really appreciate it when you can skip a puzzle that has you stumped, so you can come back fresh to it at a later time. Unfortunately, [I]Linked[/i] does not offer such an option. If you're stuck on a puzzle, you're stuck so you either keep trying to solve that one puzzle, look up the solution in a guide or (rage)quit the game.\n\nThe background music in [I]Linked[/i] is a nice piano tune that's subtle enough to not distract you from thinking, so that's a plus. If you prefer, you can switch off the music and/or the sound effects through the game menu. \n\n[I]Linked[/i] has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game. The 12 Steam Achievements are very basic and straightforward: you get one for each group of puzzles you manage to complete.", "votes_up": 10, "author": {"num_games_owned": 700, "playtime_forever": 191, "last_played": 1502307507, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042646749"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1502307988, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.528339", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34131754"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
