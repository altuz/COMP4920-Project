The audio is great, the art style is pleasent, and the gameplay is very very fun.  I love these simple physics/geometry type games.  Basically your a guy with a handgun who needs to bounce bullets off walls and various surfaces to try and kill all the other guys.  The other guys don't shoot at you (at least as far as I got), but peices in the enviroment can kill you (if you mess up).  Gameplay is fluid and it is easy to restart if you make mistakes.
