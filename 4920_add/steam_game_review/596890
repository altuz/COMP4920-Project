{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1496085468, "received_for_free": false, "review": "By Mike Walter, the author of \"Life of a Wizard\" and \"The Lost Heir\" trilogy. Three works that has a lot of point in common, quality being one of those point. Well-written, well thought, a lot of statistics taken in account and a lot of specific event tied to how you developped your character.\n\nSome negative point being : 1.despite the numerous choices, in the end the outcome might seem similar 2.I think Mike Walter is a great plot and story writing author but each time he doesn't make fleshing out his character a priority, in those stories (which are great) you barely have the time to get to know the protagonists like the romance or the main side-kicks. It's not that there is nothing about them, it's just the minimum. 3.the end always seems to come a little too fast, especially in life of a mobster, there is not much said on the consequences and it's a little like \"okay, finished, done\"\n\nI had a lot of fun testing the different way you can experience the story but once you did a few run-through you pretty much saw 90% of the game and there is just a few text changes here and there. So I think all those choices are like a big storyline with variations and not really a novel that gives clear different path. That's not really a problem though, just a fact. \n\nOverall Mike Walter is one of my favourite CYOA so far and Life of a Mobster didn't disappoint me. You're not forced to play a character you don't recognize yourself into, the story is believable and you read through it easily. Sometime you're overtaken by the \"meta\" side of the title, but I actually think it's positive. Just take a break and dip in again later, the story still has some lenght to it.", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 165, "playtime_forever": 2129, "last_played": 1496084035, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049979496"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496086214, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32048006"}, {"timestamp_created": 1498428477, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This was actually a really good story.
