It was a kickstarter project where the game cost \u00a315, so it would be unfair to go below. Reasonable Kickstarter prices always intended for the finished product.\n\nThe game is still in active development, and far from finished. You will encounter bugs, some even gamebreaking. Which is why you're advised to make hard-saves regularly (from the save folder).\n\nSome of the end-game features require incredible grind at this point, so you likely won't win the game.\n\nSo with those in mind it's clear that at this point customers are more like testers. You're required to browse the forums for either bugfixes, or tips to survive (especially because the wiki is almost empty).\n\n[h1]Why do I even Recommend then?[/h1]\n\nI trust the developers.\nWith all the shitty devs and publishers out there, Failbetter Games is one of the few I actually trust.\n\nThe value I got from their previous game is so high that even if Sunless Skies development stops right now, I wouldn't feel robbed. I wouldn't trust them anymore, but I wouldn't feel bad about my initial decision.\n\nAs stated above I loved Sunless Sea, and Sunless Skies looks like a kind of sequel, and definitely the same genre.\n\nThe atmosphere and feeling of the game is really good already, which was one of the strongest aspect of Sunless Sea as well.\n\nThe stories are so good in a weird, creepy way. You just have that constant feeling of dread that just hangs in the air. Dark magic and terrible things constantly happen to people, it's just the way life is in the Unterzee and the High Wilderness. Now I have to state that I never read or was interested in anything like H.P. Lovecraft or China Meiville. However I might read their works because of how amazing Sunless Sea was.\n\n[h1]Disclaimers[/h1]\n\nI might not update this review, another reason it's Positive; current date: 2017. sept. 06.\n\nI know that my review affects the percentage seen on the Store page (only 23 reviews atm), and I'm basically lying by saying that I recommend the game in its current state. But I also believe that people should check reviews before buying EA games, or they just don't care enough what they spend their money on.\n\nAs a sidenote about the \"trust\" part: I was someone who was really interested in No Man's Sky: sci-fi is my favourite genre in everything, and survival is my favourite type of game. The game looked amazing in every trailer.\nI still didn't buy on release, because I didn't trust them and I did my research.\nNow, after a year and 3 major updates I bought it at \u20ac24, and I'm very satisfied.\nMaybe this will convince you that I'm not completely crazy for trusting Failbetter Games this much.", "votes_up": 39, "author": {"num_games_owned": 228, "playtime_forever": 1416, "last_played": 1505092693, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993824256"}, "comment_count": "2", "timestamp_updated": 1504694785, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.574055", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34773172"}, {"timestamp_created": 1504801195, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I hope this \"review\" somehow makes it to the developers. I really like the series (is this a series now?) and I wanted to voice my opinion. Hope it helps.\n\n--- Things What Work (and deliciously so) ---\n\n- Train Movement and Systems:\nI'm a sap for games that are in space. Also one's with dark Victorian settings and Antedeluvian horrors, hence why I'm here. So despite other people's groaning I actually like how the train you pilot moves compared to the ships in SSea. For those unaware, the train works like a real space ship. You have a forward thrust for general power and directional thrusters for course correction. It feels like I'm actually trying to wrestly a beast of protyped technology and makes for a more engaging traveling experience then what was in SSea\n\nAlso the fuel on board now serves double duty as both power for the engines and what heats the ship. Space craft in real life have to keep the interior heated because A: space is a bit nippy and B: we don't generally like dead astronauts. It's bad P.R. So fuel kinda works the same way supplies did in SSea. If you run out of fuel you run a good risk of a slow death. It's just another way to die without having to really pay much attention to anything new.\n\n- Combat:\nCombat in SSea was one of two things: a boring nautical equivalent of aircraft turn-fighting to get on a ships rear (stern...? bow...?) OR it was a \"OH MY GOOD GOD BACK AWAY WHILE FIRING KEEP THAT SPIDER AWAY FROM THE SHIP\" until something dinks you (seriously, to hell with the Constant Companion). I'm could skip around for joy that they took that system out to the barn for a dirt nap. \n\nNow the combat revolves around using both your forward thruster and directional thrusters in a masterful 2D dance of death around whatever is attacking you. It's both faster paced and just plain more fun since the enemies can do it too. Also your weapons don't auto lock onto a target and can produce excess heat if you fire them too much. This excess heat can damage systems. So yea, all around a much more engaging engagment. I feel like I'm going to use that word a lot.\n\n- Character Development:\nOne of my favorite things about SSea and my new favorite thing about SSkies. Before in SSea you could choose a character backstory in order to kinda role-play as someone in universe. It wasn't just a insert-yourself-here affair like most other RPGs do, but it only really affected certain character stats. Kind of a let down. In a lot of RPGs it's been found that if a game will allow you to basically insert yourself in you will act as you normally would, which is usually to be a goodie-goodie. This almost makes it pointless to add any kinda of \"bad-guy\" option.\n\nHOWEVER, in SSkies as you earn experience you can unlock events from your character's past. Not only does this allow you to craft a more interesting person to RPG it up as, but evidently this will affect how characters in the game treat you. I cannot write here just how great this new format is, but it feels like your the new captain in town and as you accomplish things your story will be unearthed by the people of the Reach and your name will become either famous or infamous. Its not a choice of \"Be good, be in the middle, or be cartoonish levels of evil\" either. These choices make sense and come about from really good morality vs. personal gain standpoint. \n\n--- Things What Don't Work (but I think could be improved upon) ---\n\n- Navigating the Reach (Salesmen and Bats):\nHonestly, I really didn't want to buy this game until it was released. I just didn't want to spoil anything. However, someone being a dick on the community hub forced my hand. This person argued that the position of the starting point (London in SSea, New Winchester in SSkies) from the western most part of a grid to the center of a circle made the time it would take to travel to each port and how much fuel and supplies you would use increase by a large margin.\n\nThis person was right theoretically (as much as it pains me to say) in how they argued it with the Traveling Salesman Problem, but not practically. The circle the Reach encompasses is FAR smaller then the Unterzee and you use supplies and fuel to a very similar rate. This means you actually get more distance for your fuel. What makes it seem so large is that there is sizeable swaths of completely empty space that would have normally been filled in SSea. This means less ports, less places to stop, less opportunties to stock up. I imagine this will be resolved. \n\nHey look, I explained that without being a dick either. Points to me!\n\nWhat I really have an issue with is that damnable bat though. Like in SSea you use a bat for navigation assistance. You send it out, it looks for something interesting and then reports back with a direction to go find it. Its a nice system, but now that bat requires supplies to use. Oh god, why? There's barely anything in the Reach and you expect me to keep sending the bugger out just to return \"saw nothing captain\" again and again? And have it use supplies?! I understand you may want a drawback to using the bat for those that would go around spamming it, but allow me to suggest an alternative.\n\nYou mention in the writing that the bat can be a bit mischiveous. The captain has to coax it with a meal of beetles until it finally spills what it knows, right? Maybe make it so that if you over work the bat it will give you misinformation. Maybe even point you towards danger. I imagine this would be making a simple system more complex, but it's an opportunity worth mentioning.\n\n- Writing:\nStay thy pitchforks, fandom. I love the writing in Fallen London and SSea as much as anyone. It was scary enough, weird enough, ambiguous enough, yet detailed enough to get me really (and I mean REALLY) interested in the games and it's the reason I kept coming back. I wish I had the ability to write like these people do. I am happy to say it is just as humorous and unnerving in SSkies as before, but I have two issues.\n\nFirst, some lore bits are explained a bit too much. Things like the war between London and the Taccies (tackies?... tactites?... oh screw it) and what the researchers at traitors wood were looking for were explained a bit too much. Other things like the... oh what's it called? The place where you can lower your terror? I'm bad with names. Yea, it's services to clients it allowed and didn't allow was explained very well. You had to dig to get there, and once you did the full extent of what you really learned remains to be unlocked in your own head-canon. There's a disparity between what is explained well and what is not that worries me. I blame the early stage the game is in.\n\nSecond, there's a lot more character to player dialogue and more overall description text now. I actually like this. It makes every character feel different rather then in SSea, where most characters seemed like shady back-handers because the writing was so ambiguous. I like that there is more description for characters and places, but my concern is whether or not this will eliminate more of the ambiguity then it should. The best horror resides in what you do not know. I hope this game keeps to that.\n\n--- Things What Are Broken (but hey, what do I know?) ---\n\n- Factions (and how to identify them):\nIn SSea, if you locked onto something in combat it told you what it was. (Oh, hi Eater of Names. Goodbye now!). That's not a thing anymore. I'd like this system because it makes some things mysterious and when you kill it you can identify it. However, you can never identify anything later on in the game that you have already killed. Likewise, this ended up in a friendly-fire incident where I shot down a ship of a faction I supported. Other then that I like the addition of factions I can support.\n\n- Economy:\nI just wish there was one... also I sold something I bought at one port for the same price at another. What in the what?

Unfortunately, many people, myself included, often cannot break out of that early-game hell, and that is at the point where Sea loses its appeal.\n\nLuckily, Failbetter, having learned from their mistakes, have taken another crack at the survival genre with Sunless Skies, and from what I have seen, they're doing a hell of a lot better, even in this early version.\n\n--Positive--\n\nMany have said that this game is Sunless Sea IN SPACE, but I find it to be rather different. While the gameplay may retain a great number of aspects from Sea, the fact that the game is set in a gravity-less environment is handled well, and controlling the sky-ship feels very different from that of a boat, offering a much greater degree of mobility. This lends itself well to combat; while combat in Sea consisted of trying to get astern of your enemy and blast them to scrap while praying that they didn't do it to you first, in Skies, it is possible to fight somewhat strategically by dodging enemy projectiles and the like. As well, the \"heat\" mechanic is a welcome introduction; rather than waiting for your gun to reload, you can fire as much as you like but might overheat. This adds, in my opinion, more of a sense of peril and is a constant reminder that you are not driving a boat, but braving a strange version of the cosmos in what is essentially a steam locomotive with thrusters on it.\n\nThe region available at the current time has only eleven ports, as opposed to the more than 40 in Sea, but they are gorgeously detailed and much larger, and as well, each seems to have its own unique aesthetic. You might come into one port built on floating ruins, but the next could be a verdant jungle. My personal favorite is a city on a giant flower. \n\n--Negative--\n\nThe game, as it is now, is full of more bugs than a slab of beef that's been left out in the sun. Enemies often float by without a care in the world, and will only rarely turn to fire at you, even if you're pelting their starboard hull with bullets. At times, you may even run across enemies that are stationary, which only move once you shoot them. Rendering is a major problem; coming upon a port is always signalled by the sky becoming cloudy, but oftentimes, once you leave that region, instead of gradually transitioning from fog to a sparser starry backdrop, the fog will simply vanish once you get far enough away. The worst problem of all, however, is a terrible bug that seems to occur by exiting to the menu screen and going back into the game. When coming back in, everything on the map save for the port you are currently in will vanish, leaving the game unplayable. \n\nThere are only four enemies in the game, two of which are trains and the other two denizens of the Wilderness, one of which is apparently so rare that I have not come across a single specimen in 13 hours of gameplay. While it is fun to fight these ships and take money or salvage off of them, eventually tedium sets in as you encounter the 17th identical pirate ship in a row. \n\nThe game is rather sparse right now, and the only stories available are small-scale ones. It is possible to recruit named crewmen as in Sea; however, many of them are not implemented yet, and thus, the majority of your crew, after some hours playing, will inevitably consist of such individuals as  \"Placeholder Quartermaster.\" It is such a lack of content that eventually led to me stopping the game for the time being for lack of anything meaningful to do. \n\n--Overall--\n\nSunless Skies, Failbetter's second attempt at an open-world survival, may be in early access, but I can already see, despite the early-version flaws, that the game will be great when it is released, having taken the best aspects of Sea's gameplay and improving on unfavorable aspects. While the game is not quite as refined as I would have expected of a public release, albeit an early-version one, Failbetter has never steered me wrong and I eagerly await their final product.\n\n", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_forever": 866, "last_played": 1506959777, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "steamid": "76561198045077314"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505267189, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.500496", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34911579"}, {"timestamp_created": 1505579083, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Don't get until it's fully out", "votes_up": 4, "author": {"num_games_owned": 560, "playtime_forever": 62, "last_played": 1505574874, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197982062042"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505579083, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.486611", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35001178"}, {"timestamp_created": 1504682344, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The only thing I have to say about this game is that any horror aspect that could have been flew out the window the moment you gave us a damn train, in space.
