{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1497795395, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I had high hopes for this game. When checking out the steam page it reminded me of Marble Blast. Unfortunately, this game is very slow. You move like a snail, especially up slopes. It's frustrating. There's unforgiving deaths. There's \"shortcuts\" and an \"energy bar\", both of which I have no clue what they are and I've played for almost an hour. I feel like that should be like level 2/3 stuff. Instead, I've gone through four or five levels of just rolling around.\n\nThe third level would send you back a couple minutes of this snail-like movement if you died (there's checkpoints, but they're not spreadout correctly). After about eight minutes into the level, there's this bug that'll toss you over the wall, right back to the beginning. Come on. It's level three.\n\nThe fifth level has a floating clear pyramid with a \"?\" in it. I had hoped it would be one of the powerups that I somehow hadn't encountered 40 minutes into this game yet. But no, it just dropped me in the middle of no where and fell to my death. What the heck? That's not fun. If it took me like 10 seconds to get back, maybe, but it's just stupid with how slow you move. Deaths are unforgiving in this game, albeit easily avoidable. I wouldn't mind as much as long as it wasn't in the first five levels.\n\nI'm five levels into the game and I have no idea what the point of these gems are. I'm thinking \"Why should I care about these?\" I eventually realized after going to the home screen there's a shop where you can buy a \"slow-mo\" mode (because this game isn't slow enough) and some other locked features.\n\nAlso, there's no way to adjust the in-game music/effects. Why not?\n\nI realize that this was developed by one person over 5 months, and I can commend the developer. I couldn't make this. It looks great. But, that doesn't take away from how frustrating this game is. It's slow, it's unforgiving, and I feel like more of the mechanics should be introduced earlier.", "votes_up": 6, "author": {"num_games_owned": 79, "playtime_forever": 40, "last_played": 1497794097, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041147722"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497795395, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.514544", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32538772"}, {"timestamp_created": 1497874174, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Mini Rollers is a great casual game (i am 15 levels  in). It can be unforgiving at times, for example in the third level there is a gaint beetle that can send you back to the beginning but you can easily avoid it. Six levels in you get a new ball and it is slightly different from the first ball, the third (level 11) and fourth( level 14 and it is fast, lighter and doesn't like water) ball isn't that far a part form each other so don't worry you don't have to play six levels for a new ball as far as i know. \n[b] Before you play i suggest you check out the basic video first here on the store page. [/b]\n\n [h1] Pros [h1]\n\n\n -Looks great.\n -Balls have physical properties not just abilities.\n -Levels have a nice difficulty.\n -Nice music.\n -New balls between nice amount of levels.\n -Nice ball sound effects.\n -Level replayability with all the balls that you have.\n\n\n[h1] Cons [h1]\n\n\n -Can't change the music volume.\n -Must go back to the menu to access the shop to spend gems.\n -The shortcut system is not explained in the game(see the basic video on the store page).", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_games_owned": 67, "playtime_forever": 1293, "last_played": 1499981152, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198222015212"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1497885700, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.505402", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32563874"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
