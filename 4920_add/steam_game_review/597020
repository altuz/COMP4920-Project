I would love to have the option to switch to different positions especially in the infield. The glove could of course use some work in terms of detail and realism but im happy this game is out. An option for a softball would be awesome as well. I read in the comments that the future would be to add trackers to an actual glove. If this is done, I would pay certainly more than 6 bucks.\n\nHeres hoping!\n\nThanks again for putting this out.", "votes_up": 0, "author": {"num_games_owned": 110, "playtime_forever": 41, "last_played": 1503454876, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053421886"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1498862378, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33058759"}, {"timestamp_created": 1497149484, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is awesome!

Simple, easy to pick up and play. It's a workout too.
