But I can already say it's a fun game with a great atmosphere and interesting characters. Brianna, a b-movie fan like myself, is a very relatable protagonist.\n\nI don't feel bombarded with walls of text, but I still get lots of information about people, the setting and the puzzles, which is a big plus. I'm also a big fan of the music and artwork. All in all, the game captures the atmosphere and allure of small movie theatres and the cult around b-movies very well. I generally don't play much text-based games, but the setting and story sold me on this.\n\nAlso encountered a bug and got support and a solution within a few hours.", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_games_owned": 104, "playtime_forever": 207, "last_played": 1500931815, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198256291224"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1499401302, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501618", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33332574"}, {"timestamp_created": 1503735615, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game has a very interesting story that you must gradually uncover.  The game is like a classic text adventure with locations and an inventory.  At each location you are presented with interaction options that you must select with the mouse.  It uses static artwork for locations and events that arise from interaction selections.  The artwork is very well done and the music really adds to whole experience.  You can tell that a lot of thought and effort went into the plotline.\n\nYou play as Brianna, a young woman who has been invited to a special screening of films by her favourite director, Claude Ferucil.  When Brianna arrives at the theatre she finds it abandoned and a mystery is presented.\n\nThe game is creepy and weird at times, even downright unsettling.  Being a text adventure, the gameplay is a bit slow as you must gather clues and piece together what has happened in the past - but eventually all will be revealed.  The developers give you enough information to get past the puzzles/tasks that are presented.  When faced with a challenge you have the option of receiving hints if you are stuck.\n\nI really liked this game - I wasn't sure what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. It is good for about six to eight hours of playing time.  I bought this on sale at 50% off and definitely got my money's worth.\n\nI give it 7.5 out of ten and recommend it to patient people who like story-rich point and click games like [u]Black Mirror[/u] or [u] Gray Matter[/u].", "votes_up": 2, "author": {"num_games_owned": 119, "playtime_forever": 422, "last_played": 1503819494, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198077378264"}, "comment_count": "1", "timestamp_updated": 1503735615, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34499397"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
