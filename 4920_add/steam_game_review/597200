As a veteran of GLWG and GBWG with hundreds of hours of playing (both on Steam and mobile), I've still pretty much enjoyed this sequel, which I'd waited since 2014.\n\nHaving said that, here are some suggestions that I hope Rubicon will consider implementing in the near future:\n1. The campaign is a little too short: spoiler alert: [spoiler]22[/spoiler]missions compared to 50 in GBWG.\n2. Everytime a new turn begins, the screen goes back to HQ location, which is a little annoying. It would be great if the screen could go back to where the last action took place.\n3. In Skirmish mode: I wish there were an option to choose which military branches each side can have. For example, we can assign Air Force to side 1, and Army to side 2. I believe this is a great way to maximize a player's strategy in using each branch's potential.\n4. If possible, please add a super-long-range unit. I remember Rubicon did consider this idea, but somehow it got dropped.\n5. Lastly, please increase Sniper's range to 4 or 5.\n\nThat's all for now, hope we all enjoy the game :))", "votes_up": 11, "author": {"num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_forever": 2218, "last_played": 1498749458, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079644468"}, "comment_count": "3", "timestamp_updated": 1496516572, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.521173", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32158449"}, {"timestamp_created": 1496612065, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is a fun and silly war game.

I haven't played any multi-player.  If you are interested in multi-player, I suggest you find reviews that address it.  This version is the only one that has local multi-player and co-op modes which is a great feature if that's your thing.  But if you are mostly interested in just the single player campaign, read on.\n\nLike its predecessors, this is a fun game.  It doesn't take too much strategizing, and is a casual and entertaining title.  There are a few missions that might take you a few times to win, but overall, the difficulty is just right if you have more fun winning than you do with a serious challenge.  Difficulty cannot be adjusted which is disappointing for a third rendition of the original GLWG.\n\nAll that said, this game feels like a step backwards from its predecessors.  In GBWG, you had limited fuel and ammunition for your units and you needed to use the supply vehicles to resupply them.  This added a nice bit of depth to a sucessful strategy.  In ELWG, you have unlimited fuel and ammo.  In GBWG, you had access to Jeeps, MLRS, the aforementioned supply trucks, and tank killers.  All of those are missing from ELWG - at least for the single player campaign.  The MLRS is available but for the enemy only.  ELWG does provide some very interesting new units including a submarine.  Rubicon boasts that they have 47 different units.  Unfortunately, in the single player campaign at least, like the MLRS these units are available only to the enemy.  There is nothing new for the single player unit-wise and as previosly mentioned, a lot of the units you used to have are no longer available.  The engineers in GBWG have been replaced with builders.  Like engineers, builders build things.  But the enginner could also capture enemy oil wells and buildings.  The builder cannot and is basically an engineer-lite.  A new mechanic unit is available which is a welcome addition.  The mechanic can fix damaged vehicles much like the medic can heal infantry units.\n\nI always enjoyed the sea battles.  But the campaign provides only two (disclaimer: I think it's two - I didn't count while playing, but it's certainly not very many.)\n\nThe game is short.  It has [spoiler]less than half[/spoiler] the number of levels that GBWG had.\n\nMy final complaint is probably something that Rubicon likes.  The \"epic\" factor.  Some of the maps are very large, but the game can become a grind when playing these large maps.  The number of units on the board becomes very large.  It takes a long time to complete your turn and becomes difficult to remember which units you have already moved or attacked with and which units you haven't, so you find yourself clicking on each unit again to see if you have already moved them or not.  Changing the unit color to something dark to indicate that they have no movement left would be a big help.  [i]Commanders: Attack of the Genos[/i] did this and it works very well.  A separate indicator showing if a unit has attacked already would also be a nice feature, but doesn't exist.  It is often difficult to see what is on the board when you have a large number air units hovering over ground units or when you are in an area full of terrain like trees.\n\nGBWG is a better offering in my opinion, and costs less too.  If you don't already have GBWG, I suggest you get that one first.  It's a better game with more units, provides a longer single player campaign, and costs less.\n\nDespite all of these complaints, the game is still fun, so I am giving it a reluctant thumbs up.  6.5/10.", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_games_owned": 353, "playtime_forever": 2309, "last_played": 1498615051, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019025778"}, "comment_count": "3", "timestamp_updated": 1498615437, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32707144"}, {"timestamp_created": 1497938439, "received_for_free": false, "review": "So many good things to say on this game.  This is, indeed, from the makers of \"Great Big War Game,\" which is so far the only turn-based strategy game to out-do the Nintendo DS \"Advanced Wars\" game.   This game takes that same engine and puts quite a few new twists on it:\n1. You can create buildings now!  No longer is there a guaranteed recipe for victory on a map, as your opponent can really mix it up with where they place their structures and barriers (and what kind of structures at that).\n2. Different factions.  Most games just give you different names for the same capabilities, but here each faction actually has unique capabilities (similar to playing Starcraft).  \n3. Seed-generated maps (similar to Minecraft seeds).  You can create an endless number of maps, and save the seeds to your favorites.\n4. They've added Co-Op mode as well, and you can have more than 2 armies battling it out on a map.\n\nThe only thing I miss is fog of war, but there was a lot of contention around that feature and many online battles turned it off, so I suppose I understand the reasoning behind removing.  I still hope to see it return someday.\n\nI bought this game when it first came out, so some of the multiplayer features aren't quite live (friends lists), but Rubicon did a great job of continuosly updating Great Big War Game and Combat Monsters, so I'm confident this will be the case of ELWG.  \n\nOh, and you can also get this on Android and iOS, and it's not some watered-down version (like they do with Minecraft PE or Terraria).  It's the full game!  You can start an online multiplayer game on the PC, and then continue to play it on your phone!
