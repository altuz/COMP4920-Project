Rather than performing animated actions (besides walking and one or two other things), the character will just state \"okay, I did this thing\" without moving. Every time you open your inventory, you can't just click on an item to use it--you first have to remember to click the \"Use\" or \"Look At\" icons on the right side of the inventory, THEN click on the item you wanted, or else the inventory will just close itself when you click on an item. There are many spelling/grammar mistakes in the captions, which gets distracting, and adds to the low production value. Again, cute concept, and the music was fun, but I think it needs a lot more work.", "votes_up": 7, "author": {"num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_forever": 152, "last_played": 1500945051, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198098023726"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1500947323, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.486140", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33777293"}, {"timestamp_created": 1500069109, "received_for_free": false, "review": "To recommend or not to recommend...\n\nThis short adventure was created by a single person and is their first release.

Everything has a great concept to it!\nUnfortunately, the concept is the best part of the game, and when you have a great concept, but everything else is just kinda \"meh\", the whole thing just leaves you... Disappointed.\nThe idea for the story is great, but it was short, and barely a cohesive story. There could've been so much more of it. And I'll admit, I like the ending, but it felt so rushed, and again, disappointing.\nThe location is a mysterious island that [spoiler]has ghosts on it[/spoiler], but [spoiler]you meet one and ONLY ONE ghost, and even then only for like 2 seconds, because all you do with him is give him a picture for his girlfriend and then he leaves[/spoiler], and that's just disappointing. So much more could've been done with the backstory for this island. At the very least, have some of the characters talk about it more.\nSpeaking of the characters, they all had so much potential to fun and interesting! But they were all just kinda... Blah. Seriously, the [spoiler]drunk guy[/spoiler] had the most character. Even the main character is just robotic. The voice acting is decent, but none of the characters' dialouge was very good, and even the best actors can't save bad scripts. And the script wasn't even bad, per se, but again just disappointing. No witty dialouge or sarcastic comments that are often the hallmark of point-and-click adventures. And in the few places where there ARE jokes, they often feel just as boring as the rest of the dialouge. So much of the game could've been made so much better with a little bit of clever dialouge, and it really just left me wanting to play a WadjetEye or old LucasArts game.\nOverall, the game really just made me wish the people who made it had done more with it. It's not that I don't like the game, but I honestly wish there was more substance to it. Just do MORE with it!\n\nOh yeah, and that combination puzzle was complete crap.
