{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1506126806, "received_for_free": false, "review": "West of Loathing is a lot of things, but what it is most of all is an epic Stickman Western. Part Spaghetti Western, part Eastwood Western, part Monty Python, but all fun and hilarity.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThe story in West of Loathing is one of love and loss. You are the witty protagonist, a stick man teen set off from his family\u2019s home to explore the world. Unfortunately, Cows from Hell are rampaging all along the countryside, and so you begin investigating that while simply exploring your world, meeting new stick people and forming friendships (and enmities) along the way.\n\nThe comedy in West of Loathing never relents, and is very much in the fusion of Clint Eastwood meets The Holy Grail. Of course, this is a western, but the memes and pop culture references also never relent, and to optimal effect. The writing is just awesome, tongue in cheek, and hilarious.\n\n9 out of 10\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nWest of Loathing is a stickman game, and so you can expect sketch art as the medium of expression here. Mostly black and white, minimalist sketch art. Again, this is done to optimal effect and it really becomes endearing and comfortable. While the artwork is sparse, it is as evocative as it is effective. Also, the style really assists in the healthy serving of sarcastic exposition you will encounter throughout.\n\n9 out of 10\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay in West of Loathing is really a combination of 2-D open world exploration and JRPG style combat.\n\nThere is an overlay map, from which you will explore the open terrain finding towns, old mines, ranches, forts, and other random spots. The 2-D map, from which you will handle direct exploration, combat, dialogue, and so on is set up in pretty basic fashion. You have your base areas and then buildings/caves/etc\u2026that you can explore. No one area  is very large, but each makes complete sense as far as its design goes and fits perfectly with the overall theme of the game.\n\nThe combat system is handled in traditional JRPG style face offs with some very forgiving RNG\u2019s (random number generators), base attacks, special attacks, and of course item usage. It\u2019s actually a pretty easy game and you really shouldn\u2019t die very often.\n\nTo assist in this, you have an infinite number of inventory slots with which to carry the various  weapons, limited use items (such as food and drink for buffs, items which cause specific types of damage, healing objects, lockpicks, and of course crafting materials.\n\nCrafting is an essential part of this game and you will craft a lot of items through the course of your adventure. It happens in a variety of ways as well. For example, you will need a stove to bake bans, a silversmiths table to craft silver bullets and lockpicks, etc...\n\nAdditionally, you can and will build relationships, via conversations and/or side quests. The side quests often poke fun at the standard RPG tropes by making you do them almost to the point of exhaustion while also making fun of the situation as you do. In fact, this game in general is about breaking down and making fun of the RPG standards.\n\nThere is actually quite a bit more to this surprisingly deep game, but I\u2019ll leave off for now.\n\n9 out of 10\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\n\nThe audio is actually done to perfection. From the ambient sounds you would expect from a western to music that would fit in any Clint Eastwood film, you are in for a treat with regards to the audio in West of Loathing.\n\n10 out of 10\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nWest of Loathing is a game that, simply by appearance, can be easily dismissed. However, that would be a mistake as it actually ended up being an excellent game worthy of at least on and possibly even two or three playthroughs. You will be doing yourself a favor by picking this one up.\n\n9.3 belligerent and drunk stick man horses out of 10 possible. The other .7?

I'm not even joking.  There are two reasons I did this: 1) achievements and 2) this game is ridiculously fun and entertaining.  I've spent basically 82 hours playing this game and I had fun each and every time I did it!  Seriously, even though I was basically doing the exact same things as I'd done before over and over, I still thoroughly enjoyed playing.  Which lead me to question how in the world I didn't get tired of the game even remotely.  I came up with a list to answer that question, which I will now share.  \n\nI think a large part of it is the sheer amount of humor in the West of Loathing.  Humor and puns are practically the lifeblood of this game!  There's so much attention to detail, from the bigger stuff like the quests and missions to the smaller stuff like random encounters and even minute details like the personalization of tombstones and notes!  Every single character that appears in the game is unique.  What's more, the way you play and the choices you make affect literally everything in the game, from how the story ends to the encounters you have and the way you handle them.  In all of my playthroughs of this game (and I intend to do at least one or two more), there seemed to always be something new.\n\nI so highly recommend West of Loathing.

It's like one of those old-timey DOS RPGs that you always say you're going to go back and play, except when you finally do it's so abstruse and clunky and old-fashioned that you end up dying in the first encounter, or unable to figure out how to get out of the first town, so you quit after 20 minutes.\n\nIt's like that, except it's actually accessible and playable, with an interface that you understand how to use just by looking at it. It still has all the good stuff about those old RPGs that everyone raves about: worldbuilding, a boatload of secrets and mysteries to unravel, multiple ways to solve problems, skill checks out the wazoo, bad graphics, exciting loot, a million viable ways you can build your character, and a rewarding tactical turn-based combat system. It's also the funniest game I've ever played, which is a low bar, but WoL grabs that brass ring and races past the finish line with it faster than Superman can mix this metaphor.\n\nIf you like computer role-playing games you should play West of Loathing.\n\nOne erratum (9/22/17): If you want the rewarding tactical turn-based combat, make sure you equip the hard hat. Otherwise the battles are pretty trivial. If you do put the hard hat on, make sure you select the option to distribute your XP manually instead of letting the game allocate it for you. The game would still be fantastic and well worth the price of admission if you just want to breeze through the combat and explore the world, but for me personally the challenging combat and the decisions I had to make when building my character added an extra layer of enjoyment to the game.", "votes_up": 4, "author": {"num_games_owned": 407, "playtime_forever": 1566, "last_played": 1506592176, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 268, "steamid": "76561198000833782"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506056290, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.510022", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35055201"}, {"timestamp_created": 1505639796, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[b][h1]\"If any game needs to be made, it's more of this\" \u2014\u2014Markplier[/h1][/b]\n10/10\uff0cThe world need more of this.", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_games_owned": 58, "playtime_forever": 1274, "last_played": 1506405225, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 188, "steamid": "76561198067671721"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505639796, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35018525"}, {"timestamp_created": 1504942115, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Now get KoL on steam somehow.", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_games_owned": 398, "playtime_forever": 2183, "last_played": 1502789184, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198036513923"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504942115, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34831150"}, {"timestamp_created": 1505863120, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I have a hundred games on steam, and I have no genre preferences at all; I go mostly by if the game feels like it can bring something good.

I had never heard of Kingdom of Loathing prior to discovering this game, and as such I have never played it before.  \n2. I bought this because I watched a let's play of the beginning bits and my curiosity was piqued.  I highly recommend that if this game sounds like something you want to buy, *do not* do this.  You do not want the feeling of \"Oh I've heard this joke before,\" as the comedy is worth experiencing for the first time on your own.\n\nOverview:\nAfter picking a name and gender for your character, you are given the option of magic-wielder, melee fighter, or a rogue/thief class.  (For the record, in my one playthrough I have completed thus far, I picked magic).  Your character has decided to leave your family's farm to go west, where small towns and demon cows are awaiting.  That's basically all of the story in a nutshell.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n- Laugh-Out-Loud Funny  \n\nSeemingly everything has a goofy description, a peculiar story, or is just a strange thing in general that will probably make you crack a smile.  This humor is not high-brow, but it doesn't have to be.  If you allow it, this story will make you laugh.  The game thrives on player exploration, so you are doing yourself and the game a disservice if you do not check out everything you can.\n\n- Surprisingly Open-Ended\n\nInstead of formal levels, the progression in this RPG is mostly through using XP to increase stats.  In a way very reminiscent of Fallout, having certain stats a high enough level will allow you to avoid the game becoming a series of never-ending fights, while also hiding some of the game's best gags.  Of course, no one will blame you if you mercilessly fight everything that looks at you sideways either.  The game shows you this choice early on when you are first given the option to kill a bandit or talk him out of his life of crime.  Not only that, but the short time you spend with side characters while helping them with their varying problems does often lead to actually helping them.  There's a strange amount of impact you leave on the small game world.  \n\n- Intuitive, Easy Combat\n\nThis is as simple to grasp as it gets. Fighting is standard turn-based fare, with melee weapon, gun, and magic attack options.  Each fight you start with a certain amount of AP which you use to cast spells, but guns and melee weapons are unlimited.  Characters are on a grid, but this really serves no change in combat.  Guns become blocked off by cover (either yours or your enemies) or another enemy standing in front of your target.  Because magic and melee still work in these cases, however, I can't say this made much difference.\n\n- Interesting and Likeable Characters  \n\nFrom the most evil enemies to your choice of \"pardner,\" every npc in this game has an adorable charm.  Part of it is of course the stick figure aesthetic, but characters stand out for their quirkiness and deadpan acceptance of the ridiculous world they live in.  Some moments with characters are even downright sad in spite of the obvious comedic theme.  One character that you choose from a few options follows you throughout the game as your \"pardner\" and fights in combat with you.  Each of these characters was interesting and I wanted them to go with me for different reasons.  Hearing their dialogue and using their abilities is warranting of multiple playthroughs, as far as I see it.  \n\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n- Little Quest Variety\n\nAlmost every mission, whether it's part of the main quest or not, is at the heart of it a fetch quest.  Characters have lost this or that, or had it stolen, and it's up to you to find it (and you'll probably have to kick some ass to get to it).  The game seems to make fun of itself for this late in the game during one of the main story missions, with your main character actually getting pretty frustrated at a particularly ridiculous endeavor.  For me though, this was just a reminder of how I was beginning to grow tired of the superficiality of the actual tasks I was doing.  I often used the ability to ask my \"pardner\" where I was supposed to go next for the various side missions just because I started getting bored of quests and would go off exploring instead.\n\n- Combat Growing Tedious\n\nAs I said previously, I played the magic-casting \"beanslinger\" class so my best attacks were spells that I learned from books I found throughout the world.  Once I had found a combo of spells that allowed me to take a good chunk of health from an enemy in turn one, there was no reason to do anything else.  Battles started to become all the same, and I started spacing out while doing them just to get to more of the funny dialogue.  One particular annoyance came in a fight which had three enemies attacking me and 2 others buffing the whole team's attack and defense each turn.  I had to kill the attackers first so that I wouldn't be killed (more an annoyance that anything, as you can come right back), but this left the other two enemies with 100+ hp health bars buffing themselves into oblivion.  By the time I was fighting only them, they had buffed themselves so much that I could only do 1 damage at a time to them, and had to just speed up the combat speed in the options menu and wittle them both down one at a time.  This is of course a worst-case scenario, but as I said just going through the motions once you are super strong quickly becomes the worst part of the game.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n\n-The Ending (NO SPOILERS!) \n\nThe game just sort of ends once you complete the last mission of the \"main\" storyline.  You are free to watch the ending cutscene, as well as go right back into the world and complete any remaining sidequests, but there's something so dissatisfying about it.  It's a feeling of reading a very good joke book, and the empty feeling you get when you close the back cover.  \n\n\nTL;DR, West of Loathing is game that is a solid RPG that just barely overstays its welcome.  It's hilarious for people who don't mind some simple humor, but the game design could have used a bit more complexity.  \n\nIf you don't mind an RPG not being very deep in its mechanics and instead being a charming, ridiculous world, West of Loathing is your game.  You're either going to play it once, enjoy it, but never feel a need to play it again, or want to try every \"pardner\" and replay for hard mode and show all of your friends.  \n\nFor the low price, the length and potential replayability, and the enjoyment I personally got from it, I can whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a chill time and a good laugh.", "votes_up": 2, "author": {"num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 526, "last_played": 1506731935, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 526, "steamid": "76561198096200616"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506497892, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35237283"}, {"timestamp_created": 1506965130, "received_for_free": false, "review": "yeehaw", "votes_up": 2, "author": {"num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_forever": 449, "last_played": 1506294699, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 49, "steamid": "76561198171855439"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506965130, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35424271"}, {"timestamp_created": 1505790851, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I can't remember the last time I laughed this much playing a game.", "votes_up": 2, "author": {"num_games_owned": 428, "playtime_forever": 633, "last_played": 1506742475, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 411, "steamid": "76561197968099417"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505790851, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503834", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35057046"}, {"timestamp_created": 1505005641, "received_for_free": false, "review": "10/10 would befriend gary again", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_forever": 985, "last_played": 1503369372, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198106960537"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505005641, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34850408"}, {"timestamp_created": 1505004475, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Almost perfect, but needs more hats. 9/10\n\nSeriously: I don't generally like text-heavy games, but the writing here is clever, witty and light, with great attention to grammar, punctuation and spelling.

You should definitely give West of Loathing a try even if you aren't already a fan of the greater Kingdom of Loathing universe.", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 2102, "playtime_forever": 1400, "last_played": 1504784538, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002540254"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504783066, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34792367"}, {"timestamp_created": 1504795252, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is one of the most charming games I have played in a long time now, this game decides to give the bird to all the major gaming companies with a spitoon hand held high.

The biggest thing that stands out here is the exploration and excellent absurd humor. Same kind of humor in games like undertale. Combat in the game felt either very easy or hard. You collect a ton of items over the course of the game and depending on playstyle, you might not use most of them. Graphics are extremely minimal but it fits the game. My biggest gripe is that it felt like the main story wasn't important. It just felt like it had no meaning while the side quests sometimes felt a lot more important. \n\nOverall the game was one of my favorites in a while: 8.7/10", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 121, "playtime_forever": 829, "last_played": 1504922480, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079486616"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1504923307, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34827222"}, {"timestamp_created": 1504959848, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Best.
