I will admit I did get confused a few times so it can definitely be finished in under 3 hours. I did enjoy it and would reccomend it but not at the current price. I payed $1 and if I had payed more than $3 I would not be reccomending it at all.  I understand the developer has put a lot of time into this and when I had a question he replied almost instantly in the forums but even with the last dungeon included this just doesn't feel like a game that should cost $10. \n\nThe game itself was enjoyable and did make me scratch my head a few times but the enenies were lackluster at best. The only enemys that seem to know you're even there are the ones that shoot projectiles. All the others including bosses just randomly move around as if you don't even exist. The Boss battles themselves are way too easy as well. I only found out I was even fighting a boss on more than one occasion after defeating them. I just thought it was a new enemy being introduced. \n\nThe map is basically useless as well in my opinion. It may be more useful if it wasn't the size of a thumnail and introducing  a second map only made things more confusing. I enetered a dungeon at one point that I had already been in but had to turn back because I needed another item. When I returned later I turned back again thinking I had already finished it but that was only becasue the map was completed. An X or something on the map once completed would probably help or just have seperate dungeon maps in each dungeon. I honestly don't understand the second map at all unless I'm missing something.\n\nAll in all I'm glad this was on sale for a dollar.

That said it definitely gets the feeling of the original zelda down.  The monsters in the beginning that pop out of the ground to attack are a pain in the butt to kill and I died many times to them before I just gave up trying to kill them and ran on by instead.  Honestly the blobs and skeletons are easier to deal with than the burrowed ones.  Also I don't know if it was intentional or not but the burrowing monsters look like male body parts when they pop up.  My wife and I both thought the same thing when we saw them.\n\nAs of the posting most of the dungeons are not very complex, by far the best dungeon is the fish shaped one.  It is less linear than the other dungeons and makes you solve a maze to get through (albeit a simple one).  One other thing, during the boss battles with the aliens there are not any indicators of how much room you have to maneuver on either side of the room.  Also the space seems slightly less than the normal size of other rooms so you can be running side to side but get stopped too soon.\n\nI do have a problem with the alien map that you can find.  It shows too much because it shows all the dungeons and other cave areas.  It would be better if it showed above ground and then only certain parts of the dungeons.  Definitely it should show the final dungeon in whole.  Maybe have the map show where upgrades are but not show terrain, that way people have a way to find things but still have to work out how to get to it.\n\nProbably the hardest part of the game for me was the haunted woods.  Since I still didn't have much hearts and the enemies do a lot of damage, not to mention the moving trees coming out of nowhere, I died many times.  I still wouldn't change anything about it though.\n\nUsing a shotgun to fight definitely takes some practice because of the random spread and how it doesn't knock enemies away like swords do in other games.  Another good thing to see is that the NPCs will defend themselves if you attack them.  And it will hurt when they fight back.\n\nWhen I have seen problems with the game, the developer was quick to fix any issues like crashes or problem areas.  For example I commented that when you get a rim fragment it shouldn't teleport you to the entrance of the dungeon becuase there might still be things in the place you need to collect.  So he fixed it almost the next day.\n\nSome improvements I recommend if the developer has time and resources to do them.\n[list]\n[*]Most dungeons could use a few more updates to make them harder to solve.  Not by adding more enemies but forcing the player to think more about how to get through them instead of the linear setup for most underground areas.\n[*]Is it possible to allow the character to move diagonally as well as shoot diagonally.\n[*]The rock blocks that are a slightly different color than the others that you can pass through, need to be more distinguishable unless that was the intended goal to force the player to seek out a secret.\n[/list]\n\nSo far I recommend this game.\n\n*edited to add bullets", "votes_up": 2, "author": {"num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_forever": 450, "last_played": 1507183472, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 405, "steamid": "76561198022041814"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1506904488, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35059715"}, {"timestamp_created": 1505257181, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Excellent game.
