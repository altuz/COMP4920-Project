I didn't pay for an early access game or download some beta, this game should be AT LEAST playable but it isn't. I love the concept and it shows a lot of potential but it is all ruined by a buggy mess. Nothing seems to work in the slightest. Animals clip through fences, my character frequently gets stuck in place forever, there is no clear purpose for anything and the tutorial is useless. I would love to see this game improved but until then I cannot recommend it in any way.", "votes_up": 7, "author": {"num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_forever": 19, "last_played": 1501532746, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198360747843"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1496678240, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.506314", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32202332"}, {"timestamp_created": 1494430956, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Although the game was vile when it has initially launched, the developer made an effort to work on this game and I've to say his effort paid off!\n\n6/10 -Could be better\n\nPS: Please make an easy mode thanks!( Only reason why I gave up on this)", "votes_up": 7, "author": {"num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 30, "last_played": 1497610929, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198119242396"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1494430956, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503388", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31667413"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 3, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
