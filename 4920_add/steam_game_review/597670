{"reviews": [{"timestamp_created": 1493275741, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Exterminator is a brief, simple, yet very polished room-scale VR whack-a-mole game. Similar to the traditional carnival favorite, you have to swing at mice emerging from various pipes in a 360 degree environment. Combos can be built up by continuing to hit mice within a time window starting from the last successful hit. After a certain amount of time a boss creature will come up out of the floor and you can pummel him into oblivion while taking a few swipes at the surrounding mice before the round ends. \n\nLike I mentioned before, there\u2019s not a whole lot to this game but the overall experience is very good. The game has you hold the controllers sideways, reducing your chance of damaging them (although you might still bust a knuckle if you aren\u2019t careful) and the response from landing a hit is solid. You don\u2019t necessarily have to swing around either; simply waving a controller over the location of an exposed mouse is enough to register a hit. This game offers three challenge modes which are faster and with more mice per round, and there is a global scoreboard so you can see how you measure up against the rest of the playerbase. \n\nExterminator would be a good game to add to your library if you happen to run a VR caf\u00e9 or are demoing VR for friends and family as it\u2019s a great way of introducing people to room-scale virtual reality. For everyone else, it\u2019s still a nice little stress-relief game that feels more like a real game rather than a tech demo like so many other VR titles. Consider giving it a spin if you\u2019ve got the hardware to handle it.\n", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_games_owned": 425, "playtime_forever": 38, "last_played": 1496539546, "num_reviews": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197967229781"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1493275741, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.504847", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31388603"}, {"timestamp_created": 1491736961, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Well polished.
