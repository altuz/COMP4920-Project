The visual style speaks for itself; if you're interested in this almost sort of Native American or tribal white-on-black starkness, you know this game is for you already and you should play it. The mechanics feel just like they should and there's only one annoying bit where left and right get reversed (I raged a little bit). The music is great but they are fixed songs on loops, not responsive to your actions or the progression of the level as in 140 for example. Still, excellent compositions that fit the game's mood perfectly.\n\nI'll use this space to recommend a few similar things that are adjacently awesome:\n[list]\n[*]140 is a game by one of the Playdead guys that has a similarly stark art style but with a simply amazing synthesizer soundtrack.\n[*]ibb & obb has a similar sense of reversable momentum, except designed around co-op and with the exact opposite color palatte (which is to say, lots of colors and gradients)\n[*]PixelJunk Eden is a similarly bouncy platformer with tons of vector-based graphics on stark color palattes\n[*]Absolute Drift if you want a stark game but with drifty car mechanics for some reason\n[/list]", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 363, "playtime_forever": 221, "last_played": 1505251338, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034423768"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505423722, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34957915"}, {"timestamp_created": 1505423706, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I found a swastika between all the images. 10/10 would paint again.", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 51, "playtime_forever": 211, "last_played": 1505406280, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198087065681"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1505424237, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34957911"}, {"timestamp_created": 1504673004, "received_for_free": false, "review": "0/0 would rate again", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 27, "last_played": 1504575111, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198418313480"}, "comment_count": "1", "timestamp_updated": 1504673004, "voted_up": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.435316", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 33, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34769529"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 38, "num_reviews": 6, "total_negative": 1, "total_positive": 37, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
