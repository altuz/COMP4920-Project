I enjoy the game so far, the premise is good. You're a toy car that drives around and completes objectives. Cool. Great time waster, nice graphics and physics. \n\nMy only gripes are that the car controls are too touchy without using slow motion all of the time. \n\nThe suspension of the car is bouncy and hard to get used to. You hit a bump and you go flying.\n\nIn all, I like this game. A few kinks, but hey even giant AAA titles have problems.

Graphically the game is everything you see in the trailer, it's amazing, but gameplay wise is another story.  The controls are atrocious.
