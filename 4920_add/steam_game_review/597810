You have been sent to deal with a serious threat, and in so doing, have come back to the home you only remember from nightmares and a shattered past. That home still stands, though it is broken down after all this time (and you thought it had been burned to the ground). During this game you will reconstruct it and use it as a base to fight the dark threats growing outside.", "votes_up": 2, "author": {"num_games_owned": 445, "playtime_forever": 78, "last_played": 1490756958, "num_reviews": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069159152"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1490754852, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.497993", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "30805609"}, {"timestamp_created": 1489964429, "received_for_free": true, "review": "Need info abut this game no one make help in youtube!!!!!\n Shining Plume 1 not so hard found quest here its good game but buz its new hard found were to go in big world!!\n8++ like++", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_games_owned": 92, "playtime_forever": 404, "last_played": 1489269779, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198213843708"}, "comment_count": 0, "timestamp_updated": 1489964429, "voted_up": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "language": "english", "weighted_vote_score": "0.447675", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_down": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "30626044"}], "query_summary": {"total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 0, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
