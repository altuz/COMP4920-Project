There's been a serious lack of decent, affordable TRPG map makers out there for quite some time, though that is recently being rectified by programs such as this.\n\nThe UI is quite well organized and easy to navigate for the most part. Making dungeon rooms of varying sizes and depths and populating them with environmental details is remarkably simple. You could easily construct a decently sized dungeon within 15 minutes or so, as long as you have the image resources you need and a basic idea of its layout in mind.\n\nThat said, Arcane Mapper is not without issues. In its launch state, the program's still got some bugs that need to be sorted out. To give a few examples, it tends to freeze when I minimize it at times, and the lines and vertexes that you place down when shaping out a room occasionally disappear for some reason. I think it happens after I delete a room. Also, the program is missing a few of its advertised features at launch, such as procedural liquids and steam workshop support. *However*, I have faith that these features will be added in due time. The dev has stated that library support and web search will be added within the next day or so, and he has stayed true to most of his initial promises. I'm not saying that it's always acceptable, but I think the dev is making an earnest attempt to improve his product. He's certainly provided us with consistent status updates throughout Arcane Mapper's development, so I have faith in him to continue to deliver.\n\nSo yeah, while the product may not be in a perfect state, what we have right now is pretty decent, and I truly believe that it will get better over time. My opinion may change, based on how satisfactory future development turns out to be, but for now, I'm quite impressed with what's been presented to me, and what's been promised. If I decide the product isn't worth it, I will change my review, but I'll admit that I've been itching for a solid, low-priced map maker for some time now, so I'm really looking forward to whatever comes next. I say give Arcane Mapper a chance.

The developer has been very willing to work with his customers to make this tool more accessible from the start.\n\nMy prior review had detailed a few bugs that are no longer present, and a few misconceptions that have since been answered.  (rather quickly, too!)  While the program is still fairly simple, this only gives it a starting point to grow in a ton of directions that I can't wait to see.\n\nIf you're new to GMing tabletops, this is a great tool work with; No need to learn layer masking or any other image editing software unless you want post editing.   You can simply draw your map, choose your textures dynamically (meaning no constant editing to see how different walls and floors work together), and then light it up.  It's all very hands on, and doesn't feel overwhelming or technical, despite the power it gives you.  No more drawing boxes in MS Paint.  Get that shit outta here.\n\nNow, as it currently stands, most WILL want to work with their maps they export from here in post, if they want things like texture fading between floors,outdoor elements, etc.  But, again, this is clearly a work in progress that I can only imagine the dev(s) are working feverishly to further.\n\nShould you pick it up?  If you're new to mapmaking, definitely.  If you've been doing it for a while and already have a grasp on image manipulation, probably not YET, but if you want a quick way to get a clean, easy-to-work-with base for more complex maps, this is it.

I have to keep moving the wall points one by one and praying it won't crash on me.\n\nOn the upside, it appears you can easily create custom content. Check out your */steam/steamapps/common/arcanmapper/library directory, and you can clearly see each prop, floor, etc. This implies to me that you can either add in your own .png files and add way more content, which is always a plus, or at least you can overwrite some crappy thing you don't want with this, such as removing a torch style you won't ever use and replace it with a new color (like making blue a rich purple or neon pink for all it matters). \n\nI got a refund on this, but still vote up on it because the developer(s) made a point of troubleshooting my bugs, as any can see in the coments below.
