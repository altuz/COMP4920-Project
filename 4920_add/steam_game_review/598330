I haven't seen the development progress, but from what I have seen and have played, this is one of the most advanced early access games that I have ever played.\n\nThe mechanics of the game work well, especially for an early access game. There are some mechanics that I don't think have to be changed, but there are some mechanincs that have to have some work done, like people missing their flights because they sit at the cafe, and as a result of this, planes are 30 - 120 minutes late (See next paragraph). But overall, the mechanincs are really well done for an early access game.\n\nNot everything in the game is all good though. I am actually writing this review because of the main fact that I want to get across: people keep missing their flights! Here's the scenario. You have just spent about 4 real days (or 30 game days) building, and nothing else. You have built an airport with 30 different gates (and it isn't 100% finished), and with the hopes of attracting every single airline company and sending them to your airport. You're also about $52 million in debt (I think you can gather what game mode I was playing). All you want to do is watch your airport come to life. You get bored of building. So, on the 30th day, you get planes, and wait for your airport to spring into action, doing what it was made to do at the start of a new month (I mean, it is September as of writing this). What you weren't expecting were all your planes being between 30 - 120 minutes late (Yes, sometimes it got that bad) because half of the people on the plane were slowly making their way from the cafe all the way to your gate. By the time your plane leaves, it's 90 minutes late. That is the troubles I'm going through. I think I lost the point. The point I am trying to make is that: \n\nThe developers should improve the intelligence of the AI, so people don't make their flight 90 minutes late\n and then clog up the whole system and as a result, every plane starts becoming 90 minutes late. (While I'm at it, could you also change the morning, afternoon and night times a bit. Instead of night time going to 10pm, it could border with the morning time, to create a full loop so your planes can go at any time and not be restricted to 4 am till 10 pm. Just a thought).\n\nI feel really bad now. I feel like I just insulted the developers. If I did, I am so sorry. But, long story short, This game is amazing and I recommend this game, but I think that the further the game got in it's development, the more I would recommend it.\n\nAnyway, this game is amazing and you definitely should buy this game if you don't mind the game not being perfect.
