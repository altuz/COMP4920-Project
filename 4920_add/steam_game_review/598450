It has got a very nice battle system with some intricacies to it. The parry-cancelling that allows you to bait attacks for example, or combo two attacks. Jumping isn't broken, which makes it very tense throughout each round, one mess-up can mean everything.\n\nA MAJOR buzzkill for this game is that there isn't any online for the multiplayer. I was hyped for this game when I saw the mechanic shift from health bars, and was hoping to be able to play against other people, but that's just not the case and on a keyboard, it's too cramped to play 2 player and though you can use a controller, that requires spending more money on one if you don't already own one.\n\nAnother kill for me, was the control mapping. The controls themselves are fine, but it doesn't save your controls for each time you launch the game. Something like that is quite vital for almost any game, as I'm already used to a different button mapping from playing a game similar to this. A minor quality of life adjustment that NEEDS to see itself into the game.\n\nIs it worth the current value? Yes, mostly. Does it need online to be something I'd continue to play? 100%.", "recommendationid": "31421826", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534431", "timestamp_created": 1493402725, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 80, "playtime_forever": 112, "last_played": 1495485741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063788591"}, "votes_up": 64}, {"timestamp_updated": 1493392194, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Caught me by suprise.\nSollid game, a hidden gem.\nOne clean hit kills.
