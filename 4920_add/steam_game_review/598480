Obviously, any black/white platformer gets compared to Limbo which really isn't a good comparison beyond surface level features. It is not a bad game but I feel like toward the second half there is more frustration than fun (mostly do to poor hit boxes, combat, and time-consuming respawns) While I feel that game could be sufficient with few updates I was forcing myself to enjoy it.\n\nThe first Act focused primarily on puzzles, story, and platforming which was very enjoyable. I only died few times and felt like I was playing a casual, sinister looking puzzle game. Then it starts snowballing downhill almost to where I considered refunding it. In next few Acts, generic combat becomes a big part of the experience. Game has a lot of insta-death so you constantly replaying 2-4 minutes sections between checkpoints. I died at least 100 times to just poor visual hit boxes. The combat system gets really boring and just feels like a massive waste of time when you die in an unfair way.\n\nFor me, one of the biggest problems is the visibility. There are many parts of the game where I had to move my head toward the screen just to see the enemy in dark corridor. Other times I just wander around the area for 20 minutes because I can't see the interactive object blending into the environment. Part of the problem is just the fact that game has no zoom options (maybe will be added later?) I definitely feel that developers need to do a better job showing points of interest and maybe give some tool tips when new mechanics are introduced. In general, I would even enjoy the aesthetic more if only I could look at world's detail closer. \n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ very enjoyable aesthetic\n+ many unique mechanics\n+ interesting puzzles\n+ good amount of content\n+ soundtrack\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- visibility problems\n- problematic hit boxes\n- a repetitive and frustrating combat system \n- beginner traps that make you replay from poor checkpoints\n- no zoom options\n- relatively weak story \n- limited platforming elements\n\n[b] Final Thoughts 5.5/10 [/b]\n\nI can't deny the effort that went into making the game look the way it does. There is clearly a lot of thought that went into making each object, enemy, and background. Unfortunately, to me, this is a case of an identity problem toward gameplay. It starts as a casual puzzle game only to become Meatboy with more punishing deaths do to checkpoints. The game keeps adding things that instantly kill you but it does not give you more mobility tools. Crapy combat+begginer traps+poor hitboxes+instadeath+uneven checkpoints+visibilety issues. It legitimately becomes a hard game except that you get good at it by learning how to adapt to its flaws.", "recommendationid": "34874869", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500080", "timestamp_created": 1505095153, "author": {"num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 597, "playtime_forever": 350, "last_played": 1505089660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995669628"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 8, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
