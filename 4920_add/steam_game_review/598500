I love the look and feel of this game so much. From the variety of mechs with unique weapons, to the multiple special abilities with active and passive effects, the game does a great job of putting you in control of how the battles play out. I really enjoy the Boss mode where you can build your own custom boss and upload it for other to try and defeat. Finally the love and attention to detail put into the game really shines through in all aspects. It may be simple in it's delivery, but don't be fooled, this is going to be a hidden gem that way to many people will end up missing. Don't be a statistic and give this one a shot. \n\nIf you wanna see some game play and personal impressions I've provided a link below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaihiUtej38", "recommendationid": "34874842", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490850", "timestamp_created": 1505095008, "author": {"num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 712, "playtime_forever": 92, "last_played": 1505141590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030083302"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504974761, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 8, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is rad.\nMecha combat in pseudo 3d space.\nSuper bright Neons, bullet hell, upgrades, all sorts of battles.\nThe ships you fight are all a bit samey, but it is super fun anyway.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/VrRViEe-w7E", "recommendationid": "34841387", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479220", "timestamp_created": 1504974761, "author": {"num_reviews": 396, "num_games_owned": 538, "playtime_forever": 42, "last_played": 1504971587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019816374"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
