The fact that it isn't labeled as such is very decieving. It's alpha software. It's a proof of concept that ultimately is not a practical solution for movie viewing in VR. There are much better options. \n\nThe next update has been coming \"next week\" as of mid-March. If this hasn't been abandoned, then the developer needs to step up and talk about what's to come. Right now, it just feels like a waste of money. I'll be refunding.", "recommendationid": "33183790", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489987", "timestamp_created": 1499088641, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 540, "playtime_forever": 34, "last_played": 1501606017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197965124540"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494273443, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The program is not a new idea, except for the fact that it is made with Plex directly in mind. There are a few issues that can restrict what shows and plays on a particular server when Plex will work just fine on any other platform. Definitely a huge pain in the ***. Besides the inability to see all of the content, the simulation that you exist in is barebone. You can change to a couple locations or exist in a black world and you can alter the screen size and location. The enironments themselves feel very, very fake. Over a decade ago I was learning C++ and generated an entire prestine city out of code. It was beautiful, but too perfect and it looked.. well.. generated. That is the only way I can describe the aesthetics. As for controlling everything.. the author really felt touch was the way to go. Remember, this is a \"I'm going to sit back in a Lazy Boy and watch a movie\" program but for some reason a controller wasn't thought up. To add to the sitting down should be the focus problems, if you are sitting and line up the black \"VR Lazy Boy\" to your Lazy Boy perfectly you can accidently change the environment with your hands in a resting state on the arm rests. It was really, really annoying to try to figure what madness was happening the first time I wanted to watch something.\n\nOn top of all of that no one has reviewed this game for well over a month, and the developer is nowhere to be seen. I would HIGHLY DISCOURAGE buying this title until some serious work is done. I got it for 20% off the $9.99 price and still asked for a refund.", "recommendationid": "31633325", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485714", "timestamp_created": 1494273443, "author": {"num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 373, "playtime_forever": 32, "last_played": 1489298607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027103195"}, "votes_up": 4}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 25, "total_positive": 17, "review_score": 5}, "success": 1}
