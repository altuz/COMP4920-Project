It's got some flaws... but it's pretty decent as a puzzle game. It features two play modes, a variety of different puzzles, anime artwork and steam achievements. \n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Relatively easy. You don't have to flip the pieces - the correct rotation is already shown for you. There is a tray to seperate some pieces from others. You can even sort the puzzle area to show the edge pieces from the inside pieces. The characters that are featured on each stage will give you little hints. They will indicate whether you should be moving the pieces left/right, etc. \n\n[*] Features 16 puzzles in all. Some of them you have to unlock, but 12 are unlocked by default. There are three sizes for puzzles: 60 pieces, 240 pieces and 350 pieces. Achievements only require you to do one size of puzzle. This is a great feature for each player to choose which size of puzzle they want without having to stress out about doing them all. \n\n[*] You can snap pieces together before finding the \"correct spot\". Not a lot of puzzle games do this and it's great to see. What I mean by this is that you can have a big section of multiple pieces that are put together but are not \"in place\" yet. You can move a large group of pieces that are put together into their correct spot as one, instead of having to place each piece individually. \n\n[*] Ikemen mode is AWESOME and is probably the biggest highlight of this game. Ikemen mode gives you one piece at a time and you have to connect each piece to other pieces you've already put down to form the entire puzzle. It's the only way to get the currency to unlock the other four locked puzzles. You are timed, and can form a chain as a bonus for as long as you don't make mistakes. By the end of it, you will get your points to use on the locked puzzles. It makes the puzzling feel a bit more fast paced and makes it more managable by focusing on one piece at a time. \n\n[*] The artwork is pretty nice. \n\n[*] It saves your progress automatically so you don't feel rushed to complete a puzzle in one sitting if you're having troubles or just think you need a break. \n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] After I started to play Ikemen Mode, I found the classic mode to be completely useless. As much as I like classic puzzling, giving you an alternative that's a lot more fun is a way to make the classic choice obselete. The downfall about Ikemen Mode is that you can only do 60 piece puzzles. To do the larger puzzles, you have to stick to classic, which I think is the only selling point on staying on this mode. \n\n[*] It feels nearly impossible to pick up pieces in Classic Mode. I had to click on pieces so many times to pick them up that I actually thought my mouse was broken. It also seems that you can only pick up the pieces in layers - if I see a piece I want on the bottom of a stack of pieces, I'm not able to pick it up unless I pick up the pieces on top first and move them. I found that the holding down of the mouse to drag the pieces and having to click so aggressively really hurt my fingers after a while.\n\n[*] The tray areas are not big enough. Even with a 60 piece puzzle in classic mode, it's hard to find the piece you want becuase they get stacked in such large piles and it's hard to seperate them. There's not a lot of room to move them in the tray and spread them apart just to see each piece. The other thing that annoys me is that pieces that are on the picture (but not placed) will automatically get placed back into the pile if you hit \"shuffle\". I think the shuffle function should have been used only for the pieces still in the tray. \n\n[*] The clock feature felt sort of stressful. In Ikemen mode, I can understand why it's there since the amount of time left on the clock will award you with bonus currency when you finish the puzzle. The timing is extremely generous and I feel like it's probably impossible to run out of time. In classic mode, however, it's simply not necessary. It serves no purpose, as you are not awarded or punished based upon how much time you've spent on a puzzle. \n\n[/list]", "recommendationid": "34415419", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504318", "timestamp_created": 1503407147, "author": {"num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 881, "playtime_forever": 561, "last_played": 1506974697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 118, "steamid": "76561198053984243"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500191380, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I wish there was a so-so or neutral button. Not my kind of puzzles but that is not a complaint. There are a few plusses and minuses to this puzzle game:\n\n+ Art is fine and there are several challenge levels to each puzzle\n+ You can connect pieces together even if they are not \"in place\" yet\n+ Has and interesting game mode where you keep adding pieces from a starting piece. Different and fun\n\n- No piece rotation\n- Annoying constant \"hints\" that I could not find a way to shut off\n- Horrible piece manipulation. I had to click on many pieces several times to pick them up and move them\n\nThe last achievement that requires you to do every puzzle at every size is not actually that unusual. It is just odd since all of the other achievements are so easy.\n", "recommendationid": "33579181", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500355", "timestamp_created": 1500191380, "author": {"num_reviews": 69, "num_games_owned": 2745, "playtime_forever": 277, "last_played": 1500190873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971074683"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 7, "total_positive": 6, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
