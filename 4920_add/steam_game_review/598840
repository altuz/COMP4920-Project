Plays really well in a mutiplayer aspect! \n\nVery challenging single player mode taking on hordes of enemies in tight enviroments at very high pace. Fun and includes lots of dabbing ninjas which you can taunt your friends with after you kill them with a Katana sword, Shireiken, guns, missles, more ninja related items and more!\n\nHighly recommend!", "recommendationid": "35229142", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514349", "timestamp_created": 1506455675, "author": {"num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 63, "playtime_forever": 15, "last_played": 1506455080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "steamid": "76561198021116584"}, "votes_up": 6}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
