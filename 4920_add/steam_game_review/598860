Windows Live Movie Makers lags less (with the same files) than this piece of crap. For some videos I had to use WLMM to render a file, so Magix can even open it, without crashing. WHAT THE HELL?!\nI am endlessly unsatissfied, especially, that I was using MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2015 for quite some time and it was working a lot better.\nI still own it ONLY because I was stupid enough to trust that newer and more expensive software should be better, so I started to use it after first month from buying, as earlier I didn't had a need to do it.", "recommendationid": "34666789", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517300", "timestamp_created": 1504292215, "author": {"num_reviews": 115, "num_games_owned": 1314, "playtime_forever": 667, "last_played": 1505320168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984240274"}, "votes_up": 7}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
