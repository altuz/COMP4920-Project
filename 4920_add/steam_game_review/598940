Can't say the same for the Casino minigame, which had its use on the IOS but here on Steam it's quite pointless. \n\nBut other than that, the main game mode is as fun as always, this time with added visual representation of how your actions  affect the city(ok, so it's just a simple drawing which slowly changes with your progress. Nothing crazy, but still appreciated)\n\nThe side stories, where you follow a cop and a criminal are a nice addition, but they're still rather short and end quite abruptly. \n\nAll in all-if you like Doodle games and you're not tired with this formula, then you should definitively buy it...though it say it's more of a 3 euro game rather than 6. so wait for a better offer ;)", "recommendationid": "33661052", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1500504678, "author": {"num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 224, "playtime_forever": 190, "last_played": 1500504141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046636147"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
