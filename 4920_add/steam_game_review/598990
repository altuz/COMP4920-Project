I played this countless of hours when I was a kid, making weird pizzas, decorating lavish restaurants, and of course blowing up my competitors (and subsequently spending a lot of time in jail). But it wasn't until I played this as an adult that I figured out how advanced this game really is - and how hard it is when you play it honest (not trafficking guns). \n\nEven though the game is over 20 years old it's still really fun to play, and I highly recommend it - though I don't recommend you buying it! Pizza Tycoon/Connection is abandonware, and you can download the exact same version for free (legally), and launch it the same way Steam does with the DOSBox software. \n\n[i]Also, you really need to download the original recipe book to be able to play this - if you don't recreate the basic pizzas pretty much perfectly from the book you will have an extremly hard time getting customers. (This was a sort of piracy protection back in the day, if you only copied the game and didn't have the book you couldn't really play it)[/i]", "recommendationid": "33175857", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545962", "timestamp_created": 1499074898, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 40, "playtime_forever": 12, "last_played": 1498979269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198102896368"}, "votes_up": 20}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
