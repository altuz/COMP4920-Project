Send punks, bugs, rats. You can even kidnap your competitor's staff, arrange shootouts, and blow up their buildings.\n+ Option for the citizens to speak the local language.\n\nNegatives:\n- Performance issues: Delays in typing and mouse clicks.\n- Graphic glitches: Pieces of furniture get stuck in place as you move them around.\n- It takes too long to save manually. Thank you auto-save!\n- Sometimes, the game crashes.\n\nScore: 6.5/10", "recommendationid": "31148179", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520256", "timestamp_created": 1492226869, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_forever": 1219, "last_played": 1491994503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198158194908"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496068291, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "First of all it still works fine in 2017 i just add to start the game only real prob his the starting menu when you set up your character its kind of glitchy slow but once the game his started evrything works fine, for the game well its still has hard has i remeberd it to be when i was a kid, if you like bisness games and having alot of headgrasping to do its a great one to have in your collection, lets just say this one his not for kids, theres so much little things you can twik  and manage, its really a hard one and fun one your kind of a gangster gone in the pizaria bisness,you try to make a pizaria empire,send gangsters rought up the compition or blow up there place or try to play fare you can just send inspecters on there restaurent for many reasons to try to slow them down and so so and so much more i dont whent to remove all the fun of find out for your self all in all this game his a must try but remeber you will need a shit load of patience to find how to not go bankrupt and build a pizz empire good luck", "recommendationid": "32042607", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504821", "timestamp_created": 1496068291, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 79, "playtime_forever": 1042, "last_played": 1496207825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198068670881"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500833346, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "10/10 shrimps !", "recommendationid": "31088888", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497977", "timestamp_created": 1491959355, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 291, "playtime_forever": 15, "last_played": 1503058044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198130988375"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492641725, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Nostalgia and my childhood :,(", "recommendationid": "31246055", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491361", "timestamp_created": 1492641725, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 72, "playtime_forever": 309, "last_played": 1492372096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198039930890"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492101209, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 14, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Great Game .. back then.
