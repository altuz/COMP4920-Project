I really enjoy the art style although my only familiarity with retro sci-fi styling comes from Futurama and the odd episode of Star Trek: Voyager. The opportunities for co-operation extend far beyond the scope of regular RTS games as multiple players can be landing and contesting different territories all at once with bonus cash getting paid out at certain conquest landmarks making it both fun and lucrative to work together. The population limit is currently set at 250 per territory per player, so with 9 players contesting a region the battles can get huge and are very satisfying to watch. It is pretty cheap to setup extra squads letting you contest large chunks of a planet single-handedly.\n\nSo yeah, I'm very much enjoying this game, it certainly needs work in its current condition but I'm positive about the direction it is going in.", "recommendationid": "31017360", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520411", "timestamp_created": 1491657458, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 121, "playtime_forever": 6801, "last_played": 1493048374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007364099"}, "votes_up": 11}, {"timestamp_updated": 1491664803, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "The first thing I simply want to say, awesome. I have been following the game for a while now, and at some point I started to fear this would be a heavily instanced game. Where you would fight over territory, but in the very standard form, where you are forced to fight 1vs1, 2vs2 or 3vs3. You would all start without anything and build up from the start.\n\nHowever this is absolutely not the case, while you do fight in instance based areas, you can leave and join at any moment, without any restrictions. If you jump into an area, the enemy has often already set up a complete base where you start from scratch. Once you have defeated the enemy, you can decide to leave the area again, or you can decide to leave your army there (by default you have 2 'armies', but you can get up to 6 or 8).\n\nWar:\nSomething that does bother me a little bit, is that when you leave an area, it simply becomes neutral again, this makes the taste of victory a bit less, after all you have just cleared out an enemy army and there is nothing to do in that sector anymore. You only have 2 armies available, so you can leave it behind once, but if you have captured two sectors, you have no choice but to pick up one of your armies again.\nA suggestion would be, that if only 1 faction is active in a sector, and all other enemies have been defeated, a small AI base is deployed, maybe just an outpost + couple of tanks. This would be enough to keep it yours, however not enough to really put up any fight at all.\n\nEconomy:\nThe buildings work exactly as you expect them to do, you have three resources which come down to 'power, metal, gas'. Power generators can be build everywhere, as where you need a node for metal and gas. Gas being a bit more rare and needed for more special units. The amount of buildings is not very large, however since the game is very fast, this might be for the better.\n\nUnits:\nThe units are very simple and I would say that at the moment the variaty is a bit on the low side. The strategy that generally works best is to simply make a big pile of units and send them into combat. Furthermore I also think production is a bit too fast (perhaps too cheap). It is very easy to just set up 15-20 factories and basically go from 0 units to the unit limit in less than 5 minutes. While the battles are interesting because of that, I feel like it becomes a stand-still very soon. As it takes longer to move to an enemy base than it does to create an entire army. Meaning that in theory, two opposing players could get to a situation where no one will ever win.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe game is a lot of fun, every battle feels meaningfull, though it does hurt a bit when you need to pull out a unit and allow a territory to go neutral again. The economy is not very complicated, but this feels correct for a fast pased stategy game. Units need some more variaty and it feels too easy to get to the unit cap, increased cost might not be a bad idea.\n\nThe one fear I still have, is that this game is P2P, while the game is relatively cheap (at least in early access), the game does not to have a very large following yet, unless a lot of marketing will be done, the sales will probably be low. Since this game heavily focusses on multiplayer, this game, more than others, needs players to attracs more players. I fear that at this moment, this might not happen.", "recommendationid": "31019730", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505284", "timestamp_created": 1491664803, "author": {"num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 382, "playtime_forever": 1793, "last_played": 1495355126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030219637"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1491719838, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Awesome C&C/Supreme Commander mix. \n\nThis game is epic, the build style remembers me of Supreme commander \n\"without the commander unit\" and the scale of the battles is nice and nostalgic C&C style.\n\n-The 3 Factions look great.\n- A reliable Base Build RTS with 3 infinite generating resources, 2 of them are limited to build on the map and energy generators.\n-I plays like supreme commander/ Ashes of the Singularity, but on a scale comparable to C&C, \nso not too small or too big armies. \n-You can build in time what you need and it doesn't take too long, or end massive spam of units.", "recommendationid": "31033654", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504139", "timestamp_created": 1491719827, "author": {"num_reviews": 103, "num_games_owned": 392, "playtime_forever": 45, "last_played": 1491590011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198133845992"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503605867, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[h1] Very promising little MMO RTS game, but already abandoned - AVOID [/h1]\n\nPositives:\n+ Great theme and atmosphere of the game\n+ Game mechanics are decent and taken from games like Supreme Commander/Ashes of The Singularity\n+ Graphics look decent \n+ Nice soundtrack (of course there could be more tunes)\n\nNegatives:\n- No more updates are expected\n- Not enough variety of units and factions are all the same\n- No normal single player campaign and skirmish is also very shallow at the moment (no options to set more than 1 opponent for example)\n- Some bugs and other minor glitches, but they are expected in early access Game", "recommendationid": "31197505", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "timestamp_created": 1492429157, "author": {"num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 210, "playtime_forever": 90, "last_played": 1492374582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198117058103"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1491776631, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very promising and fun game to play.
