I played in 51 minutes all the game and have unlocked all weapons. \n\nPro\n+ Grafik is ok (on some levels even great :)\n+ Weapons are implemented in a good way (laser for aim)\n+ Makes fun for some rounds\n+ A good game for the 50% off sale\n\nContra\n- Not much content at the moment\n- More balance needed. The turret kills everything till level 3, with the mini-spider bot you can go till level 4 or 5 without shooting any bullet. \n- You can't deactivate the turret or the spider bot. That makes each map borring till level 7\n\n\nExample\n- I played the map space till level 5 to receive the spider\n- then map sky till the machine-gun and then till the turret\n- back to map space till level 10 ->upgrade for the spider\n->now with this combo, nothing can stop you :(", "recommendationid": "33672139", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503194", "timestamp_created": 1500556706, "author": {"num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 113, "playtime_forever": 51, "last_played": 1500556413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197966822965"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
