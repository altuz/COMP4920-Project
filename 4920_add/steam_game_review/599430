Good concept and I like the variety of weapons. It's definitely early access though - voice acting is all one person from china talking in a heavy accent, and the tracking for the bow and arrow is pretty bad. \n\n\nI wish there were health bars on creeps as well. As it is I have no idea how powerful any thing is on the map. The PVP aspects are a lot of fun though - dodging arrows and using your shield is really a lot of fun.", "recommendationid": "30678321", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1490232968, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 166, "playtime_forever": 36, "last_played": 1490185590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984589366"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1489491546, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 25, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great game! so many king of weapons is funny! this is a very creative game!
