In order to craft that item you have to be able to find the resources from sending your heroes out to gather them. Then at the end of every month you must pay back your debt to infinity. You don't even need to hire anyone, your staff is just given to you. Your heroes are also your staff.\n\nWant to craft 20 bars of something, sorry, you can't queue it up, you have to click the button wait for it to get done, then do it again 20 times over. Same for all the other crafting. Oh, btw, you can only have one window open at a time.\n\nNow look at one of the images for this game, the one with the 16 work stations, now imagine have to manually tell each one of those to create one item at a time. That means, open window, click once to create, wait, close window, and repeat over and over and over.\n\nWant to at the same time send your heroes out on a quest. Sorry, you have to micro-manage that to death also since you have to watch their progress, click everything to pick it up and then most of the time you have to run away from battle. I think I was able to complete maybe 2 quests out of 20? (honestly I lost count (and don't really care), happens when you're bored).... \n\nHad I known it was the micro-management from hell game, I would have never bought it. I was mislead by the positive raiting for this game.\n\nWas reading in the forums somewhere that automatic exploring is end game. WTF, why even add it then.\n\nI played for almost 2 hrs, I doubt I'll ever play this game again. I was pretty bored of the click, wait for for it to get done, then click again, etc etc etc etc etc.\n\nBut if you love micro-managing everything to death, waiting a lot, grinding for gold, and time based missions then this game is for you!", "recommendationid": "34765561", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511959", "timestamp_created": 1504649998, "author": {"num_reviews": 172, "num_games_owned": 795, "playtime_forever": 100, "last_played": 1504649428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197985573260"}, "votes_up": 20}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 109, "total_positive": 92, "review_score": 8}, "success": 1}
