At least it is teeming with half-decent hidden object scenes.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nThe first half hour of Ghost Files: The Face of Guilt shows such a great promise. It starts up as a realistic police procedural drama, where we have to use our forensic skills and some standard modern hidden object game mechanics to capture a serial killer.\nThis premise lasts about thirty minutes before the forensic equipment decides to sit out most of the game as unused clutter in the inventory, and the realism exits stage left the moment we end up in a ghost realm to look for magical runes.\n\nTo the game\u2019s credit, at least it manages to retain an above-average quality. The plot never stops and the detective work brings plenty of surprises, even if the final twist is quite dumb and comes from nowhere.\nGameplay is similarly above average, thanks to the dozens of decent hidden object scenes and some of the nicer puzzles.

Not that I really expected it to be, although, it is called \"Ghost Files.\"\n\n[b]If you're looking for a paranormal, spookerino, ghost-a-fied lovin' HOG - this isn't it.[/b]\n\nI truly wanted to enjoy this game. I wanted it to be one of my new favorites. However, you don't use your super handy-dandy forensic lab like I had hoped. And, even after the \"otherworld\" places that you go through, the main character doesn't really address any of it. In my opinion, the psychic is a random character that they threw in so they could say they had one. Overall, the plot was just about what you'd expect from an average HOG.\n\nThe hidden object scenes were decent. There was a mixture of word, shadow, and picture lists (I don't know technical HOG terms even though I've played way too many). The puzzles were basic, literally the same puzzles that you can come across in every HOG. Not bad, but nothing too challenging. Also, the music was weirdly intense for some situations. It put me on edge, but nothing came of it.\n\nWhen loading out of hidden object scenes and cutscenes, it always froze for a few seconds before it loaded me back into the game. It froze long enough to make me wonder if it was an issue. I'm not sure if it was on my end or if it was just how the game did its thing. Thankfully, it never crashed. There were no serious bugs that kept me from getting achievements or finishing the game.\n\nI didn't dislike this game, but like I said, it's not a brand spankin' new favorite of mine. I purchased it when it was on sale, and if you're interested, I'd gently encourage you do the same.", "recommendationid": "31893724", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510465", "timestamp_created": 1495415662, "author": {"num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 151, "playtime_forever": 226, "last_played": 1495415814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067063974"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498385056, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Sucks to say, but this has to be one of the worst AM games to date.

The biggest crime (and I am putting my hand up to help with future releases) is the spelling mistakes which really are unacceptable in a 4-5 hr long game, especially when there is not a huge deal of text in the game. From a Tarot card achievement called the 'Whell of Fortune' to various 'i' before 'e' errors it is distracting, and not helped by the back end of the game posing not much of a challenge on expert level.

There isn't even a reward (achievement) for playing this title at highest difficulty or for doing the mini game instead of the HO puzzles.\n\nAlso, The HO scenes didn't vary on my second playthrough, the objects needed are always the same, which only increased my boredom. The achievements were mediocre, too, the game overall posed no challenge whatsoever.\n\nThe story seemed somewhat fresh at first, which got me prematurely excited, only to quickly realize that the mystery's solution was 100% stereotypical, hence obvious and predictable and void of fun.
