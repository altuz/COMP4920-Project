Visually it's breathtaking. Every field you enter puts you in a different mood, each of them are well designed and can effortlessly draw you into their own worlds. And its music... Mountain Mind's music simply shakes you to the core. Every song of this game has something to say \"where words fail, music speaks\". You can easily hear and feel that this EP is a product of a brilliant mind and contains the purest Stoner Rock soul which is enough to make you high as mountains without any help, you might say.  So here we have Mountain Mind, one of its kind, not just an amazing idea of a game but an awesome experience you should try it first-hand. And I guess there is a hidden word at the end of its name because it really is mind blowing. ^^ Congratulations to the team. They set the bar as high as Fujisan.", "recommendationid": "30396770", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544655", "timestamp_created": 1489001418, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 783, "playtime_forever": 6933, "last_played": 1490444567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198054736789"}, "votes_up": 36}, {"timestamp_updated": 1488975034, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 7, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I love the intiative that you took to make this and the creativity that was put into this, also love the music.
