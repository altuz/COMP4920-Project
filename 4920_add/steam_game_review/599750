I wanted to like this game a lot, I enjoy deep strategy games a lot, but the execution of the idea was too poor to suffer much longer with this mess. Is running the Soviet Union meant to be such a confusing mess and so wooden? It didn\u2019t draw me in that I am a leader of a huge union, just a huge mess.  While this game gets a high positive rating overall on Steam, I\u2019m afraid I 100% agree with the negative reviews and experience negative reviewers have had.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like is the tutorial is very poor, features are not explained very well in game plus the mechanics behind it all are not explained at all.  An instant put off for a game. The decisions you make get little feedback and there is no advice for courses of action (compare to the RPG element of Decisive Campaigns Barbarossa where you get multiple viewpoints from impacted parties). Lack of feedback is a big problem as is understanding why it matters which leader you choose to roleplay. In this respect the game is a bit wooden, nothing seems to matter.  \n\nThe interface itself feels a cluttered mess, especially the map with all those flags showing and symbols over the top of them which is meant to represent various states (are they NATO member, etc.).  The graphics are basic at best and perhaps a bit oversized for what they need \u2013 please get the buttons over in the cleanest and simplest way \u2013 they don\u2019t need to be \u201cin my face\u201d to make it a great game.  Make it practical. \n\nThis game is trying to be everything, but falls short on effectively executing most features.  Great idea for a game but I don\u2019t get this implementation one bit. I didn\u2019t realise until today there was a original game by this name and never played it, but the original 1992 game \u201clooks\u201d far better and cleaner and what this game needs. \n\nSadly, this is another warning to me of low priced games on steam. Generally, low priced for a reason because they are not all that good.  My rating is 3/10, for the idea only, I can\u2019t rate the game very highly on much else.  Perhaps there is a lot of research in here somewhere you can learn from, so that merits a small uptick too.\n\nOverall : 30%, avoid.  Look for other geopolitical simulators.  If you want to try this, you will definitely know within two hours whether you like this game or need a refund, as I do.", "recommendationid": "35184301", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510655", "timestamp_created": 1506268203, "author": {"num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 24, "last_played": 1506266004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "steamid": "76561198015017512"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506043841, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Crisis in the Kremlin is a simulation game of the USSR in it's last years.

You will have to manage the budget of the USSR and respond to events twice a month, while trying to maintain or expand your international sphere of influence, finding new trading partners and allies, shuffling around your ministers to find the best men for the job, guiding research and enacting new policies in finance, foreign affairs or the interior. As you do so, you will have to deal with problems like the oil crisis or an earthquake in Armenia, as well as international crises where you can choose between agitating the US and getting new issues, or striking a more conciliatory tone... but tick off the US too much and your generals will coup you just before the Cold War goes nuclear (unless you have strengthened the military and weakened the Americans so much that you can easily wipe them off the face of the Earth!).\n\nUnfortunately, the game has a lot of imperfections - most of them related to the user interface. The game is developed by Russians whose English translations are often imperfect and occasionally almost incomprehensible, especially if you don't understand the jargon associated with the Soviets. There is also a lack of tooltips which makes it hard for someone unfamiliar with this part of history (and sometimes, even those familiar) with understanding what certain things might mean. A minister's stance might be described as \"Party course\" or \"Harsh policy\". What do these mean? You can take an educated guess, or try your luck with them and see what exactly they do (which is usually not obvious immediately). Not much else - there are no tooltips to help explain these. \n\nThe various budget options (\"Computerization\", \"Support for the UN\", \"Social Spendings\") also sometimes have side effects that you may not expect, although common sense will help you here. (For example: corruption is one of the biggest issues plaguing the USSR and if not curbed, it will spiral out of control. Simply funding the \"fight against corruption\" budget option will only help so much, and will do more harm than good if you overfund it. After all, throwing money at the corruption problem is never as effective as addressing the root causes of corruption. Making the bureaucracy more efficient might help, for example, if you know how - but can you really expect corruption to go away if you yourself engage in it by paying for \"envelopes\" - i.e. bribing people? But then again, maybe you are just like certain real-life politicians who doesn't care how corrupt the system is as long as you stay in power and enrich yourself... as you can see, there are numerous ways and possibilities to manage the country.)\n\nCrisis in the Kremlin is a game I'd recommend simply because very few games like it exist, and it's not exactly expensive. There's a lot of fun to be had in the game already and it's very satisfying to score one of the several possible victories the game offers. Crisis in the Kremlin is under constant development and issues are being fixed all the time - we can expect interface improvements too, eventually, and there have already been some. However, you can still learn the game now - there are tutorials on Youtube and here on Steam to help if you find the in-game tutorial lacking. I have one final piece of advice for you: if you're one of those games who always plays on \"Normal\" or \"Hard\" straight away, never on the easiest difficulty - don't do that here! The default difficulty setting is, if I recall correctly, \"Easy\" - and that's where you should stay until you've won at least once. Despite the name, it's not easy at all, and more likely than not, you will hopelessly spiral into decline in your first few games anyway.", "recommendationid": "35177030", "steam_purchase": true,
