Has a nice moody atmosphere, graphics and sound are nice enough, nothing amazing. I managed to finish the game once in about 45 minutes but there are multiple ways to end the game, so I'll be revisiting it for at least one more run. Puzzles aren't terribly taxing but require attentiveness. Overall just a nice little experience.", "recommendationid": "33943342", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503191", "timestamp_created": 1501569813, "author": {"num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 373, "playtime_forever": 46, "last_played": 1501569449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066964770"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
