There is some fun to be had but a lot of annoyances too.\n\nI loved Tequila Zombies 2.\nIt seems like with Tequila Zombies 3, the developers took away stuff that was good in #2 and introduced new mechanics that are really quite annoying.\n\nFirst, there are no waves. Each stage has some checkpoints, but there is no clear visibility of how far you are from completing the stage.\n\nSecond, there is the reload mechanic which is really quite annoying. Tequila Zombies 2 had a better \"flow\" to it. In #3 you keep having to reload, which is a few seconds pause in the action.\n\nThird, the super power or whatever it's called. I only tried with Miguel so I can't say for the other characters. The super power itself is great, but every time you use it (and you get enough tequila to use it quite often), it initiates some 6-7 seconds of animation during which the gameplay stops. The animation is cool but after a couple of times you get tired of it and wish the game continue already.\n\nFourth, the game is not as responsive to controls as I would expect. I have a high-end machine, but the game doesn't feel so smooth. I'm not sure it's a regression from #2, and it's probably Flash' fault, but I expected a bit more from a game on Steam, despite its Flashy heritage.\n\nFifth, there are cut scenes at the ends of stages which I believe cannot be skipped (maybe about one minute per scene).\n\nSixth, there is no support for controllers.\n\nFor me, this kind of game is about smooth action. All of the pauses introduced by the mechanics mentioned above pretty much ruin it for me.\n", "recommendationid": "33533033", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508352", "timestamp_created": 1500028065, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 173, "playtime_forever": 90, "last_played": 1499903608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198012194788"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
