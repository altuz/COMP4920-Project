The devs also may want to consider adding video settings to this game in the future, just so it can be more accessible to those with worse PC specs.\n\nAlso, as I was playing the game, I noticed that there was a considerable lag when I tried using my mouse to move the camera like you do in every game that takes place in a first-person perspective. You may want to consider adding a setting for mouse sensitivity as well, at some point in the future.\n\nNow let's talk about other gameplay elements. While I was moving, I felt like my character (whoever he or she is) was moving quite a bit too fast. This wouldn't have been so bad if the area my character was in was much wider, but since the area is so small I found myself constantly crashing into walls. The devs may also want to consider either tampering with the controls, or making an entire change to the level design. I'd, personally, recommend that you tamper with the controls, although you'd earn my respect if you decided to change the size of the whole level. I'd also like to talk about another issue. I feel like the regular jump height isn't very high. Only if I was using double jumps, parkour, or wall-jumps could I get anywhere. This is a platformer, after all.\n\nNow, that I think I'm done complaining, let me talk about the pros.\n\nI, for one, love the idea of sandbox-like first-person 3D platformer that a set goal that also takes place in a cobalt-black futuristic setting. I also love the fact that you can change up the way some gameplay elements. Makes me wonder where the devs are going to go with a such a concept. Also, as laggy, as this game is, it looks amazing. I don't know how many devs are creating this, but if only two devs are working on this like I think this might be the case, than both of them deserve a medal.\n\nIn the end, I think this has the potential to be a great game. However, we need to see more. We need to see where the devs are going to with SecondSpeed; what story this game is going to have; what features are going to be implemented. I truly want to see more, because I truly feel that this Early Access Game that costs one dollar and ninety-nine cents has has a great concept.", "recommendationid": "31726964", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498327", "timestamp_created": 1494689974, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 22, "last_played": 1494726712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198269446345"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495630145, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "it's good, but boring after a while. :/\nput more things in the game please :)", "recommendationid": "31933842", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494493", "timestamp_created": 1495630145, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 33, "playtime_forever": 19, "last_played": 1495630000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198217368203"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494811373, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Its a bit like Mirrors Edge, but with one small level.", "recommendationid": "31760364", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488902", "timestamp_created": 1494811373, "author": {"num_reviews": 44, "num_games_owned": 159, "playtime_forever": 10, "last_played": 1494811350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198132152488"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
