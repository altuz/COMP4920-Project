I'd say it absolutley does! While this is certainly not a perfect port with a mod fix (especially to fix the horrible mouse acceleration) the game runs amazingly well and really the graphics are not too bad! \n\nI'd say the gameplay is really the heart of this game as you truly do need to use your squad in order to win and as the game goes on you get many opportunities to use them in various positions from turrets to sniper postions to using grenade launchers. There's just enough depth that making tacticul decisions feels good but it's also very streamlined so that you're never confused or overwhelmed. For the most part your ally AI is pretty damn smart! Many times they will take cover on there own and can very much handle themselves in battle. There are not many games where I can actually rely on AI companions and them actually protect me!\n\nThe story is pretty good but it definitely takes a backseat to the whole experience. Really just the reason for you and your squad to be going in and kicking serious ass! The game takes you from Geonosis where Attack of the Clones starts, to an awesome mission reclaiming a captured Clone Assault Ship, to the final missions on the Wookie home planet of Kashyyk. The squadmates (and your PC as well) are very well voice acted and very likable. Each with their own personalities that make them easily identifiable. Granted while they all have their own \"expertise\" that really doesn't show in gameplay as they all can do every task equally as well. But hey I'm sure that's part of why the gameplay goes very smoothly.\n\nNow for stuff to nitpick about I'd say that the later levels definitely have some bugs and problems as well as general problems throughout the game. For example if you alt tab and go back into the game more often than not the textures un the game all suddenly stretch and look incredibley ugly. The main assault rifle of the game is really damn weak to the point of frustraion at times. It gets the job done though if you're out of ammo for the other weapons which are all basically top notch EXCEPT for the Trandoseon SMG. That gun is so damn worthless. Might as well be farting at the enemy and hoping they'd be offended.\n\nAll in all I would say Republic Commando is a very solid experience and frankly for a rated T game it's pretty dark and gritty. Would definitely rank this as one of the best Star Wars games up there with Knights of the Old Republic and OG Star Wars Battlefront."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506018740, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35110934", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971168633", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 719}, "timestamp_updated": 1506018740, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This sorely needs a sequel."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505479157, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504314", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34970788", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198081824347", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1445686298, "num_games_owned": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 428}, "timestamp_updated": 1505479157, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Amazing game, always recommend when its on the cheap, would be amazing if they could remaster this and make it a 4 player CO-OP online, yet make a sequel called Imperial Commando..\n\nWheres Sev we all ask!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505712769, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35039473", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198325738915", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506313003, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 92, "playtime_forever": 1374}, "timestamp_updated": 1505712769, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Premise: Republic commando is a game about the Delta squad, a elite squadron of the grand army of the republic.
