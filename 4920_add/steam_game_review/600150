The game is fun, though it definitely lacks polish. The music is good, but the voices are repetitive and don't add much to the 'feel' of the game. The game design is solid enough, like a limited version of chess set on a dynamic battlefield. However, there are only 3 regular units types (and the catapaults), and most battlefields are too large, which results in a largely lackluster match. While I haven't played against human opponents (and I will in the future, I hope, since the AI is dreadfully bad), I never felt much intensity or 'epicness' while playing that I would normally feel in a boardgame, particularly for one thats been ported to VR and allows me to physically get right into the action. I recommend the game so that others might try it out and encourage the devs to expand on their game: polish the map and controls, add extra unit types, and hopefully rework map design to lead to more strategically tense matches.", "recommendationid": "33400958", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "timestamp_created": 1499598239, "author": {"num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 214, "playtime_forever": 53, "last_played": 1499597474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002049680"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504567474, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Making an homage to old games like GW's \"Battle Masters\" or \"Crossbows and Catapults\", this game is a little gem for old boardgamers and wargamers like myself.\nAnd you can even paint your miniatures yourself!\n\nI've played the non-VR version and had a blast!", "recommendationid": "34745996", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1504567474, "author": {"num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 1305, "playtime_forever": 70, "last_played": 1504994073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984725886"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 11, "total_positive": 10, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
