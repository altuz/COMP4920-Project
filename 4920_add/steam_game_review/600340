Basically you have to destroy some turrets and avoid the enemies trying to kill you at the same time.  As soon as you destroy the turrets, the level ends regardless of how many enemies are left on screen.  Even if you kill all the enemies, they just keep respawning, so just strafe kill the turrets and avoid the enemies!  Easier said than done sometimes! lol You get caught up on the environment, so you need to be careful when running around.\n\nThere are only 80 levels which go quick! In my short time of playing I already beat 10% of the game. Levels only last about 1 or 2 minutes, but the gameplay could be more exciting.  You run faster than the enemies and the turret's shots, so if you die, it's usually because you got caught on a wall or some other part of the environment. It could use some more polish, but again, it's fun.\n\nIf you like twin-stick shooters (TSS) and have a fairly good computer, you may like this, but there are much better TSS out there.  Recommended to TSS fans with a decent computer.  As other reviews have stated, the game needs optimizing because it really heats up your computer!!!\n\nEDIT: The game crashed occasionally when quitting.  I let the developer know and he fixed it super fast! Great support!!! :-)", "recommendationid": "33770647", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1500918024, "author": {"num_reviews": 119, "num_games_owned": 790, "playtime_forever": 14, "last_played": 1501090423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198073648775"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500923917, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is OK, but that's about it.
