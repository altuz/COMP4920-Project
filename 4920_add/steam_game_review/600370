I can't say I expected much several years ago, when the original trailer showed off its gloriously greasy artwork, a style that mixes Salvador Dali with the too-close-for-comfort close-ups of [i]Spongebob[/i] or [i]Ren & Stimpy[/i]; some things are just too good to get in quantity.  The game, however, pulls it all off and more, lacing its ten hours of painstaking graphical work with awesome humor, clever (but never ball-breaking) puzzles, smooth electronica that would be right at home in a 1970's informational reel, and countless unique ideas.  [i]Saturated[/i] is almost what you'd call it -- there's something to look at, or laugh at, or play with tamped into every crevice.\n\nBelieve it or not, there's something more in [i]Paradigm[/i]:  a kind of wholesome affirmation about the value of life, even when that life is none too pleasing to the eye.  In this and many other ways, it was an adventure that kept me surprised and engaged through the very end.", "recommendationid": "34917416", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513221", "timestamp_created": 1505301047, "author": {"num_reviews": 171, "num_games_owned": 1626, "playtime_forever": 615, "last_played": 1501124365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198072182182"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505610686, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Why are you down here?
