The answer is no, but this one comes pretty darn close. The game itself is a cross between soccer and air hockey with a few extra mechanics that are pretty interesting. A fun little game to play with your kids or some friends. It works reasonably well with the Kinect and I could see it being really fun if I could get it to work with 2 players. My kid is a little spastic which the Kinect doesn't like, so it may not be the game's fault that I can't get it working. That's probably why the Kinect didn't work as a game controller come to think of it. At any rate, it's surprisingly polished \"looking\" for a $5 game, but overall it's pretty buggy. I've gotten trapped in menu screens on several occassions. Also, the game is pretty challenging for a casual game. It could really use some speed/difficulty settings, especially for young kids. Still, at the end of the day if you have a Kinect on your PC and feel like playing a game with it, this is kind of the only option and it's not bad. And actually, if you're a big soccer/air hockey fan looking for something different, you might enjoy this with a controller.", "recommendationid": "34052659", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "timestamp_created": 1501995049, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 112, "playtime_forever": 60, "last_played": 1502053586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961160364"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
