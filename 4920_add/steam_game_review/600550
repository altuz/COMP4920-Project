The Frame Rate, just... what? Either the cutscences lag and the game is okish, The cutscences are fine and the game has a stroke, or they both have a fit. Messing with the settings sorta helped... I think? But it just feels so unstable.\n\nB. The Gameplay, A standard Third Person Shooter, but with glaring flaws. The dodge doesn't always go the direction you want it. The enemys all seem to rush you, shread your health, and blow up on death. ( Still more fair than Dark Souls lol) The aiming feels off and theres no way to change it from what I have seen. Oh and are we supposed to have infinite ammo?\n\nC.The Options, five options....  FIVE! Im sorry but come on, a mouse sensitivity bar would be nice, or key bindings. sound options, subtitles, anything? Oh and please make it so we can accese the options from in game, trying to gett the frame rate stable is bad enough, having to go to the main menu to do so is a total pain\n\nWith this said there COULD be a good game here, but it needs work, alot of work, to get there. Fix the stability, the enemys, the dodging, the aiming and the ammo. Add the basic options, add a setting box to the pause screen, and with that your on your way to a fun little shooter. Oh and one last thing, why the name Save Our Souls: Episode I - The Absurd Hopes Of Blessed Children? That is just a mouth full, Save Our Souls: The Blessed Children on the other hand flows much better and doesn't seem as, well, Absurd.\nI truly hope the devs see this and understand that we just want the game to be good and do good. I mean no Ill will, I just would like this to succeed where others have failed horridly.", "recommendationid": "33938896", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501275", "timestamp_created": 1501546980, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 63, "last_played": 1501748331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198114582733"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499735715, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is pure fun... love it.. it does have issues tho.. needs polishing/refining and bugs everywhere..and should come with a serious hardware warning...a 1050ti is enough but barely for the avid gamer.
