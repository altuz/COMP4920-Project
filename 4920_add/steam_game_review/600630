The mechanics of the game however are just not interesting. The guns are all just, things that shoot bullets or things that shoot lasers. The item pickups are vague single use squares with a slightly more vague image on them, which have a kind of but not very useful effect on use. The special ability of each class is basically pointless. Most of the envrionmental hazards are not worth taking advantage of, and the environmental hazards are often too subtle to really notice consistently.\n\nAlthough the rooms are decently randomized, they're all just squares filled with enemies and objects. So they might as well not be randomized at all due to how same they all end up looking and feeling to play in. It also taking noticeable amounts of time grinding through each biome of levels to reach the next one, making progression slow and even more tedious.\n\nThe unlock system is very unsatisfying, most of the perks to acquire for the character are just upgrades to their useless special ability, to make it slightly less useless. And the only real unlockable items at the hub are upgrades and equipment that can be purchased multiple times, only effecting your current character and thus becoming null when they die.\n\n\nWhile the game itself is solid from a functional standpoint, it mostly just fails to be anything other then bland. Nearly all of the fundamental mechanics are done in a way that is just poorly thought out and not intriguing in any way to interact with. Which makes the game really just a waste of time because, you could get the same genre of Rogue-like shooter experience from multiple other games like Enter The Gungeon; but with significantly more satisfying mechanics and fun gameplay in general. It took only an hour and a half nearly for playing this game to reach boring.", "recommendationid": "33390676", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513776", "timestamp_created": 1499563216, "author": {"num_reviews": 62, "num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_forever": 94, "last_played": 1498178009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198171033130"}, "votes_up": 15}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501861691, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have played this game from alpha (?) version with another art :)\nSo I am an old fan of these space adventures.\nIt's a magic when somebody without artist can do awesome pictures with such a nice palette.\nI liked the gameplay, plot and  music of this game.\nAnd I like the developer continues working with this universe in his next project.\n\n", "recommendationid": "34018568", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499810", "timestamp_created": 1501861691, "author": {"num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 338, "playtime_forever": 6, "last_played": 1495218473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198058249737"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 7, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
