It didn't have any reviews in English, but I Google translated the ones it did have (for pre-access and review copies) and it seemed interesting. At under \u00a34, you can't go wrong with so many options for character classes.\n\nI am very pleasantly surprised and pleased by the game and would recommend it. \n\nIf you think a cross between Epic Manager, Desktop Dungeons and a bit of Ratchett and Clank, you won't be far wrong.\n\nVisually it's pretty as you can see in the screen shots and the short video. This seems to only run in windowed mode and doesn't have an option to change the resolution. So if you run in a high resolution (like me), then you may need to reduce it so that you can see the game. \n\nThe music is quite nice but doesn't seem to have an option to turn it off or down. It hasn't bothered me so far, but most music gets grating after a while.\n\nThey keys are bound to the cursor keys and aren't changeable. That's a bit of a pain because I prefer wasd but in honesty, the developers have chosen a perfectly reasonable set of keys, not something completely random. Space/Enter does things, Esc gets you to a menu. Nothing is obscure here.\n\nThe intro is short and to the point; it goes over how to move, run, use items without being long or dull. You can always save and re-read it if you forget something. \n\nThe puzzles that I've come across so far are the lever and dodge type. I'm currently stuck on one with green handles. I doubt it's a very difficult puzzle (I'm on Easy mode and it's the first Dungeon) so I'm putting it down to me being a bit dim on a Saturday night.\n\nI was very impressed by the number of character classes and I'm playing a Devourer. Which despite being a non-melee char is holding up quite well. The summoning ability is a lovely idea and I'm looking forward to seeing the summons shown in the shop video; I currently have Golem and Medusa.\n\nThe only minor criticisms I can level are:\n- no way to play full screen\n- the keys aren't configurable (VERY minor)\n- not being told that when you set your battle formation, you have to put your character in place first then the summons\n\nOverall, it's  a lovely little game, the devs deserve some love and frankly it's more polished than many recent \u00a330+ titles.\n\nWell done and give it a go; it's really worth it.", "recommendationid": "32328864", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506729", "timestamp_created": 1497132891, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 103, "last_played": 1497130519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198092299899"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497482430, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Old school stype RPG with some interesting atmospheric based elements.
