The game is very simple to play, with the player primarily making a few choices through dialogue and who to interact with. You play as Dana, who becomes a babysitter to younger girl Kimmy. During the days that you babysit, you have a limited amount of time to play with other kids, buy toys and games, and learn more about the residents of your town. As with many of Nina Freeman\u2019s games, what appears on the surface to be a normal 1960\u2019s summer is in fact a dark, mature tale of the struggles that many families face. The game moves along at a good pace, taking you from interaction to interaction without much fuss and hardly a single wasted word throughout the entire game. It is very interesting to see the world through the eyes of a young girl at that time \u2013 I can\u2019t think of any other game where the player takes the role of a middle-school-aged-girl. \n\tOverall, it is a very interesting and impactful game that doesn\u2019t take too long to tell its story. If you are a big fan of story in games, or just find this premise interesting, I\u2019d definitely recommend picking Kimmy up!
