Original was Not Recommended, due to the game only allowing the player to control ship rotation.]\n\nThe new version adds an option for letting the player choose when to thrust or fire weapons, and with that new control scheme, I can change this review to Recommended.\n\nIt's a very slow-paced take on Asteroids that trades off twitch action for careful planning of your ship's maneuvering and attacks.   There are still a few things that could use some tweaking, but for the  most part, it's a nice diversion that can be almost relaxing... until the drones start showing up to spoil the day, anyway.", "recommendationid": "31554123", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511979", "timestamp_created": 1493967363, "author": {"num_reviews": 32, "num_games_owned": 521, "playtime_forever": 185, "last_played": 1495515168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197990695056"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
