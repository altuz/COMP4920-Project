I saw the trailers and was amazed by what I saw. It looks great, like a remake of the Bay environment from TrackMania Sunrise and United. Then I bought it, only to regret instantly after. The game sure looks and sounds great, but the car physics ruin it completely for me. The cars are literally undriveable. The steering is too sensitive and for a game like TrackMania, this is terrible. A mere touch on a wall and your time is garbage. And this happens way too many times on Lagoon. Canyon was perfect; Stadium was great; Valley was good; Lagoon is... disappointing. \n\nI'll wait for the upcoming updates to see if they can make the game feel better.
