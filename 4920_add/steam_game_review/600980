I kinda liked this game, at least I played it basically everyday. Altough there was not much content in the game, the leaderboards were kinda meh because not many players playing this game, the gun sounds were a bit lame, there was no vibration on the controller when firing a weapon (Rift), the recoil was not right (basically none existant), so the whole -firing a weapon- part was overall a lame experience, compared to the likes of Pavlov VR. But it was the only shooting range game that I had, and sadly, that was the only \u201dplus\u201d of the game. It is sometimes nice just to try to make a string of perfect shots in the shooting range, and basically aiming wise, there is nothing wrong with this game. So that's why I propably played it so much, even though all the shortcomings it had. \n\nThat is until the multiplayer update came and destroyed the performance of the game. At least for me it did. Dev doesnt see any problems in the performance of the game (which is obviously a problem in itself), they say its performing well with the same GPU that im using (I posted my specs to Dev). However, im getting FPS between 22-33 FPS (everything at low settings), a far cry from the required 90 FPS for VR, so it is -easily- the worst performing VR game I've ever played, and 100% unplayable atm.\n\nThey rolled out two performance patches after the MP update, and told me that those patches would make the performance better, but they didnt help. At all. Comparing to all the other VR games I've played so far, without any performance issues whatsoever, the problem must be within this game. I would of refunded this game, but since I allready had 9 hours on it before it went unplayable, I cant get a refund. Well, time to move on to Practisim VR or H3VR for more smooth shooting range experience, I guess.", "recommendationid": "33625958", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "timestamp_created": 1500369357, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_forever": 566, "last_played": 1500286377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030754362"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
