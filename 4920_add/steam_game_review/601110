It's just plain broken. \n\nI needed to switch my steam controller to keyboard and mouse mode and wasted a full hour just create a profile and playtest it for the weird ass gameplay to control 2 characters at the same time. Also you can't do shit if you have the vive wands + the controller turned on. They should remove the input compatibility for the vive wands.\n\nYou can't even set a custom seating position because clicking the reset seating position doesn't do shit.\n\nMore details on the problem:\n1) The jump + dash distance is not consistent\n2) Moving platforms displaces your character enough to desync/displace when you control both of them\n3) Moving platforms not colored differently but rather colored ever so slightly\n4) Coin collection requires precision that it breaks the flow of the game since the floors on this game disappears after you step on it.", "recommendationid": "35145005", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1506145769, "author": {"num_reviews": 85, "num_games_owned": 6257, "playtime_forever": 102, "last_played": 1506151450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 102, "steamid": "76561198046980920"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
