Trucks are nice with almost actual graphics but without damage model, tracks are boring with 10 years old graphics, competitors are completely useless (they are not racing at all!), you can upgrade your truck multiple times with the same upgrade package and so on, and so on.\n\nWait for later patches if there will be any.
