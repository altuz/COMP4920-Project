Possibly adding the ability to navigate using your keyboard or automatic level progress would be an awesome fix\n\nGood game, probably gonna tear my hair out on the later levels, cant wait to see this develop over time!\n9/10", "recommendationid": "34697691", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509760", "timestamp_created": 1504394039, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 365, "playtime_forever": 469, "last_played": 1505425413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198111754247"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504428995, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Hey i just played 1 level and i think it has opportunity if u add multiplayer and like level creation it will be good\nand the game is so RAGE but most of all its a fun game if u don't have wifi :P\n\nand i have high hope on this game i recommend it it's a good 2d offline game", "recommendationid": "34706322", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504683", "timestamp_created": 1504428995, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_forever": 44, "last_played": 1506945032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198220504428"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
