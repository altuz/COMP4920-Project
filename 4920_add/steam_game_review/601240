NO GUIDE ON YOUTUBE <:( \n- Achievements are way too sarcastic (there is literally an achievement called \"I'm Loving This\"... *sarcasm*)\n- Doesn't bring anything new to the table\n\nRecommended for:\n\nPeople who just want to create badges, or collect some trading cards, only when the game is on sale.\nAnyone else should skip it and play better games instead.\n\nNOTES:\nI got this game for 66% off via a coupon for creating a badge, and i think it's worth only that.", "recommendationid": "32071557", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504621", "timestamp_created": 1496178310, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 114, "last_played": 1497458067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198070255471"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
