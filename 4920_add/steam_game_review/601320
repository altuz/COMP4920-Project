I heard about the game because it's made by a local developer. Each game is really different, and they're very fast-paced. Gameplay is really solid, mechanics for each game are well thought out, but the visuals could use a bit of touch-up. I personally like the minimalistic approach, but a little update to the graphics could be good.\n\nOverall, the experience is enjoyable, especially with a few friends that have a bit of a competitive side.", "recommendationid": "31266487", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1492737535, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 443, "playtime_forever": 65, "last_played": 1492733357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198022063940"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
