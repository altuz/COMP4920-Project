Movie is good, this game seems like typical quick to market sofisticated advert. Ad you need to pay for :) \nHand tools was fine... minigames were relatively ok, if the game had actually some content. \nAlso the minigame content etc. was so \"just to be there\".. no real gameplay reason - just arbitrary timeouts etc.\nGraphics looked very bad in the distance... seemed supersampling was lowered even below 1.0. Worst outer space walk experience i had in VR games. Propably mainly because of low resolution and missing some details on the star surface and so.\nI actually liked the suit. VR games tend to look better on closer objects and moving head with helmet felt fine.\n\nThere are actually many free games with much more content than this paid ad.
