Hard-core HOP fans, yeah you can cope with all the bad things this game has - bad translation, annoying kid factor, bad character artwork (scenery is beautiful and colorful, but chars not), very bad narrative, OK VO I guess, music is quite good.

I have played over 200 HOG's and this is one of the best games I have ever played! Beautiful graphics, awesome and amazing voice-overs (which for me can make or break a game), and a very unique and engaging story line. I plan on going to the developer's website after leaving this review, to see about what other HOG's they have out there. Download it, buy it- you won't regret it!
