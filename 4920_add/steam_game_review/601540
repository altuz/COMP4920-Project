I tried a few custome battles with miltiple units and started the campaign. Not much in the way of guidance to get you started as a newbie and lots of the overworld textures are a blatant rip off of mount and blade.  I really want this game to get better as the general concept is good and the developers look like they are very involved.  I'm sure I'll pick it up again in half a year to try once more. Until then I'm going to leave this in my wishlist.", "recommendationid": "34749248", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501966", "timestamp_created": 1504583640, "author": {"num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 211, "playtime_forever": 11, "last_played": 1504583416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025198563"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505330724, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 8, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "So this game look col from the screen shots dont let it fool you it uses a mount and blade like tile movvment map battles are like any other Mideval war total war, and the worst part its very boring i can`t even play though the totorial i watched youtube videos and was like wait is this the same game i bought?\n\nso save yourself the time and money inless you really like TBS stratagy games this one is RTS and plays like a TBS\n", "recommendationid": "34925750", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487701", "timestamp_created": 1505330724, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 211, "playtime_forever": 43, "last_played": 1505330430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198058640073"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 46, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 157, "total_positive": 111, "review_score": 6}, "success": 1}
