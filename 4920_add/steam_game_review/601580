The controls are well transponsed and it plays really smooth, prefer it over touch. The best thing is that there are no annoying pop-ups and you can just enjoy the game and complete your hero tab/develop your Knights without being reminded that it is free and that I should pay to get stuff... Prefer to pay and get a full game. Price seems fair aswell to me. Recommeded for:\n- Player who look for some quick fun (with more depth then expected and some RPG elements as well)\n- TD lovers\n- Onion Lovers! (actually havent seen many onions, you just defend them I guess...maybe they should change that... anyway it's a good feeling to fight for a noble cause :-D)\n\nI haven't played it for long yet but will definately try to beat some more bosses asap!", "recommendationid": "34945604", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507119", "timestamp_created": 1505383329, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 66, "playtime_forever": 342, "last_played": 1505587989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992436075"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505485427, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "fun game. definitely one of the better tower defense games with a good humour!\n\ni played already via mobile but with pc it is even more fun (as long as you don't have to stand when you commute:)).", "recommendationid": "34973136", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1505485427, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 280, "playtime_forever": 73, "last_played": 1505473349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197965486605"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
