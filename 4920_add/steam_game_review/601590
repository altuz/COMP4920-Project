What you see on the screenshot is what will you get.\nThe main menu is quite weird. Some button can be press by using controller and some, you have to use your keyboard/mouse (hence the partial controller support)\nController works 100% during race.\n\nThe race itself?\nThe race is very simple and straight forward. You got item,you use it and kill other trucks (kinda like mario kart but cheap version with less item and simple map)\nAs far as  I played, the difficulty is okay, nothing much to comment about that.\n\nAnd one more thing, can you change the HUD to top right. I cannot see what item I pickup/HP if the HUD keep moving around on my truck and out of my play area(under the screen).\n\nAs the other racing game, multiplayer and workshop content (user level) might make this game better. But there is not much high hope to put for the indie game like this.\n\nThe game is good if you don't have other game to play and just want to sit back, relax and destroy trucks.\nI recommend this game.not recommend you to buy it if you expect much from it but if you want to support the developer, go ahead. It is cheap and got a lot of stages. I hope the developer can add more stage.\n\nGood indie game 6.5/10\n\n", "recommendationid": "30395548", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520755", "timestamp_created": 1488996683, "author": {"num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 184, "playtime_forever": 48, "last_played": 1489117606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046925032"}, "votes_up": 13}, {"timestamp_updated": 1489099488, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This was a surprise. Loving racing games and trucks, I couldn't pass this one up, but I didn't expect much at this price. What you get is an enjoyable 'future racer' style game, but with big rigs. Tons of courses are available from the get go and a big range of vehicles to drive. The game could do with more race options (time trials, 1 on 1, elimination races etc) and truck upgrades, but maybe they will come as the game develops. Good start over all, looking forward to seeing how this develops.\n\nHere are my first impressions of the game as I played it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMxzeWwv_eE", "recommendationid": "30416465", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504280", "timestamp_created": 1489099488, "author": {"num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 181, "playtime_forever": 38, "last_played": 1489015122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063832708"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1490731103, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "its good why arent they realesing updates they should because its: fun.good at holding suspense. over all its great im expecting updates if not just why it will start getting respect if it has more updates and people will spread it to the community and it will start being alot more fun because how much updates the games probably going to have and how much community ideas and mods will be made is unlimited so the devs really should focus more on the game side note devs please see this", "recommendationid": "30800532", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490634", "timestamp_created": 1490731103, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 40, "last_played": 1495124078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198213031092"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
