Very buggy. Teleportation sometimes works, half the time does not work. Does not even have basic things like a color pallette so you can really find good colors. Also, all dimensions are at right angles and quantize to either a solid foot or half foot. So much for matching an actual house. Lots of potential, but way too expensive for the raw state it's in. And from the forums, it appears nothing has been done to this software since release. Not a good sign. I'd stay away until the dev shows more dedication to making this worth the money. Right now, it's not worth it. It's frustrating, especially not being able to move about the space you just created. and some items, once spawned in, do not appear to be able to be removed. I assume this is a bug. But I accidently spawned a drawer and I wanted to remove it.

Very intuitive and easy to use. I could make a room at real size and add furniture in 5 minutes.\nThe controls are very handy. Placing a door or a window on a wall (as well as furniture) is easy since the objects snaps to each others.\nNot sure but I haven't found how to make a ceiling at the room (not sure it's possible as of today).\nI was very interested in a software like that because I am about to renovate and extend a kitchen and this will help me to give me an idea of the final volume and placement of the furniture.\nCherry on the cake, it will be possible to import objects.
