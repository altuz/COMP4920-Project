In this village a young boy named Huan wakes up at 3am every day to join all the other young children on their journey by bike, like hundreds of thousands of other young children to the workshops in the nearest city of Xixxiun.\n\nOnce there they turn on their assigned computers and open Unity Personal edition and start importing free assests into the latest Steam greenlight game they are working on. They need to have 6 of these games completed before 11am and ready to be uploaded for Steam Greenlight. Story, gameplay, controls, graphics, optimisation none of this matters as long as they are able to run.\n\nThen they move onto what will sell the games, the most important part of this whole enterprise. The cards, they design the cards, as they know most who buy this game from a 90% discount voucher will just idle for the cards. Once done they move onto another 5 games for the afternoon and finish up around 10pm for the long ride home.\n\nIn another dark and dingier corner of the sweat shop younger children spend their days logging into their multiple steam accounts voting on the Steam Greenlight games their co-workers have made so they get passed through green light and into your account.\n\nThe Guard of Dungeon is made from the sweat of little nine year old Huan. \n\nGames shit.", "recommendationid": "32708511", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514592", "timestamp_created": 1498274122, "author": {"num_reviews": 336, "num_games_owned": 1810, "playtime_forever": 494, "last_played": 1499947614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197974522156"}, "votes_up": 8}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
