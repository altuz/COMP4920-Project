I've enjoyed being able to go and fire some rounds down range whenever I feel like it.\n\n- The outdoor ranges are fun for target practice, and there are a lot of interactive targets.\n- The interactive targets work well, and react when shot properly.\n- For being an early access game, there are a ton of different types of rifles, pistols, and shotguns to shoot, with more coming every few patches.\n- There are a ton of paper targets to choose from on the indoor range\n- Beta features / items can be toggled on and off if you don't like them until they are put into the game permanently.\n\nFor an early access game, I was expecting some bugs, and there are a few.  But, unlike a lot of early access games, the developers are very responsive and are listening to the players..\n\nI'm expecting this game to only get better then more time the developers put into it!\n\nBack to the range...", "recommendationid": "35010516", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1505608475, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 278, "playtime_forever": 196, "last_played": 1505606924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197964402452"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505255917, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is pretty good if you like messing with guns", "recommendationid": "34909657", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1505255917, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 193, "last_played": 1504711148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198138003115"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505174742, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Love the game.
