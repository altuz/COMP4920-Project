The plot of the game is the usual generic fanasy RPG plot: evil sealed away is being released, you must stop it.\n\nPros:\n- The combat is very well designed, and flows very well.\n- The maps are quite expansive, and there are plenty of areas to explore, with useful to find in them.\n- Enemy variety is quite strong, and in general the enemy AI is well programmed.\n- The dialog is decently written.\n- The English translation is very polished (the game was made by a Thai company).\n- No loading times at all, and the game is very stable. I ran into zero bugs during my 16+ hours playing it.\n- A very respectible game length that didn't feel like it was intentionally drawn out to me.\n\nCons:\n- One of the game's main mechanics is dodge rolling, which is controlled by double tapping a direction key. Unfortunetly it's a bit unresponsive at times, and the keypress detection needs imporvement.\n- The game's monitary system is not all that well designed in my opinion. Pretty much no enemies drop Gold, just various items, and it's hard to tell what is safe to sell, and what you might need later for crafting purposes.\n- The graphics are pretty low key. Personally I don't care about this, but the game looks about on par with Nintendo 64 era 3D graphics.\n- Inventory management could have been handled a bit better, such as an option to manually (or even automatically) sort your bag. It gets hard to find what you're looking for later in the game.\n- The controls for dialog aren't stellar. You have to drag your mouse down and click an arrow icon with a very small mouse region each time.\n- No gamepad support. And considering how many action bar slots the game has, I don't know if there will ever be support.\n\n-----\nOverall I VERY MUCH enjoyed this game, and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys hack and slash RPGs. This was the most fun I've had with any game in quite some time.\n\nI'd rate it 4.5 out of 5 - very much recommended!", "recommendationid": "35177852", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514723", "timestamp_created": 1506251458, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 210, "playtime_forever": 2134, "last_played": 1506576334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2134, "steamid": "76561198042039384"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506144680, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A simple hack and slash rpg game that is nothing special in the grand scheme of things but is full of references and reminded me of the old days of playing adventure games on the N64 and dreamcast.\n\n-follow a fairly linear storyline\n-choose between 3 classes\n-leveling up gives you allocation points \n-find/buy/craft better gear and potions\n-actionbar you can fill with abilities/spells, or powerful passive signets you locate in the world.\n\nI was surprised with the accurate balancing and pacing of monsters throughout the game. It became even a challenge in some circumstances.

Other than that it is a stellar little rpg that harkens back to the old days of Threads of Fate and Brave Fencer Musashi (great games I would recommend). It's got simple gameplay elements of hit thing til dead that is well made and only made better with a large selection of skills at later levels to vary gameplay and strategy. The difficulty curve is not too heightened as to scare away as enemies one step ahead of you are still managable, but with the right gear and stats are then made trivial. \n\nAs far as classes go, you have your basic three of: Knight that tanks hits as well as giving them out, Mage which is your typical glass cannon, Rogue which relies more on mobility and dodging for armor than the knight's high defense. From there you learn new skills every level or couple levels that help you on your journey and can help you hone your character to your liking. \n\nAs for equipment, there is no limitation be it class/level/stat/gender. Everything is available to everyone as long as you can get your hands on it. So a mage can have a bow for when mana is low, a rogue can have a staff to buff their magic poison and the knight can use a dagger for the crit bonus if they so choose. There are four slots for equipment which are: Weapon, Armor, Hat/Necklace and Ring. Weapons are pretty straightforward but the defensive gear offers a variety of bonuses as well as possible drawbacks. One of the better examples is a Blindfold that greatly enhances magic attack and a few resistances (like Dark and Stun) but also decrease the user's Hit and Flee because you can't hit or dodge what you can't see. There's also a chicken hat. Always a plus.\n\nStorywise the game follows a rather typical tale of King was a hero back in the day, but has a son who turned eeeeevil but is actually a good guy. There are also quite a few references thrown in to Pokemon, One Piece, Excalibur and Gundam. It may be amusing to some but detract for others.\n\nMusic is quite nice and the environments, while maybe small and simplistic, get the job done for the day.\n\nI would say this game is worth the price but if you're not sure, pick it up on a sale. It's a good bit of fun if you like those old rpgs or want a simple rpg without so many convoluted systems.", "recommendationid": "35221953", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505403", "timestamp_created": 1506432966, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 146, "playtime_forever": 2355, "last_played": 1507094665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2355, "steamid": "76561198012406551"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505834486, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Haven't played it much yet but from what I have seen I think it's fair to say I know whats there for the rest of the game.\n\nill keep it straight forward this time around:\n\nThe animations are stiff and not very pleasing to look at.\nThe character models aren't exactly bad but they could have done a better job.\nThe combat is button mashing together with a hotbar like an MMO that allows you to perform skills.\n\nThere is parodies here and there that I think old school gamers myself including can get at least a giggle out of (not going to spoil them)\nThe graphics are actually quite nice, Tho the map design is a little lazy.\nI will update this review once I get more into it but for now ill leave it at this.\n\nTo sum it up if your looking for a silly game then this might be right up your ally.\nIf you were looking for an anime game or something of the like then your probably better of with the newly released Accel World VS SAO or the upcoming YS: Lacrimosa od Dana.", "recommendationid": "35066410", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494991", "timestamp_created": 1505834486, "author": {"num_reviews": 75, "num_games_owned": 282, "playtime_forever": 21, "last_played": 1505834165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198086758882"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505894844, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Sympathic little game, Eternal Lore can't hide it's extreme simplicity. The backgrounds are empty, the gameplay is basic, the sound base is very poor (no talking of course, but you can't even hear the footsteps or movements of your character or of any NPC). \n\nHowever, if those details are not enough to turn you away, you will find a pretty nice action RPG. Nothing close to the huge licences like the elder scrolls, witcher etc, obviously, but exactly what you could expect from an RPG on the DS or 3DS. \n\nI haven't played much yet, but I can already tell the game has it's personnality, the musics are nice, the gameplay is simple but enjoyable and for now the game seems to show a lot of content (you can even fight in an Arena if you get bored of the storyline, Oblivion fans will appreciate that). \n\nCertainly not worth the full price of a game, but since the game cost less than 10\u20ac even at it's highest price, I can only suggest you give it a try, for such a low price, there's no way you can regret such a nice little game. \n\nIf like me you are an huge fan of RPGs and you have already tried all good RPGs on steam, this game is a nice try.", "recommendationid": "35079713", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492576", "timestamp_created": 1505894844, "author": {"num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 161, "playtime_forever": 43, "last_played": 1505974520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198116593913"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505974112, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Even during the first few minutes of the game, its already funny. It feels like a 3D Ragnarok Online with your typical Knight / Mage / Rogue class types. So far, I think Bow weapon is overpowered since you can shoot from afar, kite while shooting arrows, and no arrows are required to attack with bow. Plus, no stamina required to attack! So I can just shoot arrows all day every day! Navigation is lacking though, there's no indication or pointing arrow to your destination. I don't think you can zoom out to get a better view of the map. But it is a fun game nonetheless. I score this 8/10\n\nUPDATE: Here's my first 35-minute gameplay video.
