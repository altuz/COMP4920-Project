If a mix of Genesis Sonic games' fast paced action and platforming, multiple powers with different movesets and intense, button-mashing (in a good way) combat, this game is for you. The story isn't toooo coherent but honestly it doesn't really matter; it's fun and humorous with big moments peppered in that don't really feel forced. One more thing that I will say is this: if you were and/or still are a fan of Super Mario Bros. Z or any sort of Dragonball Z-esque Sonic sprite animations, you'll probably enjoy this. The cinematic cutscenes aren't that kind of animation but the game certainly has the same sort of charm in a few different ways.", "recommendationid": "35034682", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1505688182, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 343, "playtime_forever": 671, "last_played": 1505687400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198256813925"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 118, "total_positive": 109, "review_score": 8}, "success": 1}
