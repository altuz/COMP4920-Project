To do this, you have to \"spread\" colors from exisiting tiles to their adjacent tiles. It's a pretty simple mechanic, but good puzzle design along with a few interesting twists / mechanics keeps the game fresh.\n\nDifficulty-wise, it's not too hard, but hard enough that you can't just guess your way through the game. Progression is clear and new mechanics are introduced with some ramp-up. One thing here is that sometimes it was hard to figure out exactly what new mechanics did - there's no textual explanation, so even if you solve the puzzles introducing the mechanic, it might take a while for you to really understand what it's doing.  There's also a perfect score for each function if you want another layer of challenge.\n\nGraphics are nothing to write home about, but the shapes are sharp and the colors make it easy to stare at the screen while trying to figure out the next move. It fits with the type of game this was designed to be.\n\nThe music fits well with the aesthetic the game is going for and has some chill and relaxing tracks for puzzle-solving.\n\nOverall, this is an engaging puzzler that's worth your time to spend a few hours with and use some of those dormant brain cells.", "recommendationid": "33018674", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524114", "timestamp_created": 1498787991, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 264, "playtime_forever": 107, "last_played": 1498629345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198054946871"}, "votes_up": 12}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497381575, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have to say that I've mostly enjoyed Adjacency.
