I kept playing till I got stuck here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=918808473\nI tried and tried, but had to contact the developer. He decided to the change the level and I finally got an update:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=960265412\nI was still excited and continued playing past the 1st boss in New Game+. At a certain moment - while at this level 'Detour' - I came to the conclusion that the games wasn't a fun experience anymore; there was just too little room for error (again), and with that in mind, you were forced to move very slowly a lot of the time. Not a problem in case of a short level experience, but that wasn't the case a lot of the time. That aside, it's not possible to move backwards nor use a 'handbrake' or similar to completely park the triangle/rocket, making it only harder (especially with your 'Luv', where you sometimes need 4 eyes); not only unforgiven, also unfair I had to conclude, partially caused by slowness = annoyance. Checkpoints are recommended in some levels, but there are none.\n\nA few recommendations for an update:\n- 'Reverse gear' = moving backwards; only being able to make turns and rotate, often means dying through 1/3 edges of the triangle, because there's little room for error (in New Game+);\n- The possibility to completely park the triangle, not moving a pixel;\n- Level tests in New Game+...the progression in difficulty didn't always make sense, [spoiler]caused by a time limit, gravity (%) or fuel limitations[/spoiler];\n- Level screen! Could have motivated me to continue or maybe I could have skipped a few levels first, if that would have been an option. I didn't have any insight regarding my progress, I could only find some numbers in the game data...\n\nThat being said, I can actually still recommend playing this game, because there's enough fun before you start a New Game+ - which I don't expect everyone to start anyway. I just have mixed feelings about the New Game+ Mode and actually regret having started it...I could eventually finish it, but when something's not entertaining anymore, it's better to stop. I left the game with a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n7/10 - If you like Gun Rocket and are good at it, definitely try this, but think twice prior starting a playthrough in New Game+.", "recommendationid": "33132971", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509374", "timestamp_created": 1499004152, "author": {"num_reviews": 66, "num_games_owned": 146, "playtime_forever": 627, "last_played": 1499001546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063042468"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498586745, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I really enjoyed playing this game! some levels can be quite difficult but still fun", "recommendationid": "32871320", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477064", "timestamp_created": 1498586745, "author": {"num_reviews": 71, "num_games_owned": 1551, "playtime_forever": 204, "last_played": 1494866190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198217979953"}, "votes_up": 6}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
