You earn gold coins by shooting futuristic weapons like shotguns and lasers at fish who are minding their own business heading for some sort of aquatic Stargate. After a while the Jaws theme plays and a shark starts circling. For some reason the platform doesn't work and you have to crouch when it attacks but I  was lazy and only ducked. Survive and the next level of fish appear. There's also a tour mode where the platform moves on a predetermined path and another without the shark. \nGun and hand models look good (the reef not so much), the shock wave effects when using some weapons are really effective.  Fish vanish when blasted rather than explode in a vermilion cloud of blood and giblets, which is a shame. And why does it take 2 rounds from the M45D Tactical Shotgun knockoff to kill a clownfish?\n This would be good if the well-known \"FishLord\" hardened up and sent out some real fish because shooting a stream of bubbles from a shotgun at passing marine life is not a great fishing adventure.  \n\n    It's more like a fairground shooting range, but underwater with fish and shotguns. Sounds good on paper.\n6/10 if you've got young kids.", "recommendationid": "30357078", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498540", "timestamp_created": 1488813575, "author": {"num_reviews": 75, "num_games_owned": 214, "playtime_forever": 18, "last_played": 1488798930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002872077"}, "votes_up": 6}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
