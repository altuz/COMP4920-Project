Typically when reviewing a game so early on in it's lifecycle I'd return to the game after updates so I could update the review to account for any issues that had been resolved. HOWEVER, as the developer is dismissing any issues brought up on the game forum as \"design choices\" I'm unwilling to dedicate any more time to this particular title.\n\nDeep Fear is a procedurally generated endless \"runner\" that was originally Greenlit as a VR title. The store page for the current release however has no mention of either VR support or plans for it's addition in the future.\n\nAs soon as you start the game however it's immeaditley obvious that the game is still designed around VR implementation. The main menu is managable but the in-game HUD is placed off-screen above the character and requires you to pan your view upwards to t which is far from ideal as this also moves you in that direction.\n\nComments on the forum indicate the game is an asset flip with the developer responding that some assets are store-bought and some are original content. I personally have nothing against \"asset flips\" but it will obviously impact others decisions whether or not to buy the game.\n\nThe achievements which were my primary reason for buying the game are another aspect that others will have issue with and whilst it does have more than the typical game it's closer to Zup! than Sisters in Hotel as it does require some effort to unlock them rather than just idling the game.\n\nThe visuals are clearly an example of \"sex sells\" and it's obvious this is why the game is in third person. The third person camera makes for poor controls though and the crosshair - when it can be seen - seems to be too far ahead of you, meaning you often go everywhere but where you expect to go.\n\nThere are three game modes which are identical except for the colour palette. During each run you collect shells/coins that you can then spend on extra health, increased speed or additional characters. The health purchases however are consumable and not a persistent upgrade.\n\nWhilst there are a number of questionable design decisions you can't really argue with what you get for the price, whether discounted or not. However at this point I'd recommend holding out to see what state it's in after a few updates.", "recommendationid": "33698776", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585862", "timestamp_created": 1500650024, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 6399, "playtime_forever": 203, "last_played": 1501093669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198045737785"}, "votes_up": 87}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500941468, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "TL;DR Cheap and you get what you pay for.\n\nLet's be clear on this, it's an endless runner made up of a bunch of assets. While it's not technially an asset flip (i.e. I can't find an asset demo that is this game) the assets are pretty stock and the game is boring. \n\nYou swim, collect bubbles, avoid the deadly (?) plants, and then get eaten by sharks.\n\nWhat interested me was the video intro, thinking it might be a survival game or something (think Raft, Stranded Deep, etc.) but no. You don't have a raft, you'll never see the rendering quality of the swimmer like in the video, and you'll play it for about 10 minutes then forget about it. \n\nThe description is deceptive. Maybe there was some point in time where you could see \"Atlantis\" but I thought, from the description and video, this was some kind of exploration game. If going in a straight line seeing bubbles, various sea life, and some plants is your idea of exploring, maybe the developer will want to hire you.\n\nOh and there are achievements. Well, you get an achievement for almost every meter you make it in this game. No creativity whatsoever in these so they're just there for you to pad your achievement collection, if that's what people do.\n\nI get it's \"early access\" and some people will say \"there will be more\" but I don't see it. The three modes the game offers are the same thing but with a different coloured ocean. Early Access is a cheap out for this developer and game. This thing isn't going anywhere and in 6 months to a year, it'll be the same maybe with a whale or somehing added.\n\nFinally this was a VR game, as much as the developer might say it wasn't, it's clear. The menus are VR, the screens just activate when you hover over them, and 9 times out of 10 you'll accidently activate the menu system when swimming or browsing the menus. So a VR game that isn't VR.\n\nAt least it was less than a $1.", "recommendationid": "33710666", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536679", "timestamp_created": 1500690309, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 99, "playtime_forever": 5, "last_played": 1500689597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961839146"}, "votes_up": 50}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500733276, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 9, "comment_count": "8", "votes_funny": 4, "review": "Bewbs and booty are the only good features of this game...oh an music is okay-ish.
