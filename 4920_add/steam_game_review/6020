They could make a serious amount of money, if they made one of these now. It could be one of the top selling games, of this decade. The Saber mechanics, and dynamic force power usage, are revolutionary, and I wish they had made more of this game. Not to mention the multiplayer was some of the best of any game ever. It's a true shame that this franchise didn't go on longer.
