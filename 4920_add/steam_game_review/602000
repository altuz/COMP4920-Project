It's a cool setting short story with interactive environment and teleport locomotion.\nHas a nice classic adventure game feel to it.  \nNot everything is interactive but just enough to keep it satisfying.  \n\nI like the narration and hearing what my character is thinking.  Helps move the story along nicely.\n\n\n", "recommendationid": "31521458", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495846", "timestamp_created": 1493806853, "author": {"num_reviews": 127, "num_games_owned": 185, "playtime_forever": 39, "last_played": 1498667993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063942102"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496925910, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Just canceled my refund as I got it working smoother on oculus I put it in windows compatibility mode.The game is a exciting mystery.Possibly make the cars drivable in the desert.Praise Jesus!", "recommendationid": "32266339", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493047", "timestamp_created": 1496925910, "author": {"num_reviews": 54, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 50, "last_played": 1497039892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198235851042"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 6, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
