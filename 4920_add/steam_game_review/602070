It is exactly how I pictured white blood cells fighting off bacteria when I was in 6th grade.\n\nHowever this game NEEDS double jump and some kind of mid air uppercut. There are quite the many flying enemies in the game and you can only really hit them by jumping into their trajectory and punching them or by hoping they fly low enough you can jump over them and ground pound them. However there is one flying enemy that does not dip down far enough for the ground pound, and are annoying to hit by just punching in midair.\n\nStill, it's surprising that I spent 45 minutes in this game and the time went by like that. I'm far from done with the game but it looks promising and is fun to play. For $6, it's great.", "recommendationid": "31728153", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510565", "timestamp_created": 1494693263, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_forever": 42, "last_played": 1494692934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010898791"}, "votes_up": 6}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
