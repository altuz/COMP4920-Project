According to the description on the Store Page, the dream is technically Stephanie's dream, and Stephanie is a girl who happened to be dumb enough to get windswept and sentenced to the torment of a maelstorm (sorry, didn't mean to be dark; I needed to say that).\n\n[h1][u]Story[/u][/h1]\n\nInstead of explaining the story on this page, why not instead actually put some time and effort into animating cutscenes illustrating and [i]showing[/i] the players what happened to this girl? I know this is an Indie game and it is pretty difficult to make a videogame on one's own, but if you were going to add a story to the game, at least put some effort into appealing our senses by adding animated scenes or something.\n\n[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]\n\nVery simplistic control mechanics, similar to that of a Mario game; jumping over cliffs and dodging obstacles. The game presents itself as a casual game where the only thing to do is to dodge obstacles and not be \"killed\" in a sense, something that the developer(s) clearly mentioned on the Store Page, well done. Basically, your goal as Stephanie is to keep moving rightward, dodging boulders, spikes, flying axes, and apparently spears from the sky until you reach a portal that leads into the next world, or \"level.\" \n\nWhat frustrates me a lot about this game is that there are checkpoints in-game, but no indication of them. The player is practically blind to figuring out where he/she will technically be \"safe\" from harm, so if they mess up, they will be back to a spot that is convenient for them. \n\nAdditionally, it frustrates me even more when developers make poorly-constructed obstalces. For instance, the swinging axes have no proper momentum and physics; they will swing very high up and somehow immediately jolt and swing to the other side, making dodging it nearly impossible unless you time it [b][i]EXACTLY[/i][/b] right, which composes an obstacle, but does not make it fun; it only angers the player.\n\nThat being said, gameplay is frustrating, with missing utilities and mechanics that basically leave the player frustrated and in the dark.\n\n[h1][u]Art Style, Environment, Music, Immersion, Etc.[/u][/h1]\n\nBackgrounds are the same for [i]one[/i] map level; you can keep moving leftward and notice how it is the same thing; nothing new or appealing to bring to the table. There are only three levels, and in a dream world, I would be expecting more than that;  very dissapointing. Environment resembles that of a dream world, which is accurate, but that is spoiled by the same repetitive music for all three maps. Honestly, I never finished this game; I got frustrated and moved on, so I have no idea if there are different environments from the three levels.\n\nVery little immersion and atmosphere. While the art is decent and the music relevant, the fact that both are repetitive ruins this game's attempt at immersing the player in a truly augmented dream.\n\n[h1][u]Settings[/u][/h1]\n\nPoorly established, not much to offer to the player trying to find something they can adjust to make their gameplay more comfortable and relaxing. Very limited, and I guess that makes sense considering what this game is in nature.\n\n[h1][u]Endgame?[/u][/h1]\n\nI would say no because this is an obstacle game. No unlocks, and that's fine; it doesn't need one.\n\n[h1][u]Achievements and Difficulty[/u][/h1]\n\nNone.\n\n[h1][u]Worth the Price?[/u][/h1]\n\nFor the price of $3.99 to frustrate your ass off and become annoyed by repetitive music, yes. Or, if you just want to see how the game is, the price isn't that bad.\n\nFor an Indie game created by a competent developer, the game receives:\n\n[h1][u][b]\ud83d\udc2fThe Indie Snowfire Scoreboard\ud83d\udc2f:[/b][/u][/h1]\n5.) Well-created, well-made, practically no problems in gameplay; worth the purchase!\n4.) Created well and firmly established with minor bugs, glitches, and/or errors in gameplay; worth the money.\n3.) Decently made, some elements detriment the game, has some problems and issues that can impair gameplay; can at least take a look.\n[b][u]2.) Appropiately made, numerous elements detriment the game, has some problems and issues that will ruin the gameplay a bit; probably not worth the look.[/u][/b]\n1.) Poorly made, plenty of elements destroy the game, has many problems and issues that make gameplay a joke; quarantine yourself from this game.\n\nDreamlike Worlds claims to not be like another Limbo, when it kind of is. You can't just say that when it is, admit it. Regardless, the game is not exactly up to par with me. It has a decent price for it, but repetitive elements and a lack of an illustrative story destroy this game for me.
