I love the graphics and the atmosphere. The concept of the weapons handling feels a bit strange though. I mean that first you grab an item, then you press a button to add it to your inventory, and doing that the item disppears, just to show up again sticking to your hand, and only then you can use it. It would be more immersive if you just could grab a weapon and use it. \n\nThe weapons themselfs work quite well. I love the bow. Great feeling and accuracy. Also the wand.\n\nI really hope you will add locomotion (free movement) as an option. \nKeep up the good work. I am looking forward to your next updates.", "recommendationid": "31043289", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492465", "timestamp_created": 1491753429, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 79, "playtime_forever": 43, "last_played": 1493930219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030716934"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
