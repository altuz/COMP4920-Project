But that set aside, i really enjoyed it and i hope this gets a bigger playerbase so that erveryone can find a server when they want to. Its a cool concept and good execution with just a lack of people but that cant be fixed by the devs.", "recommendationid": "33815912", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495587", "timestamp_created": 1501096905, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 49, "playtime_forever": 146, "last_played": 1501256663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198215457792"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502344960, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Played at a time when there weren't too many servers running, but it seems pretty fun so far!
