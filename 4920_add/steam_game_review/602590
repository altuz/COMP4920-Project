I also played in in German and the translation was just horrible. Most of the time it was grammatically incorrect and at one point the translation was missing.\nYou also don't get explained that you open your inventory by pressing \"I\". That's the reason I didn't manage to do anything for the first hour of the game...\nIn my opinion the strong part of the game is the atmosphere which has been implemented perfectly throughout the graphics and the music.\n\nSo if you are interested in a game which makes you to think about everything then this might be it for you but for me it was just bored clicking, walking and reading poems.", "recommendationid": "34210407", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487512", "timestamp_created": 1502618612, "author": {"num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 540, "playtime_forever": 92, "last_played": 1502617789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198054651665"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
