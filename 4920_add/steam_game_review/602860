I very much love Total War: Shogun 2 - Fall of the Samurai and therefore have bought this game without thinking. Very interesting period in the history of Japan. Naval battles in Fall of the Samurai were primitive and schematical. It seemed that they were done by indifferent people who don't understand naval tactics and strategy at all. \n\nIronclads 2 series of games strange looks, and it is still difficult to understand how to play at once.

Civil War feels very tensive because you have limit time to realize your advantage (when you have it or wait for it trying not to lose a fleet) otherwise when opponent gets advantage, you can lose the game. Pacific gives you not chanse to lose a ship because each side of the conflict can\u2019t produce armored ships at all, so you have to be very careful.\n\n\nAnd now we have a Boshin War, Japanese Civil War with interesting alignment of forces, Imperial forces have army but not powerful fleet, Shogunate has a more powerful fleet but almost no army. I played Shogunate and started from destroying imperial fleet, in first battle using manual artillery mode (have to say with 5-6 guns battery it works very well) I was able to deal damage from far distances and at the end of hour 3 armored transports of imperial fleet was on the button of the ocean. Great! Other game time was tense to, but good start gave me a time to capture enough cities for 81% success rate.\n\n\nWhat can I say, game still needs a lot of improvements, for example sometimes you forgetting that your ship is ready to action - better show it somehow. Infantry part of the game could be better, right now it works like strategic element of gameplay but has lack of tactics. Even with that it plays very fast and interesting \u2026 of course when you already understand what you need to do and how to move and build.", "recommendationid": "31459043", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501573", "timestamp_created": 1493543252, "author": {"num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 152, "playtime_forever": 393, "last_played": 1493541274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007111818"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495997991, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I did not expect very much when I purchased this game.
