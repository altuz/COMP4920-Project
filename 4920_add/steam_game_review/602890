I played up until the 3rd mission where I accidentally skipped on of the dialogue boxes (my mouse is finicky). You wouldn't think it is a big deal, but it really is. You can't go back to look at previous dialogues or anything of the sort. I was left confused and trying to figure it out. This game could be really good if the developers put some more time and effort into the game. Another thing, the developers do not seem to care too much about there customers since I haven't seen any acknoledgements from them that the game is a broken (or any other notes from the devs. They don't even release patch notes.). I wish that I could recommend this game. I really do, but there are just so many problems with it that I can't.

The main desktop was very promising but then you start opening programs and immediately the facade falls away because of poor UI design.\n\nThe puzzles quickly became less fun and more bashing my head against the wall trying to remember arbitrary commands I had used an hour ago in the console. The console itself is a huge problem, using made-up commands and invalid syntax...
