Surprise! It contained some collecting with a little bit of challenge to make you think. Won't break your brain but will definitly make you question things if you make the wrong move or just try to power click or rush through. Also has a nice soundtrack in my opinion.\n\nPro Tip: If you saved on a map/level and exit when you return it is reset allowing you a fresh restart without going into the AppData to delete the whole save file. Developer plans to put a in-game reset option soon.", "recommendationid": "32097355", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532229", "timestamp_created": 1496277657, "author": {"num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 3480, "playtime_forever": 554, "last_played": 1504450896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198068149445"}, "votes_up": 15}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499094578, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Dream stone is first person puzzle game. i play for an our and there is some optimization problems.
