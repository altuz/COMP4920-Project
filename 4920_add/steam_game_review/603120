I had to see it for myself.  While I agree with the badness, I also found myself laughing...a lot.  And I sincerely hope that's what the devs were going for with this - humor - lots of laughs at the sheer ridiculousness of it.  Because if not, I am deeply disturbed...\n\nIt's also a serious stretch to call this a game.  There is only one ending.  The \"choices\" affect nothing more than a few lines of dialogue.  There is one actual choice of something you can do or not do that branches the story slightly but brings you quickly back to the same ending. \n\nAs for the 18+ content, I consider the game itself to be 18+   It is extremely inappropriate in a lot of ways to begin with. All the patch does is add two anatomical details.  It adds nothing else - no new scenes, no new dialogue. \n\nAgain, not recommended, but you might enjoy it if you go into it like I did expecting it to be bad and you aren't easily offended.   I enjoyed this for the moments of comedy (some great dialogue) and a few instances of surprisingly deep conversations about relationships, but I can't call it good overall.", "recommendationid": "34516351", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513619", "timestamp_created": 1503789237, "author": {"num_reviews": 38, "num_games_owned": 4881, "playtime_forever": 441, "last_played": 1503787846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198039619705"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499807269, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "I wanted to find a good yuri visual novel, and let me just say this isn't it.", "recommendationid": "33465484", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505871", "timestamp_created": 1499807269, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 92, "playtime_forever": 102, "last_played": 1498271873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053277808"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504335545, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "A bit overpriced,  but it has a certain charm that makes it stand out.  \n\nAlso it has a lot of \"its so bad its funny\" segments. \n\nPlus, large not-to-scale anime tiddies, you all know what you're really come here for. \n\nEnjoy an adventure unlike any other and be proud to play one-handed.", "recommendationid": "34678072", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1504335545, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 293, "playtime_forever": 75, "last_played": 1506896772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "steamid": "76561198100266725"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504144774, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "33 minutes was all it took for me to have done everything you could do.
