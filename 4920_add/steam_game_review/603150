If you are lucky you get one hour of gameplay out of this. The last 4 maps has some challenge at least, and as such I don't think this dollar-game was a complete waste. It's certainly not the worst TD out there, but far, faaar from the best.\n\nThe bad:\n* Sound. Dear god man.\n* Spam click monster to get their health down. It's just such a poor game mechanic it makes me sick.\n* Length. Over befor\n* Lack of strategy.\n* Graphics and UI (Smartphone port I'd say). But you stop caring a few levels in. (As with most TD's)\n\nThe good:\n* There is some challenge to be found.\n* Interesting enough to keep me in to the end. (But the first 5 levels were stretching it).\n* I figure it's easy to get 100% achievements if that's your thing.\n\nRecommend because the dev(s?) must have put some effort in and it's cheap as dirt. \nIt's really not that great of a game though.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this to friends, but to other TD-enthusiasts who likes to scrape the bottom of the barrel; go for it!", "recommendationid": "33700789", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507074", "timestamp_created": 1500655947, "author": {"num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 1161, "playtime_forever": 55, "last_played": 1500655064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197975373553"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500762208, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Finished the game, got all cards and 100% achievements in less then two hours.\nGame is a little dusty, could be really from the late 90's, but playable without crashes.\nA few minor bugs, nothing serious.\nGameplay is repetitive, therefore 5/10 maybe less.\n\nI probably wouldn't buy it again, but I can barely recomment it if you're a completionist.\n", "recommendationid": "33731147", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494521", "timestamp_created": 1500762208, "author": {"num_reviews": 107, "num_games_owned": 1157, "playtime_forever": 116, "last_played": 1500761058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041832614"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 8, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
