The art is fantastic, the character designs are great, and the soundtrack is top-notch. Taken together, the game succeeds in producing the creepy, yet aesthetically appealing atmosphere it seeks to create. However, what matters most in a video game is the gameplay, and that's where My Own Little Planet suffers. Greatly.\n\nCreating an action platformer sans attack button is not necessarily a deal-breaker, but when your defenseless character's only means of survival is to run and jump a foot off of the ground, the fun factor diminishes by several orders of magnitude. This is compounded by a complete lack of power-ups and usable items. The game's most significant shortcoming, however, is the level design.\n\nUnlike most platformers, My Own Little Planet places the player in numerous situations that he/she cannot possibly react to in time. Put another way, the game relies on repeated attempts to complete most levels. This essentially requires the player to memorize each level's layout, as well as the locations of traps and monsters, rather than hone his/her skills to address them. This shortcoming is most evident during the giant moth \"battle\" in stage 5. The player is given no warnings as to where the moth will appear, effectively forcing him/her to replay the long, arduous level over and over again. Such gameplay is not skill-based and is definitely not fun.\n\nI admire the vision you had for this game, Mr. Parise, but I cannot honestly recommend it to anyone at this point in its development. That said, I think a patch rectifying some or all of the shortcomings I addressed could make My Own Little Planet a memorable game worth playing over and over again.", "recommendationid": "31332001", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534120", "timestamp_created": 1493000219, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_forever": 42, "last_played": 1492912731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198157843700"}, "votes_up": 14}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492557494, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Good ideas/inspirations, not so great execution. 4/10 considering the cheap pricetag\n\nThe game is a very basic platformer with the same aesthetic as Don't Starve (so much so that the main menu looks like a carbon copy). Your character lacks the ability to actually kill anything so the killing of enemy comes from luring them into the traps that would normally kill you.\n \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6n1tkuBXs4&lc=z12eh3mrdqbdfzcrz04ccnjqionltlervog0k&channel=UC9I_hGc1N7uT4a2G2mwja4g\n\nThe principle is good but the actual gameplay not so much. There is a lack of an ability to peek around the edges so a lot of times you are stuck just jumping into an area you cannot see at all and dying on a trap. Most of the difficulty in this game seems to stem from this die until you have seen  the entire stage aspect + the extremely jenky hitboxes. Traps that have already activated can still kill you before disappearing, the first major boss will kill you even if it is clearly not hitting you on the screen, enemies that kill you on touch will hit you when you are visibly out of range. Basically Flappy Bird in terms of hitbox accuracy.\n\nThe music is pretty decent, most of the tracks feel like a rehash of something else but different enough to not feel like a total ripoff. The aesthetic is the same fun Don't Starve style, some of the sprites are pasted on a bit poorly but you aren't likely to run across them except during deaths. \n\nNot sure if the game will actually run you 5 hours as the dev claims considering I reached the boss of the first of 5 worlds in under half an hour with my poor platforming skills.", "recommendationid": "31186342", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513559", "timestamp_created": 1492374700, "author": {"num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 362, "playtime_forever": 32, "last_played": 1492315862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044873014"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492272155, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "A fun game about trying to outwit puzzles and avoid monsters.
