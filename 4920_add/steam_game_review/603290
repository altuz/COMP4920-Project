The puzzle levels are a lybrith of sorts with obsticles and thinking processess are needed. There is trading cards, witch is nifty for the badge collecters, but there is only one achievement so far (and so far its not reveled what it is).  The game doesn't save, so you have play it all at once. There is only 5 worlds with about 10 levels per world.  There is a glitch on level 30 where the block on the far left is always off centered. The glitches do seem to be attacked and corrected on a regular bases lately. Witch is good and means the developers are working. The music is good, but oddly uppbeat for such a casual/relaced game and repetitive. There was one song that was a Mission Impossible style, while all I was doing was pushing around blocks.  Hard core eh? It is a good game for people who like puzzle games and kill some time.
