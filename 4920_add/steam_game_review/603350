There's no real story, and the gameplay is far from difficult or complicated. It's pretty much an arcade game; get as much points as you can, and when you lose, try again. But that's okay, because it's pretty good arcade game. And if you're feeling competitive, you can play in multiplayer mode and go against your friends (or random strangers online).
