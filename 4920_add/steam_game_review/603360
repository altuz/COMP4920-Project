I say this because one review claims that you can upgrade your so-called \"mining machine\" and unlock more difficult levels. However, I've played the game for an hour, unlocked all the acheivements, but still was unable to upgrade anything nor get different levels.\n\nOnto the game, it's simply a matching game and yes it is a good brain stimulator and works your memory, but often times I found it to be too easy. Sometimes it wasn't very random and I believe the generation of the board could be vastly improved. There was a save file system in place which was a nice touch, but as I mentioned earlier, I don't see much reason to go beyond five levels as that's when it starts to drain on your soul. \n\nI also noted that many advertised features did not work. After each round, you can earn 10 or 20 coins to put towards upgrades and power-ups. I hurried to gather 200 coins for the big upgrade option, only to find out that it was bugged. I still have no idea what the boosters are supposed to do, nor what the number counting up on the top right means. Please, if you're going to keep this game on Steam, fix these issues and then I think it has some potential. I will await for an update.\n\nIn summary, unless they fix the issues and add more level variety, do not get this game. If you're a completionist and want the acheivements, even if it was only 20 cents with your steam coupon, I advise against it. But if you must, get ready for the most soul draining task ever.
