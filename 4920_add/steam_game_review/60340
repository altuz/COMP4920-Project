Fullscreen mode is supported, although the screen is stretched from a fairly low resolution window, but unfortunately the Steam Overlay is not supported.  The game features a wide variety of detailed scenario backdrops and ball paths, as well as a nice selection of power ups, extra point gems and coins and end level achievement trophies that are in game only. Altogether this is one of the better casual puzzle games on the market and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a solid casual challenge."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1413701856, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500131", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "12563265", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197994155733", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1439081950, "num_games_owned": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 252}, "timestamp_updated": 1413701856, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I downloaded this game.
