The arrows are hard to get on the bow sometimes. I smacked my controllers together a few times.\n\n I played through the 1st 5 levels & 3 of the bosses just ran in place and didn't attack me. \n\nHit registration is not very good. Watched many arrows go through enemies without doing anything.\n\n I love the idea of this game though. Hopefully there will be updates in the future & I can go back to it.

You just basically stand there in this semi-beautiful jungle shooting animals constantly moving around and then wait for some to attack then run and then attack then run .... and then a \"boss type animal\" comes and you shoot it and it runs and then it comes back and you shoot it and it runs and then it runs away. Huh? And then some different types of animals cycle in and the same thing occurs. I was hoping this was an open world type hunting game which we need badly in VR like Island 359. Wiith this premise of hunting it could have been good. The game is just boring in the state it is in though. It looks good but that does not make it fun. Not fun and I don't recommend it right now.", "recommendationid": "30765197", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462843", "timestamp_created": 1490585739, "author": {"num_reviews": 221, "num_games_owned": 477, "playtime_forever": 8, "last_played": 1490564140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197974765747"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
