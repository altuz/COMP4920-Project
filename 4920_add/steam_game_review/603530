I wanna leave a positive review but I just can't for the game's cost/length.\n\nThere's a lot of good - the music and sound are pretty solid, the graphic style is decently solid. They've got a nice pixely art thing going, but obviously not a 'true' pixel art with the way assets and gibs move and flop around, but it's a minor nag.\n\nWhat gets me  though is I beat the game, first playthrough, no deaths, in an hour and fourteen minutes. The bigger problem is I didn't really feel compelled to do it again - the unlocks just seemed to be a few random powerups and a weapon or two, but none of that really changes up the game dynamic enough to be really worth further exploration. Metroidvanias work because they are sprawling and vast - this one had basically two areas, and that's it. Several powerups felt kinda pointless - the 'dash' is just a sluggish short-range dash with no purpose besides breaking a few blocks to arbitrarily block you, and many many assets are more 'copied' than 'inspired by' metroid. There's a fine line between homage and needless mimicry. The last boss was more of a pain in the finger from button mashing than difficulty, I knelt in one spot and just shot for a few minutes.\n\nThis is a game where I wish steam had a yes but bear in mind or a more neurtal rating, I hate having to give it a thumbs down, but I really just wouldn't recommend someone to buy it. It just doesn't quite work as it is. A true metroidvania relies on several things to really make it jive, and those things don't really jive well with some roguelike nuances.\n\nIt was kinda fun but horrifically short - if I hadn't left it on the title screen to get lunch I woulda beat it with 45 minutes to spare in the refund window, and that just doesn't cut it for me and a 'metroidvania' of any sort. The entire point is to spend hours and hours wandering  and exploring different areas, going back and forth, finding things, etc.\n\nSeveral things really threw off this game further - the item which lets you see powerups totally trivializes exploration and removes the need to keep an eye out, you immediately know every room with a powerup, period. SEveral powerups don't seem to work together - I got a 'shot fragments on collision' powerup, but my shots already passed through enemies and walls.. so it just did nothing? The shops have no explanation whatsoever for items until after you buy them, and resources to purchase seem random/scarce.. but ultimately not really needed anyways, apparently.\n\nThe game isn't bad, if it were just a couple bucks I'd let it slide for an hour and change, but as it is I just don't think it really works.\n\n", "recommendationid": "34803311", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559477", "timestamp_created": 1504821283, "author": {"num_reviews": 81, "num_games_owned": 380, "playtime_forever": 129, "last_played": 1504820912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197967981251"}, "votes_up": 66}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504807675, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 11, "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 2, "review": "An actual, backtrackable, fully explorable, rogue-lite castleroid.

We knew him long enough.\n- Save Rooms as extra lives was brilliant.\n\nCONS:\n- The music just.. isn't that good. Its not BAD by any means, but I often found it really easy to just ignore and never really felt like it was adding to the experience.\n- Its... shorter than I'd like. My first successful run was about 2 hours long and after I beat the boss I just sat there wondering if there was gonna be anymore. Then the credits rolled.\n- The Final Boss fight could have been better. Its a nice bullet hell (sort of) but when you show up completely decked out you can kinda just blast all the pesky mobs and bullets.\n- Normally I like my games Charge-Attacks to charge off the first press, but in this case I found it more frustrating that my attack-speed gets nerfed slightly by having a charge weapon because it always tries to charge shots when I wanna just tap-tap-tap the fire button quickly.

You can tell this game is a love letter to the genre, and it scratches just about every itch that's associated with it.\n\nI'm not fantastic at reviewing so I'll just skip right to the Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n- It's a bite-size adventure that has all of the best elements of a Metroid game. It's designed to be able to be beaten in a little over an hour, which encourages multiplie playthroughs and speed running.\n- There's a good sense of progression, you really feel like an unstoppable force by the end of a run, yet the final boss remains challenging.\n- No mindless wandering. I know this wont be a plus for everyone, but I don't like feeling entierly at a loss on what to do next, this game always has a few leads to follow if you're unsure. It never spells it out for you, but you always have an idea on where to go next.\n- It follows the beam-stacking formula, which means your default weapon will always be fun to upgrade and worth using.\n- There are some really nice musical pieces in here.\n\nMixed Impressions:\n- Bosses are a bit too easy sometimes. I'm grateful for this sometimes, but other times I'm unsure. Maybe the late game bosses could be a little harder. The final boss seems just right though.\n- The minimap lets your know if there's a powerup in the room somewhere. This isn't a big deal, and encourages speedier play, but I wouldn't mind if there were additional powerups that weren't revealed on the map as well as the ones that are. (Unless there are, then whoa...)\n- The downward shot while jumping looks hillarious. \n- No wall jump. I can see how this would break a procedurally generated game though.\n\nCons:\n- This is just an early game gripe, but my first few play throughs saw too many of the same powerups.\n- Each run (so far.) has contained the same areas in the same locational placement. \n\n\nI'm always happy to see fellow Unity developers have success.

The controls are pretty tight and I haven't died without totally feeling like I deserved it.", "recommendationid": "34869750", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504768", "timestamp_created": 1505072465, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 2173, "last_played": 1506864631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 787, "steamid": "76561198096607404"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504847283, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is an awesome buy.  Cost/fun factor is great.  Extremely satisfying controls that get better with each powerup.  The music and graphics are AMAZING.  Most people these days don't know what the metroidvania and roguelite genres mean, but if you do, you know what you're looking for and this game blends the two naturally.

The story is not the main focus, and thank god its not, because its just about killing some giant flying meatball.\n\nAs soon as you start the game, you immediately go into the settings and fix your button layout. I don't have a 360 contoller, and I don't know why, but my Generic USB Joystick (my GameCube controller) has an inverted axis only on this game, and I can't seem to fix it. So I had to use keyboard, which was probably the best option for me. The most suitable way I found is to have movement with 'WASD', diagonal aiming and switching weapons on the arrow keys, Space to shoot and Enter to jump.\n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand, and unless you know how Super Metroid controls, you may go through a few playthroughs getting confused about the control scheme.\n\nUpon choosing 'New Game' the world is created, building a map using pre-existing rooms with random powerups in them.\n\nEven if you only get terrain-phasing shots, four orbs, and no energy weapons, or something equally ridiculous, the game is still entirely completable as its procedurally generated to construct the world's obstacles based on the upgrades you are given. Because of this, the game is fairly linear, and you should be able to get 100% completion as long as you go through every room, since there's no secret rooms or alternate shortcuts, and all the items show up on your map.\n\nEventually you'll come to your first boss, 1 out of 3 random bosses for each area. Although these bosses are simple enough, they can be quite hard especially at the start since you're only guaranteed one or two powerups, which may not even be for your weapon.\n\nIf you beat the boss, you'll be introduced to the game's semi-permadeath mechanic, with new items and perks for all future playthroughs as you progress and unlock achievements. \n\nThese items can be found in upgrade rooms, or forged by the hand of allies whom you can find in the lower levels of the world. To craft these items, you use scrap found from monsters, or found randomly in hidden locations where powerups can also spawn. You don't need to craft these for 100% completion, but you do need to find all the ones across the world.\n\nIf you manage to survive the onslaught of all four areas and their respective bosses, the objective now is to go all the way back to the start and kill Megabeast. Assuming you beat the damage sponge that is the final boss, you teach robotkind the important lesson that things die when you kill them.\n\nThe ending wraps up telling you Megabeast's arrival was due to the 'anti-fascist' Mole People, and that many other robots will now take on the name Fight and challenge Megabeast. Which kind of makes sense with the permadeath idea. S'not 'A Robot Named Fight' as much as it is 'Multiple Robots Named Fight'. \nAnd the game ends with no further explanation. And then you win! Cheers!\n\n\nMusic and graphics are alright.\n", "recommendationid": "34908666", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502487", "timestamp_created": 1505250854, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 159, "playtime_forever": 996, "last_played": 1506626158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 196, "steamid": "76561198139124725"}, "votes_up": 8}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 20, "total_reviews": 103, "total_positive": 98, "review_score": 8}, "success": 1}
