On easy, even my youngest in first grade should be able to play (even if not well yet, but that's the point). There are in game power ups that are extremely easy to unlock (let a parent play on easy once) that extend the timer and allow additional mistakes. On hardest this reaches a point that is even challenging for me. It takes a second to think about some of the equations and you have to be able to read what cancels as you go to keep pace with the timer. The operations aren't hard, but you do have to be able to do them quickly on the highest difficulty. Good for the kids, but a worthwhile challenge if they want parents to jump in as well.\n\nSo I'm not misleading anyone about the difficulty, here are examples of the math involved:\n\n9+1 with a 13 second timer (Easy, early question, in game power ups applied)\n\n5+9:5-12+46  with a 5 second timer (Hardest, late question, no power ups applied)\n\nWith that one you basically have to read 7-12+46=41 then look at the options of 37.8, 41.8, 40.8 and realize that 9:5 is < 2, giving 40.8 as the answer very quickly. However, all the questions are multiple choice, so if math isn't your strong suit and you are running low on time you can blindly guess with a 1/3 chance of getting it right.", "recommendationid": "32013620", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514617", "timestamp_created": 1495955636, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 110, "playtime_forever": 93, "last_played": 1503198286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198288258686"}, "votes_up": 6}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 6, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
