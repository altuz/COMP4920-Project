{"reviews": [{"timestamp_updated": 1501201584, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 11, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "So I really, really wanted to like this game because the graphics look amazing and the plot sounded very interesting for a point/click adventure game; however, a lot of small issues ultimately led to an underwhelming experience that lost my interest in the game within about 45min. It says I logged about twice that time, but that's only because I quit at one point without realizing there was no autosave so I ended up starting over (blaming myself for that assumption). \n\nPros:\n1) Interesting plot (from what I experienced in terms of the overall direction)\n2) Graphics look fantastic\n3) Sound is pretty good and voice acted characters is always a plus\n4) Despite my complaints below, I can tell a lot of time and effort went into creating this game since certain aspects were polished very well\n\nCons: \n1) Character mouth/audio syncing: The character's mouths don't sync up with the audio which irks me (intentionally it seems). Typically after the character stops talking, his/her mouth is still moving for a second or two. However, this by itself wouldn't bother me if it was my only complaint. \n2) Audio issue with some dialog: With one particular character, it sounded like the audio recording was done over a phone. It seemed off compared to the rest of the characters that I'd encountered so far.\n3) No in-game settings/options: There's no menu option for any kind of settings like audio or key remapping. Can't recall the last time I saw a game without even a basic option menu.\n4) Main character can't move during dialog: While someone is talking, whether it's your character talking to herself/you as she examines items or talking to another character, you aren't able to walk around at all. I can understand it for talking to characters, but it's annoying that I'm frozen while inspecting a random item.\n5) Can't re-examine items in inventory: This one really annoyed me since I can't remember the last time I played a point/click game that didn't let you do this. I picked up a flyer with lots of info on it, but I accidentally clicked off so it went into my inventory before I could read it in full. I tried to right-click on the item from my inventory to re-read it, but the game wouldn't present me with the blown-up flyer again nor did my character even narrate what the item is. The only hint is a tooltip that appears when hovering the item which describes it in about two words (in a font that makes you squint). Luckily in this case the contents of the flyer turned out to not be too important in terms of how it needed to be used, but I had a feeling that this issue could easily get me stuck in the game later on (at least without relying on save points to re-examine items) which made me hesitant to continue playing.\n6) Can't skip dialog using mouse: The only way to skip dialog, which I found by trial and error, is hitting spacebar. And of course since there's no option menu, this can't be re-assigned at all. Space bar for skipping is fairly common, but personally I like being able to play point/click games using only mouse when possible. Considering your character can't even move during dialog, allowing a mouse click to skip seems reasonable. \n7) Examining documents should should be layered over the dialog text options: The first scene in the game has you making a phone call with documents for reference to help manipulate the caller into telling you what you need to hear. When examining a document up close (not the normal inventory items which can't be re-examined as mentioned above), the document is layered behind the dialog options even though you can't select dialog while examining the document. It was slightly annoying trying to read them since I had to keep re-adjusting each document to fit within the available real estate.\n8) Poor feedback when you fail at something: When making that first phone call in the game, there's three pieces of info that you need to extract from the caller - but aside from being told by another character prior to making the call, you never see those objectives again so it was confusing as to which I did wrong/why. Another short scene has you pick-pocketing someone which I was positive that I did right, but it said I failed without any indication of why... felt like it was an impossible task but presented otherwise.\n9) Unmemorable characters: I didn't really like any of the characters in the game that I encountered in my short time playing. Most of them I actually found a bit annoying, including my character who I think I liked the least. I didn't care for her voice acting or even her design (the weird clown make-up on her face, the way she awkwardly walks, and her pants that swallow half her body). In general, even though I'm not exactly sure why, but I found myself not caring about anything that the characters had to say.\n10) Strong start with high expections but quickly dulled: After the first task/puzzle in the game where you had to make that phone call and apply some logic to manipulate the caller, I was really excited to play since it felt like a different experience than most point/click games generally offer. It set the first impression for what kinds of things I'd be doing/solving, but then five minutes later I'm simplistically talking to some old coworker coming up with childish rhymes and haikus so he'll help me with something (despite him previously telling me that he'd never risk his job for someone he just met, but apparently he can be convinced for a rhyme).\n11.

I finished it in about 4 hours. That's with leaving the game running while taking short breaks every once in a while.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nThe beginning of the game starts off very enticing and intriguing. You get to talk to all the characters and learn little unique aspects about them. However about halfway through, the plot seemed to take a turn I wasn't expecting. The missions began losing their sense of seriousness to me. This happened to the characters as well, particularly Turn. I understand his character goes through an internal conflict, but his conflict seemed pretty humorous to me.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nI'm going to break this section up into two sections. There was the length of the game, sense of interaction in the levels and then the actual puzzles themselves.\n\nLength - I finished this game in about four hours. I thought the plot was rushed; I really wanted time to relax and fall in love with the atmosphere of the game by being able to interact with more objects but it didn't have that. It was more : Objective, objective, and objective. By chapter six, the final chapter, I stopped for a moment and said, \"How'd I get here? Wasn't I just applying for this job like 2 and a half hours ago?\" \nHowever, in those four hours, I felt very attached to the, sometimes seemingly, goofy characters. I really want to know what's next for all of them. If a game can manage that, I feel it has done it's job.\n\nInteraction - For the most part, you only get access to the parts of the levels that pretain to the puzzles. I feel like if there were more objects to interact with, reguardless if they pretained to the player's current objective, to make the world feel more real than I would have been more immersed.\n\nPuzzles - The puzzles were amazing. Cudos to the development team for the puzzles. I legitimately was stuck for a while on a lot of them in the later chapters. I really wish there were more honestly because those were my favorite part of the game. \n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nI really loved the graphics. I truly felt the Indie game vibe and thought it was very unique. The water was amazing looking!\n\n[b]Personal Thoughts[/b]\nIf I could reach out to the devs, I would say to continue the amazing work they're doing. I was surprised it was a ten person team during the credits. I would ask for a longer game. I don't think this game is worth the price it is for the length of gameplay - I'm sorry :/. I think there is an amazing game here, but the pacing was too fast. At the end, I felt slightly confused. It ended on what I thought was a good midway climax to the story's plot; there could have been six more chapters.\n\n[b]Overall[/b]\nOverall, The Low Road is a great game for what it is. I became invested in the characters and the world created. I feel like if you are to buy this game, try to do so during a sale (30%-50% off) due to it's short runtime. The puzzles were fantastic. I really hope there is a sequel to expand upon this game.\n\nReally can't wait to see what this company puts out next!\n", "recommendationid": "33847003", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528919", "timestamp_created": 1501212374, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 161, "playtime_forever": 276, "last_played": 1501210691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198082256428"}, "votes_up": 15}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503025893, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A bit expensive on the price point, but this game is great as of 8/17.

Around 5 hours from start to finish, the plot line is a little disjointed in terms of balance. The game is split into 6 chapters, however the first chapter seems more fleshed out than the others, and I would have preferred fewer, more developed divisions. Conversational choices all seem revertable, as there are only two possible outcomes to each fork- the 'right' response which progresses you; or the 'wrong' response(s) that either allow you to reselect until you get the right response, or fail you and return you to the last save point.

The term sounds disingenuous and a little immature but despite that I find the Low Road to be a wonderfully quirky game. It is possessing of an innocent kind of charm and a sense of humor that doesn\u2019t rely on shock value or trying to be over the top. The Low Road is a game about Noomi Kovacs a young woman fresh out of spy school who just entered the work force in the world of corporate espionage. From the very get go the game presents you with a somewhat ridiculous premise and it runs with it. What follows is a charming experience hampered by some odd creative choices.
