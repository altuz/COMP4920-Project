Arcane RERaise, if anything, manages to be worse and more mediocre in every single way than Arcane Raise, even the obscure monetization: It ditches the tradeable Steam marketplace items and makes the cheat item pack be of fairly limited use, but doubles the amount of mutually exclusive DLC characters to 8, while making them even less useful.\n\nMeanwhile, the game still has no original assets, almost no story, a bare minimum of mechanics (2 characters in fixed classes from the first game, all items available from a shop midway through the game), and is just over half an hour long with or without the booster pack, even picking up all chests, which I almost assuredly didn't need to do. At \"best,\" there's one challenging fight, against a Succubus before you are able to access the shop, but noticing that Alex Oriana has Paralysis on his spell list is enough to make that a snap.\n\nTo similarly sum up the entire game as I did for the first: after a tutorial featuring mechanics that don't actually exist in the game (e.g. potential punishment for retreating from fights, vehicles), you are put in front of a castle, told that it's full of \"Infected\" and some NPC's brother is trapped inside (this is never mentioned again), walk up to the castle optionally fighting \"Rates\" (rats) and zombies on your way, as they're now immobile on-map encounters, fight a semi-difficult Succubus, then enter the castle, full of chests full of money and XP, shops selling all of the items in the game, and the exact same glitchy NPC from the first game which lets you fight the final boss at any point - including the same dialogue, which has no bearing on this game's supposed plot. So again: you grab all the chests, buy +attack items at 200 a pop / 99 for 19800, enjoy the sound of consuming items 99 times in a row, then hit the final boss for 4000 damage five or so times. Now you are not a Shade, but a Shade Alpha, despite that not, as far as I can tell, being the premise of the sequel. Also you can uninstall the game now.\n\nOh and you get 36 achievements, probably also all stock art, for starting the game. This time loading a \"DLC character\" savegame doesn't lock you out of the achievements and tutorial, though!\n\nIn conclusion, no. Irredeemable, and somehow worse than the first.", "recommendationid": "33618984", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523959", "timestamp_created": 1500336049, "author": {"num_reviews": 182, "num_games_owned": 2229, "playtime_forever": 65, "last_played": 1500338415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988663774"}, "votes_up": 10}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 14, "total_positive": 5, "review_score": 4}, "success": 1}
