The weird monetization finally improves slightly with the mutually exclusive DLC characters, with there being a somewhat sensible assortment of 6, one of each gender/class combination, while the cheat item pack is about as mediocre as it was in Arcane REraise.\n\nMeanwhile, the game still has no original assets, almost no story, a bare minimum of mechanics (2 characters in fixed classes from the first game, all items available from a shop somewhat early into the game), and is just over half an hour long with or without the booster pack, even picking up all chests, which I almost assuredly didn't need to do. Unlike Arcane RERaise, there's no real challenging fights unless you stumble into the part of the map where Demons and Succubi spawn too quickly.\n\nTo similarly sum up the entire game as I did for the first: after a tutorial featuring mechanics that don't actually exist in the game (e.g. potential punishment for retreating from fights, vehicles) that you have to confirm twice in a row that you want to play through, due to it being copied from the previous games without removing the confirmation screen, you are dumped into a house full of people who turn into zombies and skeletons or explode when you talk to them, get outside, have a second (or third) character join your party, then clear out a large village-style map full of chests of money and XP while occasionally ducking into the shop to buy equipment and +attack items at 200 a pop / 99 for 19800, enjoy the sound of consuming items 99 times in a row, then enter a building marked \"Demon Lair\" and fight the final boss, hitting it for 4000 damage five or so times. Unlike Arcane RERaise, you are actually treated to a new message appropriate to this game for beating the final boss, but it's just \"Congratulations! You have defeated the boss.\"\n\nOh, and you get 36 achievements, probably also all stock art, once you get out of the house full of zombies.\n\nIn conclusion, no. Still irredeemable, and the last of this series I've ended up with a copy of, because I learned my lesson and the Occult Raise games appear to be even worse.", "recommendationid": "34384236", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509663", "timestamp_created": 1503271122, "author": {"num_reviews": 182, "num_games_owned": 2229, "playtime_forever": 64, "last_played": 1503271954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988663774"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499792631, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 10, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Same thing like the previous series.
