It is a fun game, but I have yet to see a \"combo\" of any sort nor have i encountered a challenge. Before I even got to the third area I was able to afford a sword that can kill everything from a distance. It is a lot of fun, still, but then I get stuck in the environment. When I reload my game, I am in a different area (I knew this would happen and was not worried) but then I was stuck by a story-lock and unable to progress in the game. I've only played the game an hour so far, but it was not so fun that I would want to replay that hour.", "recommendationid": "35013465", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507004", "timestamp_created": 1505620532, "author": {"num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 275, "playtime_forever": 60, "last_played": 1505620998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025400985"}, "votes_up": 4}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 17, "total_positive": 14, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
