If you're a fan of horror games and don't have any weird hang ups about Unity, this is definitely a title to check out.  \n\nI had no idea what I was getting into and I honestly hated it at first because I tried to rush around and didn't really take a couple minutes to learn the game. Once I had a bit more patience with it, I found it to be a lot of fun and I also enjoyed the little story. \n\nIt was a little awkward until I got the hang of the way things worked but overall I enjoyed it and felt like I got my money's worth. I look forward to hopefully seeing more games like this from these Devs.\n\nMy only complaint is that the voice over didn't really jive with me. It wasn't poor acting or reading or anything. Just something about it kinda rubbed me the wrong way.  Maybe that's not a bad thing? I mean, it is a horror game after all.  :)", "recommendationid": "33955112", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506948", "timestamp_created": 1501613277, "author": {"num_reviews": 89, "num_games_owned": 911, "playtime_forever": 219, "last_played": 1502578562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997678124"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500079714, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I'm extremely happy this game kept calling me back. Having read reviews I made sure to keep my camera charged and I figured out I could look through my invetory while the charger did its thing, also I could look around. This game is slower paced than some and I got stumped a few times (plus I missed a ton of stuff according to my invetory) but I really enjoyed myself.
