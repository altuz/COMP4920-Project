So I might be a little bias but here it is... (please note, im not far in the game)\n\n\nThe art style is awesome with really beautiful cutsenes and colour. Level design is not amazing but it still is pretty ok. The game's level design is hard though. The controls are pretty good on a controller, Disapointingly, you cant customize controlls on the PC. \n\nThe Game is a little finicky and glitchy but im told that will get updated and patched. A major glitch i found is the fact that you can controll randal when the black fade in is happening. Which makes it so that you can pass some electronic fences without being hurt by them.\n\nRandall is almost a little too responsive in that its easy to get killed by touching the electricity without meaning to even go near it. The joy stick is a big fault, even with a slight touch, randall responds greatly.\n\nI like the beat 'em up aspect and fighting in the game because its not too hard but not too easy. I am nowhere near a pro gamer but for a casual gamer, the fighting is good\n\na little bit of punctuation mistakes (not really important though)\n\nOverall, the game has great potential and so far has been pretty good. Just keep in mind that companies that aren't known famously are usually bashed. Also games that aren't AAA games are bashed aswell. So developers, good job. hopefully you can the bugs in a later update.", "recommendationid": "32296477", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500557", "timestamp_created": 1497027634, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 69, "playtime_forever": 49, "last_played": 1497028857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198136814236"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496767640, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 38, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "works poorly on controller", "recommendationid": "32223341", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.428284", "timestamp_created": 1496767640, "author": {"num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 106, "playtime_forever": 47, "last_played": 1496767514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198141623600"}, "votes_up": 10}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
