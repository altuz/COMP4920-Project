You do not even get a warning to prepare and are never informed about this boss in the tutorial. The tutorial could be better but that isn't why I am writing this review. I hate to be negative but this game has some big flaws. I hope that it improves so I can change my view. I only currently have .6 hours because I have no current intrest to play the game anymore. P.S. I could only use the tutorial map and don't understand why they had the other maps locked?", "recommendationid": "34362236", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501661", "timestamp_created": 1503189159, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_forever": 38, "last_played": 1503188246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198273165445"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499852687, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "i love tower defence games, and has collected a lot, so i could not pass this one as well:\nfirst thing this game differs from any other you might have been played is design:\nits made of clean and minimalistic hexagons - pure tower defense experience without lots of redundant and excessive\npixels :)\nnext thing - in this game you have bosses, that can destroy a core you are defending immediately -\nand, of course you have lots of different towers, upgrades, enemies, levels, tasks and all these for exxxtremely low price ))", "recommendationid": "33475618", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489362", "timestamp_created": 1499852687, "author": {"num_reviews": 240, "num_games_owned": 2596, "playtime_forever": 30, "last_played": 1499851918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198110829497"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
