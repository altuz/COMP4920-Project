The best 50 cent i've spent in a long time.\n\nThe playtime is rather short and its graphics are simple, but you can feel the developer made this game with all of his passion.  \n\nI also enjoyed the voice-acting with that very heavy german/swiss accent as it fits to the story.\n\nThis is a real gem and its easily worth 10x the price. \n\n\n+++", "recommendationid": "34898403", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "timestamp_created": 1505212015, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 174, "playtime_forever": 255, "last_played": 1505149551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198111518750"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504666093, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I was actually pleasantly surprised with this game. The puzzles make you think and sometimes are a bit difficult, but not to the extent that it becomes irritating. There are no cheap jump scares which I was also quite a fan of, and the game maintains a certain ominous and creepy vibe throughout, as you progress through the levels.\nWhile there are no jump scares, per say, you still have to deal with things following or chasing you while you attempt to figure out puzzles, which can be a bit annoying until you figure things out, but overall doesn't take away from the experience of the game. That being said, my favorite part is trying to find my way through a claustrophobic labyrinth while being perused by the creatures within.\nOverall, you can easily get 3-4 hours of entertainment out of this game for less than a dollar. In my opinion, that is very much worth supporting these devs. I hope to see more from them at some point.", "recommendationid": "34768481", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501365", "timestamp_created": 1504666093, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 269, "playtime_forever": 301, "last_played": 1504757854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198037921744"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 8, "total_positive": 8, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
