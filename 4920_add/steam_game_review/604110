I very much hope someday it will become one, though.\n\nYou should not buy it unless you specifically want to support the devs.\n\nThe store page calls this \"an early alpha proof of concept\", and it's barely that. I've only got 1h played, and I'm pretty sure I've seen everything there is to see, and that's stretching it. I forced myself to \"play\" a fair while after there was nothing to do, just to see if there was something I was missing; there wasn't.\n\nI absolutely love what the devs are trying to do with this title, and the planned features certainly sound interesting. I love the art style and the music, but in its present state, there's just... nothing there. There's no content. There's no \"game\". This is not even a demo.\n\nIf you buy this game, you're buying a dream, you're funding a wish. It might become something. It might not.\n\nIf you like the idea of what it might become, go ahead and consider giving the devs your money.

You are given a passport kit that allows to (finally!?) travel outside of your country and monthly allowances that, if used wisely, make your trips less hitchhiking-esque. Isn't this a dream for everyone who sets his/her/their eyes on what's beyond the tiny bubble called \"home\"? Anyway, you can post on your blog with what I believe to be automatically generated hashtags whenever you travel to a city or spend a good few days there. Though I'm on the rather wary side when it comes social media and often its accompanied whiny, imbecilic \"commentators,\" here in the game you can't steer away from it. This is supposed to be a casual, relaxing game where you go to different places and meet people, the interactions mostly being enjoyable, but the reality is that you can't do much other than click on the name of your destination, fast forward as you travel, and then spend a few days there while basically nothing happens, which makes posting on your blog to get followers one of the only few goals and perhaps the most important goal of the game. But the followers mean nothing but a number to you--there's no interaction or impact at all whatsoever--and, after the first few posts, choosing hashtags becomes a chore.\n\nI understand that the game is still in early access, which is why I'm giving it a tentative yes.The premise is interesting and there is just so much potential in what it can be that I'd be sad to see it fail.", "recommendationid": "34421157", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485849", "timestamp_created": 1503425501, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 221, "playtime_forever": 18, "last_played": 1503336078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002265986"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503323964, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 7, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "Cool music, cool graphics.
