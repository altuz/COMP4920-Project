Or classic shooters of the like? Well made maps, the option to pull up a barebones map for an idea of where you were, interesting stages and usefull weapons. Challenging mobs and fast paced gameplay. This is none of these things and more.\n\nMy wife thinks me a moron, she asks me all the time, \"Why do you buy these shitty 1 dollar games, then get mad when the shitty 1 dollar game is shit. You dolt.\" I know what this is, and hate everything about it. From the copy-paste halls and low visuals made the mindset of a runa nd gun more of a waiting and kiting game. Mobs spawn in the CHEAPEST places. Behind doors around corners. Bodyblocking and rushing adds that stand for 10 seconds and flood in a direct line to be pegged off one at a time. \n\nShitty weapon placement and no means of knowing where said weapons are. Boss pulls tend to \"replace\" your weapons for whatever reason. I had a minigun swapped out for a shotgun during a boss pull which actually killed me from the lack of DPS. Bulletsponge fights with no cover, you either exploit a door for hits, overheath the boss by disecting the map collecting packs or pull the boss, leave and find the minigun and cheap the game. 3-4 asset models, 2 kinds of mobs. Every map looks the same with no indication of how to find any exits. \n\nIt just falls short on every bracket. I dont care about the badges or achievements for this game, Im having no joy in this, it is a chore. A slow paced pre-planned joke of code and pixels. I had decent hopes, it looked fine, throwback style shooter but it is so fuckng cheap in having more mobs than ammo in certain maps, the forced weapon switches and barely functioning AI made this less a journey into the past, but a realization everything I ever liked or enjoyed as a child will be destroyed for capitalism.", "recommendationid": "34397864", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510922", "timestamp_created": 1503331263, "author": {"num_reviews": 161, "num_games_owned": 1376, "playtime_forever": 822, "last_played": 1503373959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044229474"}, "votes_up": 11}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502945453, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 16, "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Co-Co CORN MAFIA is a old classic, with a dense and detailed world full of secrets to discover.", "recommendationid": "34300046", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506860", "timestamp_created": 1502945453, "author": {"num_reviews": 467, "num_games_owned": 6186, "playtime_forever": 644, "last_played": 1502774633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198037796318"}, "votes_up": 16}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503839535, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I always suspected u.... corn flakes.....", "recommendationid": "34278361", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495625", "timestamp_created": 1502897350, "author": {"num_reviews": 108, "num_games_owned": 622, "playtime_forever": 8, "last_played": 1502897248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198272538113"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502787824, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 11, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "this game has reminded me good old first person shooter that started the genre - Wolfenstein 3D made in 1992 by id Software ))) even keyboard controls without help of mouse was typical for that times; mouse support appeared later, i can even remember playing network match of Quake I with a guy that played on keyboard faster and better than many with mouse just because he already got used to.\nif you ever feel nostalgy, if you ever want to show to someone how games in 90s looked - remember this title.", "recommendationid": "34252093", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483866", "timestamp_created": 1502787824, "author": {"num_reviews": 240, "num_games_owned": 2596, "playtime_forever": 65, "last_played": 1502752944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198110829497"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 6, "total_reviews": 7, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
