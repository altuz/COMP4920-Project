The game, in my opinon, should be free. It's not worth money. It's not inherently bad, I mean it's competently put together and I only found one bug (walking through the bannisters of the house onto the wall banners) in my short playthrough. However it is meant to be a horror game but it falls far short of being scary at all. To me horror is all about sound. If I watch Lights Out or The Grudge or any horror film and replace the music with the Benny Hill theme song it won't be scary at all and that's basically what this game does. It lacks any real sound design. Also it's story is just cliche at best and filled with 'guess what the developer is thinking' puzzles which infuriate me, but you may enjoy that. It's all down to personal taste.\n\nIf this game had been free to gauge what could be done better next time I'd be more forgiving but it's being sold for money and therefore open to more harsher criticism I find. Developer please check out other RPGMaker Horror games and see how they do it better and for free even ala The Witch's House.\n\nTLDR - Sound design is balls and therefore the horror never appears.
