The game has beautiful graphics which keep you drawn into it and the music keeps the action alive, not to mention the music which plays during the final seconds of each match that get your palms sweaty.  During the hour I played so far i encountered various different game modes which i thought were very thought out and personally I think having a game where the developers show this kind of commitment to it is another draw because it just shows that they are willing to improve and add onto the game and not just drop it like so many other games i've played before have been.

The concept is inginuitive and fun,  music is good,   (although it's really just one song on loop the whole time), the weapons all feel different and are very imaginitive and there's plenty of game modes. Now the issues. I gave this game a negative review not because I feel the concept is bad, but simply because it does not come with enough content to justify even a  $10 price tag. Although there are 4 or 5 different game modes and maps, they all feel rather similar and repetitive. Add that to the fact that the servers are ALWAYS EMPTY. This is not an exageration. Normally the only region with a servor even running is the eastern U.S. servor, and that normally has one or two people and the rest filled with bots. For a game based on online PvP, the is not a good sign. Also there's just general bugs and lag, such as when you shoot someone and then they die a second later instead of right after you shot them. This game is a great concept! It just needs more content (like more guns) and a bigger community. I very well may change my review in the future if these needs are met.", "recommendationid": "35481598", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1507155708, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 19, "playtime_forever": 129, "last_played": 1507154388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 129, "steamid": "76561198153557302"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1507080943, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I guess no one has time to play this game.\n\nIt's fun but no one is playing.", "recommendationid": "35441488", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1507026182, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 19, "last_played": 1506169578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "steamid": "76561198096267465"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505431755, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Add single player please.", "recommendationid": "34959809", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505455", "timestamp_created": 1505431755, "author": {"num_reviews": 117, "num_games_owned": 375, "playtime_forever": 169, "last_played": 1505786822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983613557"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 25, "num_reviews": 9, "total_reviews": 177, "total_positive": 152, "review_score": 8}, "success": 1}
