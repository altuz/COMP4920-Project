His name is THANKCREATE, born on November 1990. This game is his personal experience. Four different people represent four stage of his life. [/h1]\n\nHis high school life study in Huanggang Middle School, A key high school of China. He would like to be educated in Tsinghua University. However, his result in NCEE is not as ideal. He finally got a ticket to learn in HuaZhong University of Science & Technology-School of Software Engineering.\nWhen year2 in University, He was affected by his classmate and decided to join the New team of his university, Team Dian. He worked in a group of international project cooperation. He had totally changed his school life after attended this group. Other than the normal daily activities such as attending lessons, kicking the football, playing games and sleeping, he has to concentrate on project development until late at night, so that he can return back to the dormitory.\nIn year3, he studied in a key class of School of Electronic Information and Communications instead of previous one.\nHe gave up the opportunity of becoming a postgraduate before graduating from undergraduate.\nWhen campus recruitment, He sends his resumes to Tencent, Baidu, and Taobao, Tencent and Baidu accept his application. Which one would he choose? He chooses Baidu without hesitation because he thought Tencent is a \u2018copycat\u2019 company. And later what he see and hear, his thought with these two company have completely different than before.\n\n[h1] On October 2012. He resigned from Baidu, he only worked 3 months though.\n\"I can learn something from here but I as an aspiring youth who has just graduated should do something else which is more meaningful.\n\nSomeone always tries to tell us what we should do or not.\n\nWhen studying, a teacher tells him that you need to read more book. You won't have time to read after work. However, he can still read some book every day.\n\nWhen he before graduating, he has found a survey result. It shows that a programmer who has just graduated can get \uffe54000~\uffe56000 every month.(around 600USD~900USD) However, his salary is more than that.\n\nWhen work, lots of people express their experience that a graduate shouldn't try to start their own business. However, THANKCREAT successes and he don't think it is difficult.\n\nHe wants to work on gaming in the future. [/h1]\n\n\"I was pretty narcissism. I thought that I am a creative game developer. I always ridiculed that I am an artist with my friend before. However, after watching <Indie Game: The Movie>, the oversea developer is a real artist.\"\n\nHe earns lots of money through <Strange Adventure>  though, he thinks this game is a bit odd. Its style is not very good. \"If I can make an indie game like <Super Meat Boy> or <Fez>, I will be contentment.\n\nAlthough THANKCREAT is a programmer, he buys a tablet and starts to learn how to draw by himself. He spends 5 hours every day. He is doing this for a 'more artistic' game.\n\n[h1] That why Another Adventure appears in our sight.
