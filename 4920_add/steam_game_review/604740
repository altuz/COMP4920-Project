For now, I will say, pick it up ...but if it's on a steam sale, DEFINITELY pick it up.", "recommendationid": "35190721", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500810", "timestamp_created": 1506286606, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 246, "playtime_forever": 151, "last_played": 1506286357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 97, "steamid": "76561198072007286"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504883801, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "poo game.
