Game Graphics are decent and sound is kinda good but nothing special. Before you start playing game you can choose between Kid or Logic mode, If you choose other mode (the one You didn't start), game levels will reset and after You return to previous mode you need to start again all over again. I'm not recommending this game because it's horrible  with bad controls. Do not buy this game full price, either you buy it on sale or with -90% coupon to expand your library.\n\n\nRating: 3/10", "recommendationid": "34467552", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512378", "timestamp_created": 1503607369, "author": {"num_reviews": 113, "num_games_owned": 604, "playtime_forever": 125, "last_played": 1504381399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198129417648"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501937815, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Complete garbage.", "recommendationid": "34037603", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501704", "timestamp_created": 1501937815, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 190, "playtime_forever": 92, "last_played": 1502025192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079378242"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502217698, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "overall just feels like a game that was translated from chinese using google translate", "recommendationid": "34109514", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496942", "timestamp_created": 1502217698, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 33, "playtime_forever": 138, "last_played": 1504989063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198255604116"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501861351, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "\"Well, in conclusion, some might say that there are redeeming factors to this game. The music\u2019s pretty cool, and the graphics are nice and colorful. Some might call it a mixed bag. But let me tell you what kind of mixed bag. It\u2019s a trash bag that\u2019s had a bad day. Like, say your mom cleans out the cat litter. Fresh and stale doody pebbles go right in the bottom of the bag. And then your sister throws out her used tampons, and where do they go? In the same bag. And then your brother comes home, piss-ass drunk, just upchucks, pukes right into the bag...\n\nNow, I\u2019m not trying to be disgusting, but that is a realistic situation, and what it all comes down to, THAT'S A NASTY BAG. But I\u2019d rather take that shit out to the garbage than deal with this piece of fuck! Fuck this game, get out of my face!\"\n\n--- Angry Video Game Nerd", "recommendationid": "34018457", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496942", "timestamp_created": 1501861351, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 74, "playtime_forever": 7, "last_played": 1501861290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198120329890"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 7, "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 10, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 4}, "success": 1}
