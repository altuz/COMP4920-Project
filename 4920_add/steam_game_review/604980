I played the latest casual game released and it made me want to buy every game in the series.  These are really good!  They even made me a better match 3 player.  This game was slightly easier, but it made me feel like a better puzzle player and let's not forget the epic moment of constantly blowing stuff up around the screen.  Never a dull moment!  Thank you for making these games. :)))", "recommendationid": "34158611", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "timestamp_created": 1502414200, "author": {"num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 125, "playtime_forever": 429, "last_played": 1502414699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198207083779"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
