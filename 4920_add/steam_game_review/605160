The game's strange save system and a glitch preventing me from progressing on level 3 are why I don't recommend the game overall, despite enjoying the game quite a bit.\n\nPerfect Plan has a story with full voice-acting, albeit voice acting in English with heavy accents and a fair amount of the dialog can come off over the top / unintentionally (?) funny. That being said, it's nice that there is effort being put in to tell a story, with cutscenes and dialog. The cutscenes, however, are very simplistic consisting of little more than gates / doors opening and things being blown open. Sometimes the cutscene during dialog / opening the next path is as simple as the camera spinning around and then an explosion effect occuring somewhere. \n\nThe levels are varied and include infiltrating a shipping area and then navigating along a moving train, but your tasks will never consist of too much complexity beyond clearing rooms and walking up to various terminals to press E on them. The 3 guns you are given at the start of each level seem random. You see some variety in the guns, however beyond their rate of fire being a bit faster or slower and slight changes to the damage output there is no customization of the weapons (i.e. no attachments and you're never given the option of which 3 you begin a level with)\n\nAnnoyingly there is no UI indicator of how many bullets you have remaining in a clip. You have no skills to unlock for the main character and there is no stat leveling of any kind, just you and the base fire rates / damage outputs of the guns. The enemies have some variety including crab-like mine enemies and android / turret type enemies, but the enemies you encounter most frequently have a very simplistic \"two rectangles stacked on top of one another with an optical eye on top\" look to them, and if they occur as frequent as early in the game I could see it becoming repetitive. \n\nThe soundtrack to the game fluctuates wildly between hip hop esque beats to a strange, almost out-of-place relaxed feeling guitar melody (which actually becomes quite immersive and gives the game a strange light-hearted feel early on) during the opening level. The sound effects to the guns are nice and loud / laser-y though, and seeing their lighting effects as you blast at dudes is nice. \n\nThere is an unfortunate glitch halting me from progressing around the third level, and nearly the only reason I don't suggest the game right now. I encounter the glitch when I drop down a long shaft to face off against two large blue enemies covered in video screens at the bottom. They seem impossible to beat as there is no cover to get behind and their attacks do a ton of damage if they connect at all. When I inevitably die in this encounter, I am then loaded into a dark/empty play area and can move around using the mouse but nothing else... Because of this, I'm forced to reload the level from the beginning to try to hopefully clear all of the rooms until I get to the aforementioned 2 blue enemies and hope to beat them somehow.\n\nThe checkpoint system in the game is pretty unforgiving and annoying as well, with no player-determined savepoints, you're forced to retread the same areas you may have cleared previously. For example, let's say you cleared 5 of 10 rooms on your way through a level. If you die on room 6 you are then strangely thrown to the very start of the level to run from room 1 all the way to room 6 again, rather than starting right at room 6. Rooms 2-5 will be empty of all enemies you've killed, presenting no challenge (nor reasaon to go through them again, really) but you're thrown clear back to the beginning to just run through the empty areas until you reach where you haven't yet progressed for some reason. \n \nThe game lets you pick whichever chapter to begin from as well, for better or worse. I personally hate when games do this as I think it kills a lot of your sense of progression through a linear campaign, although I guess this may be a way I can experience more of the game outside of the glitched area from the first chapter.\n\nThe game includes a strange \"Self Harm\" button by pressing U, which I don't understand the purpose of other than maybe to trigger a checkpoint to reload should you find yourself stuck in the level somewhere??? Otherwise its inclusion seems very strange. During the brief tutorial section of the game you're told E is to interact with things and then immediately after told to press K to interact with a computer screen. The controller support for the game (for Xbox One USB controller) is very minimal with only aiming, shooting, and jumping being implemented. No reload button, no switch weapons button, no turn on/off flashlight button when compared to the Mouse and Keyboard. \n\nPerfect Plan is a simple game that has its charm and will appeal most to diehard fans of first person shooters and neon/geometric style design. To its credit, I can't say I have played a game that has this kind of visual look. The game is very straightforward and many may find its limited budget off-putting, with levels mostly consisting of taking out enemies on your way from point A to point B, whether that just be an exit you walk through or walking up to a button and pressing E on it. The varied locales and unique graphical style are what make me enjoy this game the most, but its unfortunate checkpoint / saving seems buggy and sparse.", "recommendationid": "34364200", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "timestamp_created": 1503198699, "author": {"num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 800, "playtime_forever": 38, "last_played": 1503199789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173606567"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
