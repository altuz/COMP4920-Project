I'm not sure what to make of the writing. At times it's well thought-out, and other times missed the mark. Many various typos, but I'm willing to forgive that on the basis that the spoken text is all in Russian, though I am thankful that someone even included an English translation (it could still use some improvement). But, don't take this criticism too harshly, it's mostly minor. Overall, a really interesting story underneath some of the minor flaws. I think some have argued that Isanami (and what I find really odd about this game is the use of Oriental names when the  voice actors speak in Russian, yet the text is in English. I suppose it's entirely possible that the creators were heavily influenced by Asian anime. I have to say the characters were very interesting. At first it seems like it's a little shallow when you first start the story, but by the middle of the visual novel it really picks up (esp by chapter 6). I loved the fact that if you save it before the end and do not over-write that save, you can see at least 5 endings, save up your gallery points and get the 200+ alternate ending, you get a rather neutral ending, which is um very steamy to say the least.\n\nI'm probably one of the few women who would actually admit to enjoying an anime-style like this, but I suppose it was the theme that ultimately drew me in, something about demons, angels and vampires (well not to mention angel hunters). I have to admit, strange concepts to meld together but somehow they do work. I got mostly good endings with most characters except Akira (figures), I'm trying to figure out how to get his good ending, as I had a rather unfortunate bad ending LOL, but well good or bad endings, it's all fairly enjoyable really. I suppose Hideki or your psychology friend would actually make more sense (on the endings, but it's all rather a personal choice). Personally, I find Sadao (which I think is Japanese for Sadist haha) is interesting, at least he never 'put on airs' with Isanami, he didn't lie like Akira or Yuki did (those two together make for a frightening pair, even though Yuki always insists he 'loves' Isanami, but the truth is, if it was true he wouldn't let Akira use her ...I don't know he always seems to share with his brother. On a basic level,  suppose they would be 'hot vampires' but after seeing the bad ending for Akira it felt a little more wrong, partly because things promised to Isanami were not honored). And in a weird way Sadao is the only out of the 5 who actually has you confront your fears to possibly rid you of them (unlike the vampires who are mostly just self-serving), he's at least smart enough to know that if you always live in the past, you deny yourself a present and possibly future. It was also very heart-breaking to learn your mother tried to kill you in a schizophrenic state...sad, and later your friend tells you he thinks you might be having delusions like her (while schizo disorder does often pass in families, there is no guarantee it'll pass directly onto child, it can skip generations and you might also get it from a uncle, aunt or distant relative, but I sorta could see where the story was going). I was more neutral with the psychologist friend, but still managed a good ending (while him giving you a car at the end was generous & him hinting at possible relationship, but I didn't see him offering marriage, so I wasn't sure if I got the best possible ending with him [though I fear he lacks as much passion as the others, but he genuinely seemed to be the one anchor in the story]. I could see myself playing this again, though after the first run through, some other people should have opened at least 5 or 6 endings. I'm missing about 4, plus some gallery photo content, so at least that gives me incentive to play it again (only I'm a little confused how to get the other endings. I suppose I need to make Hideki,Yuki, and Sadao dislike me to get their bad endings, and somehow figure out how to get Akira to like me (which is hard because of his harsh personality), & I'm not sure if there is a bad ending with the psychologist guy, technically I got mad at him when he suggested I go into the hospital which I thought would be the bad choice, I guess next time I could just agree but I don't see how that would incite the bad ending for him? \n\nI guess some men and women might be on the fence about a visual novel like this, on a thriller scale, it's pretty intense, if this were a real anime the dream sequences would certainly seem Lovecraftian, just with hot guys instead of monsters LOL, as much of the game has you feeling like you really have no choices (except for which guy to choose), though at a few points you are given options to resist. I think the main reason Akira didn't like me, was I tried to slap him, but who could blame me, he came across as arrogant and brutish (but not even brutish in the honest way that Sadao was but in the manipulative way the vampire brothers came across). I realize this game was still probably marketed at males, but it's hard to find visual novels females might be interested in too (in fact I think there's only 2 or 3 on steam, & this one seemed one of the better options). I admit, this game being on sale did help me give it a try, as it's clear alot of time was put into it (I agree with what someone said about this game could use a few achievements, even just 5 & most of that could be related to which guy you chose at the end,the psych. guy or trying to choose none of them, or perhaps a steam card if you used your points to open up the alternate ending. But, that's also small potatoes I guess, if you ever make a Theory of Fear 2, it would be an interesting ride I think. Hot stories, but I like that there is some attention to character and back-story. Side note: It was interesing to hear the Russian voices, but for the sake of understanding to English speakers, it would be nice if at some future point you could add English voice actors, or perhaps if that is too time consuming, adding English voice speakers to a 2nd game in the future. I don't think you need to get rid of the Russian, as I'm sure that would upset a few native speakers, but it would be nice to be able to toggle between the two, while I enjoying reading some English speakers might find it more enjoyable to hear the English accents (many men complain about time requirements to reading LOL, sad but true). I do think the guy voice actor was very sexy sounding, well even the female accent too, so it could appeal in a general sense. Just something to keep in mind for the future, but overall a steamy story that still manages a decent (or shall I say indecent) haha story, but some of the endings have that mutual feeling, while others do not. At least there is variety, and I could see it appealing to many types of people out there (except maybe Lesbians of course, they might argue that Isanami is too passive, though in reality she isn't always (there are a few times she is given the option to fight back or flee, it's just that the 'demons' are often stronger, & even if the will is great to resist, sometimes 'fate' happens as it will. I think it was highly interesting that Hideki commented in a back-story of Isanami that she was the possible cause for their meeting, when her parents died, she was lonely and sad...she somehow 'willed' Hideki to appear, though she didn't know who would come, just that it was 'someone' who could help her feel better than her awkward & confusing feelings. That was an interesting sub-plot I felt. I also feel, it was important in Hideki's story if you choose to look at the ring, he'll either say you can ask about past precedings with him, or ask him about the ring (eventually you still learn the ring has runes that tie you to Hideki once you put it on) but for some reason I was more interested to learn at what other time did you possibly meet Hideki; few can refuse a mystery I think.", "recommendationid": "34565384", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504617", "timestamp_created": 1503966601, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 80, "playtime_forever": 133, "last_played": 1503937023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053014242"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500252554, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I played 1 good, 1 bad and the neutral ending so far, and I really liked them all. The artwork and music is good. The english translation could be a bit better, but its still okay.

I like the story and all of the characters, I know they are supposed to be, well, not nice, but I cannot help it. I have to admit the game is kinda weird, and you really really should be into kinky stuff. Probably kinky is not enough - there will be some serious violent stuff and if you are not okay with that, please do not play it, for it would be quite disturbing. For me, I even found loads of romance, too,  but I would not compare it with usual Otomes at all...

I have most of steam in my library. This one definately stands out from all the rest. This game might be a trigger for some people, so be aware. There is sadism and aggro dom type behaviors from a couple of the guys. The game can be dark, but thats something that sets it apart from the others. A lot of otomes have the same underlieng process and the same types of guys. The eldest, the flirt, the smartie, the youngest, the angsty one. And you pick one and blah blah blah.\n\nI personally enjoyed this game a lot. I have to say my favorite is Sadao! [spoiler] Everything he does seems like hes just fucking with you but really, he's doing it to help you. He tries to make you overcome your fears and get stronger. [/spoiler] Anyway, that just might be my mental spin on this. I'm also in the kink community :P , so my perspective might be different than the average conservative. \n\nIf you try this game, Yes. There are rapey type bits, so be wary if it's a trigger. If youre into kink, I think you'll love the game. :D  \n\n<3", "recommendationid": "33537263", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498663", "timestamp_created": 1500043372, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_forever": 405, "last_played": 1500013122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198110375027"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499474851, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I haven't finished all the routes and I'm debating if I should or not.
