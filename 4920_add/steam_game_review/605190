It is well suited for romantics old and young alike, just the sort of thing to sit-down to - with a cup of tea and a cake!\nIf I have a critisim, it is with the 'snap-shots' or 'Gallery', it would be nice to slide-show or scroll through them, as one would through a photo-album.\n\nBut just a minute, don't the girls get a turn?  What about a Getaway Island 2? The cantankerous Rochester or Darcy, vociferous over the demise of his dinner-jacket, then the lean Geek trying to dry-out his hand-held single-board, who would be quite good-looking if it wasn't for the damaged prescription-glasses, finally the native, 'one-with-nature' 6' 6\" golden-tanned muscular overly-edowed Adonis named Karl - wearing just a skimpy leather-loincloth, who's only lines of english are heavily Germanic in accent, and all end in 'YAH, eest Goot Yah!\n", "recommendationid": "31524286", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494571", "timestamp_created": 1493819041, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_forever": 1065, "last_played": 1502302562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198239998632"}, "votes_up": 8}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
