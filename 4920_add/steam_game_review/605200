Just take five minutes to read the help menu and your on your way.  Not that being of easy gameplay, means that it will be easy to have a victory in your hands!  Plan ahead before you move (no undo option) and move wisely!  With some thinking and a bit of dice luck, you just might pull it off!\n\nOverall it\u00b4s fun and a challenge to play without brainstorming you with options or rules. Just plan and move chits, just like you always enjoyed to do.  A nice addition to Steam and my collection!", "recommendationid": "33541061", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510425", "timestamp_created": 1500054762, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 117, "playtime_forever": 504, "last_played": 1500384559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057176049"}, "votes_up": 4}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
