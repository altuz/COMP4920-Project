Cluckles' Adventure is a platformer game that is a \"Collect number of [X] and exit the level\" type. If you played games like Life of Pixel, it's similar to that but with Chicks. At least in this one, you can actually defeat enemies but one hit from them and you start over the level again, although in the game you can gain shields and helmets to be better well-defended. Chicks can be hidden in levels so you have to find hidden walls and etc to collect them to get a \"Perfect\" on it. The Soundtrack sounds nice and retro-ish. \n\nWhen I beat this game, I will give a better and more thorough review but I can say that you can enjoy this if you like \"Collecting [X] to beat level\" platformers and casual games to kill some time.

I'll leave it as a positive review that highlights the games weak points.\n\nI am enjoying playing through Cluckles' Adventure, the controls are tight and movement and attacking feels very fluid. However as I have gotten to the third set of levels, its flaws are standing out more and more.\n\n-When Cluckles falls, she plummets like a rock. This has lead to many deaths when I need to jump over a hazard and can't react before she falls to her death.\n\n-There are several types of enemies and hazards that throw projectiles. Often they will attack the split second that the screen scrolls onto them leading to a cheap and unavoidable death. \n\n-In the first two worlds, secret walls are hinted at by placement of a butterfly hovering around in the area. But in the third world, there are many secrets that have no butterfly which means I have to hump every wall, floor and ceiling until I find the one that leads to a hidden room.\n\n-and finally a minor issue, the level select screen is very slow to navigate with a controller, it's far quicker to use the mouse to get to the level I want to play.", "recommendationid": "32913356", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1498628459, "author": {"num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 6017, "playtime_forever": 420, "last_played": 1498677927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992566038"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492911928, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Entertaining cute little game where you play as a chicken and save little chickies and kill evil slugs, skeletons, etc. Very simple and pleasing gameplay with cute graphics :D Also very fun to speedrun, especially with the leaderboards and in-game timer :)", "recommendationid": "31192171", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1492402014, "author": {"num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 122, "playtime_forever": 1376, "last_played": 1499366912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198072709112"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1491921939, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Visually pleasing.", "recommendationid": "31079308", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492869", "timestamp_created": 1491921939, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 185, "playtime_forever": 58, "last_played": 1495359746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007469857"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1491850405, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Its a very astheticly pleasing game the musics is good. The game is set up in a stage by stage format where if you die you are taken back to the start of the stage and there is a really smooth flow eel to the game. Now for the complaints, the controls are a bit weird and arent't told to you so you have to press keys untill you find out which ones you can use. The nice flow of the game is ruined by the need to take you hand of the controlls to use the mouse to go to the next stage.
