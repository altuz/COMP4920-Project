It is not an action game but does provide a pretty epic feel during the opening and later part of the game (though, short). Voice acting is kinda bad but decent at other times, but there are small moments towards the end of the game that are really cool to experience in VR, because you're not just watching a story being told, you're experiencing the central characters journey and emotions, that although are not anything exceptional, it still has an impact to experiencing it as the character does.\n\nMusic and sound effects are great and if you can stick past the first half of the game and not go into it expecting an action adventure game, it's a pretty decently put together, story-driven VR experience that is rare right now.

Pretty much everything you do is inconsequential, to the point that the game feels like an extended tutorial for an actual game.  More of a slightly interactive experience than a game.\n\nIt's really only a 90 minute experience or so, so as far as value proposition goes, there are far better options available, but at the end of the day, if you're someone who invested into a full VR setup, it's an experience that's worth the $10 or whatever.  At the end of the day, I do reccomend it.  The graphics are among the best I've seen, you get a variety of controls, and the story is enough to keep your interest for the time it takes to get through it.\n\nIff the developers add a reasonable amount of content to the base setup work they've done, they could have a AAA hit, it's that well done.", "recommendationid": "33357179", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503388", "timestamp_created": 1499469140, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_forever": 115, "last_played": 1498966761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035249326"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 16, "total_positive": 11, "review_score": 5}, "success": 1}
