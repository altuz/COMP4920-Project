While it was only $1.09 CAD I feel that it's not put together in a very aesthetic fashion. Mechanically, it sort of works. But I'm talking how it actually LOOKS AND FEELS. And it doesn't look or feel very good at all.\n\nOctomber. Yeah. That was an actual typo. I can forgive most things, but that is really, really bad. Not to mention the very poor english all throughout. Seriously, people: get someone to proofread your stuff and help clean up your scripts. It's becoming the norm, not the exception, for RPGMaker games.\n\n+Low Price Point\n...Yeah, that's about all I've got.\n\n=Hunger and Thirst Meters are well-implemented, however, they seem to tick rather quickly.\n=Poor grammar. Again, Octomber...\n=The constant heartbeat starts to get annoying.\n\n-Game starts in Full Screen with no way to change it (F3 makes it smaller, but still Full Screen)\n-No way to actually quit the game without hitting Ctrl+Alt+Del. Quitting in-game just takes you back to the title screen, and literally NOTHING I did there, aside from CAD, caused the game to exit.\n-The low light aesthetic does more to annoy than cause suspense. Three hits and you're dead from a zombie. Take a wrong turn down a single hallway and you're pretty much dead, unless you have a weapon. However, you have no idea where you're going because there's little to no light to see paths. While I can understand and appreciate WHY that is like that, make the zombies move very slowly to help avoid them in time, or give us more light to see the layout of an area before we start to run around blind.\n-The font choice is best left for the title screen. After a while it's just annoying. And it's for ALL the text in the game.\n\nTLDR: Game is far too dark to be enjoyable, which is too bad, because it actually seems like something of a fun game there. I'm not going to recommend it at this time, unless the creator cleans it up a bit.", "recommendationid": "30631689", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515288", "timestamp_created": 1489999206, "author": {"num_reviews": 78, "num_games_owned": 2157, "playtime_forever": 39, "last_played": 1489998356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198003479630"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1489005073, "language": "english", "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Remember those old get touched and die RPG Maker games that where huge in the early 2000s?\nThose games that mostly used tropes known from other games or movies?\nHere you can have that experience again and you will not enjoy it.\n\nThe story could be something interesting but the writing and the gameplay kill it.\n\nALSO - The game header uses stolen and slightly modified art assets from one of the POP Horror Asset Bundles\nI also do not know why it says I got the game for free, I paid the 99cents\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u352rtzAwf8&feature=youtu.be", "recommendationid": "30396781", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501672", "timestamp_created": 1489001448, "author": {"num_reviews": 60, "num_games_owned": 1056, "playtime_forever": 39, "last_played": 1488995880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040275876"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1489145575, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 7, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Yes.
