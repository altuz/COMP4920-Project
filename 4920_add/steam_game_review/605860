It looks quite polished. The environment is nice, it has music, and it actually uses a recent version of UE4. It would have been nice to be able to locomote and view the environment that otherwise is wasted.

It just sucks that we can't 'stream' or otherwise combine all these little VR experiences into 'locations' in the metaverse. At the moment, they are all just separate steam apps, that you have to download and install in the clunky fashion inherent to computer gaming for decades. You know what I mean?\n\nAnywho, I'm still appreciative of something like this. I can make a video for it, take screenshots, etc. In this way I can indulge my the OCD related to Steam collection that has (more or less) ruined my life. Another benefit at the present time, is that I can feel alright leaving a negative review, which will balance out my collection of reviews that is largely positive. Crass, I know.
