This is what time management games should be right here.  You actually had to use your brain to beat these stages and get the challenges completed.  Graphics are as beautiful as the 1st game.  The music.. I really am starting to like the cut music they put in these games. Storywise... the beginning gets a bit frustrating because you want to dive right in from the end of the 1st and get right to the 2nd.  You actually have to wait a bit before the story starts rolling, but stick with it.

Never heard of it, or seen it before - it was on sale, so I thought \"why not try it\". \n\nThis game definitely goes under the 'guilty pleasure' category for me. I love those kind of games, and always have one on my phone for when I travel. \n\nI was surprised how much story this game actually had. It was over the top, soap opera style - And I liked it, it was funny and great for a 'simple' game.\n\nSo for some reason I also decided to 100% it - and I bought the previous game for iPad. It's a neat casual game, when you just need to waste a little time and relax. \n\nI think GameHouse and Blue Giraffe & Friends made a really great time-management game, and it's really cool to see a game like this, actually 'tell a story'.", "recommendationid": "33473761", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1499844870, "author": {"num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 521, "playtime_forever": 773, "last_played": 1496438082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198011129687"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500122105, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The story is so cheesy, I like it. Original songs are lovely also. But the gameplay gets tedious very quickly, I feel done after 30-40 levels, there's no 'actual' strategy involved (because it's casual games, I can understand that) so new stages are just more frustrating rather than more challenging. \n\nCasual games with this style have a lot of stages, they only have weak underlying plot which is not important to gameplay, allow them to achieve the true 'time killer' status. Heart's medicine, however, has solid story and tries its best to deliver the story with side challenges, but a lot of stages feel like they were just trying to fill in the level quota. It feels like Heart's medicine cannot decide whether it wants to be time killer casual game or story driven game, and it stucks in between, not delivering either aspect to the full potential.\n\nI'm in dilemma when I play it, I want to see more of the story but the stages are so tedious. I feel like there are a lot of potential in this game but for now, I have to say nay.\n\nTLDR; Solid story, tedious gameplay, weak storytelling.", "recommendationid": "33558435", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505368", "timestamp_created": 1500122105, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_forever": 433, "last_played": 1500118423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198080837810"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501180495, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Just as great then the first two games!
