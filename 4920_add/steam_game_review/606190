You have a dodge/teleport button, a super button, etc. The direction of your attacks is automatic (straight ahead) so aside from orienting your ship in the right spot to take out the waves of enemies and be aware of your own hitbox to evade their many attacks there's not much to the gameplay. The level design can be a little bit bland, consisting of little more than a solid color and some grid lines or lasers to dodge. Although the levels progress in a \"constantly viewing the horizon approaching\" vertical shooter kind of way seen in other games of the genre, the game often has a cool effect of exaggerating how much this is \"rolling\" toward you, and often tilts the horizon to make for an interesting effect while progressing. \n\nThe game provides various enemies with different attack patterns to mix up the gameplay often enough, and you are able to select to swap your weapon or keep the one you have at level's end after defeating the big bosses of each stage. The soundtrack inparticular is good, and the announcer adds to the game's overall well-done arcade-y effect.\n\nI do wish you could upgrade your weapons or super by collecting pickups during the levels, but I have liked most all of the weapons you can opt to pickup at the end of the level. The dialog's humor while funny at times (seeing a boss simply titled \"Motherfucking Spider\") begins to become one-note (titling the boss right after that \"A Tiny Fucking Planet\") The standouts of the game for me are the boss fights and the soundtrack, as the soundtrack thumps along and you dodge the bosses' screen-filling attacks. I'm a fan of the new retro wave esque soundtrack so that probably adds immensely to how much I enjoy the game, but if you're a fan of the retro SHMUP genre I think you will probably enjoy this game.", "recommendationid": "33390980", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1499564283, "author": {"num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 799, "playtime_forever": 36, "last_played": 1501990084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173606567"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
