While [u]Shadows 2: Perfidia[/u] does not reinvent the wheel for survival horror, it does effectively incorporate a very interesting philosophy to their main gameplay, and that is, making the familiar strange. You play through an aggregate of about eighteen levels that on a surface-level blueprint look incredibly similar. However, small details really help disorient, terrify and scare -- keeping you on edge, not knowing when the monster is going to strike, or even if the monster is real at all. Which brings me to a core element of this game that it shares with other successful titles of the genre, and that is that it effectively ascribes to the horror game theory of [i] accomplishing more by showing less[/i]. You barely get a clear picture of the \u2018monsters\u2019. They\u2019re always shadowy figures, humanoid silhouettes or loud growls \u2013 and that\u2019s brilliant, because it lets the mind fill in the gaps and instead of running and hiding from an identifiable threat, you\u2019re escaping a very personal and subjective fear. Whatever that may be, it becomes the main antagonist of this game.\n\n[u]Shadows 2: Perfidia[/u] is a very literary game. [u]Perfidia[/u] is a Spanish word that means treachery and deceitfulness which are, not coincidentally, two main thematic points of this game. You have the option of playing two characters on their way out of a seemingly normal office party, when strange happenings begin to occur -- you witness shadowy figures moving in the dark, you hear something stomping through the halls or you see the first mutilated coworker. The narrative doesn\u2019t revolutionize survival horror storytelling, but it engages the player enough to suspend, scare and introduce a fun twist at the end \u2013 through journal entries illustrating the protagonists interior monologue and scattered notes left around by the \u2018shadow people\u2019.\n\nLet\u2019s briefly return to [u]Shadows 2: Perfidia[/u] philosophy of making the familiar strange. Every building floor has a similar visual design \u2013 there\u2019s a meeting room, there\u2019s a bathroom, there are halls with brown wooden side desks, there\u2019s a storage room, a play room, office rooms and an occasional guest room. The objective is to navigate through each floor maze and find the elevator so you can get to the ground floor and escape your worst nightmare. However, you have to deal with \u2018shadow monsters\u2019 that lurk in the dark, and that to your knowledge, have slaughtered your coworkers in a brutal and ritualistic manner. At first, the floor levels might seem repetitive, but then sound design kicks in: you hear door creaks in the distance, you hear a growl two feet behind you, a mirror breaks, lights flicker or someone turns them off in a room you just were \u2013 these technical mechanics help increase the overall scare factor of the game and add a unique aspect to each level in a creative way. \n\nMoreover, in an attempt to combat repetitive gameplay, [u]Shadows 2: Perfidia[/u] also displays a wide variety of disturbing, creepy and gross paintings throughout the levels. Not only do they startle the player occasionally but they add a level of surrealism to the gameplay that would be absent in corporate setting. At times, I also found myself just pausing and admiring a painting or the other that displayed a gruesome monster because they are genuinely interesting pieces of art \u2013 there\u2019s a museum characteristic to each level that I truly appreciate. Other technical aspects that help add variety to each level are randomized item locations, good use of lighting, puzzling secret item locations and gruesome mutilated body parts as office decor.\n\n[h1]If you enjoy the way I review games, join and follow my curator group!

This is what you call a successor. Great game, not your tipical spinoff, constant jumpscare game. This one actually sets an atmosphere. You feel like something is watching you all the time.

And not only that, you get so much content for the price you pay, definetly a great game, recommended for anyone that likes to poop their pants. I suggest you get a pair of diapers or two...
