One of its promotional images shows the protagonist kneeling in a cloak in front of a darkened cityscape, bright bursts of pink \u00a0(cherry blossom trees, it turns out) on either side of her and rain drizzling in the background. It's that image that caught my eye, and even though I read some brief impressions and looked at a few screens after that, I was probably always going to buy it after I saw that initial artwork, assuming it didn't end up being some kind of call center simulator. But honestly, I'd probably buy even that if it were attached to art this pretty. The same aesthetic carries through the entire game, with muted grays and blues punctuated by splashes of more vibrant colors. It's surprisingly evocative for such a small game; the city itself reverberates with an eerie stillness, while the more whimsical character designs lighten the mood ever so slightly.\n\nThe puzzles are better than they probably needed to be, too, particularly for what was originally a mobile game. If the mechanics aren't particularly novel, they are soundly executed, and the gently sloping difficulty curve is ideal for this more casual type of game. You're introduced to simple set of rules early on, and though there are a small handful of new mechanics introduced throughout the game, those same rules will always apply. \u00a0Crucially, it never violates it's own logic, and never asks you to come up with solutions it hasn't taught you. A pet peeve of mine is when a puzzle game pulls solutions out of thin air, as if it's so very clever for expecting you to solve a puzzle in a way it never even communicated to you was possible; none of the puzzles here even approach that. There are a few telltale signs that Flood of Light didn't originate on PC; it's very mouse-oriented even when that isn't the most intuitive input option, and character movement is sluggish and occasionally imprecise. Overall, though, it's a very solid port, and I think the fact that I didn't even realize it was a port until I was nearly halfway through says something about the quality of the game.\n\nIf it has one major downfall, though, it's very clearly its writing, or more accurately, the translation of that writing. Flood of Light comes from a Chinese developer, and I strongly suspect they translated the game into English themselves, perhaps with some help from Google Translate. The result is incoherent at best, and complete gibberish at worst. A kind steam user volunteered to fix its grammar, which removed some of the most egregious errors but it essentially amounts to a band-aid on a chainsaw wound. What the game really needs is for every line of text to be rewritten from the ground up by a proper translator. Do I begrudge a small studio for not having the resources for a better translation? Not at all. Do I think you should be aware of its translation issues before buying Flood of Light? Absolutely.\n\nI can imagine some players criticizing Flood of Light for being too easy, but I think to do that is to fundamentally misunderstand what type of game this is. It's not trying to force your brain into mental gymnastics like The Talos Principle, \u00a0or make you feel like a small, worthless and very stupid pile of organic refuse the way Stephen's Sausage Roll does; it's trying to be the game you play to relax after work. Think of Flood of Light like a lazy brook in the summertime; it's pretty, gentle, and will have a decidedly calming effect on your mental state.", "recommendationid": "33586898", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512138", "timestamp_created": 1500217335, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 533, "playtime_forever": 453, "last_played": 1499992463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025034579"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501383075, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "While I can't recommend it for the story (what is kind of a first for me), I can and certainly will recommend it for the puzzles.\n\nAs the description goes, in [i]Flood of Light[/i] you play as a little girl who needs to light her way through a city submerged by rain. You start on the roof of a building and your objective is to activate the pedestals at the end of the level on each of the floors. However, in order to reach said pedestals you must light different lamp posts and activate a few stone posts along your way.\n\nFor the most part, the game does a pretty good job introducing you to the different ways in which you can manipulate light, how you can absorb, store, and transfer it, as well as the different types of light that will be available to you (blue can be submerged, yellow cannot). I say \"for the most part,\" as there is some trial and error in order to get the most out of the available light. The game encourages you to be efficient and thorough, suggesting a maximum number of steps (how many lights you move in order to reach the pedestal) and indicating what discoveries you need to make to achieve a perfect 'S' rating. Achieving a perfect rating on all floors unlocks the 'true' ending.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough how addicting this game is, a feeling that is undoubtedly exacerbated by the drive to solve each and every puzzle in the least amount of moves possible, not to mention some achievements require an inordinate amount of patience and perseverance (more on this later). I would sometimes stare at the screen for a few minutes, mentally transferring light from one lamp to the next, activating and deactivating switches, tallying the number of imaginary moves I was making. It felt incredibly rewarding solving the puzzles on each floor and I instantly took up the challenge to achieve a perfect rating on every one of them (which I did).\n\nThe game however, is not without its flaws, and one of the most glaring ones becomes apparent right away: there is no manual save. What does this imply? Well, for one, it means that if you quit the game before you have completed a floor, then all your progress on that floor is lost (what contributed to my 45-hour playtime as I sometimes left the game open and went to bed). Sure, there are checkpoints throughout the floor that allow you to replay a particular segment in order to optimize the total number of moves but if you quit the game, you'll have to start that floor over from scratch. Also, these checkpoints are sometimes quite inconveniently placed, making it easy for you to make a mistake and not having enough time to get back to the menu to hit replay before your progress is automatically saved.\n\nThis lack of manual saves is particularly maddening when you're trying to unlock the \"Being the prophet\" achievement, as you cannot use the aforementioned replay function. I mean, you can, but if you do, you won't be able to unlock the achievement. That means if you make one false move, you'd better start the level all over again... and there is a noticeable ramp-up in difficulty on that last floor; I must've replayed it ten times, maybe more. A friendly tip: favour the keyboard on that floor instead of the mouse. Sometimes the mouse doesn't respond correctly when you're trying to place a lamp or absorb light, but you can be sure that won't happen with the keyboard.\n\nThis repetition can certainly get on your nerves but, fortunately, the game has a soothing (if simple) soundtrack to ease the tension. Combine that with the lovely artwork and this is definitely a most inviting game to play and replay.\n\nAs for the story, while you do collect letters that try to explain what is going on, and you interact with robots that give you a few tidbits here and there, the issue lies in the fact that all of the writing has been translated from Chinese to English... and the translation just isn't very good (to say the least). Sure, you can understand most (if not all) of it, but at no point did I feel engaged by it. I know there's probably a good story there, but the issues with the grammar took me out of it.\n\nConsidering its pleasing aesthetic, high replay value, and relatively low price-point, [i]Flood of Light[/i] is a great game if you feel like flexing your brain muscles. While I would've preferred that the soundtrack had been included with the game, I have no qualms recommending this title at full price.", "recommendationid": "33895336", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508207", "timestamp_created": 1501382863, "author": {"num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 159, "playtime_forever": 2716, "last_played": 1500411874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198047495857"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 11, "total_positive": 11, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
