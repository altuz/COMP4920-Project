Fans of previous Grisaia games will enjoy it but others don't need to have played them to understand this.\n\nThe biggest problem is the price-playtime balance and episodic release format.\n\n\u00a310.99 ($15 USD/ \u20ac15) when full price for approx 3 hours of playtime (most reviews are ~7hours but this is idling for card drops). I paid \u00a38.79 (-20%) when it was on discount for release (which was less than the amount paid by kickstarter backers btw) and still felt it was too high. So far there are 3 episodes released which seem to be based on character routes (except vol. 1). If we estimate that there will be a volume per character + the first \"intro\" volume there will be up to 6-7 volumes to buy (Intro, Rena/Maki, Tohka, Chris, Murasaki, Arisaka, and maybe Haruto). Both volumes so far have been very short at ~3 hours, so for \u00a365.94-76.93 ($/\u20ac90-105) for 18-21 hours of material it is pretty damn steep. Even at my 20% discounted price and love for the series it is hard to justify the costs involved. Episodic release of a single game in \"books\u201d, \u201cchapters\" and \"episodes\" is a frustrating marketing technique that relies on the sunk-cost fallacy where a person really doesn't want to miss out on the next part of the game because they have already invested in the beginning...\n\nHopefully in the future Phantom Trigger will be sold as a set or collection at a reduced price, then I can complete it and consider my earlier high spending as support for the series or funding for the anime adaptation.\n", "recommendationid": "35065550", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510422", "timestamp_created": 1505831571, "author": {"num_reviews": 45, "num_games_owned": 258, "playtime_forever": 421, "last_played": 1505607985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198176715762"}, "votes_up": 4}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 22, "total_positive": 21, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
