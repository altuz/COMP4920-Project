I loved this game when I was a kid. Sadly, my old CDs wouldn't work on newer versions of Windows, so I was delighted when I saw that the game is available on steam, in a version compatible with modern operating systems!\n\nOriginally released back in 1999, the game is quite old, so don't expect any fancy new graphics. Graphically, the game isn't exactly complex, as it features polygonal 3D characters drawn against beautiful pre-rendered 2D backgrounds.\n\nThe story is essentially a fairytale. The protagonist is the brave, honorable hero whose wife is abducted by stereotypical evil meanies with a sinister laugh. On his quest to save his wife, said protagonist gathers followers and visits many different places and landscapes.\n\nSilver's great strength is the active combat system. While it is possible to fight enemies by simply clicking on them in a hack'n'slash like manner, this proves to be quite ineffective. Combat really comes to life when it is controlled by mouse movement. You literally control your character's sword with your mouse. For example, holding the left mouse button and moving your mouse to the right causes your selected character to slash to the right, whereas holding CTRL and the left mouse button and moving your mouse down causes your character to perform a turnaround slash. This may feel kinda clunky sometimes, but it becomes second nature after a few fights. And it's so much fun. Fighting is so much fun in this game, it's incredible.\nBut since you control a party of up to 3 party members, this can sometimes be quite a hassle, especially during boss fights. Instead of controlling all 3 characters separately during combat, it's often the best to just concentrate on one of them and let the AI handle the others.\n\nParty members can be changed at any time (except for the David, the protagonist, who will always be in the party). Companions that aren't in your party can be found in Haven and there is a total of 5 different companions to choose from. Every companion has strengths and weaknesses; some are good archers, others are good sorcerers or melee fighters. There is even a character that excels in unarmed combat.\n\nThe game has a few minor flaws. The voice acting surely isn't the best, and the inventory feels clunky and inefficient and needs getting used to.\nThe game feels kinda \"open\", but is actually quite linear with just a few secrets here and there. Due to this, the game lacks replayability.\n\nI may be a bit biased and I'm sure nostalgia plays a big part in this, but I love the crap out of this game, despite its flaws. So naturally, I recommend this game to anyone who is interested in RPGs.\n\nBy the way, a lot of people seem to complain about crashes. Well, all I can say is that (apart from some issues with the intro) I played through the entire game without a single crash, error or bug.", "recommendationid": "34132437", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506528", "timestamp_created": 1502310510, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 73, "playtime_forever": 772, "last_played": 1497644124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198021676032"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501970944, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Never played the original but this still brings on a sense of nostalgia for the older games of it's time, sounds odd but this actually became interesting to me because of the Harry potter and the chamber of secrets game.

[/u]\nYes it's that old and although it's that old, it still has decent graphics. \nA few reviews here tell you that they can't run it on their windows 10 system because they keep on getting errors. I can tell you that in 9 hours of playing i had just 1 error on my windows 10 system. \nAlso for the people that are worried about the bell puzzle. It works (without any help from slowing your pc or save exploiting. You just need to know the timing on when to click).\n\n[u] What does the game have in store for you [/u]\n[list]\n[*] An epic adventure\n[*] You control your sword with your mousemovements\n[*] Nice background drawings\n[/list]\n\n[u] What's not so good [/u]\n[list]\n[*] It's really hard controlling all your 3 characters seperately\n[*] Changing weapons / specials / magic is weird compared to games nowadays.\n[*] Replayability is only interesting if you want to play with different characters (the story stays the same)\n[/list]\n\n[u] My own experience [/u]\nI've played this game about 20 years ago. Back then i really enjoyed it. Seeing this on steam made this an instabuy (although i was sceptical about all the 'crashes/errors' people said they'd encountered). Again i didn't have any problems while playing this game and it took me back to my younger years. I still like the story, the characters and the drawings. I had a blast while playing this game. I've just completed the story and at some time i will replay it again, probably with the other characters. \nA funny sidenote; at one point during the game the game really reminded me of a Game of Thrones character. A white long haired girl with a 'guardian' that looks and almost has the same name as Drogon.", "recommendationid": "33557792", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1500119872, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 153, "playtime_forever": 588, "last_played": 1499799232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960334309"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501641230, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great news to see Silver released and updated, I have tried many times to get this game working on Windows 7/8 and 10 and now it's finally here.\n\nThis is one of my favourite games from the late 1990s and it's still one of my favourites almost 10 years after it's first release.
