Pretty graphics with a nice aesthetic, artistry and shadow effects? A competent sound engine that creates a cool atmosphere? Nope\u2026 it\u2019s the god damn ability to dodge and explode crap and while this game succeeds on the first 2 items it utterly fails on how it plays.\n\nI was hooked from the screenshots when I bought this game but less than an hour in and over a dozen of \u201cbut the bullet / wall didn\u2019t hit me!\u201d deaths I\u2019m done. More often than not either because of a pretty and slow plane animation or a very weird hit box you\u2019ll get hit for no good reason. \n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough different planes have a \u201cwildly different\u201d gameplay that you can categorize basically in two groups\u2026 one of them work and one don\u2019t. Many times during the story mode I was given planes with pathetic bombs and bullet patterns just to spend the next 10\u2019 wishing I could\u2019ve gotten something different.\n\nStory is completely forgettable and generic and the time gimmicky is shallow and uninteresting but I won\u2019t hold that against a game of this genre specially when the gameplay itself is more than enough reason to stay away from the title.", "recommendationid": "34844002", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "timestamp_created": 1504982497, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 222, "playtime_forever": 40, "last_played": 1504360531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971283395"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506854867, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Sine Mora EX is a side-scrolling shoot'em up that provides a unique challenge, where time is the ultimate factor. Mixing classic shooter sensibilities with contemporary presentation, Sine Mora EX is a gorgeous shoot'em up offering both a Story Mode that weaves an over-the-top tale and an Arcade.\n\nI'm torn. I like shooters, and Sine Mora EX is a very pretty shooter with all the important mechanisms, weapon upgrades, multistage bosses, great looking, etc. It has an interesting mechanics where you have given time for a level, each hit taken substracts from that time, each kill adds to that time. When the time ends, you die. There are several ships to fly with somewhat different main weapons and totally different bombs. And have I mentioned that it looks great? It does.\n\nThe problem is the game is sometimes overwhelmingly unfair. Take one of the bosses for instance, the boss enters from the left side, where you usually position yourself. If it touches you it's insta kill, and you have zero time to react. There's a level where you fly through a cave, touching a wall equals being hit and it's very easy to touch a wall because sometimes the barrier wall will look exactly like the background wall. Unavoidable insta-kill lasers? Yup, you can find them here. So basically while the game is very pretty to look at and quite fun to play, sometimes you just die, for some random reason that is so very unfair it ruins all the fun you had just a minute ago.\n\nIt's not a bad game, it just requires more patience than I can muster.\n\nI liked:\n* looks, it's a pretty game\n* some boss fights are really cool\n\nI disliked:\n* the insta kills\n* unfairness of some levels/enemies\n\nGet this if:\n* you like tough as nails sidescrolling shooters and are not easily discouraged\n\nDon't get this if:\n* you're bad at shooter games, there is no easy mode here and limited continues\n* you're short on patience", "recommendationid": "35376778", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1506854867, "author": {"num_reviews": 88, "num_games_owned": 303, "playtime_forever": 189, "last_played": 1506865664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 189, "steamid": "76561198009539258"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 28, "total_positive": 16, "review_score": 5}, "success": 1}
