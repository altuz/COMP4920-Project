Bottom line.\nBut it is not enough!  I can't quite recommend it yet, but as it is early access, I'll come back to this review.\n\nThe game is fun and the classic game mechanics are there, enough so to make it hard to stop playing. \"Work\" is decently well portraited in a way close enough to reality to make sense. However, most of the systems in this game massively lacks a depth and complexity that you expect from a tycoon game.\nOne of those things are the number of skill parameters on the employees. There is no room for complexity with just the speed & mood metrics. Adding furniture doesn't make sense after so many chairs, since mood will always decrease. \nAlso, how the devs will only work if a manager manages them is frustrating. I see how it might seem like a smart game mechanic, but the metaphor is a little brittle. Same thing for hardware. If you call it \"startup company\", the metaphore kinda falls on the fact that a modern start up would likely buy a lot of services, and build only their own core themselves. \nThis game is fun, but not satisfying in the long run.\nDevs should perhaps try to work out some of systems on paper before tossing them in as game mechanics, that way you'll see if it balances out. \n", "recommendationid": "34818163", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521145", "timestamp_created": 1504888194, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 67, "playtime_forever": 350, "last_played": 1504817329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027841792"}, "votes_up": 11}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505768204, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Bought it and played for around 8 hours now and it looks good in the beginning but with some unlogical things which have been mentioned in other revies (like software is treated factory like, you can store it and sell it) and after moving to the biggest office, running the game to level 15 there was nothing anymore. Own software projects have been running and missing features (what, a online shop platform without payment feature? WTF. And nearly everything is mobile only. Also very strange why you need different index pages for mobile/web/desktop which all count as feature.

Sure its only ten euros  but im 6h in as im writing this and ive almost done most of what you could do in the game. The rest is just a grind which i belive you could finish in about 4h hours. But as i said the rest was mostly just a grind which isent that fun. \n\nIts also a bit too easy only the first hour of palytime is some what challeging but once you pay back your first lone and have enough empleyees to do contract constently it becomes extremly easy. You dont even have to take more loans that the first one you have to take in the begining of the game. I guess the game would be harder if you tried making an own product earily on in the game which i see no reason doing snice doing so is exensive and dosent make alot of money its smarter to just complete a bunch of contract until you are in the very late game. In the late game you dont have anything else to buy snice there isent much and the rooms are to small to bother spending to much money on furniture the employees desks will just cover 70% of the room. Its also a bit repetive which i think is a consequence of there not being alot of stuff to do.\n\nOverall i think its fun but it dosent have enouth content to juctify buying it. Im writing this in early access so keep that in mind the game isent finished yet and maybe we do get more content but as of right now i wouldent recommend it unless you are willing to pay 10 euroes for 6 hours of content which maybe is worth it but i think there are better games with alot more content out there for the same price.", "recommendationid": "34780940", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "timestamp_created": 1504723127, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_forever": 499, "last_played": 1504727761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041089542"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505079445, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is really bad, however the devs do updates and improving which is good.
