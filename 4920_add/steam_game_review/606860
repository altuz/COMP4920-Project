Only if it was free, but it's not.\nProps to Tongu\u00e7 Bodur for creating the \"nephise\" word.

There is not much story to be had, and the two games are only loosely connected through your character Nephise. To me, the story was more like a template of a story, but it was asking me to fill it in, and I wanted to do just that. There is much mystery surrounding this world and Nephise to me, and I've created my own characteristics about Nephise.\n\n[spoiler]What power does the orbs that Nephise collects give? Why or how has she killed things only by touching them. Is it voluntary or involuntary?[/spoiler]\n\nStill, it's a simple story but a sweet and short one I enjoyed. It is accompanied by a small but sweet and soothing soundtrack. The graphics look fine, though the scenery can be breathtaking at certain spots. Some stretched textures and their use of parallax can be jarring on some cliffsides but overall looks beautiful.\n+bonus brownie points for GLISTENING SNOW.\n\nIs $2 worth just over half an hour of your time? Or is that soda bottle from the vending machine worth $1.75? You choose! Just make sure you dont make that comparison more than twice a month, then it might hurt your wallet ;)", "recommendationid": "35432523", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1506994897, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 167, "playtime_forever": 37, "last_played": 1506993938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "steamid": "76561198069142263"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505689005, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The hash pipe must have been burning long that night.
