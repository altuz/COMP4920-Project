The challenge is trying to beat each wave with no enemies getting through so you get 3 stars to spend on stats. And you need every star.\nJust letting one enemy through gives you just 2 stars.\nGraphics are good - there are pools of light which cast darker shadows and change the enemy's color as the walk through them. Very atmospheric.\nMake sure you set quality to 'fantastic' in the box that shows up at the start.\nBest thing I like are the special tiles where your tower gets a boost to stats. There is a super 'S' tile that boosts everything. Sit a rocket on that and you are away.\nTip for the start few levels - invest in machine gun damage and use that tower a lot. Mind you, as you buy towers their cost goes up so you can't just spam loads of the same. Good move!\nI would have liked to have a \"start next wave now\" button as sometimes I finished a wave with 15 seconds to go, although you can press the space bar to Fast Forward.\nOverall I recommend this game at such a low price.", "recommendationid": "31158372", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514176", "timestamp_created": 1492268996, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_forever": 3753, "last_played": 1502063296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198051226621"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492902269, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Classic TD Game with interesting balance idea where more of the same type of tower costs more.
