I like DOOM. Its $3.49, so I figured to give it a shot. \n*breaths in* BOI DO I EVER REGRET THAT. \n\nAt the beginning, you will be greeted with the main menu. You get 3 options, new game, load game and quit game. There is no option menu. None at all, no ability to change the audio, I would like to change it since I think its a bit too loud. The resolution is locked, graphics are pretty terrible which is strange from a game from 2017, its not even like its bad for an aesthetic choice either. It does take a few minutes to get used to the art style, but enemies are rather difficult to find. \n \nAll in all:\n+it runs... i guess thats a positive\n+music is actually pretty good\n\n-One difficulty\n-enemies will shoot you through walls\n-long load times\n-the microsecond you are in their line of sight, you will take damage, there is no warning\n-controls are stiff and confusing, you get one loading screen explaining the controls and thats it\n-bugs like enemies spawning in walls\n-nauseating FOV\n-random crashing\n-clipping problems\n\nDo I recommend this game?\n\nLmao no. Don't buy it. Im serious, it terrible. I like to play bad games from time to time to blow off some stress, garbage like Shell Shock 2: Blood Ties, but this... This game is not enjoyable in any way shape or form.

Health packs, 90s graphics, weird collision detection. I will say the game does late some things, as I'm sure you've already read, but I'll say again, no in game way to change controls, no graphical settings and no audio settings. So if you have headphones on take them off, ALT-TAB and turn down the game manually unless you like to bleed from the ears. I'm only on level 6 but I am enjoying myself. Deaths aren't too common but I can see where some might find it difficult, if you remember the kind of damage enemies did in Redneck Rampage then you'll know how these enemies treat ya. \n\nLastly I will say it does feel like the game isn't fully complete, on the Greenlight Page it stated 4 episodes with 10 levels each and here we are waiting on Episode 2. So, I believe dev should slap an \"Early Access\" sticker on this bad boy.\n\nTLTR:\nGreat old school feel\nMay be difficult for those who didn't grow up on 90s games\nFeels like Early Access\nNo Graphic/Audio/Control settings as of now.\nHeadphone users beware\nI personally think it's fun", "recommendationid": "33875732", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485577", "timestamp_created": 1501317181, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 296, "playtime_forever": 69, "last_played": 1501316391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198039603928"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500127856, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Do keep in mind, I'll be happy to change this review if the game is improved.\n\nIts not good right now.

You have to aim down the sights which slows down your movement, takes up half the screen and in general feels like a pain to do\n\nIf you intend to hip fire good luck with that, because your accuracy without it is a joke, and don't forget you only have a few seconds to do it before the enemies will kill you. You can't even run and run with the machine gun!\n\nSpeaking of running, you have to hold down shift to sprint! You can hold it down for as long as you want, there's no penalty for doing it either, what's the point? Why not just have yourself set to always run? I wanna sprint automatically and shoot enemies without having to aim down the sights. Just a little nitpick. \n\nThe shooting itself  is subpar, there's no ragdoll physics, no enemies flinching when attacking and no gore, just some pixel blood sprays and a death animation that plays with it when you kill an enemy, no fun in that.\n\nGraphics are nice though, I really do like the choice of weapon designs used, they look clean and pretty.\n\nI could forgive the lack of options, the terrible music, the extremely linear level design but when the gameplay is held back by such things, thats when you have a bad game.", "recommendationid": "34024487", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480530", "timestamp_created": 1501882398, "author": {"num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 318, "playtime_forever": 14, "last_played": 1501881499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044393007"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501543123, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "i dont know if this game is any good or not. i struggled thru 5 minutes just to write this review. there is no mouse inverting which makes a fast paced shooter impossible to play. no control custimizing either which is minor compared to the mouse aiming.", "recommendationid": "33938062", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502960", "timestamp_created": 1501543123, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 49, "playtime_forever": 9, "last_played": 1501542839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198323462290"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500627043, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The game is fun to play with acceptable levels of difficulty (searching ammo/health), BUT: badly optimized (severe framedrops)! and very repetative soundtrack in the game.
