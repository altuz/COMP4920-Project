However, despite the less than polish aspects, the game itself is actually very well design.\n\nThe gameplay feels EPIC as you are playing a team that comprises of individuals in multiple key factions in the game world. In the gameworld, you have the Rebels (evil) who killed and plunder villages, the Witches faction (neutral), the Predators (neutral) who hunt witches, the Queen (good) who fight the rebels and the Church which support the Predators.\n\nHowever, what I love about this game is the deep emotional interplay between the various groups, as things are not what it seems on the surface. There are honorable people within the Rebels that try to save the villages. There are dishonorable leaders in the Predators that tries to aligned themselves with the massacres of villages and pin the blame of the witches. So as you play the game, you are always discovering new things in the factions as it evolved.\n\nYou are playing a group of 10 individuals (from different factions including Witches, Predators, Rebels, Queen, Church, etc) that are brought together by circumstances to fight evil,  combat injustices and protect the villagers. Wow, what a noble force of good!! However, your group will start off as the underdog, as the leaders of certain factions are trying to blame you for things that you did not do. You also have to fight off strong prejudices because things are certainly not what it seems on the surface in the various factions. For example, one of the faction leader who is a decorated war hero  (highly respected and idolized by many villagers) is actually in cohort with the evil Rebels to massacre villages. People would rather believe the war hero than believe you.\n\nAs a force of good, you will also need to fight propaganda made by other factions to hurt you. You will need to win allies and make new friends. You will need to bring peace among different faction members in your team. What I like is the emotional experience that the game bring. I spend 30 hours in the game, and feels that it is very immersive.\n\nThere are only 6 achievements in the game, and I did not get my first achievement until I was almost  15 hours into the game. The achievements are well made and not buggy and you can get them all in a single playthrough. However, getting the achievements can be difficult.\n\nThis is also one of the older RPG maker games where you actually have to keep pen and paper records of all the details of the side quests. There are about 20 side quests, but the game does not have a Quest Tab to track down information for you. This is  old school, cos you have to write them down, otherwise it is so easy to forget or missed out the details, like location of quest givers, etc. Many of the side quests are also very important because the quest rewards include Relics that are key to completion of the game. Relics in this game are special items that enable you to perform various actions in the game world. For example, there are Angel Wings Relic that enable you to jump across different location, Destroyer Relic that enable you to smash a wall so that you can get treasures behind them, etc. So, without doing all the sidequest, you will be missing out on many items and locations in the games and will not have a strong enough final team to defeat the big bosses.\n\nI love this game and for $2.79 it is an enjoyable 30 hours for me. However, the fact that this game DOES NOT automatically track quests may be a big turn-off for many gamers except the truely old school, hard cores. However, I do love it.", "recommendationid": "31332367", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559744", "timestamp_created": 1493002436, "author": {"num_reviews": 50, "num_games_owned": 758, "playtime_forever": 1815, "last_played": 1493387600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198011891156"}, "votes_up": 32}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
