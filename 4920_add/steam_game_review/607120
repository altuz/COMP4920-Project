Which means that I was 6 when this came out. 6!\nThe series spanning the original SWAT to SWAT 4, has been a rather broad, somewhat eclectic mix of genres including Strategy Adventure (SW 1), RTS (SW 2) and FP Tactical Shooter (SW 3/4) spanning separately across the four titles, but SWAT 2 remains my firm favourite.\n\nThe game features two separate campaign paths in which you control a SWAT team or infamous terrorist organisation 'The Five Eyes,' and go head-to-head, from a static isometric view of California, Los Angeles and the surrounding 'off the grid' area. In total there are 30 missions, 15 for each respective campaign and each storyline is independent of the other, though some scenarios are similar. Based upon the individual mission requirements, you can select a team of officers or terrorists and negotiate, neutralise or manhandle your way to success.\n\nThe game is not without flaws, but many veteran players will look toward this title with rose tinted specs and forgive the overly complicated interface, micromanagement and janky artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n[h1]For any of you who are desperate for a fix, both in the mechanical and literal sense, I hope I can be of some help to you.\n\nThe [b] 'Smartheap Library: mem_rezise_fail' error [/b] seems to be a common problem, but I do have a workaround that I can confirm currently works.\n\nFor any of you who are struggling to run the game due to this error, firstly, I recommend going here: [url=https://ninite.com] Ninite.com [/url] and downloading the Klite codec. It is a very simple non-bloat, timely install that will correct and allow access to the video format of older games, allowing you to run the missions [I] and[/i] view the cutscenes. This should also fix the issue with grey-screening after loading.\n\nIf you feel it necessary, you can also change compatibility mode to Windows XP Service Pack 3, by browsing the local files of the games install directory, selecting the executable file, right clicking and selecting Properties> Compatability Mode. However, I found the codec pack sufficient to run the game full screen on Windows 10, 8 and 7. [/h1]\n\n\n\nI hope that this allows you to re-experience and thoroughly enjoy the game as I did/am, and bask in all the sentimental energy that has collected between your wizened ears over the years.\n\nIt remains as one of my all-time favourite games, and I was delighted to find it available on Steam earlier this year as a nostalgic addition to the RTS section, and for all fans of tactical squad-based gameplay, and I am sure it will be appreciated and welcomed by new and older gamers alike.", "recommendationid": "34797940", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508050", "timestamp_created": 1504802289, "author": {"num_reviews": 59, "num_games_owned": 556, "playtime_forever": 242, "last_played": 1505040930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197991288710"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 13, "total_positive": 9, "review_score": 5}, "success": 1}
