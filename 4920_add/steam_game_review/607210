And since it was on sale, I then decided to buy it for 2,50. Which is an acceptable price. The time invested not so much. It will take about 7h to beat this game. \nIn the first hour of this game, you see about everything that's actually worth seeing. Of course I knew it was a low-budget game, seemingly done buy 1 guy. And it shows pretty clearly. The Ai design is non-existant. The UI is horrendous, environment looks very samey. (In fact, you walk forth and back in the same area, while clearing mobs in the first areal). \nBut from a certain viewing angle, such things can add to the charme of a game. Like a bad b-movie you enjoy. \nI will give a thumbs down, not for the technical mess this game is. After all... the human eye can't even perceive more then 8 frames per second, so this is totally fine! :3\nNo... it's because this game not only overstays it's welcome, but is also ridiculously unfair. As if the second and third area where designed with a completely different mindset. You start out in an orphanage (of sorts) and find absurd characters, a story that seems to make fun of b-movies and itself, jokes written on the walls...  it's stupid fun at that point. \nBut then you hit the second area, and wait for that tone to pick up again, which it never really does. Instead it becomes mind-bogglingly hard. Spawning enemies right on top of you, creating unavoidable damage, and so on. I only managed to beat the second area birds after many trial and error attempts. I could have walked away with a smile on my face, had the game not take such an ugly turn. \nSo let this be a lesson to all devs.  \n", "recommendationid": "33491011", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.412408", "timestamp_created": 1499901090, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 171, "playtime_forever": 462, "last_played": 1499898783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038221441"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 8, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
