I have 1.4 hours in so far and have to say I am totally getting my 10 bucks worth!  it has a very stylized, simplistic, charming art style that really just lets you enjoy the game without having to pick part how detailed the art is.  I just love the music so much! the environments are big so the puzzles can span many different rooms and though they aren't the most difficult in the world they can prove a little challenging and fun to solve.  the platforming part is really fun!  you just teleport from place to plavce in this game but the way the devs incorporated it,  the locomotion is basically part of the whole puzzle so that makes it pretty great and also makes for some fun and anxoiusness waiting for the next spot to be open or free before you get smashed!  So yes this really kind of a surprise and should def be played if you feel like some relaxing medium challange puzzle solveing,  fun VR world to play through and some groovy music.  If you are looking for hard puzzles, this won't be your thing.  Try Obduction or Phantasma if you really want to cramp your brain muscle.", "recommendationid": "34005614", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195", "timestamp_created": 1501809871, "author": {"num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_forever": 199, "last_played": 1503017959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198381853704"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503429775, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Rangi is well worth the price if you are interested in puzzle games.
