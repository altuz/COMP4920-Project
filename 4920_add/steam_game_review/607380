Finally structure and order on my desktop! :-)\n\nIf I had a wish free, I'd wish to be able to assign different background pictures to different desktop pages. So I could have a background for work stuff and one for games. \n\nCons:\n\nTo be able to post my review I had to collect 5 minutes of \"play time\" with Fences. The only todo that, which I found, was to start Fences from Steam over and over again, when everytime it will run for a second or two. A bit silly! ;-)", "recommendationid": "35138803", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546570", "timestamp_created": 1506118366, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_forever": 5, "last_played": 1506118207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "steamid": "76561198008222040"}, "votes_up": 22}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 16, "total_positive": 16, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
