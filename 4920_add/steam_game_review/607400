He is kinda dead already btw, but he keeps on dying so many times! \nSurprisingly it's not frustrating at all, because you have so many checkpoints. It only gives you even more will to try it again. \nThe genius level design clearly shows to your face where you're screwing it up, but it's just so hard to make it right, so you keep on trying again and again and again. \nTill you finally get the timing right and run around the house in celebration scaring the hell outta your dogs... and neighbours if it's 4am. \nWhat the heck am I doing with my life?

Challenging and kept introducing new concepts to keep me entertained.  I think a game like this would be amazing with a level editor, adding hours and hours of content, and it's honestly a shame that it doesn't have one.\n\n\nIf you enjoy well made platformers that are actually challenging, Necrospshere has pretty much everything you want.

There are only two buttons, left and right (initially just to move in the corresponding direcition, but you can eventually double tap them, and hold them both at the same time, for new abilities as you unlock them).\n\nThe game thus has one of the easiest control schemes in PC gaming, but the perfectly tuned difficulty curve quickly makes sure that you will be tapping those buttons like they're going out of fashion. By the end of it you will be pulling off maneuvres that you will look back on in awe, occasionally while being chased by an angry fireball that makes sure you're not getting too comfortable.\n\nIt took me around 4 hours to complete the main story (I'm now working my way through the DLC) and according the credits I died 1200+ times trying. But that's not a problem, because the checkpoint placement is great, so even though you will occasionally scream at your screen with rage, you never have to repeat more than necessary for a given section as you try to master it.\n\nOnly downside would be that beause there's no map, I did occasionally struggle to work out where I was meant to go next, especially when going back to earlier areas to find some previous obstacle after I received a new ability that would let me get past it. But that's nitpicking, the game is fantastic.\n\nBuy the bundle with the DLC as after you complete the main game you will be wanting more, and the DLC ups the difficulty curve even more, but in line with where you finished the main game.", "recommendationid": "34983447", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502344", "timestamp_created": 1505517950, "author": {"num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 381, "playtime_forever": 344, "last_played": 1505519789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972276575"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505229107, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A simple game made complex thanks to Design of each level.

Its not what i expected. I will tell you something, the guys who did this, they enjoyed \"Pain Olympics\", a video from around 2004 where a guy exploded his testicles, ok?

Its like Louis CK on a first date meeting his gf parents, you wont be able to see his full potential, like when he talked about bag of dicks, etc.\n\nAnyway, i shouldnt curse so much, this is a very well made game, not my style but i can tell its good, i hope they do a continuation with no limits or politeness.
