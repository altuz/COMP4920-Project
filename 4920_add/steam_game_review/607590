I don't work for free, why should i expect them to?)\n\nThis was a good, brief simulation and my kids and I enjoyed it. I'll also be demo'ing it for others that come over since it's short and to the point.\n\nMake sure you click the start button in the beginning or you won't be able to move the game forward and pick stuff up, etc.  \n\nThanks for creating this!  PS: My 5 yr old LOVES the dog and plays the game over, and over, and over, and OVER...  just so she can hide during the earthquake with the dog.

Anything we did not create was purchased in the UE4 Marketplace. \n\nThe Earthquake Simulator VR is aimed at giving kids, young adults and families a chance to experience an earthquake and situations that can arise shortly thereafter. This is a short VR experience is targeted at schools or museums for learning purpose. Overall giving people a sense of preparing for an earthquake and how to protect their housing is the Earthquake Simulator VR\u2019s objective while having a little fun. Also, we recommend downloading the earthquake safety preparation after to get a sense of what they should do (such as bolt china cabinets, tv's, etc.... to the wall)", "review": "TERRIBLE - JUST ANOTHER WHIMPY CASH GRAB BY A DEVELOPER.
