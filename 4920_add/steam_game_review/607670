(You can farm guardian shards from normal levels through the treasure system)\n\n\nFor what it's worth, it's a fun RPG puzzle game. After going through a quick tutorial, you can customize your character's name and appearance. You can not make multiple characters, however. Gameplay is a match 3 game, fairly simple if you're familiar with puzzles and dragons. You are given a fair amount of time to create matches. And...\n\nMatching...\n- 3+ sword icons causes your character to attack\n- 3+ paw icons causes your current active guardian to attack (and fill a bit of it's special attack gauge)\n- 3+ star icons fills up your own character's special attack gauge\n- 3+ heart icons restore a portion of your HP\n- 3+ gold icons rewards you with a bit more gold at stage completion.\n\nSounds simple enough, though to gain chests in battle, there are certain matching conditions you have to fulfill, and some of those corner matches can be a giant pain. If your mouse cursor ever leaves the grid, it will consider it as  releasing your hold and end the turn. This can be troublesome later on when the matching conditions get tremendously tough.\n\nAll in all, a fun puzzle game, is it worth it's current price though?

You travel through different worlds and battle against a set of enemies in each stage in an orderly fashion. When you get into the game battles, you'll be presented with a grid with symbols that you mix and match around with. You get your obvious attack, gold, mana and health symbols to match with, but there's another symbol that you may find peculiar, the guardian symbol.
