It\u2019s a top-down dungeon crawler-esque action title that pits you against NekroSkeletus and its underground minions. At first glance it looks like a simple non-isometric rpg title from the four-eighty-six era of PCs kind of in the vein of Dungeons & Dragons, albeit a very basic one. In this case, however, those looks are incredibly deceiving.\n\nWhile the footage and images on the store front show a mildly competent creation, it\u2019s far from one. First of all the keyboard control scheme is ludicrous at best. You move around with the arrow keys while you attack using the space bar, q for an alternate attack (which is a dash forward with your sword), and e to use mana which brings back a small amount of life. Thankfully this isn\u2019t too much of a problem given the hit detection box surrounding your foes seems to be random, and your alternate attack happens sporadiclly after eight to ten normal ones.\n\nAnd then there are the enemies themselves. The common hordes of spiders, bats, and skeletons will rush you if you get within their line of sight, which is expected. However, they also will just stand there if you take two steps away, or just not even attack. Sometimes they randomly bombard you, and then do nothing or move slower the next time. And with the ever changing hit detection you can be feet from them and hit, facing away and hit, or be right on top and not even make contact at all.\n\nAll that said, the goal is to defeat all enemies in the fairly small dungeon and find the steps to advance. Given the aforementioned issues, what seems simple becomes a frustrating nightmare regardless how good you are at these types of games. After only a few floors (if you even make it that far) your interest will quickly wain due to the glaring faults of the title that is on sale at the time of writing this for a dollar snd nineteen cents. Sadly, it isn\u2019t even worth that, let alone the regular asking price of two dollars (both US currency) until further improvements have been made to the controls, hit detection, and enemy ai.", "recommendationid": "33988691", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529490", "timestamp_created": 1501753017, "author": {"num_reviews": 109, "num_games_owned": 3292, "playtime_forever": 35, "last_played": 1501741869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025037510"}, "votes_up": 13}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502411079, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "The video and screenshots on the store page make this game look like it has some potential!\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nThe basic idea at first is to just button mash your space bar which is fine enough for the first level or 2 but you quickly realize how bad the controls in the game actually are! Your Q special attack just randomly activates with no warning, your heal is... well it's a heal BUT the hit boxes in the game are absurd, the minions don't pursue more than 2 feet, it doesn't even matter which way you are facing half the time.\n\nI got this game cheap on a sale and still regret it. Maybe if a little more time was spent on the game to make some interesting fights and also fix up the controls and enemies, it would be a pretty decent game! unfortunately it isn't.\n\nI tried to complete it and managed to get past the first boss but the level after has a secret room or something that me and several other people couldn't figure out how to find so we were never able to pass the stage.", "recommendationid": "34157891", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522391", "timestamp_created": 1502411079, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 148, "playtime_forever": 123, "last_played": 1502410581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198068523714"}, "votes_up": 10}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
