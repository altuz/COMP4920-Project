This is exactly why I got VR.  Inventive games like this.  This is not just another shooter in VR.  This game is fast-paced, strategic, and twitchy in all the right ways.  The movement system this game has is absolutely amazing.  This game makes you feel like you are in the game.  \n\nThere's many different enemy types, including bosses, and each room or hallway has areas you want to avoid going through or that you want to move out of there hella fast. You defiinitely have to master the art of moving quickly whilst aiming on target with enemies in front and above you.  And they might even be behind you.  Game looks and plays great.\n\nOne of the most fun VR shooters I have ever played.  This is a must buy.  A real steal for only $9.99 or on sale $7.99.\n\nRating 9/10, would love to see more weapons, more levels, more enemies, just more of this game!", "recommendationid": "34940996", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490291", "timestamp_created": 1505356772, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 14, "last_played": 1505356236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 6, "total_positive": 6, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
