Right now I'm hunting down Coldbrand in the mushroom forest, which is leading me through a pretty enjoyable story. There's still plenty of the game I've yet to explore, which excites me. I should also mention that I've never really liked games like Final Fantasy, Fire Emblem or any games that I would think to be similar to this. But this game in particular has me drawn in. The soundtrack is like a never ending loop of \"Lavendar Town\" from Pokemon R/G/B. \n\nLikes:\n- The music / ambience\n- The Story and feeling like you contribute to the outcome\n- The look and feel of the game environment\n\nDislikes:\n- No sound control ( Can't lower the sound )\n- No autosave (Blame modern gaming for my save preferences)\n\nI'm really looking forward to completing this game.", "recommendationid": "30793485", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521902", "timestamp_created": 1490709417, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_forever": 625, "last_played": 1491075131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198122063247"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1491353095, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": "10", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If you can force yourself to play beyond the first 10 'misty' minutes of the game, it gets better, unexpected skill progressions, and a pretty easy to follow and kind of awesome story. alongside a lot of spelling mistakes, exhaustingly monotonous  soundtrack and needlessly sprawling environments with little to no interactivity. in the end, i found myself deliberately going 'the right way' every time, because the prospect of gaining a herb for 5 minutes of seriously tedious walking made me want to cry. fairly sure by doing so, i am not missing anything significant. has some cool side quests/stories and usb control pad functionality is always a plus, in fact the use of control pad might be the only thing that saved this game for me. Overall. worth 6 bux. get past the try hardness and is a decent game to read, however unfulfilling the gameplay is, the story is where it is at [and yes, eventually you can immerse yourself in the nonsensical graphics]. [[[it's cool that people are inspired to create these 'dark depressive fantasy' games, but the thing that makes the depressiveness and darkness significant, are the contrasting light and happiness, which is never apparent in these games. [undertale, toymaker, etc] obviously inspired by the hard hitting low mood sections of greater games, which only work because of the contrast]]] - if the intent is to make the user feel low energy and enthusiasm then keep up the good work. -", "recommendationid": "30820905", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504196", "timestamp_created": 1490819593, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_forever": 310, "last_played": 1490772585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988577149"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1490661868, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Just starting out and i like the art work alot.", "recommendationid": "30783396", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489324", "timestamp_created": 1490661868, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_forever": 65, "last_played": 1490652418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198262555779"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
