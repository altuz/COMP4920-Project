My screen resolution being 2560 x 1440 on a XB270HU. My average FPS is between 65 and 70. Hope this helps for those wondering about requirements.\n\nFor those who do have better PC's I recommend running the game's texture resolution at 4k it greatly increases the overall sharpness of the game 1920x1080 texture resolution being somewhat blurry. Also I highly recommend a controller over the keyboard can be difficult to use.

So when I saw that they brought one of the games to pc, I could'nt not support this game. I knew what AW was, but haven't taken the time to read it yet. Of all the SAO games that namco has released, this is probably the one I enjoy the most. The gameplay feels fun, the shear amount of characters offers a wide variety of playstyles. the story is better than some of the others they have released, but I ussually dont play these games for the stories. All in all I think its a solid game for any SAO fans. Don't worry if you arent an AW fan. They are basically special guests in the story, and are introduced enough to understand the story.\n\nNow on the technical side of things...\nOverall the port seems pretty solid, havent really run into any bugs. The launcher is kinda confusing when it comes to geting your graphics settings set up, but once they are it runs great. Graphics are about what you would expect on a ps4, with 60 FPS at all times (sependent on pc specs). On that note i do think it would be nice to release a demo/benchmark for the game so that people can stop asking \"can i run this?\"\n\nFINAL VERDICT/TL;DR\n===============\nOverall solid game/port.
