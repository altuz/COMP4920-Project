Thrillville Off the Rails has spectacular graphics and amzing missions with typical slang of the time used in conversations (\"What's the happs ?\"). Supurb visuals and outstanding coaster building with infinite soulutions to how you create each theme park making it very special in its category. Clever mini-games  for single and multi-player and cool cutscenes that make the best of the game. Sure its outdated as most games I play are now but they are still entertaing as when it first came out. I have played it both on console (X-Box 360) and PC and I have always prefered the sequel over the first Thrillville (PS2).\n9.7/10 :D"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501934827, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34036798", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051830890", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1501919082, "num_games_owned": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 450}, "timestamp_updated": 1501935116, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Probably the Tony Hawk: Underground of the theme park simulators, since this game has a plot (although pretty simple and somewhat disappointingly short) and it follows a single character that you can make. Thrillville: Off The Rails is a pretty casual game, so if you're looking for a realistic park sim, I'd suggest Planet Coaster, by the same developers.\n\nMy personal favorite part of the game is the minigames. There's the classics like mini-golf or pool and the throwbacks like Event Horizon (similar to Gradius) and Luftwaffe 109 (similar to 1942.) The coaster building part is pretty good, too (similar to Planet Coaster.) Thrillville's coasters have a unique part to them: Whoa! pieces. They can be anything from a ring of fire to a stunt jump. Either way, it's probably a safety violation.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the game doesn't go as into depth as Planet Coaster or RCT, and there isn't nearly as much creativity. All the parks have a set path and places you can put things, so each park can hold two coasters/race tracks, and there's three spots for things like rides, games, or stalls, each of which could hold maybe three or four. You'll probably be fine with the space, though, since the missions won't require too many of anything.\n\nRecommended if you don't have the creativity or patience for Planet Coaster or RCT, or if you want something a little different. Also recommended for the nostalgia."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501318229, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33876012", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198085805970", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1501386152, "num_games_owned": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1705}, "timestamp_updated": 1501318436, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Thrillville: Off the Rails is nice spinoff of the Roller Coaster Tycoon games. There are 4 major things I will talk about and compare to Rollercoaster Tycoon. The 4 things are the parks, building rollercoasters and other stuff, minigames, and the story. \n\nThe parks is the only thing I can say that I don't like about this game. Unlike RCT, TV (which stands for Thrillville) will not you edit paths, out of bounds scenery, move the floor up or down, or let you buy extra land. The only thing you can remove are some of the animatronics in the empty build areas, but you have to place something down that takes up their space. If you want to build a roller coaster, you have to go to a coaster area, and build on there. That means that their are a limited amount of coaster slots so if you build 6 (less or more depending on the park) then you can't make any more. The things I do like are the out of bounds stuff happening in the background. Stuff like bikers doing long jumps, a monster truck running over cars, and a stunt man jumping into a trampoline and just a few things that can happen in the park area. But yeah the parks are ok at best.\n\nBuilding roller coasters is fun in this game. Not only do you have the freedom to put whatever you want wherever you want as long as it applies to some rules, but you can also place down some special parts like a jump, an upward spin, or suddening falling slowly and randomly. Almost each coaster has it's own special ability, so one might have the jump, but a different one might have a spin. You can also not finish the coaster and people will eject from the carts and fall down with parachutes. This dose mean that the fun of death parks is lost in games like RCT however. Building stuff like stalls and mini game buildings are simple but easy. but just move it, rotated if needed, and just place it down. The minigame buildings have different models for what they represent, Like an arcade one looks like an arcade, but the trampolining looks like trampolines and not an arcade. However other stalls don't have as much differences from each other. \n\nMinigames are not present in the RCT games. The minigames are good for most of them. they have a variety of shooters, fighters, racers, and more. However some are just copy and paste like their are 3 different 3D race minigames, and they just change the vehicle and that's it. Not much else to say but most of them are good.\n\nAnd finally the story (no spoilers). Another thing lacking from RCT. The story goes that you are the new park manager of Thrillville and you need to improve the park to get to visit more parks. You also have to stop stuff like Globo Joy from making the park worse. The story is short however, you can speed run it in about 3 to 6 hours if you know what you're doing and know your tasks. However beating the story does not mean that you have completed all the tasks yet.\n\nConclusion, If you are looking for a theme park tycoon with a twist, then I say get this game, it's only $10. However if you don't like these kinds of games or think that Planet Coaster or older RCT games are going to keep you more occupied than Thrillville, then I say don't get it.\n\nThis game also is on PS2, PSP, WII, XBOX 360, PS3, and the DS."}]}
