Fantasy Bronze Age. Audiovisually rather pleasant for the release date. Fluid character classes where use of abilities dictate your proficiency at a class over time. Mostly revolves around left mouse button+activation of cooldown. Then grinding loot and using merchants. All pretty standard stuff. Nothing to recommend this over anything more modern however.\n\nOustanding Issues:\nKeys need to be rebinded. O=Character Sheet. WASD does not include left and right strate out of the box.\nGame sometimes tabs out and then back in on its own for a split second."}]}
