It doesnt have enough to do yet. I see a lot of potential as the enviroments are nice and the art style is really good. However I wish that there was more depth to the game, I think adding locomotion and expanding the environments would be a good Idea because at their current size you cant really \"explore\" like the description states. Also keep in mind however that it isn't much to spend if you're looking for a place to meditate, also the devs have been very active on the updates which is a good plus. I believe if they expand the environments, add some sort of story elements, and give the game more depth in general that it could become a pretty good game.", "recommendationid": "30824474", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925", "timestamp_created": 1490837340, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 71, "playtime_forever": 19, "last_played": 1489878177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024836460"}, "votes_up": 0}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492797710, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Looked like a fairly simple shoot stuf game.
