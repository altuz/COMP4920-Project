Answer:  get both!   They are both fun to play.  I'm not sure if I could play a real drum kit after playing this game, but it sure feels like I can.  Definitely got the beat/rhythm part down.  \n\nThe songs in this game are actually pretty cool.  I was surprised by the quality, even if I hadn't heard of the songs before.  The note map is very easy to read, so you know just what to play (unlike Drummer Talent VR).  Although, sometimes it may be hard to \"hear\" what you're supposed to play because the song actually plays other drum parts that you're not currently playing (at least on fun/easy and normal mode).  \n\nAlso, it doesn't seem to matter how hard or sotfly you hit the drums, it will always sound the same (unlike Drummer Talent VR).  Other than that, it's very reponsive and I didn't notice any missed notes due to tracking or delay.  There's only two visual environments, and neither are that good (Drummer Talent clearly has this better).  \n\nRating: 8/10, fun to play, good songs", "recommendationid": "34747249", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502950", "timestamp_created": 1504573591, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 128, "last_played": 1506552158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 23, "total_positive": 20, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
