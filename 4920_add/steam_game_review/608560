However, since I do think there was enough potential in this game for me to want to see more from this developer, I'll go ahead and say sure, give it a try if you are into Platformer/Retro inspired games.\n\nFirst, the good.\n- I enjoy the art style, has a solid retro feel to it.\n- It ran smoothly for me, no crashes or anything game breaking.\n- The level designs were decent and could of made for a quality game with a few changes.\n- Achievements are simply attained by passing each stage Boss,\n- When you die (easy mode) you respawn at your most recent checkpoint (this is a double edged sword sometimes) and any enemies you have already killed do not respawn.\n- The teleport function was neat, when it worked correctly.\n- If you play the game on Easy mode you will likely get through the game in less than 90 minutes on your first playthrough.  I like games in this genre to be shorter, so this is a good thing to me.\n\nNow, the bad.\n- Most importantly, the controls were problematic.  While the jumping and movement were fine, the shooting mechanic of the game where you hang in the air while firing (at an angle), as well as the fact you could not directional aim... did cause annoying gameplay.\n- The fact you had to kill ALL enemies in a stage in order to unlock the door to leave a level was bothersome.  While I understand we were killing enemies to collect all the presents, if you missed an enemy somewhere in a level (some areas can be easily missed) you would have to go backwards and find them.  This wouldn't be that big of an issue, however if you hit the checkpoint, for instance near the end of a stage, that means you would have to go backwards, possibly to the start, just to find an enemy you missed... And if you died, it would respawn you at the end checkpoint and you'd have to go all the way back again.\n- There is an Easy mode w/checkpoints and a Hard mode without.  Do the easy mode, unless you truly want to rage, then sure, try the hard mode, but don't say I didnt warn you.  I grew up with \"true\" hard NES games, but like many of those, the difficulty should come from the challenge of a game, not from problematic controls causing stupid deaths and frustration.\n- The End Boss fight can be very aggravating, but with a bit of luck you'll get past it and collect your final achievement.\n\nBasically, if you are like me and had some extra Steam wallet funds from selling cards, this isn't a bad game to purchase.  If you get it on-sale like I did, the cards from the game may even cover a chunk of what you paid for the game.", "recommendationid": "35169962", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505139", "timestamp_created": 1506224368, "author": {"num_reviews": 214, "num_games_owned": 2169, "playtime_forever": 153, "last_played": 1506228446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 153, "steamid": "76561198121017576"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 17, "total_positive": 15, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
