I do see pros and cons. I tend to lean to a favorable review for the game but I will mention a few negatives as well.\n\nPros:\nStraight Forward Game\nFreedom to do what you want to do\nPretty good enviorment for early access\nStone Hatchets and other tools last awhile. ( deteriation is slow)\n\nCons:\nNot enough ''food'' items. I spent an entire game looking for boars to kill to get some meat. I never did find any and I circled the entire island.\nAs of right now it's only single player but they did mention on the steam page multiplayer is a possibilty in the future. \n\nI do see great potential for the game! I think after the first patch/update is created the game is well worth 13.99!", "recommendationid": "32096664", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452471", "timestamp_created": 1496274296, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 185, "playtime_forever": 150, "last_played": 1503285504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198318811957"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496308369, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1496325863, "votes_down": 33, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 1, "developer_response": "Hello,\n\nThanks for your review! A small update will be coming out that fixes some issues and adds new content. The next major update (which includes saving and other features) has no fixed date at this point.", "review": "Hello, I am Jadiwan from Let's Play Online. \n\nI have played about 45 min of the game with several deaths. I have found the developers have a good concept for the game. Everyone needs to remember, this is an early access game and there are always bugs and content planned for a game that has not been implimented. This being said, I have a few isssues with the game, that are game stoppers for me \"even early access\"\n\n1: No save function for the game on release. (Note: Developers say this will be added in the next update}. This is an issue because playing a game for 30 minutes or so and then having to restart the game the next time makes the game no fun.\n\n2: As with all survival games, gathering resources is part of the game and expected. Having the tools to do this is a must. Having the resources needed to make the basic tools needed to gather resources is also a must and if not available in the game it becomes a game stopper. I found that the first tool you are given is a stone axe \"basic survival tool\". The stone axe has durabiliity and will weat out \" expected in a survival game\". However; to make a new stone axe, it requires stone, branches and cloth. No cloth to be found. I was able to get resources from one tree, on boulder of clay and boulder of stone. Axe is almost wore out. Wandered the map for over 20 minutes and found no source of cloth. Game over for me as I can not gather more wood, stone or clay to make any of the items in the crafting menue.\n\n3: Food and liquid intake is part of survial games. When you start the game you are provided berries for liquid intake. The amount provided lasted the 40 minutes or so of game play and I still had some left. However; while wandering the map[, I found no source of berries to resupply my liquid intake and will eventually die of thirst. Game over in maybe an hour or two.\n\nWith the above comments in concideration, If the deveopers make regular updates to the game and address the above issues in the next update I whole heartly give the game a thumbs up. This being said. if the devolpers do not fix the abouve issues, the game is not worth the money you pay for a game that will only give you about an hour or two of continuous playing and game over \"restart\".\n\nCheck out my First Look at Empires\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OYKtOCfFSw\n\nJadiwan\nLet's Play Online\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfDtnoTlSab2eoTBDHiAg7Q", "recommendationid": "32103123", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436357", "timestamp_created": 1496308369, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_forever": 151, "last_played": 1496312340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027070093"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
