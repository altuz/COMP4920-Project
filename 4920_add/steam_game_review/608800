Why did you release a PvE gamemode for what was a PVP game? It just totally split the playerbase. Plus, you're charging for it when you said you wouldn't, but I can understand, being that the years have been hard on this game and you need the funds. I don't mind that. Beyond that, Alliance is fine, but PVP is better IMO. Are playerbase is small enough as it is; and by releasing a PVE mode, it's just... split, like I said, and I need to give this a negative review to get their attention, unfortunately. That, and your marketing director left, making me think that this game is going nowhere. But to anyone consider buying Guns of Icarus, YES PLEASE DO IT just buy the base game for $5. Yeah, Alliance adds a lot of stuff that isn't really bad, but what I want is to see people back on PvP.", "recommendationid": "34874243", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485787", "timestamp_created": 1505091771, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 4429, "last_played": 1506823851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "steamid": "76561198160209913"}, "votes_up": 11}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 27, "num_reviews": 6, "total_reviews": 115, "total_positive": 88, "review_score": 6}, "success": 1}
