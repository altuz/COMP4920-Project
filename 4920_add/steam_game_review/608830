It was also cheap so I thought I'd give it a go.  In short I'd say don't waste your time.  The game runs nice and smooth but everything else about it is just kind of bland.  \n\nCrafting - one of the main features of the game is incredibly limited.  Especially when looking at other titles of this nature - even early access games.  Some resources are relatively plentiful and you'll get things like a house built pretty quick.  Not that you actually build the house yourself, you get a blueprint and plop a pre-made house down somewhere.  But other resources - especially those deriving from wildlife is a lot more difficult to come by and makes crafting some otherwise basic items pretty difficult.  \n\nSurvival - The other big aspect of the game is survival.  You have your standard resource meters - hunger, thirst, and stamina.  They all drop pretty quickly.  Stamina will refill on it's own - faster if you stand still.  Hunger and thirst rely on various items which in my playtime were relatively scarce.  So it's easy to run low or completely out and starve to death.  \n\nOverall the game, while cheap, really isn't worth it to me.  The world is dull and pretty lifeless.  The crafting and survival aspect are done much better by other games such as The Long Dark or Stranded Deep (among many others).  \n\nAll the negativity aside - I will keep an eye out on this game in hopes that the developers will flesh it out more.  If they manage to pull things together and get the game more polished I'll be sure to rereview it and leave an appropriate review.\n\nIf you're curious to see it in action: https://youtu.be/vvtn6nypVgs", "recommendationid": "31497659", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505640", "timestamp_created": 1493686359, "author": {"num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 169, "playtime_forever": 30, "last_played": 1493684149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025227359"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1493743784, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Do not buy this game!", "recommendationid": "31509608", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504009", "timestamp_created": 1493743784, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 81, "playtime_forever": 7, "last_played": 1493666565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069420035"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
