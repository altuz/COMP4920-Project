If I didn't pay so much for my vive, I would of smashed my Controllers into a wall a long time ago.  Not only did I want to get to the next Head banging puzzle so badly, just to stop me from slamming my Headset into the walls, but I wanted to get to the end, to find out what kind of reward I would be greeted with since I went through all of this Madness. There was none, None end line story finish, no what is going to happen to me, NOTHING!!!  it just ends...... I  am searching for a highlight of my day into the night, back to the day Aggro blast, the only thing I can come up with is standing in front of the hall door listening to the couple Screwing.\n\n\nFor hardcore Puzzle freaks, I can see you loving this game, It would be interesting, if that is what your into. I found the lack of some hint to be A little bit disturbing, But Disturbing has this game all over it. \n\nThis review is not a complaint even though it might sound like it, it's a review and it is as such, I played the game, Finished it, had fun where I could, got pissed most of the time, but completed it. \n\nI wish I would not of spent 20 bucks for my high blood pressure, but I didget some kicks out of the deal.\n\nI recommend this game to any puzzle fans out there who don't mind hanging aorund for hours in a room, or maybe not. Some of the rooms I got pretty quick, not to quick, but fast enough to get to the next one. Some to me, just needed , not really a hold your hand, but more in the way of a hint, to at least let you know your on the right path.\n\nThe game was very much thought out, and Mad props for that.\n\n", "recommendationid": "33354381", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505139", "timestamp_created": 1499461923, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 13, "playtime_forever": 444, "last_played": 1499557713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198387702756"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504413111, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 13, "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I purchased this game in support of the developer in making Steam Dolls of which playing the demo I loved.\n\nPhantasma VR is a very good looking adventure puzzle VR game. It was not easy for me but it does have hints (if you choose) and visuals to help you along. Don't expect to whip through this fast if you are not much of a puzzle person. Irregarless of the puzzle aspect it is a very well done interesting game. It is a bit twisted as you would expect by the conspiracy tag and from the imagery and the text on the various scribblings you read. The bunny is cute but seems out of place which makes him a bit creepy being there. Some may not think the price is quite right for this kind of game but it is for support of the highly anticipated Steam Dolls. And the quality and thought put into the game is worth the price in my opinion. Games that suck you into your VR experience are the ones that I deem did the job right. This one to me did that with the art style, atmosphere, thinking, interaction, and the bunny. My number rating would be a 7/10. If I was a fanatic of puzzle games it would be a 10/10. \n\nPartial game play here no edit. Enjoy.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/59kztdaMo2Q\n\nI am not sure why the downvotes but if you want to know my specs than here they are. There is nothing wrong with the game. \n\nGTX 1070\nIntel Core i7-7700k\n16 Gigs Ram\nHTC VIVE", "recommendationid": "34617929", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476413", "timestamp_created": 1504125825, "author": {"num_reviews": 221, "num_games_owned": 477, "playtime_forever": 91, "last_played": 1504124974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197974765747"}, "votes_up": 7}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 9, "total_positive": 9, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
