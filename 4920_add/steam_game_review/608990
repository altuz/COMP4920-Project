They will welcome you with open arms and wide smiles! The developers make what people want (unless it's stupid) and are very nice!\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n8.6/10\n\nAs of right now, the controls are functional but could use some minor tweaking. New abilities are also coming out all the time, keeping the game fun with new stuff.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n10/10\n\nI have a pretty bad computer but I've seen other people have the settings on cinematic. It's a truly beautiful game, along with the unique and cartoony look of the game. Defenitely a game that's easy on the eyes.\n\n[h1]Updates[/h1]\n9.7/10\n\nThe creator of this game pumps out updates right after they're done. Some are huge with new dinosaurs and maps and some are small bug fixes. However the game is not abandoned and is worked on all the time!\n\n[h1]Dinosaurs[/h1]\n9.3/10\n\nThe game goes for scientifically accurate. There is a wide and I mean [i]wide[/i] variety of dinosaurs to choose and play as. Some are born fighters and some are swimmers, choose the one that suits your play style!\n\n\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n9/10\n\nA fun, relaxing dinosaur simulator that shows the potential to be something great. I would recommend this to anybody looking for a unique game that is constantly being filled with new things. Sometimes people aren't on a lot but there isn't too many.", "recommendationid": "34766278", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "timestamp_created": 1504653806, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_forever": 5616, "last_played": 1507070876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 496, "steamid": "76561198200706027"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 95, "total_positive": 61, "review_score": 5}, "success": 1}
