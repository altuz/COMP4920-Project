Honestly, what they're trying to do here is a bit difficult to make fun without the physicality of hitting something. More power to them for trying, but I definitely threw money away on this thing. I would ask for a refund if I was a D-bag, but I won't -- I 'd rather them use their funds to grow as a company and provide other experiences in the future. Perhaps they will grow as well, but at the very least they will provide more interesting concepts. \n\nWhat I will do, though, is contact steam and see if they can remove the game from my library -- once again, without requesting a refund. I'm just picky about what I have in my library. Best of luck to you, Mr. Game creators. May you learn from your experience and make your next endeavor much better. \n\n\n", "recommendationid": "34061503", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490474", "timestamp_created": 1502030218, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 219, "playtime_forever": 32, "last_played": 1498962475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035359441"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 12, "total_positive": 9, "review_score": 6}, "success": 1}
