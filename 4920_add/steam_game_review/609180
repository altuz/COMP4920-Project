Just walk around an abandoned hotel that is somewhat similar to another game. Experience cheap jumscares worth .10 cents. I mean you can trigger some jumpscares again by walking back and into the jumpscare again lol. I wish I could get my money back but unfortunately I've been optimistic about this game trying to find a way to enjoy it as all my other games.", "recommendationid": "33957611", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519682", "timestamp_created": 1501621386, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 201, "playtime_forever": 183, "last_played": 1503214248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198165808253"}, "votes_up": 13}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
