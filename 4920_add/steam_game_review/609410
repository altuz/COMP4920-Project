Characters are generated with randomized skillsets that you unlock with experience. Each character gets four active combat skills ( randomized ) and then a larger list of passive skills ( also randomized ).  The passive skills provide benefits like more health, increased accuracy, critical chance, etc.  \n\nTravel is by longboat which you can upgrade to improve character stats and also other game mechanics like food consumption and inventory size. \n\n\nThe system is surprisingly intuitive and the different character classes work well together. The randomized skills lead you to inventive tactical parings.  \n\nBattlefields vary as does team placement and allowed team size. Before the battle starts, you get to choose which members from your longboat to bring and where to place them.  This adds another layer of strategy to the experience as you can see your opponents and their placement.\n\nCharacter death is permanent, but the loss of a party member is not a catastrophic blow to proceeding along the quest line.  You can recruit new heroes at your main camp after each mission.\n\nGame difficulty is up to the player.  Not only is there a difficulty setting in the options menu, but you can choose to tackle missions with a smaller size party than recommended, or use party members of a lower level. You can grind random missions for experience, or not.\n\nThe overall effect is a feeling of freedom to play the game as you want to play it without the constraints of an Orwellian master plan you will be punished for not following. \n\n\nI'm really enjoying the experience and looking forward to the full game release.  If you're searching for an engaging tactical game in a Viking setting, give Iron Tides a try.", "recommendationid": "34953907", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1505412046, "author": {"num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 237, "playtime_forever": 2433, "last_played": 1506082001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "steamid": "76561198024080920"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 18, "total_positive": 18, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
