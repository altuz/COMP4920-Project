Especially when I saw it's 200k words.\nWell, it took me just under 2 hours, which is less than it took me on 110k stories.\nAfter the first 3 or 4 chapters (how surprising - the free demo, which convinces people to pay for the rest, is the only good part!) it becomes boring politics, no one dies (worse - I don't get to kill anyone), for those who care about romantic themes - there are a few choices, but they're very understated and unrelated to the story, not to mention that they just pop up occasionally out of nowhere.\nThe end was boring - I decided to be nice, tried to avoid civil war - and got a bad emperor as a result. So I was vicious next time - and of course, I earned a war.\nFor my brethren among comedy lovers, I'm most displeased to say - no. Not one funny bit, except MAYBE the first line you get to decide what to say - and calling that line a joke is streching it. Very, VERY far.\nNOw, for parents - this is probably the ideal thing to buy your kid, from your point of view. Beacuse it's boring, not violent, no sex (there might have been oppurtunity once, but I picked prudence and patience, so I don't know where it leads), very political, polite, and it's even loosely based on history.\nWell, I was actually going to recommend this one, but now I read al I've written and I realize I actually have nothing good to say.\nSo..... don't?", "recommendationid": "33247424", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503771", "timestamp_created": 1499200556, "author": {"num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_forever": 111, "last_played": 1499090800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198168647573"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498069683, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "To short.
