Takes the same tower defense mechanics that you know and love and crosses it with a kind of RTS resource management side where you need to decide what tasks to assign your bees to at any given time. Do you need them manning the towers? Or collecting the various resources scattered throughout each level?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf you like your tower defense games this one is worth picking up for its current price of under a fiver.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[h1] Extra info:\u00a0[/h1]\n\u00a0\nBeefense has a cute\u00a0story for the campaign, it's not going to win any Oscars but is\u00a0a nice detail that is often overlooked in the tower defense genre. Thought has gone into the level design. The game eases you in gently but you will have to use some strategy to beat the later levels.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nManaging your bees adds an interesting twist but it can be easy to lose track of how many bees you have assigned to each task. It would be good to have a panel showing how many bees were assigned to each task.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere is a persistent upgrade system which gets you thinking which upgrade to buy for maximum effect. But Beefense's free to play origins can make earning these upgrades a bit grindy. It would also be good to get some Steam achievements added.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMrs Biscuit loves her tower defense games and gives Beefense 9/10. Better than Go Home Dinosaurs but it's no Desktop Tower Defense. Worth a look.\u00a0", "recommendationid": "31124823", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517504", "timestamp_created": 1492121287, "author": {"num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 234, "playtime_forever": 1658, "last_played": 1504378878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027644044"}, "votes_up": 11}, {"timestamp_updated": 1493628606, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Great tower defense game, but unlike other tower defense games you gather resources at the same time.\n\n8.5/10.", "recommendationid": "31481896", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503079", "timestamp_created": 1493628606, "author": {"num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 149, "playtime_forever": 121, "last_played": 1494856077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198246779586"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492822226, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Tower defense, with some RTS.  \n\nSo far I am only 7 episodes in.  Each episode (map) has been fairly short (less than 10 rounds).  \n\nThe RTS adds some interesting elements.  However, I prefer my TD to be a leisurely contemplation of strategy while I do other things such as watch TV.  In this game, the RTS element requires more active attention, such as making sure that while the bees are flying back and forth harvesting, they don't run into the MOBs (which results in the bees becoming imprisoned).\n\n", "recommendationid": "31286224", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501327", "timestamp_created": 1492822226, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 354, "playtime_forever": 212, "last_played": 1493171096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198029021012"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
