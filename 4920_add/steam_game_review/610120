The social theme seemed a little off putting, but I was totally wrong. The artwork and pricing convinced me to buy and play it and I'm happy I did! This Point and click adventure creates a nice atmosphere with beautiful artwork and music. The story is decent but especially the original puzzles made this a very nice gaming experience.
