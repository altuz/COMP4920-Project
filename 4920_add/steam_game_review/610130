[i]Back[/i] is translated to [i]Atr\u00e1s[/i] in Portuguese, something that Google Translator tells you wrongly because the right translation would be [i]Retroceder[/i], something that doesn't exist in this \"sweet tool\". This was enough to tell me that other languages had a few wrong translations too and was soon confirmed after booting the game a few times. The game barely has any text so it's terrible to fail in something like this.\nI know that I'm being picky with this but damn, if you want to do it, do it right. You want sales and I'm not against them but it doesn't hurt to ask for help even if it comes from the community or get someone who truly understands the language.\n- [b]Epilepsy warning where are you??[/b]\nHoly crap, I love games like this but the bing bang zoopdaloop updtydupty explosions everywhere may hurt some people. A warn or two wouldn't hurt.\n- [b]Stairs[/b]\nWhy is this even a feature? They lead to half-empty rooms, it's pointless to even exist. Super Mario is not amused.\n- [b]Squares[/b]\nOnce in a while you will see squares with random icones. They aren't bad if it wasn't that some of them are hard to understand if we can touch them or not because the way some are designed let you think for a while if they will kill you or not.\n- [b]Lack of information[/b]\nWhy can't I kill a giant spider in the middle of my screen??? I've a kamehameha-bazooka! I want to kill her!\n- [b]LOADINGS[/b]\nIs there a way to disable it while playing? This wouldn't be terrible if there was any change, like a small colour variation. but it's always the same yellow annoying screen with the name of the game at the center................\n- [b]Broken Thoughts[/b]\nDunno why but I've to always click on my mouse when the main menu appears after skipping the intro. This made me think that the game was broken the first time I started it until I tried everything. This also made me look dumb looking for the mouse cursor in the middle of the mess at the right of the menus because I couldn't do nothing in it with the keyboard. Yeah, I only try my gamepad after testing it first with keyboard+mouse.\n- [b]Anti-Fun[/b]\nGame makes you hate it. Not fun when you love the genre :(\n- [b]Music[/b]\nI actually liked the type of music used, and sometimes I would love to play more games with stuff like this, but it feels overused after a while to the point of being annoying. Small tracks feel bad.\n\n[b]Good stuff, the other stuff, the Side without cookies[/b]\n- Looks better when played in a damn small window.\n- Snoop Dog would approve it", "recommendationid": "34944814", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503197", "timestamp_created": 1505379266, "author": {"num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 159, "playtime_forever": 10, "last_played": 1505377957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198274704236"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505035345, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I'm quite sorry for this review, because at first I wanted to like the game very hard (I loved TBOI, The Gungeon and liked Nuclear Throne too) and then I wanted at least to recommend it to support developers because I saw some heart in it. Then I wanted to recommend it not for more than 1,50$. Now I have to NOT recommend it. \nI can't refund (I played 2 hours to give this game the chance of surpirising me). I want you to save your money.\nI spent 3,99\u20ac and I feel robbed.\n\nThis game is unbelievably average on almost every aspect. On the remaining aspects, it's bad.\n\nAverage things:\n\n- Music in very average. Not very good or catchy, not too bad.\n- Presentation. The idea/presentation of the game is cute, but nothing very original or whatsoever.\n- Graphic is \"Meh, fine\". I've honestly seen much more minimalistic graphics that stood out way more. \n- The game is pretty short.\n\nBad things:\n\n- The randomization is ridicolous.\n- The gameplay is incredibly ripetitive, bland and boring.\n- There are pits with ladders. You can go in them and open a chest to find a buddy. Chests are on normal levels too. It really feels useless, I've stopped going in them after 5 minutes of gameplay.\n- Few buddies. With a graphic like this, one of the strong points generally is a looot of stuff and items.\n- Very Few enemies. Come on, make an effort. The graphic is supersimple, and the AIs too. ADD SOME CONTENT PLS\n- AIs are idiotic. 90% of enemies follow you IF they see your in a straight line. MEH. The others shoot at you moving slowly/not moving... if they see you in a straight line. There's not a single interesting enemy in all the game.\n- Mini bosses are *yawn*. Just to give you an idea.\n- Bosses omgasdhanksdj. Seriously, with the main character, the boss is a tree that will never EVER hit you in its life but has a lot of life. The most boring three minutes of my life: walking in a circle with the left mouse button pressed.\n- When you beat a boss. Jeebus that's the thing that REALLY made me decide to write this negative review. Ok, I beat this tree-boss of boredom, and now I've ended the story with the main character. It's dead. Ok. I walk to the portal wondering what kind of silly/epic video/reward I'll get for my efforts of not falling asleep on the keyboard. I touch the portal. The main menu appears. [Insert bad, bad swearing here]. COME. ON. GUYS! That's NOT how you treat your players! Are you insane? Even the absolutely-no-fkn-SENSE videos in The Binding Of Isaac when you beat a boss are fine, you CAN'T take a player that just made an effort to end your game and kick him in the ass like \"Ok, the end. Go home now\". Come-ON!\n- And the last point is a bad bug (even if I'm pretty sure it's just matter of negligence). You play on this pixelart maps. They do have, obviously, borders. There are natural, randomized obstacles like trees and bushes, and also dangerous ones like lava pools. It often happens that one of this obstacles is near the top/bottom border of the map, and they are always at the same distance from it, that is the exact distance to let a player pass between the border and the obstacle. NOPE. Sometimes you can pass. Sometimes you can't! And the best thing is when the obstacle is something like the lava pool and you'll never know if you'll take damage or not! Amazing guys, really!\n- Oh I almost forgot. Sometimes monsters drop consumables. They're literally like three-four. Again, too few.\n- And one of these is the mysterious present. 50% heals you, 50% hurts you. The stupidest thing ever, seriously. Who the hell is taking that. \n\nSo, the conclusion.\nI see some heart in it, but mostly looks like they rushed to make the game the sooner possible. Bad idea guys, you should have worried more about its quality. There are some very annoying things. The others are plain bland. Very boring and repetitive, totally emotionless. I can't refund, and I have great respect for people who's doing shitty jobs to earn their money, so I'm writing this review to save at least YOUR money. This game is OK for 1,50$ IF they fix the collision problem and they put a freaking something after you beat the bosses. \nIf they decide to update the game adding buch of stuffs and improvements, it'll easily be worth more. But it won't happen.\n\nDo not buy guys. I feel sorry for the developers but that's the truth.
