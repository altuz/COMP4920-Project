In short, this game is a dumbed down version, the gameplay is more shallow than the same games in this series like Warriors Orochi series. Here is the breakdown of my review.\n\nGraphic, music and sound:\nOverall, graphic is nice, nothing ground breaking but character's design are clearer and more detailed. In terms of music, this game has some good tracks, but nothing worth remembering. And sound, yeah, not much is happening in this department.\n\nStory:\nThis is one of the things that makes Warriors All-Stars is just a quick cash grab, story is bad, after finishing the game for the 1st time, I didnt bother with it on my next playthrough. The character rooster is sadly very few, event DW8XL has more characters than this game. Though the character rooster isnt much, it has some awesome characters like Nobunyaan Oda, Williams from NiOh, Sophie from Atelier series, etc.\n\nGameplay:\nThis is the main problem why I said Warriors All-Stars is dumbed down, first there is no weapons, instead of weapons, we get cards, which acts like weapons, you can get cards by defeating enemies, finishing missions, finishing character's quest. Cards can be enhanced or combined to raise certain attributes, also can be sold or destroyed to get materials. Materials are needed to add your choice of attributes (enhanced cards). In battle, you can bring 4 other characters with you, you can use their skills in battle or summon all of them to battle (they will stand side by side with your characters in battle, sort of a human chains). They took some mechanics from Warriors Orochi. There is also rush battle, you can activate it if you have a star by pressing R3/RS, you can get rush star every 1000 kills you make. \n\nAvailables missions can be selected in World Map, including story and final missions. Also, everytime you finish certain missions, the map will be highlighted wider and wider. This game has multiple endings with 3 main story branch depending which sides you choose when selecting your first character everytime you start a new game. \n\nConclusion: \nTL;DR Warriors All Star isnt a bad game, but its not for everyone, too simplified, and not much content, especially for 60 bucks. If you are new to this kind of games and want to try, go ahead. But if you like DW or SW series to death, you might want to wait for sale, this game isnt as good as the main DW series. If you are a KT die hard fan, well, what are you waiting for? In short, \"Wait for a sale\"\n\nEDIT: Fixed some typos", "recommendationid": "34769843", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537445", "timestamp_created": 1504675203, "author": {"num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 638, "playtime_forever": 1419, "last_played": 1506477139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 462, "steamid": "76561198190583586"}, "votes_up": 18}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506290891, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 6, "review": "\u6211\u7ba1\u4f60\u4eec\u8fd9\u4e9b\u74dc\u76ae\u4ece\u54ea\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u6765\u7684 \u6211\u5415\u5e03\u5c31\u662f\u8981\u628a\u4f60\u4eec\u5934\u5168\u90e8\u9524\u70c2\nIt's no matter  where you guys are from.Me, LU Bu, gonna kick you ass. ;)", "recommendationid": "34863458", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521498", "timestamp_created": 1505054180, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_forever": 728, "last_played": 1507156805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 171, "steamid": "76561198116581672"}, "votes_up": 15}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504873017, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A Koei Tecmo crossover game just makes sense to be a Musou title.

Koei Tecmo delivers.\n\n\nThe game isnt flawless, but it is wonderful still. There are framedrops on maps with potential fire (even with my gtx 1070), the lack of free mode is annoying and archery bases make you pull your hair out sometimes, but the game feels fresh. The interactions between characters are endless and seems so real, the amount of different reactions and dialogue outside of fighting is insane, and dont get me started on the 15 different endings. Mind you, I have only gotten one (have had a chance for 2), but since that was the one and only way I wanted the game to end I probably won't be grinding for other endings before I have all characters maxed out lol.\n\n\nTLDR: The game is a fresh addition to the warriors series and brings you a new, lighter(/darker) view of the genre. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys any warriors-style games, and to everyone who doesn't, still give it a shot.
