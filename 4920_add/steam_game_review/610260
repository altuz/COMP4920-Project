Also, the price is a bit steep for what's really being offered. So what is being offered? \n\nFour rides (lasted me a total of 14 minutes to experience all of them) of varying fun factors and lengths, each with low resolution/low textures, each with no interactions, and each have the same ride feeling. I guess that's what's missing most from the game, you don't ever really feel like you are in a rollercoaster. In fact, I never felt the butterflies in my stomach or the euphoria you would feel if you actually rode in a rollercoaster. The rails as you are whizzing by also don't look very good (they blur or they look very slow .. depending on where you look).\n\nThe scenery and rides from best to worst (IMO) were 1) Mega Kinda Ka - nice outside park with rocks that bring a nice surprise 2) LIberty - the statue of liberty needs to look better though 3) City 4) Euthanasia - starts out looking very good, then a big disappointment, poor graphics really bring immersion down here.  \n\nHowever, every single VR scene and ride were better in Russian VR coasters.  This dev obviously hates America.  I'm joking ... or maybe not.\n\nRating 4/10 should be a .99 cent game then I could tepidly recommend and overlook its flaws", "recommendationid": "35075557", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1505871857, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 13, "last_played": 1505871307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
