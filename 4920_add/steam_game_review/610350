At least on easy difficulty (Edit: and medium difficulty), the game goes no further than you'll see at the beach (albeit in lingerie rather than bikini) and the developers comments I've seen elsewhere suggest there is no more at greater difficulty levels.\n\nThe game is stable and has no glaring issues but the interface needs work.  I'd like to see a means of easily determining the amount your opponent has raised by without doing a little mental arithmatic and an announcement by the opponent, or a status update when your opponent raises would be useful.  Moving the cards further into the players field of view would also be useful as you need to crane you neck just a little to see the cards and to select which to discard.  Speaking of which, so far as I can tell, the game does not announce how many cards your opponent has discarded, this is important information in poker so it should be clearly announced in some manner.\n\nWhen it's the players turn to act first, the game lets you raise or fold and your opponent will do the same.  I'd prefer to be able to check as well and let the opponent set the pace.\n\nThe girls are very pretty and the price is easy on the pocket.  All in all, I had fun so this just barely rates a reccomendation.", "recommendationid": "35100877", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "timestamp_created": 1505986759, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 132, "playtime_forever": 169, "last_played": 1507054959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 117, "steamid": "76561197978851675"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 7, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
