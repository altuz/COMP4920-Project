Plus there\u2019s the whole \u201csituation\u201d that Kazuma and Yukari are going through. The story certainly isn\u2019t a masterpiece, but if you\u2019re in the mood of reading something silly and cute, [i]PacaPlus[/i] can be a good choice.\n\nThe art style is very cute together with the BGM, and the VA was good [spoiler](I especially liked YukaPaca\u2019s voice lol)[/spoiler]. There\u2019s also just a few choices you have to pick in order to get the 3 different endings. I also didn\u2019t expected at all to read an actual explanation of what happened to Yukari. But well, I didn\u2019t expected to see an Alpaca wearing gym clothes or a dress either.\n\n7/10. I read that there\u2019s a prequel and a sequel to this game, I hope they\u2019ll get an English translation as well!", "recommendationid": "35163301", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570848", "timestamp_created": 1506198783, "author": {"num_reviews": 385, "num_games_owned": 791, "playtime_forever": 168, "last_played": 1506193193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 168, "steamid": "76561198120348301"}, "votes_up": 35}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
