I had fun learning to dogde enemy fighters and turret fire.  Also i liked the necessity for ship management. You have to react quick and strategic to do the missions with low losses.\nThe game runs stable and had no mayor bugs or crashes during my about 10h playtime. But i wouldn't describe it as a finished release. It is just not polished enough. \nSo if you want to support the dev team and are willing to play a not AAA game it is for you. Hopefully the devs can afford to expand it further.\n\nthis is also feedback for the devs (Sept17)\n- it still feels a bit like early access.   +Devs promised to patch and expand the content\n- 10 'campaign' missions only loosly sewn together; just intro text no cutscenes\n- priority mission targets are not highlighted - just anounced with voice\n- just some missions have a cascade of events\n- no statistics screen to rate your performance\n- difficulty setting seems just to adjust hitpoints of the enemies\n- once you learned where the shield generators on the (about 6) different capital ships are, they are pretty easy to outgun even with one fighter\n\n+ Devs promised to patch and expand the content\n+ 6 Degree of Freedom flight control\n+ Shield/engine/weapon-management necessary\n+ tutorial teaches the basics\n+ nice graphics and backgrounds\n+ totally different gameplay compared to House of the dying Sun or Everspace\n+ i played with keyboard and mouse\n+ 3pal coop possible (not tried)", "recommendationid": "35232784", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1506472589, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 70, "playtime_forever": 290, "last_played": 1506582099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 256, "steamid": "76561197978404870"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 14, "total_positive": 10, "review_score": 6}, "success": 1}
