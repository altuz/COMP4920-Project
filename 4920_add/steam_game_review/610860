Ive beaten shogo so many times its not even funny. I know where every enemy is and every power up.....But i can not recommend spending your money on this unless you have an older machine that can run it or you want to download some programs that will help you run it. \n\nThis is not optimized at all for Windows 10 at least. And i will say that no where on the store page does it say that it will run on your machine so i will give them that. The game is amazing and im proud to see it on steam....but until its been fixed to run on modern PCs then i would avoid this one for now.", "recommendationid": "34783686", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500453", "timestamp_created": 1504733985, "author": {"num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 503, "playtime_forever": 5, "last_played": 1504541919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972324850"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 6, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
