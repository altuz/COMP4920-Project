The combo system is much deeper once you dive into the game a little bit and the controls are pretty spot on. I played with the keyboard and it worked fine, but I would have loved to play with a controller.\n\nAll in all I liked the game and it was only 8.99.  It was a fun dungeon tower, roguelike, beat em up, anime style brawler. If that sounds at all interesting to you, I suggest you buy it!", "recommendationid": "34766304", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494833", "timestamp_created": 1504653954, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 405, "playtime_forever": 42, "last_played": 1504640000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197979490972"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 10, "total_positive": 10, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
