I've gotten to the boss on the third level, haven't completed it yet.  \n\nI only have a few issues with it, when I come close to a wall with mushrooms on it, a lot of time, the whole world jumps around on me, like it is trying to keep me away from the border.  When I look around close to one of the walls, the world seems distorted to me, like the perspective is not being rendered correctly.  I'm using a 980, so it's above the min spec, and I didn't notice any of this stuff with Vanishing Realms.  The second boss, I hit him with two arrows, and he died, the balance could use some more work.  There need to be a larger variety of enemies on level 3, it's just orks, no wolves or anything else until you get to the boss.  The puzzle parts are great, the trap on level 2 was awesome, more puzzles would work well.  Couldn't figure out how to open the chests at the end of level 1 & 2.  Also, can't figure out what the magic stats are for in the notebook, can't seem to upgrade anything.\n\nCreature design is top notch, combat system is fun and challenging, even on easy.  Music and sound design sounded great, VO was well recorded and engaging.  Can't wait for improvements and more content!", "recommendationid": "35039693", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1505714114, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_forever": 112, "last_played": 1505710118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198298464033"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505135386, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Absolutely love the atmospherics and the AI and combat are great.  Probably overpriced, but still worth the buy.  Played till the 3rd Boss on easy.  When you kill the Boss, he recharges 100% health from a crystal in the ceiling that was not effected by crossbow arrows, so it becomes a cycle of kill and recharge.
