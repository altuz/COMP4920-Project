The game is multiplayer only, requiring a minimum of two people but four are recommended for maximum fun. The game begins outside the abandoned house where you can choose which equipment to take, with a laptop and video cameras you can place around allowing you to see what's going on being the most interesting. You are then taken inside, and without wanting to give too much away must find the different pages of a book scattered around while avoiding the dangers within. \n\nIt's a simple premise, but with some friends willing to have a laugh it is great fun. \n\nIf you'd like to see some gameplay, you can check out our video here:  https://youtu.be/30kUQSXb8lk", "recommendationid": "31860306", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507098", "timestamp_created": 1495285683, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 121, "playtime_forever": 45, "last_played": 1492261920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198055368433"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1491828643, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Waited a hour to finally get in to a game ...  good idea but sucks!", "recommendationid": "31059302", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498593", "timestamp_created": 1491828643, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_forever": 18, "last_played": 1491815678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198179240786"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1491838302, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 7, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I'm sorry for such a short review, but i didnt experience much because of the bugs and crashes.\nBut when you finally get into a game, you have no idea where to go or what to do.", "recommendationid": "31061912", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495533", "timestamp_created": 1491838302, "author": {"num_reviews": 98, "num_games_owned": 199, "playtime_forever": 13, "last_played": 1491649972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972664624"}, "votes_up": 6}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "total_reviews": 6, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
